This commonwealth afterwards took a strong part with Pyrrhus; and when he left Sicily to the mercy of her enemies, threw itself into the arms of Carthage. During the first Punic war Agrigentum was the headquarters of the Carthaginians, and was besieged by the Roman consuls, who after eight months blockade took it by storm. It nevertheless changed matters several times during the contest between these rival states, and in every instance suffered most cruel outrages. After this period very little mention of it occurs in history, nor do we know the precise time of the destruction of the old city and the building of the new one. See Girgenti.\n\nThe principal part of the ancient city lay in the vale; the present town, called Girgenti, occupies the mountain on which the citadel of Cocalus stood.\n\nIt was difficult to be more judicious and fortunate in the choice of situation for a large city. The inhabitants were here provided with every requisite for defence, pleasure, and comfort of life; a natural wall, formed by abrupt rocks, presented a strong barrier against assailants; pleasant hills sheltered them on three sides without impeding the circulation of air; before them a broad plain, watered by the Acragas, gave admittance to the sea breeze, and to a noble prospect of that awful element; the port or emporium lay in view at the mouth of the river, and probably the road across the flat was lined with gay and populous suburbs.\n\nThe hospitality and parade for which the Agrigentines are celebrated in history were supported by an extensive commerce; by means of which, the commonwealth was able to refit many shocks of adversity, and always to rise again with fresh splendour. It was, however, crushed by the general fall of Grecian liberty; the feeble remnants of its population, which had survived so many calamities, were at length driven out of its walls by the Saracens, and obliged to lock themselves up for safety among the bleak and inaccessible rocks of the present city.\n\nAt the north-east angle of the ancient limits, upon some foundations of large regular stones, a church has been erected; a road appears hewn in the solid rock for the convenience of the votaries who visited this temple in ancient days. It was then dedicated to Ceres and her daughter Proserpine, the peculiar patronesses of Sicily.\n\nAt the south-east corner, where the ground, rising gradually, ends in a bold eminence, which is crowned with majestic columns, are the ruins of a temple said to have been consecrated to Juno. To the west of this stands the building commonly called the Temple of Concord; the stone of which, and the other buildings, is the same as that of the neighbouring mountains and cliffs, a conglomeration of sea sand and shells, full of perforations, of a hard and durable texture, and a deep reddish brown colour. This Doric temple has all its columns, entablature, pediments, and walls entire; only part of the roof is wanting. It owes its preservation to the piety of some Christians, who have covered half the nave, and converted it into a church consecrated under the invocation of St Gregory bishop of Girgenti.\n\nProceeding in the same direction, you walk between rows of sepulchres cut in the rock wherever it admitted of being excavated by the hand of man, or was so already by that of nature. Some mazes of it are hewn into the shape of coffins; others drilled full of small square holes employed in a different mode of interment, and serving as receptacles of urns. One ponderous piece of the rock lies in an extraordinary position; by the failure of its foundation, or the shock of an earthquake, it has been loosened from the general quarry, and rolled down the declivity, where it now remains supine with the cavities turned upwards. Only a single column marks the confused heap of moss-grown ruins belonging to the temple of Hercules. It stood on a projecting rock above a chasm in the ridge, which was cut through for a passage to the emporium.\n\nIn the same tract, over some hills, is situated the building usually called the Tomb of Thero. It is surrounded by aged olive trees, which cast a wild irregular shade over the ruin. The edifice inclines to the pyramidal shape, and consists at present of a triple plinth, and a base supporting a square pedestal; upon this plain solid foundation is raised a second order, having a window in each front, and at each angle two Ionic pilasters crowned with an entablature of the Doric order. Its inside is divided into a vault, a ground room, and one in the Ionic story, communicating with each other by means of a small internal staircase.\n\nIn the plain are seen the fragments of the temple of Eucleapius; part of two columns and two pilasters, with an intermediate wall, support the end of a farmhouse, and were probably the front of the cella. Pursuing the track of the walls towards the west, you arrive at a spot which is covered with the gigantic remains of the temple of the Olympian Jupiter, minutely described by Diodorus Siculus. It may literally be said that it has not one stone left upon another; and it is barely possible, with the help of much conjecture, to discover the traces of its plan and dimensions. Diodorus calls it the largest temple in the whole island; but adds, that the calamities of war caused the work to be abandoned before the roof could be put on; and that the Agrigentines were ever after reduced to such a state of poverty and dependence, that they never had it in their power to finish this superb monument of the taste and opulence of their ancestors. The length of this temple was 370 Greek feet, its breadth 60, and its height 220, exclusive of the foundations or basement story; the extent and solidity of its vaults and underworks were wonderful; its spacious porticoes and exquisite sculpture were suited to the grandeur of the whole. It was not built in the usual style of Sicilian temples with a cella of massive walls and a peristyle, but was designed in a mixed style with half columns let into the walls on the outside, the inside exhibiting a plain surface.\n\nThe next ruin belongs to the temple of Castor and Pollux; vegetation has covered the lower parts of the building, and only a few fragments of columns appear between the vines. This was the point of the hill where the wall stood on the brink of a large fish-pond spoken of by Diodorus: it was cut in the solid rock.\nAgrimony 30 feet deep, and water was conveyed to it from the hills. In it was bred a great quantity of fish for the use of public entertainments; swans and various other kinds of wild fowl swam along its surface, for the amusement of the citizens, and the great depth of water prevented an enemy from surprising the town on that side. It is now dry and used as a garden. On the opposite bank, are two tapering columns without their capitals, most happily placed in a tuft of carob trees. Monte Toro, where Hannibal encamped with the Carthaginian army, before the Roman consuls drew him into an engagement that ruined his defensive plan, is a noble back-ground to this picturesque group of objects.\n\nThe whole space comprehended within the walls of the ancient city abounds with traces of antiquity, foundations, brick-arches, and little channels for the conveyance of water; but in no part are any ruins that can be presumed to have belonged to places of public entertainment. This is the more extraordinary, as the Agrigentines were a sensual people, fond of shows and dramatic performances, and the Romans never dwelt in any place long without introducing their savage games. Theatres and amphitheatres seem better calculated than most buildings to resist the outrages of time; and it is surprising that not even the vestiges of their form should remain on the ground.","sp":142,"ep":160},{"h":"AGRIGAN","t":"or island of St Francis Xavier, in Geography, one of the Ladrones or Marian islands.

See GIRGENTI.\n\nAccording to ancient authors, Dedalus, the most famous mechanician of fabulous antiquity, fled to this spot for protection against Minos, and built many wonderful edifices for Cocalus king of the island. Long after his flight, the people of Gela sent a colony hither 600 years before the birth of Christ; and from the name of a neighbouring stream called the new city Agragatis, whence the Romans formed their word Agrigentum. These Greeks converted the ancient abode of the Siculi into a citadel to guard the magnificent city which they erected on the hillocks below.\n\nAn advantageous situation, a free government with all its happy effects, and an active commercial spirit, exalted their commonwealth to a degree of riches and power unknown to the other Greek settlements, Syracuse alone excepted. But the prosperity of Agrigentum appears to have been but of short duration, and tyranny soon destroyed its liberties.\n\nPhalaris was the first who reduced it to slavery. His name is familiar to most readers on account of his cruelty, and the brazen bull in which he tortured his enemies. (See PHALARIS.)\u2014Phalaris met with the common fate of tyrants, and after his death the Agrigentines enjoyed their liberty for 150 years; at the expiration of which term Thero usurped the sovereign authority. The moderation, justice, and valour of this prince preserved him from opposition while living, and have rescued his memory from the obloquy of posterity. He joined his son-in-law Gelo, king of Syracuse, in a war against the Carthaginians; in the course of which victory attended all his steps, and Sicily saw Agrigentum herself for a time delivered from her African oppressors. Soon after his decease, his son Thrasydeus was deprived of the diadem, and Agrigentum restored to her old democratical government. Ducetus next disturbed the general tranquillity. He was a chief of the mountaineers, descendants of the Siculi; and was an overmatch for the Agrigentines while they were unsupported by alliances, but sank under the weight of their union with the Syracusans. Some trifling alterations dissolved this union, and produced a war, in which the Agrigentines were worsted, and compelled to submit to humiliating terms of peace. Resentment led them to embrace with joy the proposals of the Athenians, then meditating an attack upon Syracuse. Their new friends soon made them feel that the sacrifice of liberty and fortune would be the price of their protection; and this consideration brought them speedily back to their old connexions. But as if it had been decreed that all friendship should be fatal to their repose, the reconciliation and its effects drew upon them the anger of the Carthaginians. By this enemy their armies were routed, their city taken, their race almost extirpated, and scarce a vestige of magnificence was left. Agrigentum lay 50 years buried under its own ruins; when Timoleon, after triumphing over the Carthaginians, and restoring liberty to Sicily, collected the descendants of the Agrigentines, and sent them to re-establish the dwellings of their forefathers. Their exertions were rewarded with astonishing success; for Agrigentum rose from its ashes with such a renewal of vigour, that in a very short time we find it engaged in the bold scheme of seizing a lucky moment, when Agathocles and Carthage had reduced Syracuse to the lowest ebb, and arrogating to itself supremacy over all the Sicilian republics. Xenodicus was appointed the leader of this arduous enterprise; and had his latter operations been as fortunate as his first campaign, Agrigentum would have acquired such a preponderance of reputation and power, that the rival states would not have even dared to attack it.

After the death of Aristobulus, his father, Josephus informs us, that Herod his grandfather took care of his education, and sent him to Rome to make his court to Tiberius. The emperor conceived a great affection for Agrippa, and placed him near his son Drusus. Agrippa very soon won the graces of Drusus, and of the empress Antonia. But Drusus dying suddenly, all those who had been much about him were commanded by Tiberius to withdraw from Rome, lest the sight and presence of them should renew his affliction. Agrippa, who had indulged his inclination to liberality, was obliged to leave Rome overwhelmed with debts, and in a very poor condition. He did not think it fit to go to Jerusalem, because he was not able to make a figure there suitable to his birth. He retired therefore to the castle of Massada, where he lived rather like a private person than a prince. Herod the Tetrarch, his uncle, who had married Herodias his sister, afflicted him for some time with great generosity. He made him principal magistrate of Tiberias, and presented him with a large sum of money; but all this was not sufficient to answer the excessive expenses and profusion of Agrippa; so that Herod growing weary of afflicting him, and reproaching him with his bad economy, Agrippa took a resolution to quit Judea, and return to Rome. Upon his arrival, he was received into the good graces of Tiberius, and commanded to attend Tiberius Nero the son of Drusus. Agrippa, however, having more inclination for Caius the son of Germanicus, and grandson of Antonia, chose rather to attach himself to him; as if he had some prophetic views of the future elevation of Caius, who at that time was beloved by all the world. The great affluence and agreeable behaviour of Agrippa so far engaged this prince, that he kept him continually about him.\n\nAgrippa being one day overheard by Eutyches, a slave whom he had made free, to express his wishes for Tiberius's death and the advancement of Caius, the slave betrayed him to the emperor; whereupon Agrippa was loaded with fetters, and committed to the custody of an officer. Tiberius soon after dying, and Caius Caligula succeeding him, the new emperor heaped many favours and much wealth upon Agrippa; changed his iron fetters into a chain of gold; set a royal diadem upon his head; and gave him the tetrarchy which Philip, the son of Herod the Great, had been possessed of, that is, Batanaea and Trachonitis. To this he added that of Lybanias; and Agrippa returned very soon into Judea to take possession of his new kingdom.\n\nCaius being soon after killed, Agrippa, who was then at Rome, contributed much by his advice to maintain Claudius in possession of the imperial dignity, to which he had been advanced by the army. But in this affair Agrippa acted a part wherein he showed more cunning and address than sincerity and honesty; for while he made a show of being in the interest of the senate, he secretly advised Claudius to be resolute, and not to abandon his good fortune. The emperor, as an acknowledgment for his kind offices, gave him all Judea and the kingdom of Chalcis, which had been possessed by Herod his brother. Thus Agrippa became of a sudden one of the greatest princes of the east; and was possessed of as much, if not more territories\nAgrippa, ritories than had been held by Herod the Great his grandfather. He returned to Judea, and governed it to the great satisfaction of the Jews. But the desire of pleasing them, and a mistaken zeal for their religion, induced him to commit an unjust action; the memory of which is preserved in Scripture, Acts xii. 1, 2, &c., for about the feast of the passover, in the year of Jesus Christ 44, St James major, the son of Zebedee and brother of St John the Evangelist, was seized by his order and put to death. He proceeded also to lay hands on St Peter, and imprisoned him, waiting till the festival was over, that he might then have him executed. But God having miraculously delivered St Peter from the place of his confinement, the designs of Agrippa were frustrated. After the passover, this prince went from Jerusalem to Caesarea, and there had games performed in honour of Claudius. Here the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon waited on him to sue for peace. Agrippa being come early in the morning to the theatre, with a design to give them audience, seated himself on his throne, dressed in a robe of silver-tissue, worked in the most admirable manner. The rising sun darted on it with its rays, and gave it such a lustre as the eyes of the spectators could not endure. When therefore the king spoke to the Tyrians and Sidonians, the parasites around him began to say, that it was the voice of a god, and not that of a man. Instead of rejecting these impious flatteries, Agrippa received them with an air of complacency; but at the same time observed an owl above him on a cord. He had seen the same bird before when he was in bonds by order of Tiberius; and it was then told him, that he should be soon set at liberty: but that whenever he saw the same thing a second time, he should not live above five days afterwards. He was therefore extremely terrified; and he died at the end of five days, racked with tormenting pains in his bowels, and devoured with worms. Such was the death of Herod Agrippa, after a reign of seven years, in the year of Christ 44.\n\nAgrippa II., son of the preceding Herod, was made king of Chalcis; but three or four years after, he was deprived of that kingdom by Claudius, who gave him in the place of it other provinces. In the war Vespasian carried on against the Jews, Herod lent him a succour of 2000 men; by which it appears that though a Jew by religion, he was yet entirely devoted to the Romans, whose affiance indeed he wanted to secure the peace of his own kingdom. He lived to the third year of Trajan, and died at Rome A.D. 100. He was the seventh and last king of the family of Herod the Great. It was before him and Berenice his sister that St Paul pleaded his cause at Caesarea.\n\nAgrippa, Marcus Vitianus, son-in-law to Augustus, of mean birth, but one of the most considerable generals among the Romans.

The prophets marched in the front, singing hymns in honour of their deities; after them came a herald with a caduceus in his hand; these were followed by three druids abreast, bearing the things necessary for sacrifice; last of all came the chief or arch druid, accompanied with the train of people. The chief druid climbing the oak, cut off the millet with a golden sickle, and the other druids received it in a white cloth; on the first day of the year it was distributed among the people, after having been blessed and consecrated it by crying \"Gui l'an neuf,\" to proclaim...\nproclaim the new year. This cry is still continued in Picardy, with the addition of Plantez, Plantez, to with a plentiful year. In Burgundy and some other parts, the children use the same word to beg a new-year's gift.

Ahab was ordered to review the princes of the provinces, which he found to be a choice company, consisting of 232 young men, who were to command the people in Samaria, amounting to about 7000 men; with this small army Ahab was directed to fall upon the great host of the Syrians, and that at noon-day, while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings that accompanied him were drinking and making merry. Ben-hadad having notice that they were marching out of the city, ordered them to be brought before him alive, whatever their designs were; but the young men, followed by this small army, advanced, and killed all that opposed them. Such a panic seized the Syrian troops, that they began to fly, and even Ben-hadad himself mounted his horse and fled with his cavalry: which Ahab perceiving, pursued them, killed great numbers of them, and took a considerable booty. After this the prophet came to Ahab, to animate him with fresh courage, and to caution him to keep up his guard; assuring him, that Ben-hadad would return against him the year following. According to this prediction, at the end of the year he returned and encamped at Aphek, with a resolution to give the Israelites battle. Both armies being ranged in order of battle for seven days successively, at length upon the seventh day, a battle ensued, wherein the Israelites killed 100,000 of the Syrians, and the rest fled to Aphek; but as they were pressing to get into the city, the walls of Aphek fell upon them and killed 27,000 more. Ben-hadad throwing himself upon the mercy of Ahab, this prince received him into his own chariot, and made an alliance with him. The year following, Ahab desiring to make a kitchen garden near his palace (chap. xxii.), requested of one Naboth, a citizen of Jezreel, that he would sell him his vineyard, because it lay convenient for him. But being refused, he returned in great discontentment to his house, threw himself upon the bed, turned towards the wall, and would eat nothing. Jezebel his wife coming in, asked the reason of his great concern; of which being informed, she procured the death of Naboth, and Ahab took possession of his vineyard. As he returned from Jezreel to Samaria, the prophet Elijah met him, and said, \"Hast thou killed and also taken possession? Now faith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. As for Jezebel, of her the Lord spoke, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the way of Jezreel.\" Ahab, hearing these and other denunciations, rent his clothes, put sackcloth upon his flesh, and gave other indications of his sorrow and repentance. But his repentance was neither sincere nor persevering. Two years after these things, Jehoshaphat king of Judah came to Samaria to visit Ahab (chap. xxiii.) at a time when he was preparing to attack Ramoth-gilead, which Ben-hadad king of Syria unjustly withheld from him. The king of Israel invited Jehoshaphat to accompany him in this expedition; which that prince agreed to do, but desired that some prophet might first be consulted. Ahab therefore assembled the prophets of Baal, in number about 400; who all concurred in exhorting the king to march resolutely against Ramoth-gilead. But Micaiah being also consulted, at Jehoshaphat's suggestion, prophesied the ruin of Ahab. Upon this, Ahab gave orders to his people to seize Micaiah, and to carry him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; telling him in his name, \"Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with the bread of affliction, and with the water of affliction, until I come in peace.\" But Micaiah said, \"If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me.\" Ahab, therefore, and Jehoshaphat marched up to Ramoth-gilead; and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \"I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle, but put thou on my robe:\" for he knew that the king of Syria had commanded two and thirty captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, \"Fight neither with small nor with great, save only with the king of Israel.\" These officers, therefore, having observed that Jehoshaphat was dressed in royal robes, took him for the king of Israel, and fell upon him with great impetuosity: but this prince seeing himself pressed closely, cried out; and the mistake being discovered, the captains of the king of Syria gave over pursuing him. But one of the Syrian army shot a random arrow, which pierced the heart of Ahab. The battle lasted the whole day, and Ahab continued in his chariot with his face turned towards the Syrians. In the mean time, his blood was still issuing from his wound, and falling in his chariot; and towards the evening he died: whereupon proclamation was made by sound of trumpet, that every man should return to his own city and country. The king of Israel being dead, was carried to Samaria and buried: but his chariot and the reins of his horses were washed in the fountain of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood, according to the word of the prophet.

One of his sons he consecrated, by making him pass through and perish by the fire, in honour of the false god Moloch; and he offered sacrifices and incense upon the high places, upon hills, and in groves. Rezin king of Syria and Pekah king of Israel invaded Judea in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz; and having defeated his army and pillaged the country, they laid siege to Jerusalem. When they found that they could not make themselves masters of that city, they divided their army, plundered the country, and made the inhabitants prisoners of war. Rezin and his part of the confederate army marched with all their spoil to Damascus; but Pekah with his division of the army having attacked Ahaz, killed 120,000 men of his army in one battle, and carried away men, women, and children, without distinction, to the number of 200,000. But as they were carrying those captives to Samaria, the prophet Oded, with the principal inhabitants of the city, came out to meet...\nmeet them; and by their remonstrances prevailed with them to set their prisoners at liberty. At the same time, the Philistines and Edomites invaded other parts of his land, killed multitudes of the people, and carried off much booty. In this distressed condition, Ahaz finding no other remedy for his affairs, sent ambassadors to Tiglath-pileser king of the Assyrians; and to engage him to his interest, he stripped the temple and city of all the gold which he could meet with, and sent it as a present. Accordingly Tiglath-pileser marched to the assistance of Ahaz, attacked Rezin and killed him, took his capital Damascus, destroyed it, and removed the inhabitants thereof to Cyrene.\n\nThe misfortunes of this prince had no influence to make him better: on the contrary, in the times of his greatest affliction, he sacrificed to the Syrian deities, whom he looked upon as the authors of his calamities, and endeavoured to render propitious to him, by honouring them in this manner. He broke in pieces the vessels of the house of God, shut up the gates of the temple, and erected altars in all parts of Jerusalem. He set up altars likewise in all the cities of Judah, with a design to offer incense on them. At length he died, and was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the sepulchres of the kings of Judah his predecessors: which honour he was deprived of, on account of his injurious course of life.

The Moabites, who had been always obedient to the kings of the ten tribes ever since their separation from the kingdom of Judah, revolted after the death of Ahab, and refused to pay the ordinary tribute. Ahaziah had not leisure or power to reduce them (2 Kings i. 1, 2, &c.); for about the same time, having fallen through a lattice from the top of his house, he hurt himself considerably, and sent messengers to Ekron, in order to consult Baalzebub, the god of that place, whether he should recover of the indisposition occasioned by this accident.

Ahijah was one of those who wrote the annals or history of this prince (2 Chr. ix. 29.) The same prophet declared to Jeroboam that he would usurp the kingdom (1 Kings xi. 29, &c.), and that two heifers should alienate him from the Lord, meaning the golden calves erected by Jeroboam, one at Dan, the other at Bethel. About the end of Jeroboam's reign, towards the year of the world 3246, Abijah the son of that prince fell sick; upon which Jeroboam sent his wife to this prophet to inquire what would become of the child. The queen therefore went to Abijah's house in Shiloh, disguised: But the prophet, upon hearing the sound of her feet, said, \"Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam, why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.\" Then he commanded her to go and tell Jeroboam all the evil that the Lord had declared he would bring upon his house for his impurities; that so soon as she should enter into the city her son Abijah should die, and should be the only one of Jeroboam's house that should come to the grave or receive the honours of a burial.

This prince, upon his being preferred to the crown by the greatest part of the Israelites, sent for Ahitophel from Gilo (2 Sam. xv. 12.) to assist him with his advice in the present state of his affairs: for at that time Ahitophel's counsels were received as the oracles of God himself (chap. xvi. u.l.) Nothing gave David more uneasiness than this event; and when Hushai his friend came to wait on him and attend him in his flight, he intreated him to return rather to Jerusalem, make a show of offering his services to Absalom, and endeavour to frustrate the prudent measures which should be proposed by Ahitophel. When Absalom was come to Jerusalem, he desired Ahitophel to deliberate with his other counsellors upon the measures which were proper for him to take. Ahitophel advised him in the first place to abuse his father's concubines; so that when his party should understand that he had dishonoured his father in this manner, they might conclude that there were no hopes of a reconciliation, and therefore espouse his interest more resolutely. A tent, therefore, being prepared for this purpose upon the terrace of the king's palace, Absalom, in the sight of all Israel, lay with his father's concubines. The next thing Ahitophel proposed was in the terms following: \"Let me now choose out 12,000 men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night, and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and I will make him afraid, and all the people that are with him flee, and I will smite the king only; and I will bring back all the people unto thee; the man whom thou keepest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.\" This advice was very agreeable to Absalom and all the elders of Israel. However,\nAbihas desired Hushai to be called to have his opinion. Hushai being come, and hearing what advice Ahithophel had given, said, \"The counsel which Ahithophel has given is not good at this time; what, for the present, in my opinion, may do better, is this: Let all Israel be gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and put thyself in the midst of them, and wherever David is, we may fall upon him, and overwhelm him with our numbers, as the dew falleth upon the ground.\" This last advice being more agreeable to Absalom and all the elders of Israel, was preferred; upon which Ahithophel saddled his ass, went to his house at Gilo, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. He foresaw, without doubt, all that would happen in consequence of Hushai's advice, and was determined to prevent the death which he had deserved, and which David would probably have inflicted on him, as soon as he should be resettled on his throne.","sp":164,"ep":165},{"h":"AHMELLA","t":"in Botany.

Joshua having sent a detachment of 3000 men against Ai, God permitted them to be repulsed on account of Achan's sin, who had violated the anathema pronounced against the city of Jericho. But after the expiation of this offence, God commanded Joshua (chap. viii.) to march with the whole army of the Israelites against Ai, and treat this city and the kingdom thereof as he had treated Jericho, with this difference, that he gave the plunder of the town to the people. Joshua sent by night 30,000 men to lie in ambush behind Ai; having first well instructed those who had the command of them in what they were to do; and the next day, early in the morning, he marched against the city with the remainder of his army. The king of Ai, perceiving them, fell hastily out of the town with all his people, and fell upon the forces of the Israelites, who, upon the first onset, fled, as if they had been under some great terror.\n\nAs soon as Joshua saw the enemy all out of the gates, he raised his shield upon the top of a pike, which was the signal given to the ambuscade; whereupon they immediately entered the place, which they found without defence, and set fire to it. The people of Ai perceiving the smoke ascending, were willing to return, but discovered those who had set fire to the city in their rear, while Joshua and those who were with him turning about, fell upon them, and cut them in pieces. The king was taken alive, and afterwards put to death.\n\nThe chevalier Folard observes, that Joshua's enterprise on Ai, excepting in some particulars of military art, is very like that of Gibeah, which is scarce anything more than a copy of it. It would appear, says that writer, by the Scripture account, that Joshua was not the author of the stratagem made use of by him: for when God directs himself to Joshua, he says, \"Go up against Ai; lay an ambuscade behind the town; I have delivered the king and the people of it into thine hands;\" yet notwithstanding this, God might leave the whole glory of the invention and execution of it to him, as to a great general. \"Joshua arose, (says the sacred author,) and all the people of war, to go up against Ai (verse 3.) and Joshua chose out 30,000 mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night,\" Folard remarks, that there is a manifest contradiction between this verse and the 14th, wherein it is said, that Joshua chose out 500 men, whom he sent to lie in ambush, between Bethel and Ai. How is this to be reconciled? Calmet says, that Malus allows but 5000 men for the ambuscade, and 25,000 for the attack of the city, being persuaded that an army of 600,000 men could only create confusion on this occasion, without any necessity for, or advantage in, such numbers; but the generality of interpreters, continues Calmet, acknowledge two bodies to be placed in ambuscade, both between Bethel and Ai; one of 25,000, and the other of 5000 men.\n\nWith regard to the signal Joshua made to that part of his army which lay in ambuscade, the learned Folard embraces the opinion of the Rabbins, who believe what is called the shield to be too small to serve for a signal: hence they make it to be the staff of one of their colours: from this, our author concludes, that the whole colours were used on this occasion; for in the Asiatic style, which is very near the poetical, the part is oftentimes to be taken for the whole.","sp":165,"ep":165},{"h":"AICHSTATT","t":"a town of Germany, in Franconia, and capital of a bishopric of the same name.

About the year 1723 he fixed his residence in London, where he followed the profession of painting, and had the good fortune to be patronised by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Burlington, Sir Godfrey Kneller, and other liberal encouragers of the arts. He painted many portraits of persons of the first rank in England and Scotland; and a large picture of the royal family for the earl of Burlington, now in the possession of the duke of Devonshire, which was unfinished at his death.

We need not follow Rouffleau, and the other philologists, in their endeavours to investigate the etymology of the word air. Its derivation, though found and ascertained, would contribute little to illustrate its meaning in that remote sense, to which, through a long continuance of time, and the various vicissitudes of language, it has now passed. The curious may consult the same article in the Dictionnaire de Musique by M. Rouffleau.\n\nIn modern music, there are several different kinds of airs, each of which agrees to a certain kind of dancing; and from these dances the airs themselves take their specific names.\n\nThe airs of our operas are, if we may be permitted the expression, the canvas or substratum upon which are painted all the pictures of imitative music; melody is the design, and harmony the colouring; every picturesque object selected from the most beautiful parts of nature, every reflected sentiment of the human heart, are the models which the artist imitates; whatever gains attention, whatever interests the soul, whatever charms the ear, or causes emotion in the heart, these are the objects of his imitation. An air which delights the ear, and discovers the learning of the composer; an air invented by genius, and composed with taste; is the noblest effort of music: it is this which explores the compass, and displays the delicacy, of a beautiful voice; it is in this where the charms of a well conducted symphony shine; it is by this, that the passions, excited and inflamed by nice gradations, reach and agitate the soul through the avenues of external sense. After hearing a beautiful air, the mind is agreeable and serene: the ear is satisfied, not disgusted: it remains impressed on the fancy, it becomes a part of our essence, we carry it with us, we are able to repeat it at pleasure: without the ability acquired by habit to breathe a single note of it, we execute it in our imagination in the same manner as we heard it upon the theatre: one sees the scene, the actor, the theatre; one hears the accompaniments and the applause. The real enthusiast in music never forgets the beautiful airs which he has heard; when he chooses, he causes the opera to recommence.\n\nThe words to which airs are adapted are not always rehearsed in regular succession, nor spoken in the same manner with those of the recitative; and though, in general, they are very short, yet they are interrupted, repeated, transposed, at the pleasure of the artist. They do not constitute a narrative, which once is told over: they either delineate a picture, which it is necessary to contemplate in different points of view; or inspire a sentiment in which the heart acquiesces with pleasure, and from which it is neither able nor willing to be disengaged; and the different phrases of the air, are nothing else but different manners of beholding the same image. This is the reason why the subject of an air should be one. It is by these repetitions properly placed, it is by these redoubled efforts, that an impression, which at first was not able to move you, at length shakes your soul, agitates you, transports you out of yourself; and it is likewise upon the same principle, that the runnings, as they are called, or those long, mazy, and inarticulated inflections of the voice, in pathetic airs, frequently seem, though they are not always so, improperly placed: for whilst the heart is affected with a sentiment equitably moving, it often expresses its emotions by inarticulate sounds, more strongly and sensibly than it could do by words themselves.\nThe form of airs is of two kinds. The small airs are often composed of two strains, which ought each of them to be sung twice; but the important airs in operas are frequently in the form of rondellas.\n\nAir, in Geography. See Ayr.\n\nAir-Bladder, in fishes. See Comparative Anatomy and Ichthyology Index.\n\nAir-Gun, a pneumatic machine for exploding bullets, &c., with great violence. See Pneumatics.\n\nAir-Jacket, a sort of jacket made of leather, in which are several bags, or bladders, composed of the same materials, communicating with each other. These are filled with air through a leather tube, having a brass stop-cock accurately ground at the extremity, by which means the air blown in through the tube is confined in the bladders. The jacket must be wet, before the air be blown into the bags, as otherwise it will immediately escape through the pores of the leather. By the help of these bladders, which are placed near the breast, the person is supported in the water, without making the efforts used in swimming.\n\nAir-Pipes, an invention for drawing foul air out of ships, or any other close places, by means of fire. These pipes were first found out by one Mr Sutton, a brewer in London; and from him have got the name of Sutton's Air-pipes. The principle on which their operation depends is known to everybody, being indeed no other than that air is necessary for the support of fire; and, if it has not access from the places most adjacent, will not fail to come from those that are more remote. Thus, in a common furnace, the air enters through the ash-hole; but if this is closed up, and a hole made in the side of the furnace, the air will rush in with great violence through that hole. If a tube of any length whatever be inserted in this hole, the air will rush through the tube into the fire, and of consequence there will be a continued circulation of air in that place where the extremity of the tube is laid. Mr Sutton's contrivance then, as communicated to the Royal Society by Doctor Mead, amounts to no more than this.\u2014\"As, in every ship of any bulk, there is already provided a copper or boiling place proportionable to the size of the vessel; it is proposed to clear the bad air, by means of the fire already used under the said coppers or boiling places for the necessary uses of the ship.\n\n\"It is also well known, that under every such copper or boiler, there are placed two holes, separated by a grate; the first of which is for the fire, and the other for the ashes falling from the same; and that there is also a flue from the fire-place upward, by which the smoke of the fire is discharged at some convenient place of the ship.\n\n\"It is also well known, that the fire once lighted in these fire-places, is only preserved by the constant draught of air through the forementioned two holes and flue; and that if the said two holes are closely stopped up, the fire, though burning ever so briskly before, is immediately put out.\n\n\"But if, after stopping up the abovementioned holes, another hole be opened, communicating with any other room or airy place, and with the fire; it is clear, the said fire must again be raised and burn as before, there being a light draught of air through the same as there was before the stopping up of the first holes; this case differing only from the former in this, that Air-Pipes, the air feeding the fire will now be supplied from another place.\n\n\"It is therefore proposed, that, in order to clear the holds of ships of the bad air therein contained, the two holes above mentioned, the fire-place and ash-place, be both closed up with substantial and tight iron doors; and that a copper or leaden pipe, of sufficient size, be laid from the hold into the ash-place, for the draught of air to come in that way to feed the fire. And thus it seems plain, from what has been already said, that there will be, from the hold, a constant discharge of the air therein contained; and consequently, that that air, so discharged, must be as constantly supplied by fresh air down the hatches or such other communications as are opened into the hold; whereby the same must be continually refreshed, and its air rendered more wholesome and fit for respiration.\n\n\"And if into this principal pipe so laid into the hold, other pipes are let in, communicating respectively either with the well or lower decks; it must follow, that part of the air, consumed in feeding the fire, must be respectively drawn out of all such places to which the communication shall be so made.\"\n\nThis account is so plain, that no doubt can remain concerning the efficacy of the contrivance: it is evident, that, by means of pipes of this kind, a constant circulation of fresh air would be occasioned through those places where it would otherwise be most apt to stagnate and putrefy. Several other contrivances have been used for the same purpose; and Dr Hales's ventilators, by some unaccountable prejudice, have been reckoned superior in efficacy and even simplicity to Mr Sutton's machine, which at its first invention met with great opposition, and even when introduced by Dr Mead, who used all his interest for that purpose, was shamefully neglected.\n\nA machine capable of answering the same purpose was invented by Mr Defaguliers, which he called the ship's lungs. It consisted of a cylindrical box set up on its edge, and fixed to a wooden pedestal. From the upper edge of the box issued a square trunk open at the end, and communicating with the cavity of the box. Within this box was placed a cylindrical wheel turning on an axis. It was divided into 12 parts, by means of partitions placed like the radii of a circle. These partitions did not extend quite to the centre, but left an open space of about 18 inches diameter in the middle; towards the circumference, they extended as far as possible without interfering with the case, so that the wheel might always be allowed to turn freely.\u2014Things being thus circumstanced, it is plain, that if the wheel was turned towards that side of the box on which the trunk was, every division would push the air before it, and drive it out through the trunk, at the same time that fresh air would come in through the open space at the centre, to supply that which was thrown out through the trunk. By turning the wheel swiftly, a strong blast of air would be continually forced out through the square trunk, on the same principles on which a common fanner winnows corn. If the wheel is turned the opposite way, a draught of air may be produced from the trunk to the centre. If this machine, then, is placed in a room where a circulation of air is wanted, and the trunk made to pass through one of\nAir-Pump of the walls; by turning the wheel swiftly round, the air will be forced with great velocity out of that room, at the same time that fresh air will enter through any chinks by which it can have access to supply that which has been forced out.\n\nIt is evident, that the circulation which is promoted by this machine, is entirely of the same kind with that produced by Mr Sutton's; the turning of the wheel in Mr Defagulliers's machine being equivalent to the rarefaction of the air by fire in Mr Sutton's: but that the latter is vastly superior, as acting of itself, and without intermission, requires no arguments to prove. Mr Sutton's machine has yet another convenience, of which no other contrivance for the same purpose can boast; namely, that it not only draws out putrid air, but destroys it by causing it pass through fire; and experience has abundantly shown, that though putrid air is thrown into a great quantity of fresh air, it is so far from losing its pernicious properties, that it often produces noxious effects. We do not say, indeed, that putrid air becomes salutary by this means; but it is undoubtedly rendered less noxious than before; though whether it is equally innocent with the smoke of a fire fed in the common way, we cannot pretend to determine.\n\nBesides this machine by Mr Defagulliers, the ventilators of Dr Hales, already mentioned, and those called wind-sails, are likewise used for the same purpose. The former of which is an improvement of the Hessian bellows; the other is a contrivance for throwing fresh air into those places where putrid air is apt to lodge; but this has the last-mentioned inconvenience in a much greater degree than any of the others, as the blast of fresh air throws out that which was rendered putrid by stagnation, in such a manner as to contaminate all around it.\n\nAir-Pump, a machine by which the air contained in a proper vessel may be exhausted or drawn out. See Pneumatics.\n\nAir-Sacs, in Birds. See Comparative Anatomy.\n\nAir-Shafts, among Miners, denote holes or shafts let down from the open air to meet the adits and furnish fresh air. The damps, deficiency, and impurity of air which occur, when adits are wrought 30 or 40 fathoms long, make it necessary to let down air-shafts, in order to give the air liberty to play through the whole work, and thus discharge bad vapours, and furnish good air for respiration: the expense of which shafts, in regard of their vast depths, hardness of the rock, drawing of water, &c., sometimes equals, nay exceeds, the ordinary charge of the whole adit.\n\nSir Robert Murray describes a method, used in the coal-mines at Liege, of working mines without air-shafts.\n\nWhen the miners at Mendip have sunk a groove, they will not be at the charge of an air-shaft till they come at ore; and for the supply of air have boxes of elm exactly closed, of about six inches in the clear, by which they carry it down about twenty fathoms. They cut a trench at a little distance from the top of the groove, covering it with turf and rods disposed to receive the pipe, which they contrive to come in sidewise to their groove, four feet from the top; which carries down the air to a great depth. When they come at ore, and need an air-shaft, they sink it four or five fathoms distant, according to the convenience of the breadth, and of the same fashion with the groove, to draw ore as well as air.\n\nAir-Threads, in Natural History, a name given to the long filaments, so frequently seen in autumn floating about in the air.\n\nThese threads are the work of spiders, especially of that species called the long-legged field-spider; which, having mounted to the summit of a bush or tree, darts from its tail several of these threads, till one is produced capable of supporting the creature in the air: on this it mounts in quest of prey, and frequently rises to a very considerable height. See Aranea.\n\nAir-Trunk, is also a contrivance by Dr. Hales to prevent the stagnation of putrid effluvia in jails, and other places where a great number of people are crowded together in a small space. It consists only of a long square trunk open at both ends; one of which is inserted into the ceiling of the room, the air of which is required to be kept pure; and the other extends a good way beyond the roof. Through this trunk a continued circulation is carried on: and the reason is, that the putrid effluvia which do so much mischief when collected, being much lighter than the pure atmosphere, arise to the top of the room; and, if they there find a vent, will continually go out through it. These effluvia arise in very considerable quantity, being calculated by the late Dr Keil at no less than 39 ounces on one man in 24 hours.\n\nThese trunks were first made trial of by Mr Yeoman, over the House of Commons, where they were nine inches wide within; and over the Court of King's Bench in Westminster-hall, where they were six inches wide. They are sometimes made wider, and sometimes narrower: but the wider they are the longer they ought to be, more effectually to promote the ascent of the vapours. The reason why vapours of this kind ascend more swiftly through a long trunk than a short one, is, that the pressure of fluids is always according to their different depth, without regard to the diameter of their basis, or of the vessel which contains them; and, upon this principle, a gallon of water may be made to split a strong cask. See Hydrostatics. When the column of putrid effluvia is long and narrow, the difference between the columns of atmosphere pre\u00ebxisting on the upper end of the trunk, and that which pre\u00ebxists on the lower end, is much greater than if the column of putrid effluvia was short and wide; and consequently the ascent is much swifter.\u2014One pan of a single pair of scales, which was two inches in diameter, being held within one of these trunks over the House of Commons, the force of the ascending air made it rise so as to require four grains to restore the equilibrium, and this when there was no person in the house; but when it was full, no less than 12 grains were requisite to restore the equilibrium; which clearly shows that these trunks must be of real and very great efficacy.\n\nAir-Vessels, are spiral ducts in the leaves, &c., of plants, supposed to be analogous to the lungs of animals, in supplying the different parts of a plant with air.

It purifies the blood; purges the body from gross humours; and, as the jockeys express it, teaches the horse how to make his wind rake equally, and keep time with the other motions of his body. It also sharpens the stomach, and keeps the creature hungry; which is a thing of great consequence, as hunters and racers are very apt to have their stomach fall off, either from want of exercise, or from the too violent exercise which they are often exposed to. If the horse be over fat, it is best to air him before sunrise and after sunsetting; and in general, it is allowed by all, that nothing is more beneficial to those creatures than early and late airings. Some of our modern managers, however, dispute this; they say, that the cold of these times is too great for the creature; and that if, in particular, he is subject to catarrhs, rheums, or the like complaints, the dews and cold fogs, in these early and late airings, will be apt to increase all those disorders. Nature, we see, also points out the sun-beams as of great use to these animals; those which are kept hardy and lie out all night, always running to those places where the sunshine comes, as soon as it appears in a morning. This should seem to recommend these airings that are to be made before sunrise, and a little time after sunrise. As to the caution, so earnestly inculcated by Markham, of using these early and late airings for fat horses, it is found unnecessary by many: for they say, that the same effect may be produced by airings at warmer times, provided only that they are made longer; and that, in general, it is from long airings that we are to expect to bring a horse to a perfect wind and sound courage.","sp":171,"ep":171},{"h":"AISNE","t":"a river of France, which rises in Champagne, and runs west by Soisson's in the Isle of France, falling into the river Oise, a little above Compiegne.\n\nIt gives name to one of the five departments which comprehend the ancient Isle of France, and contains five communal districts.","sp":171,"ep":171},{"h":"AITOCZU","t":"a considerable river of Lesser Asia, which rises in Mount Taurus, and falls into the south part of the Euxine sea.","sp":171,"ep":171},{"h":"AITON","t":"WILLIAM, an eminent botanist and gardener, was born at a village near Hamilton in Scotland, in 1731. Having been regularly trained to the profession of a gardener, he came into England in the year 1754, and soon obtained the notice of the celebrated Philip Miller, then superintendent of the physic-garden at Chelsea, who engaged him as an assistant. His industry and abilities recommended him to the princess-dowager of Wales as a fit person to manage the botanical garden at Kew. In 1759, he was appointed to this office, in which he continued during life, and which was the source of his fame and fortune. The garden at Kew, under the auspices of his present majesty, was defined to be the grand repository of all the vegetable riches which could be accumulated, by regal munificence, from researches through every quarter of the globe. These treasures were fortunately committed to the hands of Mr Aiton, whose care and skill in their cultivation, and intelligence in their arrangement, acquired him high reputation among the lovers of the science, and the particular esteem of his royal patrons. Under his superintendence, many improvements took place in the plan and edifices of Kew-gardens, which rendered them the principal scene of botanical culture in the kingdom. In 1783, his merit was properly rewarded with the lucrative office of managing the pleasure and kitchen-gardens of Kew, which he was allowed to retain with the botanical department. In 1789, he published his Hortus Kewensis; or a Catalogue of the Plants cultivated in the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, in three vols. 8vo. with 15 plates; a work which had been the labour of many years. The number of species contained in this work amounted to between five and six thousand, many of which had not before been described. A new and curious article in it relates to the first introduction of particular exotics into the English gardens. The system of arrangement adopted is the Linnean, with improvements, which the advanced state of botanical science required. Mr Aiton with candour and modesty acknowledges the affluence he received in this work from the two eminent Swedish naturalists, Dr Solander and Mr Jonas Dryander. Indeed his character was such as secured him the friendship and good offices of the most distinguished names in science of his time. He was for many years peculiarly honoured by the notice of Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. The Hortus Kewensis was received with avidity by the botanic world, and a large impression was soon disposed of.\n\nNotwithstanding the singular activity and temperance of Mr Aiton, he fell into that incurable malady, a schirrous liver, of which he died in 1793, in his fifty-second year. His eldest son, devoted to the same pursuits, was, by the king's own nomination, appointed to all his father's employments. Mr Aiton's private character was highly estimable for mildness, benevolence, piety, and every domestic and social virtue. He was interred in the churchyard of Kew, amidst a most respectable concourse of friends. (Gen.

It is seated on the lake Bourget, at the foot of a mountain, between Chamberry, Annecy, and Rumilly. There is here a triumphal arch of the ancient Romans, but it is almost entirely ruined.

Lat. 45. 40.\n\nAix, in Geography, an ancient city, the capital of the department of the Bouches du Rhone, formerly Provence, in France. This city has an air of silence and gloom common characteristic of places delitute of commerce or indultry. It is, however, well built; and most like Paris of any place in the kingdom, as well for the largeness of the buildings as in respect of the politeness of the inhabitants. It is embellished with abundance of fine fountains, and several beautiful squares. The Preachers square is on the side of a hill; it is about 160 yards in length, and is surrounded with trees, and houses built with stone three stories high. The town-hall is at one end of the city, and is distributed into several fine apartments: the two lowest are taken up by the board of accounts, and by the senechal; that above is designed for the sessions of parliament. The hall of audience is adorned with the pictures of the kings of France on horseback. The hotel of the city is a handsome building, but hid by the houses of the narrow street in which it is placed. The cathedral church is a Gothic structure, with tombs of several earls of Provence, and some good pictures by French masters. The Corfe, or Orbitelle, is a magnificent walk, above 300 yards long, formed by a triple avenue of elms, and two rows of regular and stately houses. The church of the fathers of the oratory is a handsome building; and not far from thence is the chapel of the blue penitents, which is full of paintings. The convent of preachers is very fine; in their church is a silver statue of the Virgin Mary almost as big as the life. There are other churches and buildings which contain a great number of rarities. The baths without the city, which were discovered not long since, have good buildings, raised at a vast expense, for the accommodation of those who drink the waters. Although Aix was the first Roman settlement in Gaul, it is not remarkable for ancient remains. The warm springs, from which it is now known and frequented, induced Sextus Calvinius to found a colony here, to which he gave the name of Aquae Sextiae. They were supposed to possess particular virtues in cases of debility; and several altars have been dug up sacred to Priapus, the inscriptions on which indicate their gratitude to that deity for his supposed succour and assistance.

Lat. 46. 5.\n\nAix-la-Chapelle, a fine city of Germany, in the circle of Westphalia and duchy of Juliers, and capital of the department of Roer.\n\nAll authors are agreed about its antiquity, it being mentioned in Caesar's Commentaries and the Annals of Tacitus. The Romans had colonies and fortresses there, when they were at war with the Germans; but the mineral waters and the hot bath so increased its fame, that, in process of time, it was advanced to the privileges of a city, by the name of Aquaegranii, that is, the waters of Granius; that which it has now, of Aix-la-Chapelle, was given it by the French, to distinguish it from the other Aix. It is so called, on account of a chapel built in honour of the Holy Virgin by Charlemagne; who having repaired, beautified, and enlarged the city, which was destroyed by the Huns in the reign of Attila in 451, made it the usual place of his residence. The town is seated in a valley surrounded with mountains and woods, and yet the air is very wholesome. It may be divided into the inward and outward city. The inward is encompassed with a wall about three quarters of a league in circumference, having ten gates; and the outward wall, in which there are eleven gates, is about a league and a half in circumference. There are rivulets which run through the town and keep it very clean, turning several mills; besides 20 public fountains, and many private ones. They have stone quarries in the neighbourhood, which furnish the inhabitants with proper materials for their magnificent buildings, of which the Stadt-house and the cathedral are the chief. There are likewise 30 parochial or collegiate churches. The market-place is very spacious, and the houses round it are stately. In the middle, before the Stadt-house, is a fountain of blue stones, which throws out water, from six pipes, into a marble basin placed beneath, 30 feet in circumference. On the top of this fountain is placed the statue of Charlemagne, of gilt brass, holding a sceptre in his right hand, and a globe in his left. The Stadt-house is adorned with the statues of all the emperors since Charlemagne. This fabric has three stories, the upper of which is one entire room of 160 feet in length and 60 in breadth. In this the newly-elected emperor formerly entertained all the electors of the empire.\n\nAix-la-Chapelle is a free imperial city, and changes its magistracy every year on the eve of St John Baptist. The mayor is in the nomination of the elector palatine, in the quality of the duke of Juliers, as protector of the city. This place is famous for several councils and treaties of peace concluded here; particularly those between France and Spain in 1668, and between Great Britain and France in 1748.\n\nThe hot sulphurous waters for which this place has so long been celebrated, arise from several sources, which supply eight baths constructed in different parts of the town. These waters near the sources are clear and\nand pellucid; and have a strong sulphureous smell resembling the washings of a foul gun; but they lose this smell by exposure to air. Their taste is saline, bitter, and urinous. They do not contain iron. They are also neutral near the fountain, but afterwards are manifestly and pretty strongly alkaline, inasmuch that clothes are washed with them without soap. On the vaults above the springs and aqueducts of these waters is found, every year, when they are opened, a quantity of fine white-coloured flowers of sulphur, which has been sublimed from the waters.\n\nThe heat of the water of the hottest spring, by Dr Lucas's account, raises the quicksilver of Fahrenheit's thermometer to $136^\\circ$\u2014by Mons. Monet's account, to $146^\\circ$\u2014and the heat of the fountain, where they commonly drink, by Dr Lucas's account, to $112^\\circ$.\n\nDr Simmons has given the following account of their several temperatures, as repeatedly observed by himself with a thermometer constructed by Nairne.\n\nThe spring which supplies the Emperor's Bath (Bain de l'Empereur), the New Bath (Bain Neuf), and the Queen of Hungary's Bath (Bain de la Reine de Hongrie),\n\n- St Quirin's Bath (Bain de St Quirin) - $127^\\circ$\n- The Rose bath (Bain de la Rose), and the Poor's Bath (Bain des Pauvres), both which are supplied by the same spring. - $112^\\circ$\n- Charles's Bath (Bain de Charles), and St Corneille's Bath (Bain de St Corneille). - $112^\\circ$\n\nThe spring used for drinking is in the High Street, opposite to Charles's Bath; the heat of it at the pump is - $106^\\circ$\n\nDr Lucas evaporated the water of the hottest spring (of the Emperor's Bath), and obtained 268 grains of solid matter from a gallon, composed of 15 grains of calcareous earth, 10 grains of selenites, and 243 grains of a saline matter made up of natron and sea-salt. They are at first nauseous and harsh, but by habit become familiar and agreeable. At first drinking, also, they generally affect the head. Their general operation is by stool and urine, without griping or diminution of strength; and they also promote perspiration.\n\nThe quantity to be drank, as an alternative is to be varied according to the constitution and other circumstances of the patient. In general, it is best to begin with a quarter or half a pint in the morning, and increase the dose afterwards to a pint, as may be found convenient. The water is best drank at the fountain. When it is required to purge, it should be drank in large and often repeated draughts.\n\nIn regard to bathing, this also must be determined by the age, sex, strength, &c. of the patient, and by the season. The degree of heat of the bath should likewise be considered. The tepid ones are in general the best, though there are some cases in which the hotter ones are most proper. But even in these, it is best to begin with the temperate baths, and increase the heat gradually.\n\nThese waters are efficacious in diseases proceeding from indigestion and from foulness of the stomach and bowels; in rheumatism; in the scurvy, scrophula, and diseases of the skin; in hysterical and hypochondriacal disorders; in nervous complaints and melancholy; in the stone and gravel; in paralytic complaints; in those evils which follow an injudicious use of mercury; and in many other cases.

He was one of the doctors of Trinity college in Cambridge; and he attended the earl of Essex as his chaplain in the expedition to Cadiz in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is said, that his first resolutions of changing his religion were occasioned by his seeing the pomp of the churches of the Roman communion, and the respect with which the priests seemed to be treated amongst them; and appearing thus to waver in his mind, he soon found persons who took advantage of this disposition of his, and of the complaints which he made of not being advanced according to his deserts in England, in such a manner, that he did not scruple to go over to the Popish religion, as soon as he found that there was no ground to hope for greater encouragement in his own country. However that matter be, he joined himself to the Romish communion, but was disappointed in his expectations. He was soon displeased at this; and he could not reconcile himself to the discipline of that church, which made no consideration of the degrees which he had taken before. It is probable too that he could not approve of the worship of creatures, which Protestants are used to look upon with horror. Upon this he returned to England, in order to resume his former religion. He obtained a prebend in the cathedral of St Paul, and after that the rectory of Therfield in Hertfordshire. He was well skilled in the Hebrew tongue; but he gave a wrong turn to his genius by studying the Cabala, with which he was strangely infatuated. He gave a proof of this in a sermon which he preached upon taking his degree of doctor of divinity at Cambridge. He took for his text the beginning of the first book of Chronicles, Adam, Seth, Enos; and having touched upon the literal sense, he turned immediately to the mystical, asserting, that Alabaster Adam signified misfortune and misery, and so of the rest. His verses were greatly esteemed. He wrote a Latin tragedy intitled Roxana; which, when it was acted in a college at Cambridge, was attended with a very remarkable accident. There was a lady who was so terrified at the last word of the tragedy, Sequar, Sequar, which was pronounced with a very shocking tone, that she lost her senses all her lifetime after.

These islands lie between N. Lat. 59\u00b0 47' and 60\u00b0 30', and between E. Long. 19\u00b0 17' and 22\u00b0 7'. Aland constitutes the smallest of the possessions belonging to the crown of Sweden. It contains about seventy-seven square English miles, and is in length about twenty English miles, and fifteen in breadth.\n\nAland has been supposed anciently to have been governed by its own monarchs; it is certain, however, that since the fourteenth century it has made part of the bishoprick and government of Abo, with the exception that in the year 1743 Aland and the other islands submitted to Ruffia, and swore allegiance to the czarina, but were soon after restored to Sweden by the treaty of Abo. These islands in former times frequently suffered from the invasions of the Ruffians, and the inhabitants had been forced to fly from their houses and fertile plains. But in 1718 a congress was held here for the restoration of peace, by which the enjoyment of tranquillity was secured to them.\n\nAland and the several isles contain eight parishes, each of which has a church; and besides these places of worship, there are seven chapels.\n\nThe Laplanders and Fins were undoubtedly the earliest inhabitants of these islands, and their residence here is plainly to be traced in the names of places which still remain.\n\nSeveral lakes are met with in these islands, and but one rivulet, which however is sufficient to work two mills, one of which is a saw-mill. The mountains are numerous; the highest of them is called Ulfdubs Klint.\n\nThe revenues which the crown of Sweden receives from Aland and the other islands, amount annually to nineteen thousand nine hundred and eighty-five rix-dollars. Two hundred and ninety-eight fallers are registered in these islands, which cost the king of Sweden about five thousand rix-dollars yearly.\n\nAland contains about three thousand seven hundred and fifty acres of land in cultivation, which produce rye, wheat, oats, and barley, in the proportion of seven for one. The annual growth of wheat is about twenty-two thousand five hundred barrels. There is one parish, which has no arable land, and in this respect resembles Lapland. The inhabitants of this parish employ themselves in fishing, and purchase all the corn they have occasion for of their neighbours. They catch vast numbers of pilchards, of which they make great profit, it being the chief traffic of these islands.\n\nIt has been in agitation to build a city in the isle of Aland, but the project has not hitherto been carried into execution, owing it is said, to the difficulty of choosing a proper spot for it.\n\nThe usual route from Sweden to Finland is from the post office of Grillehamn in Uppland, which is eleven and a half Swedish miles, to Eckero in Aland; and from that place across the island to Abo, which is five miles more. A Swedish mile makes between six and seven English miles.\n\nIn the year 1792 the number of inhabitants upon the island of Aland amounted to eleven thousand two hundred and sixty, which is upwards of a thousand to every square Swedish mile; a very great number when it is considered how mountainous the island is. The inhabitants of these islands live to very great ages. From the year 1692 to the present time, nine persons are recorded to have died at the great age of one hundred years; and perhaps the number had been found greater, had it been thought worthwhile to notice this particular. In 1703 there died a woman named Anna Berg, who was one hundred and nine years old; and at Kumlinge, in the year 1766, another person of the same sex died at an age of upwards of one hundred and twenty years. One fifth part of the inhabitants are above fifty years old;\nold; a circumstance which affords a convincing proof of the healthiness of the place.\n\nThe sea which surrounds the isle of Aland is very seldom frozen, and was less so formerly than at the present time. In 1546 it was remarked as an extraordinary event, that in that year the sea was so frozen as to be crossed on the ice. It seems latterly that these severe frosts happened once in ten years. The winter of the year 1702 was remarkably mild, so that barley was sown on the twenty-fifth of March, at which time there was plenty of pasture for cattle: considering its high latitude, Aland enjoys a very favourable climate.\n\nIn their manners and customs the inhabitants of Aland do not differ greatly from the peasants of Up-land. Their marriages and funerals are celebrated much in the same manner.\n\nThe Alanders commonly use nourishing food; their bread is generally made of rye, even when the crops of that kind of corn have proved unfavourable. Fresh fish, and fish dried or salted, together with milk, butter, cheese, and flesh-meat, are their usual fare. They make use of the flesh of seals, and prepare a dish called *fiskbroppa*, composed of collops of the flesh mixed up with flour and lard, and this they reckon excellent. In their voyages by sea they lay in a good stock of provisions, and at those times are not sparing of meat and butter.\n\nThe dress of the Alanders is becoming. The men wear, in general, short jackets which on holidays are commonly of blue cloth. The young peasants commonly wear cotton stockings, and many of them have even watches. The women, when full dressed, wear a petticoat and apron of camlet, cotton, or printed linen, and sometimes of silk. Their dress in mourning is generally of black silk, with a camlet petticoat.\n\nThe dwellings of the peasants are very neat and convenient, kept in good repair, and well lighted. They are usually built of wood, fir, or deal, and covered with the bark of the birch tree, or shingles. Their out-houses are mostly thatched. As they have no running streams and water-mills, scarcely any peasant is without a windmill.\n\nThe Alanders are an ingenious, lively, and courteous people; and on the sea display a great degree of skill and resolution. They are far from being superstitious, but are said to be of a litigious disposition.\n\nNo bears or squirrels are to be found in these islands; and the elk, which formerly was uncommonly numerous, is now no longer seen in them. The animals chiefly found are wolves, (which are said to cross the sea from Finland, when it has happened to be frozen over) foxes, martens, hares, ermines, bats, moles, rats, mice, &c.; otters are but rarely met with: on the coast are found seals, &c. Above a hundred species of birds are found in the islands. Fish are in great abundance.

The labourer draws his plough, the weaver handles his shuttle, the joiner his plane; and these different characters, seated in cars richly ornamented, commence the procession, and precede the standard of Mahomet, when it is brought out of the feraglio to be carried to the army, in order to insure victory to the Ottoman troops.\n\n\"This banner of the Turks, which they name Sandjak-Cherif, or The Standard of the Prophet, is so revered among them, that notwithstanding its reputation has been so often tarnished, it still retains their implicit confidence, and is the sacred signal unto which they rally. Every thing proclaims its sanctity. None but the emirs are allowed to touch it; they are its guards, and it is carried by their chief. The Muslims alone are permitted to look upon it. If touched by other hands, it would be defiled; if seen by other eyes, profaned. In short, it is encompassed by the most barbarous fanaticism.\n\n\"A long peace had unfortunately caused the ridiculousness, and especially the danger, of this ceremony to be forgotten. The Christians imprudently crowded to see it; and the Turks, who, by the situation of their houses, could make money of their windows, began to profit by the advantage; when an emir, who preceded the banner, proclaimed with a loud voice,\n\n'Let no infidel dare to profane with his presence the holy standard of the prophet; and let every Mussulman who perceives an unbeliever make it known under pain of reprobation.'\n\n\"From that moment no asylum was to be found; even those became informers, who, by letting out their houses, had rendered themselves accomplices in the crime. A religious fury seized on every mind, and put arms in every hand; the more atrocious the cruelty, the more was it meritorious.

Perseus king of Macedon terminated his wretched career in this confinement, with his son, the last hope of an illustrious line of kings. Syphax the Numidian, and Bithynius king of the Avernii, were also condemned to this gaol by the particular clemency of the senate, which sometimes indulged its savage disposition by putting its captives to death.\n\nAlba being situated in the centre of Italy, amidst difficult mountainous passes, and far from all means of escape, was esteemed a most proper place for the purpose of guarding prisoners of importance. Artificial strength was added to its natural security by fortifications, which remain to this day in a state that proves their ancient solidity.

He was born at Verulam, and flourished towards the end of the third century. In his youth he took a journey to Rome, in company with Amphibalus a monk of Caerleon, and served seven years as a soldier under the emperor Diocletian. At his return home, he settled in Verulam; and, through the example and instructions of Amphibalus, renounced the errors of Paganism, in which he had been educated, and became a convert to the Christian religion. It is generally agreed, that Alban suffered martyrdom during the great persecution under the reign of Diocletian; but authors differ as to the year when it happened: Bede and others fix it in 286; some refer it to the year 296; but Usher reckons it amongst the events of 303. The story and circumstances relating to his martyrdom, according to Bede, are as follows. Being yet a Pagan (or at least it not being known that he was a Christian), he entertained Amphibalus in his house. The Roman governor being informed thereof, sent a party of soldiers to apprehend Amphibalus; but Alban, putting on the habit of his guest, presented himself in his stead, and was carried before that magistrate. The governor having asked him of what family he was? Alban replied, \"To what purpose do you inquire of my family? if you would know my religion, I am a Christian.\" Then being asked his name, he answered, \"My name is Alban; and I worship the only true and living God, who created all things.\" The magistrate replied, \"If you would enjoy the happiness of eternal life, delay not to sacrifice to the great gods.\" Alban answered, \"The sacrifices you offer are made to devils; neither can they help the needy, or grant the petitions of their votaries.\" His behaviour so enraged the governor, that he ordered him immediately to be beheaded. In his way to execution, he was stopped by a river, over which was a bridge so thronged with spectators that it was impossible to cross it; the saint, as we are told, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and the stream was miraculously divided, and afforded a passage for himself and a thousand more persons. Bede does not indeed give us the name of this river; but, notwithstanding this omission, the miracle, we suppose, will not be the least believed. This wonderful event converted the executioner upon the spot, who threw away his drawn sword, and, falling at St Alban's feet, desired he might have the honour to die with him. This sudden conversion of the headman occasioning a delay in the execution till another person could be got to perform the office, St Alban walked up to a neighbouring hill, where he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and a fountain of water sprung up under his feet; here he was beheaded, on the 23rd of June. The executioner is said to have been a signal example of divine vengeance; for as soon as he gave the fatal stroke, his eyes dropt out of his head. We may see the opinion on Mr Milton in regard to this narrative, in his History of England. His words are these, speaking of St Alban: \"The story of whose martyrdom, foiled and worse martyred with the fabling zeal of some idle fancies, more fond of miracles than apprehensive of the truth, deserves no longer digression.\" Between 400 and 500 years after St Alban's death, Offa, king of the Mercians, built a very large and stately monastery to his memory; and the town of St Albans in Hertfordshire takes its name from our protomartyr.","sp":180,"ep":180},{"h":"ALBANA","t":"in Ancient Geography, a sea-port town of Albania, on the Calpian sea, between the rivers Catus and Albanus; now called Bachu, or Bachy, giving name to the Calpian sea, viz.

His father was a silk merchant, and intended to bring up his son to that business; but Albani having a strong inclination to painting, when his father died, devoted himself entirely to that art, though then but twelve years of age. He first studied under Denys Calvert; Guido Rheni being at the same time under this master, with whom Albani contracted a very great friendship. Calvert drew but one profile for Albani, and afterwards left him entirely to the care of Guido; under whom he made great improvement, his fellow-disciple instructing him with the utmost humanity and good humour. He followed Guido to the school of the Caracci; but a little after their friendship for each other began to cool; which was owing perhaps to the pride of Albani, who could not bear to see Guido surpass him, or to the jealousy of Guido at finding Albani make such rapid progress. They certainly endeavoured to eclipse one another; for when Guido had let up a beautiful altar-piece, Albani would oppose to it some fine picture of his; thus did they behave for some time, and yet spoke of each other with the highest esteem. Albani, after having greatly improved himself under the Caracci, went to Rome, where he continued many years, and married in that city; but his wife dying in childbed, at the earnest request of his relations he returned to Bologna, where he entered again into the state of matrimony. His second wife (Doralice) was well defended, but had very little fortune; which he perfectly disregarded, so strongly was he captivated by her beauty and good sense. Albani, besides the satisfaction of possessing an accomplished wife, reaped likewise the advantage of having a most beautiful model; so that he had now no occasion to make use of any other woman to paint a Venus, the Graces, Nymphs, and other deities, whom he took a particular delight in representing. His wife answered this purpose admirably well; for besides her bloom of youth, and the beauty of her person, he discovered in her so much modesty, so many graces and perfections, so well adapted to painting, that it was impossible for him to meet with a more refined woman. She afterwards brought him several boys, all extremely beautiful and finely proportioned; so that she and her children were the originals of his most agreeable and graceful compositions. Doralice was so conformable to his intentions, that she took a pleasure in setting the children in different attitudes, holding them naked, and sometimes suspended by strings, when Albani would draw them in a thousand different ways. It was from them, too, that the famous sculptors Flamand and Argaldi modelled their little Cupids.\n\nAlbani was of a happy temper and disposition; his paintings, says Malvasia, breathing nothing but content and joy. Happy in a force of mind that conquered every uneasiness, his poetical pencil carried him through the most agreeable gardens to Paphos and Cythera; those delightful scenes brought him over the lofty Parnassus to the delicious abodes of Apollo and the Muses; whence what Du Fresnoy says of the famous Giulio Romano may be justly applied to Albani:\n\nTaught from a child in the bright Muses' grots,\nHe open'd all the treasures of Parnassus,\nAnd in the lovely poetry of painting\nThe mysteries of Apollo has reveal'd.\n\nHe died the 4th of October 1660, to the great grief of all his friends and the whole city of Bologna. Malvasia has preserved some verses of Francifco de Leme, intended for his monument; the sense whereof is,\n\n\"That the mortal remains of the illustrious Albani, he who gave life to shade, lie interred in this tomb; the earth never produced so wonderful an artist, or a hand equal to his immortal one; which gave colours to the soul, and a soul to colours.

He is said to have acted as a man-midwife; and some have been highly offended that one of his profession should follow such an employment. A book entitled *De Natura Rerum*, of which he was reputed the author, gave rise to this report. In this treatise there are several instructions for midwives, and so much skill shown in their art, that one would think the author could not have arrived at it without having himself practised: but the advocates for Albert say he was not the writer thereof, nor of that other piece *De Secretis Mulierum*; in which there are many phrases and expressions unavoidable on such a subject, which gave great offence, and raised a clamour against the supposed author. It must be acknowledged, however, that there are, in his Comment upon the Matter of Sentences, some questions concerning the practice of conjugal duty, in which he has used some words rather too gross for chaste and delicate ears; but they allege what he himself used to say in his own vindication, that he came to the knowledge of so many monstrous things at confession, that it was impossible to avoid touching upon such questions. Albert was certainly a man of a most curious and inquisitive turn of mind, which gave rise to other accusations brought against him. It is said, that he laboured to find out the philosopher's stone; that he was a magician; and that he made a machine in the shape of a man, which was an oracle to him, and explained all the difficulties he proposed. He had great knowledge in the mathematics, and by his skill in that science might probably have formed a head with springs capable of articulating sounds; like to the machines of Boetius, of which Caiusdorus has said, \"Metals lowe; the birds of Diomedes trumpet in brafs; the brazen serpent hisses; counterfeited swallows chatter, and such as have no proper note, from brafs send forth harmonious music.\" John Matthaeus de Luna, in his treatise *De Rerum Inventoribus*, has attributed the invention of fire-arms to Albert; but in this he is confuted by Naude, in his *Apologie des Grandes Hommes*.

The cathedral is dedicated to St Cecilia, and has one of the finest choirs in the kingdom. Here is a very valuable silver shrine, of exquisite workmanship, of the mosaic kind: it contains the relics of St Clair, the first bishop of this city. The chapel of this pretended saint is magnificent, and adorned with paintings. The Lice is a fine large walk without the city: what distinguishes this from all others, is a terrace above\nAlbigenses, above a deep mall, which serves instead of a fossa; it is bordered with two rows of very fine trees, which are kept in excellent order.

These wines are the only fort hereabouts that are fit for exportation: they are carried down to Bordeaux, and generally sold to the British. They have likewise several coal mines.","sp":183,"ep":184},{"h":"ALBIGENSES","t":"in Church History, a sect or party of reformers, about Toulouse and the Albigeois in Languedoc, who sprung up in the 12th century, and distinguished themselves by their opposition to the discipline and ceremonies of the Roman church.\n\nThis fact had their name, it is supposed, either by reason there were great numbers of them in the diocese of Albi, or because they were condemned by a council held in that city. In effect, it does not appear that they were known by this name before the holding of that council. The Albigenses were also called Albani, Albigeosi, Albi, and Albanenses, though some distinguish these last from them. Other names given to them are, Henricians, Abelardists, Bulgarians, &c.; some on account of the qualities they assumed; others on that of the country from whence it is pretended they were derived; and others on account of persons of note who adopted their cause, as Peter de Bruis, Arnold de Bresse, Abelard, Henry, &c., Berengarius, if not Wickliff himself, is by some ranked in the number. The Albigenses are frequently confounded with the Waldenses; from whom, however, they differ in many respects, both as being prior to them in point of time, as having their origin in a different country, and as being charged with divers heresies, particularly Manicheism, from whence the Waldenses are exempt. But several Protestant writers have vindicated them from that imputation. Dr Allix shows that a great number of Manichaeans did spread over the western countries from Bulgaria; and settled in Italy, Languedoc, and other places, where they were also Albigenses; by which means, being both under the imputation of heresy, they came, either by ignorance or malice, to be confounded, and called by the same common name, though in reality entirely different.\n\nOther errors imputed to them by their opponents, the monks of those days, were, That they admitted two Christs; one evil, who appeared on earth; the other good, who has not yet appeared: That they denied the resurrection of the body; and maintained human souls to be demons imprisoned in our bodies, by way of punishment for their sins: That they condemned all the sacraments of the church; rejected baptism as useless; held the eucharist in abhorrence; excluded the use of confessions and penance; maintained marriage unlawful; laughed at purgatory; prayers for Albigenses, the dead, images, crucifixes, &c. There were likewise said to be two classes of them; the Perfect, and the Believers. The perfect boasted of their living in continence, of eating neither flesh, eggs, nor cheese. The believers lived like other men, and were even loose in their morals; but they were persuaded they should be saved by the faith of the perfect, and that none were damned who received imposition of hands from them. But from these charges also they are generally acquitted by Protestants; who consider them as the pious inventions of the Romish church, whose members deem it meritorious by any means to blacken heretics.\n\nHowever this be, the Albigenses grew so formidable, that the Catholics agreed upon a holy league or crusade against them. They were at first supported by Raymond, count of Toulouse. Pope Innocent III, furious to put a stop to their progress, sent a legate into their country; which failing, he stirred up Philip Augustus, king of France, and the other princes and great men of the kingdom, to make war upon them. Upon this the count of Toulouse, who had sided with them, made his submission to the pope, and went over to the Catholics; but soon after, finding himself plundered by the crusades, he declared war against them, and was joined by the king of Arragon. His army was defeated at the siege of Muret, where he himself was killed, and the defeat followed by the surrender of the city of Toulouse, and the conquest of the greatest part of Languedoc and Provence. His son Raymond succeeded him; who agreed with the king and the pope to set up the inquisition in his estates, and to extirpate the Albigenses. In an assembly held at Milan, the archbishop of Toulouse drew up articles agreeable to which the count made a most ample declaration against them, which he published at Toulouse in 1253. From this time the Albigenses dwindled by little and little, till the time of the Reformation; when such of them as were left fell in with the Vaudois, and became conformable to the doctrine of Zuinglius and the discipline of Geneva.\n\nALBIGENSES is also a name sometimes given to the followers of Peter Vaud, or Waldo; and hence synonymous with what we more properly call Waldenses, or Poor Men of Lyons. In this sense the word is applied by Camaratus, Thuanus, and several other writers. The reason seems to be, that the two parties agreed in their opposition to the papal innovations and encroachments, though in divers other respects said to be different enough. The bishop of Meaux labours hard to support a distinction between the two sects, alleging that the Albigenses were heretics and Manichaeans; whereas the Waldenses were only schismatics, not heretics; being found as to articles of faith, and only separating from the church of Rome on account of forms and discipline. Dr Allix endeavours to set aside the distinction: and shows, that both of them hold the same opinions, and were equally condemned and held for heretics; and this not for points of faith, but for declaring against the papal tyranny and idolatry, and holding the pope to be the Antichrist; which last, according to M. de Meaux, constitutes nothing less than Manicheism. In this sense the Lollards and Wickliffites in England were not only Albigenses but Manichaeans.","sp":184,"ep":184},{"h":"ALBINI","t":"in Antiquity, the workmen employed in what was called Opus Albarium.

They at a distance might be taken for Europeans; but, when you come near them, their white colour appears like that of persons affected with a leprosy.\n\nIn Saufure's Voyages dans les Alpes, is the following account of two boys, at Chamouni, who have been called Albinos. \"The elder, who was at the end of the year 1785 about twenty, or one-and-twenty years of age, had a dull look, with lips somewhat thick, but nothing else in his features to distinguish him from other people. The other, who is two years younger, is rather a more agreeable figure; he is gay and sprightly, and seems not to want wit. But their eyes are not blue; the iris is of a very distinct rose colour; the pupil too, when viewed in the light, seems decidedly red; which seems to demonstrate, that the interior membranes are deprived of the uvea, and of that black mucous matter that should line them. Their hair, their eye-brows, and eye-lashes, the down upon their skin, were all, in their infancy, of the most perfect milk-white colour, and very fine; but their hair is now of a reddish cast, and has grown pretty strong. Their sight too is somewhat strengthened; though they exaggerate to strangers their aversion for the light, and half shut the eye-lids, to give themselves a more extraordinary appearance. But those who, like me, have seen them in their infancy, before they were tutored to this deceit, and when too few people came to Chamouni to make this affectation profitable to them, can attest that then they were not very much offended with the light of day. At that time they were so little desirous of exciting the curiosity of strangers, that they hid themselves to avoid such; and it was necessary to do a sort of violence to them before they could be prevailed on to allow themselves to be inspected. It is also well known at Chamouni, that when they were of a proper age they were unable to tend the cattle like the other children at the same age; and that one of their uncles maintained them out of charity, at a time of life when others were capable of gaining a subsistence by their labour.\n\n\"I am therefore of opinion, that we may consider these two lads as true albinos; for if they have not the thick lips and flat noses of the white negroes, it is because they are albinos of Europe, not of Africa. This albinism affects the eyes, the complexion, and the colour of the hair; it even diminishes the strength, but does not alter the conformation of the features. Besides, there are certainly in this malady various degrees; some may have less strength, and be less able to endure the light: but these circumstances in those of Chamouni are marked with characters sufficiently strong to entitle them to the unhappy advantage of being clasped with that variety of the human species denominated albinos.\n\n\"When nature presents the same appearance often, and with circumstances varied, we may at last discover some general law, or some relation which that appearance has with known causes: but when a fact is so singular and so rare, as that of those albinos, it gives but little scope to conjecture: and it is very difficult to verify those by which we attempt to explain it.\n\n\"I at first imagined that this disease might be referred to a particular sort of organic debility; that a relaxation of the lymphatic vessels within the eye might suffer the globules of the blood to enter too abundantly into the iris, the uvea, and even into the retina, which might occasion the redness of the iris and of the pupil. The same debility seemed also to account for the intolerance of the light, and for the whiteness of the hair.\n\n\"But a learned physiologist, M. Blumenbach, professor in the university at G\u00f6ttingen, who has made many profound observations on the organs of sight, and has considered with great attention the albinos of Chamouni, attributes their infirmity to a different cause.\n\n\"The study of comparative anatomy has furnished him with frequent opportunities of observing this phenomenon; he has found it in brutes, in white dogs, and in owls; he says, it is generally to be seen in the warm-blooded animals; but that he has never met with it in those with cold blood.\n\n\"From his observations, he is of opinion, that the redness of the iris, and of the other internal parts of the eye, as well as the extreme sensibility that accompanies this redness, is owing to the total privation of that brown or blackish mucus, which, about the fifth week after conception, covers all the interior parts of the eye in its sound state. He observes, that Simon Pontius, in his treatise de Coloribus Oculorum, long ago remarked, that in blue eyes the interior membranes were less abundantly provided with this black mucus, and were therefore more sensible to the action of light. This sensibility of blue eyes agrees very well, says M. Blumenbach, with northern people, during their long twilight; while, on the contrary, the deep black in the eyes of negroes enables them to support the splendour of the sunbeams in the torrid zone.\n\n\"As to the connexion between this red colour of the eyes and the whiteness of the skin and hair, the same learned physiologist says, that it is owing to a similarity of structure, confusus ex similitudine fatriciae. He affirms, that this black mucus is formed only in the delicate cellular substance, which has numerous blood-vessels contiguous to it, but contains no fat; like the inside of the eye, the skin of negroes, the spotted palate of several domestic animals, &c. And, lastly, he says,\"\nAlbinos says, that the colour of the hair generally corresponds with that of the iris. *Gazette litt. de Gottingue*, Oct. 1784.\n\n\"At the very time that M. Blumenbach was reading this memoir to the Royal Society of Gottingen, M. Buzzi, surgeon to the hospital at Milan, an eleve of the celebrated anatomist Moscati, published in the *Opuscoli Scelti de Milan*, 1784, tom. vii. p. 11, a very interesting memoir, in which he demonstrates by dissection what Blumenbach had only supposed.\n\n\"A peasant of about 30 years of age died in the hospital of Milan of a pulmonary disorder. His body, being exposed to view, was exceedingly remarkable by the uncommon whiteness of the skin, of the hair, of the beard, and of all the other covered parts of the body. M. Buzzi, who had long desired an opportunity of dissecting such a subject, immediately seized upon this. He found the iris of the eyes perfectly white, and the pupil of a rose colour. The eyes were dissected with the greatest possible care, and were found entirely destitute of that black membrane which anatomists call the *uvea*: it was not to be seen either behind the iris or under the retina. Within the eye there was only found the choroid coat extremely thin, and tinged of a pale red colour, by vessels filled with discoloured blood. What was more extraordinary, the skin, when detached from different parts of the body, seemed almost entirely deprived of the *rete mucosum*: maceration did not discover the least vestige of this, not even in the wrinkles of the abdomen, where it is most abundant and most visible.\n\n\"M. Buzzi likewise accounts for the whiteness of the skin and of the hair, from the absence of the *rete mucosum*, which, according to him, gives the colour to the cuticle, and to the hairs that are scattered over it. Among other proofs of this opinion, he alleges a well-known fact, that if the skin of the blackest horse be accidentally destroyed in any part of the body, the hairs that afterwards grow on that part are always white, because the *rete mucosum* which tinges those hairs is never regenerated with the skin.\n\n\"The proximate cause of the whiteness of albinos, and the colour of their eyes, seems therefore pretty evidently to depend on the absence of the *rete mucosum*: But what is the remote cause?\n\n\"In the first place, it seems probable that men affected with this infirmity form no distinct species, for they are produced from parents that have dark skins and black eyes. What is it then that destroys the *rete mucosum* in such persons? M. Buzzi relates a singular fact, which seems to throw some light on this subject.\n\n\"A woman of Milan, named Calcagni, had seven sons. The two eldest had brown hair, and black eyes; the three next had white skins, white hair, and red eyes; the two last resembled the two eldest. It was said that this woman, during the three pregnancies that produced the albinos, had a continual and immoderate appetite for milk, which she took in great quantities: but that when she was with child of the other four children, she had no such desire. It is not however ascertained, that this supernatural appetite was not itself the effect of a certain heat, or internal disease, which destroyed the *rete mucosum* in the children before they were born.\n\n\"The albinos of Chamouni are also the offspring of albinos' parents with dark skins and black eyes. They have three sisters by the same father and mother, who are also brunettes. One of them that I saw had the eyes of a dark brown, and the hair almost black. They are said, however, to be all afflicted with a weakness of sight. When the lads are married, it will be curious to observe how the eyes of their children will be formed. The experiment would be particularly decisive if they were married to women like themselves. But this faulty conformation seems to be more rare among women than among men; for the four of Milan, the two of Chamouni, the one described by Maupeuis, the one by Helvetius, and almost all the instances of these singular productions, have been of our sex. It is known, however, that there are races of men and women affected with this disease, and that these races perpetuate themselves in Guinea, in Java, at Panama, &c.\n\n\"Upon the whole, this degeneration does not seem to be owing to the air of the mountains; for though I have traversed the greatest part of the Alps, and the other mountains of Europe, these are the only individuals of the kind that ever I met with.\"","sp":185,"ep":186},{"h":"ALBINOVANUS","t":"a Latin poet, whom Ovid surmised the Divine.

His father was then professor of the practice of medicine in the university of Frankfort; but in the year 1702 he repaired to Leyden, being nominated professor of anatomy and surgery in that university. Here his son had an opportunity of studying under the most eminent masters in Europe, who, from the singular abilities which he then displayed, had no difficulty in prognosticating his future eminence. But while he was distinguished in every branch of literature, his attention was particularly turned to anatomy and surgery. His peculiar attachment to these branches of knowledge gained him the intimate friendship of Ruysh and Rau, who at that time flourished in Leyden; and the latter, so justly celebrated as a lithotomist, is said to have seldom performed a capital operation without inviting him to be present. Having finished his studies at Leyden, he went to Paris, where he attended the lectures of Du Verney, Vaillant, and other celebrated professors. But he had scarce spent a year there, when he was invited by the curators of the university of Leyden, to be a lecturer in anatomy and surgery at that place. Though contrary to his own inclination, he complied with their request, and upon that occasion was created doctor of physic without any examination. Soon after, upon the death of his father, he was appointed to succeed him as professor of anatomy; and upon being admitted into that office on the 9th of November 1721, he delivered an oration, *De vera via ad fabriec humani corporis cognitionem ducente*; which was heard with universal approbation. In the capacity of a professor, he not only bestowed the greatest attention upon the instruction of the youth entrusted to his care, but in the improvement of the medical art. With this view, he published many important discoveries of his own; and by\nby elegant editions, turned the attention of physicians to works of merit, which might otherwise have been neglected. By these means his fame was soon extended over Europe; and the societies of London, Peterburgh, and Haarlem, cheerfully received him as an associate. In 1745, he was appointed professor of the practice of medicine at Leyden, and was succeeded in the anatomical chair by his brother Frid. Bern. Albinius. He was twice rector of the university, and as often he refused that high honour when it was voluntarily offered him.

This was built in the time of the emperor Trajan, as appears by an inscription over one of the arches, by the people of Lusitania, who were obliged to supply the expense. It is raised 200 feet above the level of the water; and though it consists but of six arches, is 670 feet in length, and 23 in breadth. At the entrance of the bridge, there is a small antique chapel hewn in a rock by the ancient Pagans, who dedicated it to Trajan, as the Christians did to St Julian. This city was built by the Moors, on account of the convenience of this bridge; which is at a place where the Tajo is very deep, running between two high steep rocks: for this reason they called it Al-Cantara, which in their language, signifies the Bridge. It was taken from them in 1214, and given to the knights of Calatrava, who afterwards assumed the name of Alcantara. It was taken by the earl of Galway, in April, 1706, and retaken by the French in November following. It is 45 miles from Madrid, and 125 from Seville. W. Long. 7\u00b0 12'. N.

But the former soon released themselves from this engagement, on pretence that their grand-master had not been called to the election of that of Calatrava, as had been likewise stipulated in the articles. After the expulsion of the Moors, and the taking of Granada, the sovereignty of the order of Alcantara and that of Calatrava was settled in the crown of Castile by Ferdinand and Isabella.\u2014In 1548, the knights of Alcantara sued for leave to marry, which was granted them.","sp":189,"ep":189},{"h":"ALCAREZ","t":"a small city of La Mancha, in Spain defended by a pretty strong castle, and remarkable for an ancient aqueduct.

It was of great note, and the seat of the governor of this part of the kingdom. It was built by Jacob Almanzor, king of Fez, about the year 1180, and designed for a magazine and place of rendezvous for the great preparations he was making to enter Granada in Spain, and to make good the footing Joseph Almanzor had got some time before. It is said his father first invaded Spain with 300,000 men, most of whom he was obliged to bring back to Africa to quell a rebellion that had broken out in Morocco. This done, he returned to Spain again with an army, as is said, of 200,000 horse and 300,000 foot. The city is now fallen greatly to decay, so that of fifteen mosques there are only two that they make use of. The reason, probably, is the bad situation of the town; for it stands so low, that it is excessively hot in summer, and almost overflowed with water in the winter. They affirm to be owing to a curse of one of their saints. Here are a great number of flocks, who live very familiarly with the people, walking about the town, possessing the tops of the houses and mosques without molestation; for they esteem them sacred birds, and account it sinful to disturb them. At present, the batham of Tetuan appoints a governor to this town, which is the last of his dominions towards Mequinez. Near this city there is a high ridge of mountains, running towards Tetuan, whose inhabitants were never brought entirely under subjection; and whenever it was attempted, they revenged themselves by infesting the roads, and robbing and destroying the travellers. When they were pursued, they retired into their woody mountains, where none could safely follow them. Not far from hence is the river Elmahassen, famous for the battle fought between Don Sebastian king of Portugal and the Moors; in which the Portuguese were defeated and their king slain. W.

The levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue-officers sufficient to guard the transportation of goods, not only from one province to another, but from one shop to another. It subjects not only the dealers in some sorts of goods, but those in all sorts, every farmer, every manufacturer, every merchant and shopkeeper, to the continual visits and examination of the tax-gatherers. Through the greater part of a country in which a tax of this kind is established, nothing can be produced for distant sale. The produce of every part of the country must be proportioned to the consumption of the neighbourhood.

An alchemist puts into a crucible the matter which is to be converted into gold: this he sets on the fire, blows it, stirs it with rods; and, after divers operations, gold is found at the bottom of the crucible, instead of the matter first put in. This there are a thousand ways of effecting, without any transmutation. Sometimes it is done by dextrously dropping in a piece of gold concealed between the fingers, sometimes by casting in a little of the dust of gold or silver disguised under the appearance of some elixir, or other indifferent matter; sometimes a crucible is used which has a double bottom, and gold put between the two; sometimes the rod used to stir the matter is hollow, and filled with the dust of the metal desired; at other times there is metal mixed with the charcoal, the ashes of the furnace, or the like. Mr Harris very properly distinguishes alchemy from chemistry; and defines the former to be *ars sine arte*, cujus principium est mentiri, medium laborare, et finis mendicare; and the Italians have a proverb, *non ti fidare al alchemista povero o medico amato*. The ruin which has attended this delusion has occasioned several states to make severe laws against pretences to alchemy. The Romans formerly banished all such as professed it; and the sacred canons likewise directed the thunder of their censure against them. Diocletian and Caesar directed all books which treated of this subject to be burnt. Rymer furnishes us with a license for practising alchemy, with all kinds of metals and minerals, granted to one Richard Carter in 1476; Rymer, tom. xii. Nevertheless, we have had severe laws against alchemy, and multiplying of metals, as much so as against coinage itself.\n\n**Alchornea**.

He was present at an engagement, wherein the Athenians gained a victory over the Lebians; and here, as he himself is said to have confessed in one of his pieces, he threw down his arms, and saved himself by flight. Horace, who, of all the Latin poets, most resembled Alceus, has made the like confession:\n\nWith thee I saw Philippi's plain,\nIts fatal rout, a fearful scene!\nAnd dropp'd, alas! th' inglorious shield,\nWhere valour's self was forc'd to yield;\nWhere foil'd in dust the vanquish'd lay,\nAnd breath'd th' indignant soul away.

Hence Horace says,\n\nAlceus strikes the golden strings,\nAnd seas, and war, and exile, sings.\nThus while they strike the various lyre,\nThe ghosts the sacred sounds admire;\n\nBut when Alceus lifts the strain\nTo deeds of war and tyrants slain,\nIn thicker crowds the shadowy throng\nDrink deeper down the martial song.

Alcibiades, in the midst of an expedition he had planned against the enemies of his country, was recalled home to answer some charge of a private nature; but fearing the violence of his enemy, instead of going to Athens, he offered his services at Sparta, where they were readily accepted. By his advice the Macedonians made a league with Persia, which gave a very favourable turn to their affairs. But his credit in the republic raising jealousies against him, he privately reconciled himself to his country, and took again the command of an Athenian army. Here victory, waiting as it were at his command, attended all his motions. The loss of seven battles obliged the Spartans to sue for peace. He enjoyed his triumphs, however, only a short time at Athens. One unsuccessful event made him again obnoxious to the malice of his citizens; and he found it expedient to retire from Athens. In his absence the Spartans again took the lead, and at the fatal battle of Eges entirely subdued the Athenian power. Alcibiades, though an exile, endeavoured to restore the power of his country; of which the Spartans having intelligence, procured him to be assassinated.

But Camden and others tell us, that the nuns of that house were notorious for their incontinence, that King Henry VII. and Pope Julius II. consented to its dissolution: Bale accordingly calls this nunnery \"spiritualium meretricum cenobium,\" \"a community of spiritual harlots.\" Bishop Alcock wrote several pieces; among which are the following: 1.

The word is compounded of the Arabic particle al, and coran or koran, derived from the verb caraar or karaa, to read. The word therefore properly signifies, the reading; or rather, that which ought to be read. By this name the Mahometans denote not only the entire book or volume of the Koran, but also any particular chapter or section of it; just as the Jews call either the whole Scripture, or any part of it, by the name of Karab, or Mikra, words of the same origin and import.\n\nBesides this peculiar name, the Koran is also honoured with several appellations common to other books of Scripture: as, al Farqan, from the verb faraka, to divide or distinguish; not, as the Mahometan doctors say, because those books are divided into chapters or sections, or distinguish between good and evil; but in the same notion that the Jews use the word Perak, or Pirka, from the same root, to denote a section or portion of Scripture. It is also called al Mojsaf, the volume, and al Kitab, the book, by way of eminence, which answers to the Bibliia of the Greeks; and al Dhikr, the admonition, which name is also given to the Pentateuch and Gospel.\n\nThe Koran is divided into 114 larger portions of very unequal length, which we call chapters; but the Arabs jowar, in the singular jowa, a word rarely used on any other occasion, and properly signifying a row, order, or a regular series; as a course of bricks in building, or a rank of soldiers in an army; and is the same in use and import with the Sura, or Tora, of the Jews, who also call the fifty-three sections of the Pentateuch Sedarim, a word of the same signification.\n\nThese chapters are not, in the manuscript copies, distinguished by their numerical order, but by particular titles, which are taken sometimes from a particular matter treated of, or person mentioned therein; but usually from the first word of note, exactly in the same manner as the Jews have named their Sedarim; though the word from which some chapters are denominated be very far distant, towards the middle, or perhaps the end, of the chapter; which seems ridiculous. But the occasion of this appears to have been, that the verse or passage wherein such word occurs, was, in point of time, revealed and committed to writing before the other verses of the same chapter which proceed it in order; and the title being given to the chapter before it was completed, or the passages reduced to their present order, the verse from whence such title was taken did not always happen to begin the chapter. Some chapters have two or more titles, occasioned by the difference of the copies.\n\nSome of the chapters having been revealed at Mecca, and others at Medina, the noting this difference makes a part of the title: but the reader will observe, that several of the chapters are said to have been revealed partly at Mecca and partly at Medina; and, as to others, it is yet a dispute among the commentators to which of the two places they belong.\n\nEvery chapter is subdivided into smaller portions, of very unequal length also, which we customarily call verses: but the Arabic word is ayat, the same with the Hebrew ootot, and signifies signs or wonders: such as are the secrets of God, his attributes, works, judgments, and ordinances, delivered in those verses; many of which have their particular titles also, imprinted in the same manner as those of the chapters.\n\nBesides these unequal divisions of chapter and verse, the Mahometans have also divided their Koran into sixty equal portions, which they call Absaba, in the singular Hizb, each subdivided into four equal parts; which is also an imitation of the Jews, who have an ancient division of their Mishna into sixty portions called Mafsechoth. But the Koran is more usually divided into thirty sections only, named Ajza, from the singular Joz, each of twice the length of the former, and in the like manner subdivided into four parts. These divisions are for the use of the readers of the Koran in the royal temples, or in the adjoining chapels where the emperors and great men are interred. There are thirty of these readers belonging to every chapel, and each reads his section every day; so that the whole Koran is read over once a day.\n\nNext after the title, at the head of every chapter, except only the ninth, is prefixed the following solemn form, by the Mahometans called the Bismillah, In the name of the most Merciful God; which form they constantly place at the beginning of all their books and writings in general, as a peculiar mark or distinguishing characteristic of their religion, it being counted a sort of impiety to omit it. The Jews, for the same purpose, make use of the form, In the name of the Lord, or, In the name of the great God; and the eastern Christians that of, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. But Mahomet probably took this form, as he did many other things, from the Persian Magi, who used to begin their books in these words, Benam Yezdan bat jbnajfigher dadar; that is, In the name of the most merciful just God.\n\nThere are twenty-nine chapters of the Koran, which have this peculiarity, that they begin with certain letters of the alphabet, some with a single one, others with more. These letters the Mahometans believe to be the peculiar marks of the Koran, and to conceal several profound mysteries; the certain understanding of which, the more intelligent confess, has not been communicated to any mortal, their prophet only excepted. Notwithstanding which, some will take the liberty of guessing at their meaning by that species of Cabala called by the Jews Notarikon, and suppose the letters to stand for as many words, expressing the names and attributes of God, his works, ordinances, and decrees; and therefore these mysterious letters, as well as the verses,\nOthers explain the intent of these letters from their nature or organ, or else from their value in numbers, according to another species of the Jewish Cabala called Gematria; the uncertainty of which conjectures sufficiently appears from their disagreement. Thus, for example, five chapters, one of which is the second, begins with these letters, A, L, M, which some imagine to stand for Allah latif mazil, \"God is gracious and to be glorified;\" or, Ana li minni, i.e., to me and from me, viz. belongs all perfection, and proceeds all good; or else for Ana Allah alam, \"I am the most wise God,\" taking the first letter to mark the beginning of the first word, the second the middle of the second word, and the third the last of the third word; or for Allah, Gabriel, Mohammed, the author, revealer, and preacher of the Koran. Others say, that as the letter A belongs to the lower part of the throat, the first of the organs of speech; L to the palate; the middle organ; and M to the lips, which are the last organ; so these letters signify that God is the beginning, middle, and end, or ought to be praised in the beginning, middle, and end, of all our words and actions: or, as the total value of those three letters, in numbers is seventy-one, they signify, that, in the space of so many years, the religion preached in the Koran should be fully established. The conjecture of a learned Christian is at least as certain as any of the former, who supposes those letters were set there by the amanuensis, for Amar li Mohammed, i.e., at the command of Mohammed, as the five letters prefixed to the nineteenth chapter seem to be there written by a Jewish scribe, for Cob yaas, i.e., Thus be commanded.\n\nThe Koran is universally allowed to be written with the utmost elegance and purity of language, in the dialect of the tribe of Koreith, the most noble and polite of all the Arabians, but with some mixture, though very rarely, of other dialects. It is confessedly the standard of the Arabic tongue, and, as the more orthodox believe, and are taught by the book itself, imitable by any human pen (though some sectaries have been of another opinion), and therefore insisted on as a permanent miracle, greater than that of raising the dead, and alone sufficient to convince the world of its divine original.\n\nAnd to this miracle did Mahomet himself chiefly appeal for the confirmation of his mission, publicly challenging the most eloquent men in Arabia, which was at that time stocked with thousands whose sole study and ambition it was to excel in elegance of style and composition, to produce even a single chapter that might be compared with it (A).\n\nTo the pomp and harmony of expression some ascribe all the force and effect of the Alcoran; which they consider as a sort of music, equally fitted with other species of that art to ravish and amaze. In this Mahomet succeeded so well, and so strangely captivated the minds of his audience, that several of his opponents thought it the effect of witchcraft and enchantment, as he himself complains.\u2014Others have attributed the effect of the Alcoran to the frequent mention of rewards and punishments; heaven and hell occurring almost in every page. Some suppose, that the sensual pleasures of paradise, so frequently set before the imaginations of the readers of the Alcoran, were what chiefly bewitched them. Though, with regard to these, there is a great dispute whether they are to be understood literally or spiritually. Several have even allegorized the whole book.\n\nThe general design of the Koran was to unite the professors of the three different religions, then followed in the populous country of Arabia (who for the most part lived promiscuously, and wandered without guide), the far greater number being idolaters, and the rest Jews and Christians mostly of erroneous and heterodox belief), in the knowledge and worship of one God, under the sanction of certain laws, and the outward signs of ceremonies partly of ancient and partly of novel institution, enforced by the consideration of rewards and punishments both temporal and eternal; and to bring them all to the obedience of Mahomet, as the prophet and ambassador of God, who, after the repeated admonitions, promises, and threats, of former ages, was at last to establish and propagate God's religion on earth, and to be acknowledged chief pontiff in spiritual matters, as well as supreme prince in temporal.\n\nThe great doctrine then of the Koran, is the unity of God; to restore which point Mahomet pretended was the chief end of his mission; it being laid down by him as a fundamental truth, That there never was, nor ever can be, more than one true orthodox religion. For, though the particular laws or ceremonies are only temporary, and subject to alteration, according to the divine direction; yet the substance of it being eternal truth, is not liable to change, but continues immutably the same. And he taught, that, whenever this religion became neglected, or corrupted in essentials, God had the goodness to re-inform and re-admonish mankind thereof, by several prophets, of whom Moses and Jesus were the most distinguished, till the appearance of Mahomet, who is their head, and no other to be expected after him. The more effectually to engage people to hearken to him, great part of the Koran is employed in relating examples of dreadful punishments formerly inflicted by God on those who rejected and abused his messengers; several of which stories, or some circumstances of them, are taken from the Old and New Testaments, but many more from the apocryphal books and traditions of the Jews and Christians of those ages, set up in the Koran as truths in opposition to the Scriptures, which the Jews and Christians are charged with having altered: and indeed, few or none of the relations or circumstances in the Koran were invented by Mahomet, as is generally supposed, it being easy to trace the greatest part of them.\n\n(A) As the composition and arrangement of words, however, admit of infinite varieties, it can never be absolutely said that any one is the best possible. In fact, Hamzah Benhmed wrote a book against the Alcoran, with at least equal elegance; and Mofeema another, which even surpassed it, and occasioned a defection of a great part of the Mussulmans. Journ. de S\u00e7av. tom. xiii. p. 280. Oeuvr. de S\u00e7av. Nov. 1708, p. 494.\nthem much higher, as the rest might be, were more of those books extant, and was it worth while to make the inquiry.\n\nThe rest of the Alcoran is taken up in prescribing necessary laws and directions, frequent admonitions to moral and divine virtues, the worship and reverence of the Supreme Being, and resignation to his will. One of their most learned commentators distinguishes the contents of the Alcoran into allegorical and literal; under the former are comprehended all the obscure, parabolical, and enigmatical passages, with such as are repealed, or abrogated; the latter, such as are clear, and in full force.\n\nThe most excellent moral in the whole Alcoran, interpreters say, is that in the chapter Al Arafah, viz. \"Shew mercy, do good to all, and dispute not with the ignorant;\" or, as Mr Sale renders it, \"Use indulgence, command that which is just, and withdraw far from the ignorant.\" Mahomet, according to the authors of the Keshaf, having begged of the angel Gabriel a more ample explication of this passage, received it in the following terms: \"Seek him who turns thee out, give to him who takes from thee, pardon him who injures thee; for God will have you plant in your souls the roots of his chief perfections.\" It is easy to see that this commentary is copied from the gospel. In reality, the necessity of forgiving enemies, though frequently inculcated in the Alcoran, is of a later date, among the Mahometans than among the Christians; among those latter, than among the heathens; and to be traced originally among the Jews. (See Exodus xxxiii. 4-5.) But it matters not so much who had it first, as who observes it best. The caliph Haffan, son of Halli, being at table, a slave unfortunately let fall a dish of meat reeking hot, which scalded him severely. The slave fell on his knees, rehearsing the words of the Alcoran, \"Paradise is for those who restrain their anger.\" I am not angry with thee, answered the caliph.\u2014\"And for those who forgive offences against them,\" continues the slave. I forgive thee thine, replies the caliph.\u2014\"But above all, for those who return good for evil,\" adds the slave. I set thee at liberty, rejoined the caliph; and I give thee ten dinars.\n\nThere are also a great number of occasional passages in the Alcoran, relating only to particular emergencies. For this advantage Mahomet had in the piecemeal method of receiving his revelation, that whenever he happened to be perplexed and gravelled with any thing, he had a certain resource in some new morsel of revelation. It was an admirable contrivance of his, to bring down the whole Alcoran at once, only to the lowest heaven, not to earth; since, had the whole been published at once, innumerable objections would have been made, which it would have been impossible for him to solve; but as he received it by parcels, as God saw fit they should be published for the conversion and instruction of the people, he had a sure way to answer all emergencies, and to extricate himself with honour from any difficulty which might occur.\n\nIt is the general and orthodox belief among the Mahometans, that the Koran is of divine original; nay, that it is eternal and uncreated, remaining, as some express it, in the very essence of God: that the first transcript has been from everlasting by God's throne, written on a table of vast bignets, called the preserved table, in which are also recorded the divine decrees past and future: that a copy from this table, in one volume on paper, was by the ministry of the angel Gabriel sent down to the lowest heaven, in the month of Ramadan, on the night of power: from whence Gabriel revealed it to Mahomet by parcels, some at Mecca, and some at Medina, at different times, during the space of 23 years, as the exigencies of affairs required; giving him, however, the consolation to show him the whole (which they tell us was bound in silk, and adorned with gold and precious stones of paradise) once a-year; but in the last year of his life he had the favour to see it twice. They say, that few chapters were delivered entire, the most part being revealed piecemeal, and written down from time to time by the prophet's amanuensis in such a part of such and such a chapter, till they were completed, according to the directions of the angel. The first parcel that was revealed is generally agreed to have been the first five verses of the 96th chapter.\n\nAfter the new-revealed passages had been from the prophet's mouth taken down in writing by his scribe, they were published to his followers; several of whom took copies for their private use, but the far greater number got them by heart. The originals, when returned, were put promiscuously into a chest, observing no order of time; for which reason it is uncertain when many passages were revealed.\n\nWhen Mahomet died, he left his revelations in the same disorder, and not digested into the method, such as it is, in which we now find them. This was the work of his successor Abu Beer; who, considering that a great number of passages were committed to the memory of Mahomet's followers, many of whom were slain in their wars, ordered the whole to be collected, not only from the palm-leaves and skins on which they had been written, and which were kept between two boards or covers, but also from the mouths of such as had gotten them by heart. And this transcript, when completed, he committed to the custody of Hassa the daughter of Omar, one of the prophet's widows.\n\nFrom this relation it is generally imagined that Abu Beer was really the compiler of the Koran; though, for ought appears to the contrary, Mahomet left the chapters complete as we now have them, excepting such passages as his successor might add or correct from those who had gotten them by heart; what Abu Beer did else, being perhaps no more than to range the chapters in their present order, which he seems to have done without any regard to time, having generally placed the longest first.\n\nHowever, in the 30th year of the Hegira, Othman being then caliph, and observing the great disagreement in the copies of the Koran in the several provinces of the empire: those of Irak, for example, following the reading of Abu Musa al Ashari, and the Syrians that of Maccad Ebn Aswad; he, by the advice of the companions, ordered a great number of copies to be transcribed from that of Abu Beer, in Hassa's care, under the inspection of Zeid Ebn Thabet, Abd'allah Ebn Zobair, Said Ebn al As, and Abd'al-rahman Ebn al Harith the Makhzumite; whom he directed, that, wherever they disagreed about any word, they should write it in the dialect of the Ko-\nreith, in which it was at first delivered. These copies, when made, were dispersed in the several provinces of the empire, and the old ones burnt and superseded. Though many things in Hafiz's copy were corrected by the above-mentioned revilers, yet some few various readings still occur.\n\nIn fine, the book of the Alcoran is held in the highest esteem and reverence among the Musselmans. They dare not so much as touch the Alcoran without being first washed, or legally purified; to prevent which, an inscription is put on the cover or label, *Let none touch but they who are clean.* It is read with great care and respect; being never held below the girdle. They swear by it; take omens from it on all weighty occasions; carry it with them to war; write sentences of it in their banners; adorn it with gold and precious stones; and knowingly suffer it not to be in the possession of any of a different religion. Some say that it is punishable even with death, in a Christian, to touch it; others, that the veneration of the Musselmans leads them to condemn the translating it into any other language as a profanation: but these seem to be aggravations. The Mahometans have taken care to have their Scripture translated into the Persian, the Javanese, the Malayan, and other languages; though, out of respect to the original, these versions are generally, if not always, interlinedated.\n\nBy the advocates of Mahometanism, the Koran, as already observed, has always been held forth as the greatest of miracles, and equally stupendous with the act of raising the dead. The miracles of Moses and Jesus, they say, were transient and temporary; but that of the Koran is permanent and perpetual; and therefore far surpasses all the miraculous events of preceding ages. We will not detract from the real merit of the Koran: we allow it to be generally elegant, and often sublime; but at the same time we reject with disdain its arrogant pretence to anything supernatural; all the real excellence of the work being easily referable to natural and visible causes.\n\n\"In the language of Arabia, a language extremely loved and diligently cultivated by the people to whom it was vernacular, Mahomet found advantages which were never enjoyed by any former succeeding impostor. It requires not the eye of a philosopher to discover in every soil and country a principle of national pride: and if we look back for many ages on the history of the Arabians, we shall easily perceive that pride among them invariably to have consisted in the knowledge and improvement of their native language. The Arabic, which has been justly esteemed the most copious of the Eastern tongues; which had existed from the remotest antiquity; which had been embellished by numberless poets, and refined by the constant exercise of the natives; was the most successful instrument which Mahomet employed in planting his new religion among them. Admirably adapted by its unrivalled harmony, and by its endless variety to add painting to expression, and to pursue the imagination in its unbounded flight; it became in the hands of Mahomet an irresistible charm to blind the judgment, and to captivate the fancy of his followers.\n\n\"Of that description of men, who first composed the adherents of Mahomet, and to whom the Koran was addressed, few, probably, were able to pass a very accurate judgment on the propriety of the sentiments, or on the beauties of the diction: but all could judge of the military abilities of their leader; and in the midst of their admiration it is not difficult to conceive, that they would ascribe to his compositions every imaginary beauty of inspired language.\n\n\"The shepherd and the soldier, though awake to the charms of those wild but beautiful compositions, in which were celebrated their favourite occupations of love or war, were yet little able to criticise any other works than those which were addressed to the imagination or the heart. To abstract reasonings on the attributes and the dispensations of the Deity, to the comparative excellencies of rival religions, to the consistency of any one religious system in all its parts, and to the force of its various proofs, they were quite insentient. In such a situation, the appearance of a work which possessed something like wisdom and confidence; which prescribed the rules, and illustrated the duties of life; and which contained the principles of a new and comparatively sublime theology, independently of its real and permanent merit, was likely to excite their astonishment, and to become the standard of future composition.\n\n\"In the first periods of the literature of every country, something of this kind has happened. The father of Grecian poetry very obviously influenced the taste and imitation of his countrymen. The modern nations of Europe all possess some original author, who, rising from the darkness of former ages, has begun the career of composition, and tinctured with the character of his own imagination the stream which has flowed through his posterity.\n\n\"But the prophet of Arabia had in this respect advantages peculiar to himself. His compositions were not to his followers the works of man, but the genuine language of Heaven, which had sent him. They were not confined therefore to that admiration which is so liberally bestowed on the earliest productions of genius, or to that fond attachment with which men everywhere regard the original compositions of their country: but with their admiration they blended their piety. To know and to feel the beauties of the Koran, was in some respect to share in the temper of heaven; and he who was most affected with admiration in the perusal of its beauties, seemed most fitly the object of that mercy which had given it to ignorant man. The Koran, therefore, became naturally and necessarily the standard of taste. With a language thus hallowed in their imaginations, they were too well satisfied, either to dispute its elegance or improve its structure. In succeeding ages, the additional sanction of antiquity, or prescription, was given to these compositions which their fathers had admired: and while the belief of its divine original continues, that admiration, which has thus become the test and the duty of the faithful, can neither be altered nor diminished.\n\n\"When therefore we consider these peculiar advantages of the Koran, we have no reason to be surprized at the admiration in which it is held. But if, descending to a more minute investigation of it, we consider its perpetual inconsistence and absurdity, we shall indeed have cause for astonishment at that weakness of humanity which could ever have received such compositions as the work of the Deity.\"\nThe first praise of all the productions of genius, is invention; that quality of the mind, which, by the extent and quickness of its views, is capable of the largest conceptions, and of forming new combinations of objects the most distant and unusual. But the Koran bears little impression of this transcendent character. Its materials are wholly borrowed from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, from the Talmudical legends and apocryphal gospels then current in the East, and from the traditions and fables which abounded in Arabia. The materials collected from these several sources are here heaped together, with perpetual and needless repetitions, without any settled principle or visible connection.\n\nWhen a great part of the life of Mahomet had been spent in preparatory meditation on the system he was about to establish, its chapters were dealt out slowly and separately during the long period of 23 years. Yet thus defective in its structure, and not less exceptionable in its doctrines, was the work which Mahomet delivered to his followers as the oracles of God.\n\nThe most prominent feature of the Koran, that point of excellence in which the partiality of its admirers has ever delighted to view it, is the sublime notion it generally imparts of the nature and attributes of God. If its author had really derived these just conceptions from the inspiration of that Being whom they attempt to describe, they would not have been surrounded, as they now are on every side, with error and absurdity. But it might easily be proved, that whatever it justly defines of the divine attributes, was borrowed from our Holy Scripture; which even from its first promulgation, but especially from the completion of the New Testament, has extended the views and enlightened the understandings of mankind; and thus furnished them with arms, which have too often, though ineffectually, been turned against itself by its ungenerous enemies.\n\nIn this instance particularly, the copy is far below the great original, both in the propriety of its images, and the force of its descriptions. Our Holy Scriptures are the only compositions that can enable the dim light of mortality to penetrate into the invisible world, and to behold a glimpse of the Divine perfections. Accordingly, when they would represent to us the happiness of Heaven, they describe it, not by anything minute and particular, but by something general and great; something that, without descending to any determinate object, may at once by its beauty and immensity excite our wishes and elevate our affections. Though in the prophetical and evangelical writings the joys that shall attend us in a future state are often mentioned with ardent admiration, they are expressed rather by allusion than similitude, rather by indefinite and figurative terms, than by anything fixed and determinate.\n\nEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\" 1 Cor. ii. 9.\n\nWhat a reverence and astonishment does this passage excite in every hearer of taste and piety! What energy, and at the same time what simplicity, in the expression! How sublime, and at the same time how obscure, is the imagery!\n\nDifferent was the conduct of Mahomet in his descriptions of heaven and of paradise. Unassisted by the necessary influence of virtuous intentions and Divine inspiration, he was neither devious, nor indeed able, to exalt the minds of men to sublime conceptions, or to rational expectations. By attempting to explain what is inconceivable, to describe what is ineffable, and to materialize what in itself is spiritual; he absurdly and impiously aimed to sensualize the purity of the Divine essence. Thus he fabricated a system of incoherence, a religion of depravity, totally repugnant indeed to the nature of that Being, who, as he pretended, was its object; but therefore more likely to accord with the appetites and conceptions of a corrupt and sensual age.\n\nThat we may not appear to exalt our Scriptures thus far above the Koran by an unreasonable preference, we shall produce a part of the second chapter of the latter, which is deservedly admired by the Mahometans, who wear it engraved on their ornaments, and recite it in their prayers. \"God! there is no God but he; the living, the self-subsisting: neither slumber nor sleep becometh him: to him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven, and on earth. Who is he that can intercede with him but through his good pleasure? He knoweth that which is past, and that which is to come. His throne is extended over heaven and earth, and the preservation of both is to him no burden. He is the high, the mighty.\" Sale's Kor. ii. p. 325. 4to edit.\n\nTo this description who can refuse the praise of magnificence? Part of that magnificence, however, is to be referred to that verse of the Psalms, whence it was borrowed, \"He that keepeth Israel, shall neither slumber nor sleep.\" Psa. cxxi. 4.\n\nBut if we compare it with that other passage of the same inspired Psalms, all its boasted grandeur is at once obscured, and lost in the blaze of a greater light.\n\nO my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; thy years are throughout all generations. Of old hast thou laid the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea all of them shall wax old, as doth a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\"\n\nThe Koran, therefore, upon a retrospective view of these several circumstances, far from supporting its arrogant claim to a supernatural work, sinks below the level of many compositions confessedly of human origin; and still lower does it fall in our estimation, when compared with that pure and perfect pattern which we justly admire in the Scriptures of truth.\n\nIt is therefore abundantly apparent, that no miracle either was externally performed for the support, or is internally involved in the composition, of the Mahometan revelation.\n\nAlcoran, is also figuratively applied to certain other books full of impurities and impostures. In this sense we meet with the Alcoran of the Cordeliers, which has made a great noise; wherein St Francis is extravagantly magnified, and put on a level with Jesus Christ. The Alcoran of the Cordeliers is properly an extract of a very scarce book, entitled, The Conformity of the Life of the graphic father St Francis with the Life of Christ, published in 1510, 4to; since, at Bologna, in folio.

He was born, it is supposed, in Yorkshire. He was educated, however, at York, under the direction of Archbishop Egbert, as we learn from his own letters, in which he frequently calls that great prelate his beloved master, and the clergy of York the companions of his youthful studies. As he survived Venerable Bede about 70 years, it is hardly possible that he could have received any part of his education under him, as some writers of literary history have affirmed; and it is worthy of observation, that he never calls that great man his master, though he speaks of him with the highest veneration. It is not well known to what preferments he had attained in the church before he left England, though some say he was abbot of Canterbury. The occasion of his leaving his native country, was his being sent on an embassy by Offa King of Mercia to the emperor Charlemagne; who contracted to great an esteem and friendship for him, that he earnestly solicited, and at length prevailed upon him, to settle in his court, and become his preceptor in the sciences. Alcuinus accordingly instructed that great prince in rhetoric, logic, mathematics, and divinity; which rendered him one of his greatest favourites. \"He was treated with so much kindness and familiarity (says a contemporary writer) by the emperor, that the other courtiers called him, by way of eminence, the emperor's delight.\" Charlemagne employed his learned favourite to write several books against the heretical opinions of Felix bishop of Urgell, in Catalonia, and to defend the orthodox faith against that heresiarch, in the council of Frankfort, A.D. 804; which he performed to the entire satisfaction of the emperor and council, and even to the conviction of Felix and his followers, who abandoned their errors. The emperor consulted chiefly with Alcuinus on all things relating to religion and learning; and by his advice, did many great things for the advancement of both. An academy was established in the imperial palace, over which Alcuinus presided, and in which the princes and prime nobility were educated; and other academies were established in the chief towns of Italy and France, at his instigation, and under his inspection. \"France (says one of our best writers of literary history) is indebted to Alcuinus for all the polite learning it boasted of in that and the following ages. The universities of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soissons, and many others, owe to him their origin and increase; those of whom he was not the superior and founder, being at least enlightened by his doctrine and example, and enriched by the benefits he procured for them from Charlemagne.\" After Alcuinus had spent many years in the most intimate familiarity with the greatest prince of his age, he at length, with great difficulty, obtained leave to retire from court to his abbey of St Martin's at Tours. Here he kept up a constant correspondence by letters with Charlemagne; from which it appears, that both the emperor and his learned friend were animated with the most ardent love to learning and religion, and constantly employed in contriving and executing the noblest designs for their advancement. He composed many treatises on a great variety of subjects, in a style much superior in purity and elegance to that of the generality of writers in the age in which he flourished. Charlemagne often solicited him, with all the warmth of a most affectionate friend, to return to court, and favour him with his company and advice; but he still excused himself; and nothing could draw him from his retirement in his abbey of St Martin in Tours, where he died A.D. 804. His works were collected and published by Andrew du Ch\u00eane in one volume folio, Paris, 1617. They consist of, 1. Tracts upon Scripture. 2. Tracts upon doctrine, discipline, and morality. 3. Historical treatises, letters, and poems.

Paulus Manutius, in his commentary upon these words of Cicero, Librum tibi celeriter mittam de gloria, \"I will speedily send you my treatise on Glory;\" has the following passage relating to this affair: \"He means...\"\nAldborough (says he) his two books on Glory, which were handed down to the age of our fathers; for Bernard Jusfinian, in the index of his books, mentions Cicero de Gloria.\n\nThis treatise, however, when Bernard had left his whole library to a nunnery, could not be found, though sought after with great care: nobody doubted but Peter Alcyonius, who, being physician to the nunnery, was entrusted with the library, had safely stolen it.

He is said to have been the son of Kenred, brother to Ina, king of the West-Saxons; but, in the opinion of William of Malmesbury, his father was no more than a distant relation to the king. Having received the first part of his education in the school which one Macduff, a learned Scot, had set up in the place where Malmesbury now stands, he travelled into France and Italy for his improvement. At his return home, he studied some time under Adrian abbot of St Augustine's in Canterbury, the most learned professor of the sciences who had ever been in England. In these different seminaries he acquired a very uncommon stock of knowledge; and became famous for his learning, not only in England, but in foreign countries: whence several learned men sent him their writings for his perusal and correction; particularly Prince Arcivill, a son of the king of Scotland, who wrote many pieces which he sent to Aldhelm, \"entreating him to give them the last polish, by rubbing off their Scots ruff.\" He was the first Englishman who wrote in the Latin language both in prose and verse, and composed a book for the instruction of his countrymen in the profanity of that language. He\nAldhelm fades this, he wrote several other treatises on various subjects; some of which are lost, and others published by Martin Delrio and Cantius. Venerable Bede, who flourished in the end of this and the beginning of the next century, gives the following character of Aldhelm:\n\n\"He was a man of universal erudition, having an elegant style, and being wonderfully well acquainted with books, both on philosophical and religious subjects.\"\n\nIn fact, considering the cloud of ignorance by which he was surrounded, and the great difficulty of acquiring knowledge without proper instruction, Aldhelm was a very extraordinary man. From one of his letters to Hedda bishop of Winchester, concerning the nature of his studies whilst at Canterbury, he appears to have been indefatigably determined to acquire every species of learning in his power. For a copy of this curious epistle, see Henry's History, vol. ii. p. 320. King Alfred the Great declared, that Aldhelm was the best of all the Saxon poets; and that a favourite long, which was universally sung in his time, near 200 years after its author's death, was of his composition. When he was abbot of Malmesbury, having a fine voice, and great skill in music as well as poetry, and observing the backwardness of his barbarous countrymen to listen to grave instructions, he composed a number of little poems, which he sung to them after mass in the sweetest manner; by which they were gradually instructed and civilized. After this excellent person had governed the monastery of Malmesbury, of which he was the founder, about 30 years, he was made bishop of Shireburn, where he died A.D. 799.\u2014He wrote, 1. De cultu vitis principalibus. This treatise is extant in Bibliotheca Patronum de Canisius. 2. Enigmatum verus mille.

He was so much in favour with King Edward the Confessor, and had so much power over his mind, that he obliged him to be reconciled with the worst of his enemies, particularly with Sweyn son of the earl Goodwin, who had revolted against him, and came with an army to invade the kingdom. Aldred also restored the union and friendship between King Edward and Griffith king of Wales. He took afterwards a journey to Rome, and being returned into England, in the year 1054, he was sent ambassador to the emperor Henry II. He stayed a whole year in Germany, and was very honourably entertained by Herman archbishop of Cologne, from whom he learned many things relating to ecclesiastical discipline, which on his return he established in his own diocese. In the year 1058 he went to Jerusalem, which no archbishop or bishop of England had ever done before him. Two years after he returned to England; and Kinfin archbishop of York dying the 22d of December 1060, Aldred was elected in his stead on Christmas day following, and was permitted to retain the see of Worcester with the archbishopric of York, as some of his predecessors had done. Aldred went soon after to Rome, in order to receive the pall from the pope: He was attended by Tofton earl of Northumberland, Gilo bishop of Wells, and Walter bishop of Hereford. The pope received Tofton very honourably, and made him fit by him in the synod which he held against the simonists. He granted to Gilo and Walter their request, because they were tolerably well learned, and not accused of simony. But Aldred being by his answers found ignorant, and guilty of simony, the pope deprived him very severely of all his honours and dignities; so that he was obliged to return without the pall. On the way home he and his three fellow-travellers were attacked by some robbers, who took from them all that they had, though they did not offer to kill them. This obliged them to return to Rome; and the pope, either out of compassion, or by the threatenings of the earl of Northumberland, gave Aldred the pallium; but he was obliged to resign his bishopric of Worcester. However, as the archbishopric of York had been almost entirely ruined by the many invasions of foreigners, King Edward gave the new archbishop leave to keep 12 villages or manors which belonged to the bishopric of Worcester. Edward the Confessor dying in 1066, Aldred crowned Harold his successor. He also crowned William the Conqueror, after he had made him take the following oath, viz. that he would protect the holy churches of God and their leaders; that he would establish and observe righteous laws; that he would entirely prohibit and suppress all rapines and unjust judgements. He was so much in favour with the Conqueror, that this prince looked upon him as a father; and, though imperious in regard to everybody else, he yet submitted to obey this archbishop: John Brompton gives us an instance of the king's submission, which at the same time shows the prelate's haughtiness.\u2014It happened one day, as the archbishop was at York, that the deputy-governor or lord-lieutenant going out of the city with a great number of people, met the archbishop's servants, who came to town with several carts and horses loaded with provisions. The governor asked them to whom they belonged; and they having answered they were Aldred's servants, the governor ordered that all these provisions should be carried to the king's storehouse. The archbishop sent immediately some of his clergy to the governor, commanding him to deliver the provisions, and to make satisfaction to St Peter, and to him the saint's vicar, for the injury he had done them; adding, that if he refused to comply, the archbishop would make use of his apostolic authority against him, (intimating thereby that he would excommunicate him). The governor, offended at this proud message, used the persons whom the archbishop had sent him very ill, and returned an answer as haughty as the message was. Aldred thereupon went to London to make his complaint to the king; but in this very complaint he acted with his wonted insolence; for meeting the king in the church of St Peter at Westminster, he spoke to him in these words: \"Hearken, O William: when thou wast but a foreigner, and God,\nGod, to punish the sins of this nation, permitted thee to become master of it, after having shed a great deal of blood; I consecrated thee, and put the crown upon thy head with blessings; but now, because thou hast deserved it, I pronounce a curse over thee, instead of a blessing, since thou art become the persecutor of God's church, and of his ministers, and hast broken the promises and the oaths which thou madest to me before St Peter's altar.\" The king, terrified at this discourse, fell upon his knees, and humbly begged the prelate to tell him, by what crime he had deserved so severe a sentence. The noblemen, who were present, were enraged against the archbishop, and loudly cried out he deserved death, or at least banishment, for having offered such an injury to his sovereign; and they pressed him with threatenings to raise the king from the ground. But the prelate, unmoved at all this, answered calmly, \"Good men, let him lie there, for he is not at Aldred's but at St Peter's feet; he must feel St Peter's power, since he dared to injure his viceregent.\" Having thus reproved the nobles by his episcopal authority, he vouchsafed to take the king by the hand, and to tell him the ground of his complaint. The king humbly excused himself, by saying he had been ignorant of the whole matter; and begged of the noblemen to entreat the prelate, that he might take off the curse he had pronounced, and to change it into a blessing. Aldred was at last prevailed upon to favour the king thus far; but not without the promise of several presents and favours, and only after the king had granted him to take such a revenge on the governor as he thought fit. Since that time (adds the historian) none of the noblemen ever dared to offer the least injury. It may be questioned, which was more surprising here, whether the archbishop's haughtiness, who dared to treat his sovereign after so unbecoming a manner; or the king's stupidity, who suffered such insolence and audacity from a priest?\u2014The Danes having made an invasion in the north of England in the year 1668, under the conduct of Harold and Canute the sons of King Sweyn, Aldred was so much afflicted at it, that he died of grief the 11th of September in that same year, having befoiled God that he might not see the defolation of his church and country.","sp":199,"ep":200},{"h":"ALDRICH","t":"ROBERT, bishop of Carlisle, was born at Burnham in Buckinghamshire about the year 1493, and educated at Eaton school; from whence, in 1507, he was elected scholar of King's college, Cambridge, where he took his degree in arts, and was afterwards proctor of the university.

He had a great share in the controversy with the Papists in the reign of James II. and Bishop Burnet ranks him among those who examined all the points of Popery with a solidity of judgment, clearness of argument, depth of learning, and vivacity of writing, far beyond any who had before that time written in our language. He rendered himself so conspicuous, that at the Revolution, when Massey the Popish dean of Christ-church fled, his deanery was conferred on him. In this station he behaved in an exemplary manner, and that fabric owes much of its beauty to his ingenuity: it was Aldrich who designed the beautiful square called Peckwater Quadrangle, which is esteemed an excellent piece of architecture. In imitation of his predecessor Dr Fell, he published, yearly, a piece of some ancient Greek author, as a present to the students of his house. He published A System of Logic, with some other pieces; and the reviling Clarendon's History of the Rebellion was intrusted to him and Bishop Spratt; but it doth not appear that they made any additions, or considerable alterations in it, as has been asserted by Mr Oldmixon. Besides his performances above mentioned, Dr Aldrich was also rector of Wen in Shropshire. He was chosen prolocutor of the convocation in 1702. This worthy person died at Christ-church on the 14th of December 1710. As to his character, he was a most universal scholar, and had a taste for all sorts of learning, especially architecture. Sir John Hawkins has favoured the public with several particulars relative to Dr Aldrich's skill in music; and on account of the Doctor's eminence in this respect, Sir John hath given his life, with his head prefixed. His abilities as a musician rank him, we are told, among the greatest masters of the science. He composed many services for the church, which are well known; as are also his anthems, nearly to the number of 20. He adapted, with great skill and judgment, English words to many of the notes of Palestrina, Carissimi, Victoria, and other Italian composers for the church, some of which are frequently sung in our cathedrals as anthems. By the happy talent which Dr Aldrich possessed, of naturalizing the compositions of the old Italian masters, and accommodating them to an English ear, he increased the stores of our own church. Though the Doctor chiefly applied himself to the cultivation of sacred music, yet, being a man of humour, he could divert himself by producing pieces of a lighter kind. There are two catches of his; the one, \"Hark the bonny Christchurch Bells;\" the other entitled, \"A Smoking Catch;\" to be sung by four men smoking their pipes, which is not more difficult to sing than diverting to hear. His love of smoking was, it seems, so excessive as to be an entertaining topic of discourse in the university. Such was Dr Aldrich's regard for the advancement of music, and the honour of its professors, that he had formed a design of writing a history of the science; and the materials from which he proposed to compile it are yet extant in the library of his own college. It appears from these materials, that he had marked\nmarked down every thing which he had met with concerning music and musicians; but that he had brought no part of them into any kind of form.\n\nDr Aldrich is of some note as a Latin poet. In the *Mulce Anglicane*, we find two elegant copies of verses by him; one on the accession of King William III., and the other on the death of the duke of Gloucester. Sir John Hawkins has preferred a humorous translation by him of the well-known English ballad,\n\n\"A soldier and a failor,\n\"A tinker and a tailor,\" &c.\n\nThe following epigram, entitled \"Causae Bibendi,\" is likewise ascribed to Dr Aldrich:\n\n\"Si bene quid movet, Causae sunt quinque bibendi,\n\"Hospitis Adventus; praesens Sitis, atque futura;\n\"Aut Vini Bonitas; aut qua liberat altera Causa.\"\n\nThe epigram has been thus translated:\n\n\"If on my theme I rightly think,\n\"There are five reasons why men drink:\n\"Good wine, a friend, because I'm dry,\n\"Or least I should be and bye,\n\"Or any other reason why.\"\n\nThe translation is not equal to the original. It is evident, from the verses cited and referred to, that Dr Aldrich was of a very cheerful and pleasant turn of mind. Indeed, he is always spoken of as having been a man of wit; and as one who, to his great talents and virtues, joined those amiable qualities which rendered him the object of general affection, as well as of general esteem and respect. Having never been married, he appropriated his income to works of hospitality and beneficence, and in encouraging learning to the utmost of his power, of which he was a most munificent patron, as well as one of the greatest men in England, if considered as a Christian or a gentleman. He had always the interest of his college at heart, whereof he was an excellent governor. His modesty and humility prevented him from prefixing his name to the learned tracts which he published during his life. At his death he wished to be buried in the cathedral without any memorial; which his thrifty nephew complied with, depositing him on the south side of Bishop Fell's grave, December 22, eight days after his decease; which happened in the 63rd or 64th year of his age.\n\nALDROVANDA.

He was a most curious inquirer into natural history, and travelled into the most distant countries on purpose to inform himself of their natural productions. Minerals, metals, plants, and animals, were the objects of his curious researches; but he applied himself chiefly to birds, and was at great expense to have figures of them drawn from the life. Aubert le Mire says, that he gave a certain painter, famous in that art, a yearly salary of 200 crowns, for 30 years and upwards; and that he employed at his own expense Lorenzo Bennini and Cornelius Swintus, as well as the famous engraver Christopher Coriolanus. These expenses ruined his fortune, and at length reduced him to the utmost necessity; and it is said that he died blind in an hospital at Bologna, at a great age, in 1605.\n\nMr Bayle observes, that antiquity does not Alduabius, furnish us with an instance of a design so extensive and so laborious as that of Aldrovandus, with regard to natural history; that Pliny has treated of more kinds of subjects, but only touches lightly on them, saying but a little upon any thing, whereas Aldrovandus has collected all he could meet with. His compilation, or that compiled upon his plan, consists of 13 volumes in folio, several of which were printed after his death.

(See Brewing.) This liquor, the natural substitute of wine in such countries as could not produce the grape, was originally made in Egypt, the first planted kingdom, on the dispersion from the east, that was supposed unable to produce grapes. And, as the Noachian colonies pierced further into the west, they found, or thought they found, the same defect, and supplied it in the same manner. Thus the natives of Spain, the inhabitants of France, and the aborigines of Britain, all used an infusion of barley for their ordinary liquor: and it was called by the various names of Galia and Ceria in the first country, Cerevita in the second, and Curmi in the last; all literally importing only the strong water.\n\n\"All the several nations (says Pliny) who inhabit the west of Europe, have a liquor with which they intoxicate themselves made of corn and water. The manner of making this liquor is somewhat different in Gaul, Spain, and other countries, and is called by many various names; but its nature and properties are everywhere the same. The people of Spain, in particular, brew this liquor so well, that it will keep good a long time. So exquisite is the cunning of mankind, in gratifying their vicious appetites, that they have thus invented a method to make water itself intoxicating.\"\nThe method in which the ancient Britons, and other Celtic nations, made their ale, is thus described by Isidorus and Orofius. \"The grain is steeped in water and made to germinate, by which its spirits are excited and set at liberty; it is then dried and ground; after which it is infused in a certain quantity of water; which being fermented, becomes a pleasant, warming, strengthening, and intoxicating liquor.\" This ale was most commonly made of barley; but sometimes of wheat, oats, and millet.\n\nAnciently the Welsh and Scots had also two kinds of ale, called common ale and spiced ale; and their value was thus ascertained by law: \"If a farmer hath no mead, he shall pay two casks of spiced ale, or four casks of common ale, for one cask of mead.\" By this law, a cask of spiced ale, nine palms in height, and 18 palms in diameter, was valued at a sum of money equal in efficacy to 7l. ro. of our present money; and a cask of common ale, of the same dimensions, at a sum equal to 3l. 15s. This is a sufficient proof, that even common ale in this period was an article of luxury among the Welsh, which could only be obtained by the great and opulent. Wine seems to have been quite unknown even to the kings of Wales, in this period, as it is not so much as once mentioned in their laws; though Giraldus Cambrensis, who flourished about a century after the Conquest, acquaints us, that there was a vineyard in his time at Maenarper, near Pembroke, in South Wales.\n\nAle was the favourite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, as it had been of their ancestors the ancient Germans. Before their conversion to Christianity, they believed that drinking large and frequent draughts of ale was one of the chief felicities which those heroes enjoyed who were admitted into the hall of Odin.\n\nThere are various sorts of ale known in Britain, particularly pale and brown: the former is brewed from malt slightly dried; and is esteemed more efficacious than the latter, which is made from malt more highly dried or roasted.\n\nPale ale brewed with hard waters, as those of springs and wells, is judged the most wholesome, in regard the mineral particles tend to prevent the cohesions of those drawn from the grain, and enable them to pass the proper filtrations the better; softer waters, as those of rivers, and rain, seem better suited to draw out the substance of high-dried malts, which retain many igneous particles, best absorbed in a smooth vehicle.\n\nIn Staffordshire, they have a secret of fining ale in a very short time. Plot conjectures it to be done by adding alum, or vinegar, in the working.\n\nAle is prepared various ways, and of various ingredients, as of wheat, rye, millet, oats, barley, the berries of the quickbean, &c.\n\nSome have found that the juice which bleeds from the birch or yew tree is of great use on this occasion, applied instead of water. It makes one bushel of malt go as far as four in the common way.\n\nSome have a method of preparing ale, so that it will keep, carried to the East or West Indies. The secret is, by mashing twice with fresh malt; boiling twice; and, after skimming it, putting to every five gallons two new-laid eggs whole, to remain therein. It is said, that in a fortnight's time, the shells will be dissolved; and the eggs become like wind-eggs; and that afterwards the white would disappear and the yolk remain untouched.\n\nThe consumption of ale in these kingdoms is incredible. It was computed twenty years ago at the value of four millions yearly, including Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe duties on ale and beer make a principal branch of the revenue in Britain.

He derived the name of John le Rond from that of the church near which, after his birth, he was exposed as a foundling. His father, informed of this circumstance, listened to the voice of nature and duty, took measures for the proper education of his child, and for his future subsistence in a state of ease and independence.\n\nHe received his first education in the College of the Four Nations, among the Janissaries, where he gave early marks of capacity and genius. In the first year of his philosophical studies, he composed a Commentary on the Epistle of St Paul to the Romans. The Janissaries considered this production as an omen that portended to the party of Port-Royal a restoration to some\nAlembert, some part of their ancient splendour, and hoped to find one day in M. d'Alembert a second Pascal. To render this resemblance more complete, they engaged their rising pupil in the study of the mathematics; but they soon perceived that his growing attachment to this science was likely to disappoint the hopes they had formed with respect to his future destination; they therefore endeavoured to divert him from this line; but their endeavours were fruitless.\n\nAt his leaving college, he found himself alone and unconnected in the world; and sought an asylum in the house of his nurse. He comforted himself with the hope, that his fortune, though not ample, would better the condition and subsistence of that family, which was the only one that he could consider as his own: Here, therefore, he took up his residence, resolving to apply himself entirely to the study of geometry; And here he lived, during the space of forty years, with the greatest simplicity, discovering the augmentation of his means only by increasing displays of his beneficence, concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from the honest people, and making their plain and uncouth manners the subject of good-natured pleasantry and philosophical observation. His good nurse perceived his ardent activity; heard him mentioned as the writer of many books; but never took it into her head that he was a great man, and rather beheld him with a kind of compassion. \"You will never,\" said she to him one day, \"be anything but a philosopher\u2014and what is a philosopher?\u2014a fool, who toils and plagues himself during his life, that people may talk of him when he is no more.\"\n\nAs M. d'Alembert's fortune did not far exceed the demands of necessity, his friends advised him to think of a profession that might enable him to augment it. He accordingly turned his views to the law, and took his degrees in that line; but soon abandoned this plan, and applied to the study of medicine. Geometry, however, was always drawing him back to his former pursuits; and after many ineffectual efforts to resist its attractions, he renounced all views of a lucrative profession, and gave himself over entirely to mathematics and poverty.\n\nIn the year 1741 he was admitted member of the Academy of Sciences; for which distinguished literary promotion, at such an early age, he had prepared the way by correcting the errors of a celebrated work*, which was deemed classical in France in the line of geometry. He afterwards let himself examine, with deep attention and assiduity, what must be the motion of a body which passes from one fluid into another more dense, in a direction not perpendicular to the surface separating the two fluids. Every one knows the phenomenon which happens in this case, and which amuses children under the denomination of Ducks and Drakes; but M. d'Alembert was the first who explained it in a satisfactory and philosophical manner.\n\nTwo years after his election to a place in the academy, he published his Treatise on Dynamics. The new principle developed in this treatise consisted in establishing equality, at each instant, between the changes that the motion of a body has undergone, and the forces or powers which have been employed to produce them; or, to express the thing otherwise, in separating into two parts the action of the moving powers, and considering the one as producing alone the motion of the body in the second instant, and the other as employed to destroy that which had been in the first.\n\nSo early as the year 1744, M. d'Alembert had applied this principle to the theory of the equilibrium, and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before solved by geometers became, in some measure, its corollaries. The discovery of this new principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the first trials of which were published in a Discourse on the general Theory of the Winds, to which the prize-medal was adjudged by the academy of Berlin in the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of M. d'Alembert.\n\nHe availed himself of the favourable circumstance of the king of Prussia having just terminated a glorious campaign by an honourable peace, and in allusion to this dedicated his work to that prince in the three following Latin verses:\n\nHac ego de ventis, dum ventorum ocyor alit,\nPalantes agit Aultriacos Fredericus, et orbis,\nInsignis lauro, ramum pretendent olivae.\n\nSwifter than wind, while of the winds I write,\nThe foes of conquering Frederick speed their flight,\nWhile laurel o'er the hero's temple bends\nTo the tir'd world the olive branch he sends.\n\nThis flattering dedication procured the philosopher a polite letter from Frederick, and a place among his literary friends.\n\nIn the year 1747 d'Alembert applied his new calculus of \"Partial Differences\" to the problem of vibrating chords, whose solution, as well as the theory of the oscillations of the air and the propagation of sound, had been given but incompletely by the geometers who preceded him, and these were his masters or his rivals.\n\nIn the year 1749 he furnished a method of applying his principle to the motion of any body of a given figure; and he solved the problem of the precession of the equinoxes, determined its quantity, and explained the phenomenon of the nutation of the terrestrial axis discovered by Dr. Bradley.\n\nIn 1752, M. d'Alembert published a treatise on the Resistance of Fluids, to which he gave the modest title of an Essay; but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new observations. About the same time he published, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, Researches concerning the Integral Calculus, which is greatly indebted to him for the rapid progress it has made in the present century.\n\nWhile the studies of M. d'Alembert were confined to geometry, he was little known or celebrated in his native country. His connexions were limited to a small society of select friends; he had never seen any man in high office except Mellors d'Argenson. Satisfied with an income which furnished him with the necessaries of life, he did not aspire after opulence or honours, nor had they been hitherto bestowed upon him, as it is easier to confer them on those who solicit them than to look out for men who deserve them. His cheerful conversation, his smart and lively fancies, a happy knack at telling a story, a singular mixture of malice of speech with goodness of heart, and of delicacy of\nof wit with simplicity of manners, rendered him a pleasing and interesting companion, and his company consequently was much sought after in the fashionable circles. His reputation, at length, made its way to the throne, and rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received also a pension from government, which he owed to the friendship of Count d'Argenson.\n\nThe tranquillity of M. d'Alembert was abated when his fame grew more extensive, and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends, that a fine and enlightened taste for literature and philosophy accompanied his mathematical genius. Our author's eulogist attributes to envy, detraction, and to other motives equally ungenerous, all the disapprobation, opposition, and censure that M. d'Alembert met with on account of the publication of the famous Encyclopedic Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with Diderot. None surely will refuse the well-deserved tribute of applause to the eminent displays of genius, judgment, and true literary taste, with which M. d'Alembert has enriched the great work now mentioned. Among others, the Preliminary Discourse he has affixed to it; concerning the rise, progress, connexions, and affinities of all the branches of human knowledge, is perhaps one of the first productions of which the philosophy of the present age can boast, and will be regarded as a striking specimen of just arrangement and sound criticism, and also as a model of accurate thinking and elegant writing.\n\nSome time after this, d'Alembert published his Philosophical, Historical, and Philological Miscellanies. These were followed by the Memoirs of Christina queen of Sweden; in which M. d'Alembert showed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind, and was bold enough to assert them. His Essay on the Intercourse of Men of Letters with Persons high in Rank and Office, wounded the former to the quick, as it exposed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of those servile chains, which they feared to shake off, or were proud to wear. A lady of the court hearing one day the author accused of having exaggerated the despotism of the great, and the submission they require, answered flippantly, \"If he had consulted me, I would have told him more of the matter.\"\n\nM. d'Alembert gave very elegant specimens of his literary abilities in his translations of some select pieces of Tacitus. But these occupations did not divert him from his mathematical studies: for about the same time he enriched the Encyclop\u00e9die with a multitude of excellent articles in that line, and composed his Researches on several important Points of the System of the World, in which he carried to a higher degree of perfection the solution of the problem of the perturbations of the planets, that had several years before been presented to the Academy.\n\nIn 1759 he published his Elements of Philosophy: a work extolled as remarkable for its precision and perspicuity; in which, however, are some tenets relative both to metaphysics and moral science, that are far from being admissible.\n\nThe resentment that was kindled (and the disputes that followed it) by the article Geneva, inserted in the Encyclop\u00e9die, are well known. M. d'Alembert did not leave this field of controversy with flying colours. Voltaire was an auxiliary in the contest: but as, in point of candour and decency, he had no reputation to lose; and as he weakened the blows of his enemies, by throwing both them and the spectators into fits of laughter, the illuse of the war gave him little uneasiness. It fell more heavily on d'Alembert; and exposed him, even at home, to much contradiction and opposition.\n\nIt was on this occasion that the late king of Prussia offered him an honourable asylum at his court, and the place of president of his academy; and was not offended at his refusal of these distinctions, but cultivated an intimate friendship with him during the rest of his life. He had refused, some time before this, a proposal made by the empress of Russia to intrust him with the education of the grand duke\u2014a proposal accompanied with all the flattering offers that could tempt a man ambitious of titles, or desirous of making an ample fortune: but the objects of his ambition were tranquillity and study.\n\nIn the year 1765, he published his Dissertation on the Destruction of the Jesuits. This piece drew upon him a swarm of adversaries, who confirmed the merit and credit of his work by their manner of attacking it.\n\nBeside the works already mentioned, he published nine volumes of memoirs and treatises, under the title of Opuscules; in which he has solved a multitude of problems relative to astronomy, mathematics, and natural philosophy; of which our panegyrist gives a particular account, more especially of those which exhibit new subjects, or new methods of investigation.\n\nHe published also Elements of Music; and rendered, at length, the system of Rameau intelligible; but he did not think the mathematical theory of the sonorous body sufficient to account for the rules of that art. He was always fond of music; which, on the one hand, is connected with the most subtle and learned researches of rational mechanics; while, on the other, its power over the senses and the soul exhibits to philosophers phenomena no less singular, and still more inexplicable.\n\nIn the year 1772, he was chosen secretary to the French academy. He formed, soon after this preferment, the design of writing the lives of all the deceased academicians from 1700 to 1772; and in the space of three years he executed this design, by composing 70 eulogies.\n\nM. d'Alembert died on the 28th of October 1783. There were many amiable lines of candour, modesty, disinterestedness, and benevolence, in his moral character; which are described, with a diffusive detail, in his eulogy, by M. Condorcet, Histoire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, 1783.","sp":203,"ep":205},{"h":"ALEMBIC","t":"a chemical vessel usually made of glass or copper, formerly used for distillation.

It is built on eight hills or eminences, on the highest of which the castle is erected, and is supposed to be the ancient Ber\u00e6a. This mount is of a conic form, and seems in a great measure to be raised with the earth thrown up out of a deep broad ditch which surrounds it. The suburbs to the north-east are next in height to this, and those to the west-south-west are much lower than the parts adjacent, and than any other part of the city. The houses are large and commodious, having terraces on their tops, and generally sky-lights in form of a dome to let the light into the rooms, which from their loftiness, the gilding on the window shutters, cupboard-doors, &c. have at first entrance a very grand and agreeable effect. They are all so equal in height, that there are seldom any steps to ascend or descend in going from one house to another; while several large vaulted streets increase the facility of communication, by affording a passage to every part of the city free from the embarrassment of the open streets. They are carefully paved; have gutters and a foot-pavement on each side; and the middle of the street is laid with brick, the small end upwards, for the convenience of the horses. There is also a cleanliness observed here unknown to the other cities of Turkey, and which is not attended with the trouble of our scavengers, there being also drivers who go about the city and take up the rubbish and dust, which each inhabitant is obliged to sweep together; and though the heat of the climate renders this labour more easy, the same heat obliges them to greater cleanliness in order to preserve the salubrity of the air.\n\nThe mosques in Aleppo are numerous, and some few of them magnificent. Before each of them is an area, with a fountain in the middle, designed for ablutions before prayers; and behind some of the larger there are little gardens. There are many large khans, or caravanserais, consisting of a capacious square, on all sides of which are a number of rooms, built on a ground-floor, used occasionally for chambers, warehouses, or stables. Above stairs there is a colonnade or gallery on every side, in which are the doors of a number of small rooms, wherein the merchants, as well strangers as natives, transact most of their business.\n\nThe bazars or market-places are long covered narrow streets, on each side of which are a great number of small shops, just sufficient to hold the tradesman and his goods, the buyer being obliged to stand without. Each separate branch of business has a particular bazar, which is locked up, as well as the streets, an hour and a half after sunset: but the locks are of wood, though the doors are cased with iron. The slaughter-houses are in the suburbs, open to the fields. The tanners have a khan to work in near the river. To the southward in the suburbs they burn lime; and a little beyond that there is a village where they make ropes and catgut. On the opposite side of the river, to the westward, there is a glass-house, where they make a coarse white glass, in the winter only; for the greatest part of this manufacture is brought from a village 35 miles westward.\n\nThe situation of Aleppo, beside the advantage of a rich and fruitful soil, possesses also that of a stream of fresh water, which never becomes dry. This rivulet, which is about as large as that of the Gebeline at Paris, or the New River near London, rises in the mountains of Antab, and terminates six leagues below Aleppo, in a morass full of wild boars and pelicans. Near Aleppo, its banks, instead of the naked rocks which line them in the upper part of its course, are covered with a fertile earth, and laid out in gardens, or rather orchards, which in a hot country, and especially in Turkey, cannot but be delightful. The city is in itself one of the most agreeable in Syria, and is perhaps the cleanest and best built of any in Turkey. On whatever side it is approached, its numerous minarets and domes present an agreeable prospect to the eye, fatigued with the continued sameness of the brown and parched plains. In the centre is an artificial mountain surrounded by a dry ditch, on which is a ruinous fortress. From hence we have a fine prospect of the whole city, and to the north discover the snowy tops of the mountains of Bailan; and on the west, those which separate the Orontes from the sea; while to the south, and east, the eye can discern as far as the Euphrates. In the time of Omar, this castle stopped the progress of the Arabs for several months, and was at last taken by treachery, but at present would not be able to resist the feeblest assault. Its flight wall, low, and without a buttress, is in ruins; its little old towers are in no better condition; and it has not four cannon fit for service, not excepting a culverine nine feet long, taken from the Persians at the siege of Bailora. Three hundred and fifty Janizaries, who should\nAleppo should form the garrison, are busy in their shops, and the aga scarcely finds room in it to lodge his retinue. It is remarkable that this aga is named immediately by the Porte, which, ever fulficial, divides as much as possible the different offices. Within the walls of the castle is a well, which, by means of a subterraneous communication, derives its water from a spring a league and a quarter distant. In the environs of the city, we find a number of large square stones, on the top of which is a turban of stone, which are so many tombs. There are many rising grounds round it, which, in case of a siege, would greatly facilitate the approaches of the assailants. Such, among others, is that on which the house of the Dervishes stands, and which commands the canal and the rivulet: Aleppo, therefore, cannot be esteemed a place of importance in war, though it be the key of Syria to the north; but, considered as a commercial city, it has a different appearance. It is the emporium of Armenia and Diarbekar; sends caravans to Bagdad and into Persia; and communicates with the Persian gulf and India, by Baffora, with Egypt and Mecca by Damascus, and with Europe by Scanderoon (Alexandretta) and Latakia. Commerce is there principally carried on by barter. The chief commodities are raw or spun cottons, clumsy linens fabricated in the villages, silk stuffs manufactured in the city, copper, bourres (coarse cloths) like those of Rouen, goats hair brought from Natolia, the gall nuts of the Kourdestan, the merchandise of India, such as shawls and muslins, and pif-tachio nuts of the growth of the neighbourhood. The articles supplied by Europe are the Languedoc cloths, cochineal, indigo, sugar, and some other groceries. The coffee of America, though prohibited, is introduced, and serves to mix with that of Moka. The French have at Aleppo a consul and seven counting-houses; the English and the Venetians two, and the merchants of Leghorn and Holland one. The emperor appointed a consul there in 1784, in the person of a rich Jew merchant, who shaved his beard to assume the uniform and the sword. Russia has also sent one very lately. Aleppo is not exceeded in extent by any city in Turkey, except Constantinople and Cairo, and perhaps Smyrna. The number of inhabitants has been computed at 200,000; but in these calculations certainty is impossible. However, if we observe that this city is not larger than Nantes or Marseilles, and that the houses consist only of one story, we shall perhaps not think it probable they exceed 100,000. The people of this city, both Turks and Christians, are with reason esteemed the most civilized in all Turkey; and the European merchants nowhere enjoy so much liberty, or are treated with so much respect.\n\nThe air of Aleppo is very dry and piercing, but at the same time very salubrious for all who are not troubled with asthmatic complaints. The city, however, and the environs, are subject to a singular endemic disorder, which is called the ringworm or pimple of Aleppo: it is in fact a pimple which is at first inflammatory, and at length becomes an ulcer of the size of the nail. The usual duration of this ulcer is one year; it commonly fixes on the face, and leaves a scar which disfigures almost all the inhabitants. It is alleged that every stranger who resides there three months is attacked with it; experience has taught that the best mode of treatment is to make use of no remedy. No reason is assigned for this malady: but M. Volney supposes it proceeds from the quality of the water, as it is likewise frequent in the neighbouring villages, in some parts of Diarbekar, and even in certain districts near Damascus, where the soil and the water have the same appearances. Of the Christian inhabitants the greater number are Greeks, next to them the Armenians, then the Syrians, and lastly the Maronites; each of whom have a church in the city called Judda; in which quarter, and the parts adjacent, most of them reside. The common language is the vulgar Arabic, but the Turks of condition use the Turkish. Most of the Armenians can speak the Armenian, some few Syrians understand Syriac, and many of the Jews Hebrew; but scarce one of the Greeks understand a word of Greek. The people in general are of a middle stature, and tolerably well proportioned; but they seem neither vigorous nor active. Both sexes are handsome when young; but the beard soon disfigures the men; and the women, as they come early to maturity, also fade very soon; females are generally married from 14 to 18 years of age, and many under 14. The people of rank here are polite and affable, making allowances for that superiority which the Mahometan religion inflicts its votaries to assume over all who hold a different faith. Their bread is generally of wheat flour made into thin cakes, but very ill prepared, and is generally eaten as soon as it comes out of the oven. The principal people have small loaves of a finer flour, which are well fermented and baked. Besides these, there is a variety of biscuits, most of which are sprinkled on the top with some kind of seeds. The Europeans have very good bread, baked and prepared in the French manner. All the inhabitants of both sexes smoke tobacco to great excess; even the very servants have almost constantly a pipe in their mouths. Coaches or carriages are not used here; therefore persons of quality ride on horseback in the city, with a number of servants walking before them, according to their rank: ladies of the first distinction are even compelled to walk on foot in the city, or to any place at a moderate distance; in longer journeys they are carried by mules, in a kind of couch close covered up. There are a number of public bagnios in this city, which are used by people of all ranks, except those of the highest distinction, who commonly have baths and every other convenience in their own houses. Aleppo is 70 miles east of Scanderoon, on the sea-coast, and 175 north-by-east of Damascus. F. Long, 37\u00b0 42'. N.

It comprehends the country extending from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, between two lines, one drawn from Scanderoon to Beer, along the mountains: the other from Beles to the sea, by Mara and the bridge of Shoger. This space principally consists of two plains; that of Antioch to the west, and that of Aleppo to the east: the north and the sea-coast are occupied by considerably high mountains, known to the ancients by the names of Amanus and of Rhodus. In general, the soil of this government is fat and loamy. The lofty and vigorous plants which shoot up everywhere after the winter rains prove its fertility, but its actual fruitfulness is but little. The greatest part of the lands lie waste;\nAleppo. waste; scarcely can we trace any marks of cultivation in the environs of the towns and villages. Its principal produce consists in wheat, barley, and cotton, which are found especially in the flat country. In the mountains, they rather choose to cultivate the vine, mulberry, olive, and fig trees. The sides of the hills towards the sea-coast are appropriated to tobacco, and the territory of Aleppo to pistachios. The pasturage is not to be reckoned, because that is abandoned to the wandering hordes of the Turcomans and Kurds.\n\nIn the greater part of the pachalics the pacha is, as his title imports, at once the viceroy and farmer-general of the country; but in that of Aleppo he does not possess the latter office. This the Porte has bestowed on a mehafiz or collector, who is immediately accountable for what he receives. His lease is only for a year. The present rent of his farm is 800 purses (above 40,000l.) but to this must be added the price of the babouches (Turkish slippers), or a present of three or four thousand pounds, to purchase the favour of the vizier, and men in office. For these two sums the farmer receives all the duties of the government; which are, first, the produce of import and export duties on merchandise coming from Europe, India, and Constantinople, and on that exported in exchange. Secondly, the taxes paid by the herds of cattle brought every year by the Turcomans and Kurds from Armenia and Diarbekir, to be sold in Syria. Thirdly, the fifth of the salt-works of Djeboul. And lastly, the miri, or land-tax. These united may produce about 60,000l.\n\nThe pacha, deprived of this lucrative branch of the administration, receives a fixed allowance of about 8300l. This revenue has always been inadequate to the expenses; for, besides the troops he is obliged to maintain, and the reparation of the highways and fortresses, the expenses of which he is obliged to defray, he is under the necessity of making large presents to the ministers, in order to keep his place; but the Porte adds to the account the contributions he may levy on the Kurds and Turcomans, and his extortions from the villages and individuals; nor do the pachas come short of this calculation. Abdi Pacha, who governed 13 or 14 years ago, carried off, at the end of 15 months, upwards of 160,000l. by laying under contribution every trade, even the very cleaners of tobacco-pipes; and very lately another of the same name has been obliged to fly for similar oppressions. The former was rewarded by the divan with the command of an army against the Ruffians; but if the latter has not enriched himself, he will be strangled as an extortioner. Such is the ordinary progress of affairs in Turkey!\n\nIn consequence of such wretched government, the greater part of the pachalics in the empire are impoverished and laid waste. This is the case in particular with that of Aleppo. In the ancient defters, or registers of imposts, upwards of 3200 villages were reckoned; but at present the collector can scarcely find 400. Such of our merchants as have resided there 20 years, have themselves seen the greater part of the environs of Aleppo become depopulated. The traveller meets with nothing but houses in ruins, cisterns rendered useless, and fields abandoned. Those who cultivate them have fled into the towns, where the population is absorbed, but where at least the individual conceals himself among the crowd from the rapacious hand of depotifin.","sp":206,"ep":208},{"h":"ALERIA","t":"ALALIA, or ALARIA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Carthage, situated near the middle of the east side of the island, on an eminence, near the mouth of the river Rotanus mentioned by Ptolemy; built by the Phocaens (Diodorus Siculus).

He soon made a considerable progress in school divinity, and entered the lists very early against Luther, this being then the great controversy in fashion, and the grand field wherein all authors, young and old, used to display their abilities. Soon after, he had a share in the dispute which Patrick Hamilton maintained against the ecclesiastics, in favour of the new faith he had imbibed at Marburg. He endeavoured to bring him back to the Catholic religion; but this he could not effect, and even began himself to doubt about his own religion, being much affected by the discourse of this gentleman, and still more by the constancy he showed at the stake, where David Beaton, archbishop of St Andrew's, caused him to be burnt. Beginning thus to waver, he was himself persecuted with so much violence, that he was obliged to retire into Germany, where he became at length a perfect convert to the Protestant religion. The change of religion which happened in England after the marriage of Henry VIII. with Anna Bullen, induced Ales to go to London in 1535. He was highly esteemed by Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury, Latimer, and Thomas Cromwell, who were at that time in high favour with the king. Upon the fall of these favourites, he was obliged to return to Germany; where the elector of Brandenburg appointed him professor of divinity at Frankfort upon the Oder, in 1540. But leaving this place upon some disgust, he returned to Leipzig, where he was chosen professor of divinity, and died in March 1565. He wrote a Commentary on St John, on the Epistles to Timothy, and on the Psalms, &c.","sp":208,"ep":208},{"h":"ALESA","t":"ALESA, or HALESA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Sicily, on the Tyrrhenian sea, built according to Diodorus Siculus, by Archonides of Herbita, in the second year of the 94th Olympiad, or 423 years before Christ; situated on an eminence about a mile from the sea; now in ruins.

Philip, having made himself master of Greece, began to cast his eyes upon Persia, with a view to retaliate upon that haughty empire the injuries of former times. It was the popular topic of the day. But this prince was cut off in the midst of his enterprise. Such, however, was the influence of Alexander in the assembly of the Grecian states, that he was created general of their combined forces in the room of his father. Having made every needful preparation, at the head of a veteran army he invaded Asia. The lieutenants of Darius, who was then king of Persia, opposed him at the river Granicus, where Alexander obtained a complete victory, after which he pursued his march through Asia. At Issus, near Scanderoon, he was met by Darius in person, at the head of a prodigious army. Here he obtained a second victory; and took the camp of Darius, together with his family, whom he treated with the utmost humanity. Contrary to all the maxims of war, instead of pursuing Darius, he made an excursion into Egypt; and, as far as appears, through no better motives than those of vanity. Here he was acknowledged to be the son of Jupiter Ammon. In the mean time Darius recruited his strength, and got together an army superior to what he brought into the plain of Issus.\n\nAlexander having finished his Egyptian expedition, traversed Asia, and passed the Euphrates. At Arbela, a town in Assyria, he met Darius. Here a decisive battle was fought, which put all Persia into the hands of Alexander. His ambition not being satisfied with the conquest of that vast country, he projected an expedition into India. Here he met with great opposition from Porus, a gallant prince, whom in the end he reduced. Beyond the Ganges lay a country still unsubdued. He notified it to his army, that he proposed to pass the river. But these veterans, harassed with their fatigues, and seeing no end of their labour, mutinied, and refused to march further. The disappointed chief was therefore obliged to return. At Babylon he proposed to receive ambassadors, appoint governors, and settle his vast monarchy; but his excesses put an end to his life in the midst of his designs, and in the flower of his age.\n\nThe character of this hero is so familiar to every body, that it is almost needless labour to draw it. All the world knows, says Mr Bayle, that it was equally composed of very great virtues and very great vices. He had no mediocrity in any thing but his stature; in other properties, whether good or bad, he was all extremes. His ambition rose even to madness. His father was not at all mistaken in supposing the bounds of Macedon too small for his son: for how could Macedon bound the ambition of a man, who reckoned the whole world too small a dominion? He wept at hearing the philosopher Anaxarchus say, that there was an infinite number of worlds: his tears were owing to his despair of conquering them all, since he had not yet been able to conquer one. Livy, in a short digression, has attempted to inquire into the events which might have happened, if Alexander, after the conquest of Asia, had brought his arms into Italy? Doubtless things might have taken a very different turn with him; and all the grand projects, which succeeded so well against an effeminate Persian monarch, might easily have miscarried if he had had to do with rough hardy Roman armies. And yet the vast aims of this mighty conqueror, if seen under another point of view, may appear to have been confined in a very narrow compass; since, as we are told, the utmost wish of that great heart, for which the whole earth was not big enough, was, after all, to be praised by the Athenians: for it is related, that the difficulties which he encountered in order to pass the Hydaspes, forced him to cry out, \"O Athenians, could you believe to what dangers I expose myself for the sake of being celebrated by you?\" But Bayle affirms, that this was quite consistent with the vast unbounded extent of his ambition, as he wanted to make all future time his own, and be an object of admiration to the latest posterity; yet did not expect this from the conquest of worlds, but from books. He was perfectly in the right, says Bayle; \"for if Greece had not furnished him with good writers, he would long ago have been as much forgotten as the kings who reigned in Macedon before Amphitryon.\"\n\nAlexander has been praised upon the score of continency, yet his life could not surely be quite regular in that respect. Indeed, the fire of his early youth appeared so cold towards women, that his mother suspected\nAlexander pected him to be impotent; and, to satisfy herself in this point, did, with the consent of Philip, procure a very handsome courtezan to lie with him, whose caresses, however, were all to no purpose. His behaviour afterwards to the Persian captive shows him to have had a great command over himself in this particular. The wife of Darius was a finished beauty; her daughters likewise were all beauties; yet this young prince, who had them in his power, not only bestowed on them all the honours due to their high rank, but managed their reputation with the utmost delicacy. They were kept as in a cloister concealed from the world, and secured from the reach of every dishonourable (not only attack, but) imputation. He did not give the least handle to scandal, either by his visits, his looks, or his words: and for other Persian dames his prisoners, equally beautiful in face and shape, he contented himself with saying gayly, that they gave indeed much pain to his eyes. The Amazon Thalestris could not obtain from him a compliance with her gallant request till after a delay of thirteen days. In the mean time, what are we to conclude from his causing his favourite mistress Pancaste to be drawn naked by Apelles, though it is true he gave her to the painter, who fell in love with her? What of that immoderate love of boys, which Athenaeus relates of him? What of that prodigious number of wives and concubines which he kept?\n\nHis excesses with regard to wine were notorious, and beyond all imagination; and he committed, when drunk, a thousand extravagances. It was owing to wine, that he killed Clitus who saved his life, and burnt Persepolis, one of the most beautiful cities of the East: he did this last indeed at the instigation of the courtezan Thais; but this circumstance made it only the more heinous. It is generally believed, that he died by drinking immoderately: and even Plutarch, who affects to contradict it, owns that he did nothing but drink the whole day he was taken ill.\n\nIn short, to sum up the character of this prince, we cannot be of opinion, that his good qualities did in anywise compensate for his bad ones. Heroes make a noise: their actions glare, and strike the senses forcibly; while the infinite destruction and misery they occasion lie more in the shade, and out of sight. One good legislator is worth all the heroes that ever did or will exist. See Macedon.\n\nAlexander ab Alexandro, a Neapolitan lawyer, of great learning, who flourished toward the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century. He followed the profession of the law first at Naples, afterwards at Rome: but he devoted all the time he could spare to the study of polite literature; and at length he entirely left the bar, that he might lead a more easy and agreeable life with the Muses. The particulars of his life are to be gathered from his work entitled \"Dies Geniales.\" We are there informed, that he lodged at Rome, in a house that was haunted; and he relates many surprising particulars about the ghost. He says also, that when he was very young, he went to the lectures of Philoephus, who explained at Rome the Tufculan questions of Cicero; he was there also when Nicholas Perot and Domitius Calderinus read their lectures upon Martial. The particular time when he died is not known; but he was buried in the monastery of the Olivets. Tiraequa wrote a learned commentary upon his work, which was printed at Lyons in Alexander 1587, and reprinted at Leyden, in 1673, with the notes of Dennis Godfrey, Christopher Colerus, and Nicholas Mercerus.\n\nAlexander, Neckham, an eminent English writer in the 12th and 13th centuries, born at St Albans in Hertfordshire. In 1215 he was made abbot of Exeter, and died in 1227. He wrote several works, which were never published; but they are to be found in manuscript in the libraries of England and other countries.\n\nAlexander, Noel, an indefatigable writer of the 17th century, born at Rouen in Normandy, 1639. After finishing his studies at Rouen, he entered into the order of Dominican friars, and was professed there in 1655. Soon after he went to Paris, to go through a course of philosophy and divinity in the great convent, where he distinguished himself so, that he was appointed to teach philosophy there, which he did for 12 years. M. Colbert showed him many marks of his esteem; and being determined to omit nothing to perfect the education of his son, afterwards archbishop of Rouen, he formed an assembly of the most learned persons, whose conferences upon ecclesiastical history might be of advantage to him. Father Alexander was invited to this assembly, where he exerted himself with so much genius and ability, that he gained the particular friendship of young Colbert, who showed him the utmost regard as long as he lived. These conferences gave rise to Alexander's design of writing an ecclesiastical history; for, being desired to reduce what was material in these conferences to writing, he did it with so much accuracy, that the learned men who composed this assembly, advised him to undertake a complete body of church history. This he executed with great assiduity, collecting and digesting the materials himself, and writing even the tables with his own hand. He at last completed his work in 1686. Towards the latter part of his life, he was afflicted with the loss of his sight; a most inexplicable misfortune to one whose whole pleasure was in study, yet he bore it with great patience and resignation. He died merely of a decay of nature, 1724, in the 86th year of his age.\n\nAlexander Severus, emperor of Rome, succeeded Heliogabalus about A.D. 222, when but 16 years of age. His mother's name was Mamm\u00e6a, and by her advice he in a great measure regulated his conduct. He applied himself to the reformation of abuses, the state having been greatly disordered by the vicious conduct of his predecessor; he was a most strict lover of justice, an encourager of learning and learned men, and favourable to the Christians. He made a successful expedition against the Persians; but endeavouring to reform his troops, who had grown very licentious under the late bad government, they murdered him at the instigation of Maximinus, in the 29th year of his age, together with his mother, A.D. 235.\n\nAlexander VI. Pope, had four bastard children when he was cardinal, for one of which he had so great affection, that he stuck at nothing to raise him. Designing to poison some cardinals, he was poisoned himself, A.D. 1503. See Borgia.\n\nAlexander VII. Pope. See Chigi.\n\nAlexander bishop of Lincoln in the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen, was a Norman by birth, and nephew\nAlexander, phew of the famous Roger, bishop of Salisbury, who first made him archdeacon of Salisbury, and afterwards, by his interest with the king, raised him to the mitre. Alexander was consecrated at Canterbury, July 22, 1123. Having received his education under his uncle the bishop of Salisbury, and been accustomed to a splendid way of living, he affected how and state more than was suitable to his character, or consistent with his fortunes. This failing excepted, he was a man of worth and honour, and every way qualified for his station. The year after his consecration, his cathedral church at Lincoln having been accidentally burnt down, he rebuilt it, and secured it against the like accident for the future by a stone roof. This prelate increased the number of prebends in his church, and augmented its revenues with several manors and estates. In imitation of the barons and some of the bishops, particularly his uncle the bishop of Salisbury, he built three castles; one at Banbury, another at Sleaford, and a third at Newark. He likewise founded two monasteries; one at Haverholme, for regular canons and nuns together, the other at Tame for white friars. He went twice to Rome in the years 1142 and 1144. The first time, he came back in quality of the pope's legate, for the calling a synod, in which he published several wholesome and necessary canons. In August 1147, he took a third journey to the pope, who was then in France; where he fell sick through the excessive heat of the weather, and returning with great difficulty to England, where he died in the 24th year of his prelacy.\n\nAlexander, William, earl of Stirling, an eminent Scots statesman and poet in the reigns of James VI. and Charles I., who, after travelling with the duke of Argyle as his tutor or companion, wrote a poetical complaint of his unsuccessful love of some beauty, under the title of Aurora. He then removed to the court of James VI., where he applied to the more solid parts of poetry, forming himself upon the plan of the Greek and Roman tragedians. In 1607, he published some dramatic performances, entitled The Monarchic Tragedies, dedicated to King James; who so well pleased with them, as to call him his philosophical poet. After this, he is said to have written A Supplement to complete the third part of Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia; and in 1613, he produced a poem called Doomday, or the Great Day of Judgment. He was made gentleman usher to Prince Charles, and master of the requests; was knighted; and obtained a grant of Nova Scotia, where he projected the settlement of a colony, but afterwards sold it to the French. In 1626, he was made secretary of state for Scotland; was created first viscount, and then earl, of Stirling; and died in 1640.\n\nAlexander I., St., whom St. Irenaeus reckons the fifth bishop of Rome, succeeded St. Evaristus in the year 109, and died in the year 119. There is no account of his life; and the epistles which are attributed to him are spurious.\n\nAlexander II., king of Scotland, succeeded his father William in 1213, at 16 years of age. He made an expedition into England, to oppose the tyranny of King John; who returned the visit, and was offered battle by Alexander, but refused it. He took the city of Carlisle from Henry III., which was afterwards exchanged for Berwick. Alexander died in 1249, in the 31st year of his age, and 35th of his reign; and left for his successor, his son\u2014\n\nAlexander III., who was crowned king of Scotland in 1249. The Cummings, a powerful family, took arms against him; and taking him prisoner, confined him at Stirling; but he was afterwards released by his subjects. He married the daughter of Henry III., king of England; and was at length killed by a fall from his horse, on the 10th of April 1290, after having reigned 42, or according to others 37, years.\n\nAlexanders, in Botany. See Smyrnium.\n\nAlexandretta, by the Turks called Scanderoon; a town in Syria, at the extremity of the Mediterranean sea. It is the port of Aleppo, from which it is distant 28 or 30 leagues. It is now, properly speaking, nothing else but a village, without walls, in which the tombs are more numerous than the houses, and which entirely owes its existence to the road which it commands. This is the only road, in all Syria, where vessels anchor on a solid bottom, without their cables being liable to chafe; but in other respects it has many inconveniences. It is infested, during winter, by a peculiar wind, called by the French sailors le Raguier, which, rushing from the snowy summits of the mountains, frequently forces ships to drag their anchors several leagues: And when the snow begins to cover the mountains which surround the gulf, tempestuous winds arise which prevent vessels from entering for three or four months together. The road also to Aleppo by the plain is invested by Curd robbers, who conceal themselves in the neighbouring rocks, and frequently attack and plunder the foreign caravans. But the worst circumstance is the extreme unwholeness of the air, occasioned here by stagnant waters and mephitic exhalations. It may be affirmed that this every year carries off one-third of the crews of the vessels which remain here during the summer; nay, ships frequently lose all their men in two months. The season for this epidemic disorder is principally from May to the end of September: it is an intermitting fever of the most malignant kind; and is accompanied with obstructions of the liver, which terminate in dropsy. To this baneful epidemic, Alexandretta, from its situation, seems to be irremediably condemned: for the plain on which the town is built is so low and flat, that the rivulets, finding no declivity, can never reach the sea. When they are swelled by the winter rains, the sea, swelled likewise by tempests, hinders their discharging themselves into it: hence their waters, forced to spread themselves, form lakes in the plain. On the approach of the summer, the waters becoming corrupted by the heat, exhale vapours equally corrupt, and which cannot disperse, being confined by the mountains that encircle the gulf. The entrance of the bay besides lies to the west, which in those countries is the most unhealthy exposure when it corresponds with the sea. The labour necessary to remedy this would be immense, and after all insufficient; and, indeed, such an undertaking would be absolutely impossible under a government like that of the Turks. A few years ago, Mr Volney informs us, the merchants of Aleppo, disgusted with the numerous inconveniences of Alexandretta, wished to abandon that port and carry the trade\nto Latakia. They proposed to the pasha of Tripoli to repair the harbour at their own expense, provided he would grant them an exemption from all duties for ten years. To induce him to comply with their request, the agent they employed talked much of the advantage which would, in time, result to the whole country: \"But what signifies it to me what may happen in time,\" replied the pasha? I was yesterday at Marach; to-morrow, perhaps, I shall be at Djedda: Why should I deprive myself of present advantages, which are certain, for future benefits I cannot hope to partake?\" The European factors were obliged therefore to remain at Scanderoon. There are three of these factors, two for the French, and one for the English and Venetians. The only curiosity which they have to amuse strangers with consists in five or seven marble monuments, sent from England, on which you read: Here lies such a one, carried off in the flower of his age, by the fatal effects of a contagious air. The flight of these is the more distressing, as the languid air, yellow complexion, livid eyes, and drooping bellies of those who show them, make it too probable they cannot long escape the same fate. It is true, they have some resource in the village of Bailan, the pure air and excellent waters of which surprisingly restore the sick. The aga, for some years past, has applied the duties of the customhouse of Alexandretta to his own use, and rendered himself almost independent of the pasha of Aleppo. The Turkish empire is full of rich rebels, who frequently die in peaceable possession of their usurpations.","sp":209,"ep":212},{"h":"ALEXANDRIA","t":"in Ancient Geography, a mountain of Myfia, on the sea coast, forming a part of Mount Ida, where Paris gave judgment on the three goddesses.","sp":212,"ep":212},{"h":"ALEXANDRIA","t":"now Scandaria, by Athenaeus called \u03a3\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2; a city of Lower Egypt, and for a long time its capital. This city was built by Alexander the Great, soon after the overthrow of Tyre, about 333 years before Christ. It is situated on the Mediterranean, twelve miles west of that mouth of the Nile anciently called Canopicum; and lies in E. Long. 30\u00b0 9' N. Lat. 31\u00b0 10'.\n\nAlexander is said to have been induced to build this city, on account of its being conveniently situated for a fine port; and so sudden was his resolution, that after he had directed where every public structure was to be placed, fixed the number of temples, and the deities to whom they should be dedicated, &c., there were no instruments at hand proper for marking out the walls, according to the custom of those times. Upon this, a workman advised the king to collect what meal was among the soldiers, and to fit it in lines upon the ground, whereby the circuit of the walls would be sufficiently marked out. This advice was followed; and the new method of marking out the walls was, by Aristaean, the king's footlayer, interpreted as a prefigure of the city's abounding with all the necessaries of life. Nor was he deceived in his prediction; for Alexandria soon became the staple, not only for merchandise, but also for all the arts and sciences of the Greeks.\n\nAlexandria was a league and a half long, by one-third in breadth, which made the circumference of its walls about four leagues. Lake Mareotis bathed its walls on the south, and the Mediterranean on the north. It was intersected lengthwise by straight parallel streets. This direction left a free passage to the northerly wind, which alone conveys coolness and salubrity into Egypt. A street of 2000 feet wide began at the gate of the sea, and terminated at the gate of Canopus. It was decorated with magnificent houses, temples, and public buildings. In this extensive range, the eye was never tired with admiring the marble, the porphyry and the obelisks, which were destined at some future day to embellish Rome and Constantinople. This street, the handsomest in the universe, was intersected by another of the same breadth, which formed a square at their junction of half a league in circumference. From the middle of this great place, the two gates were to be seen at once, and vessels arriving under full sail from the north and from the south.\n\nA mole of a mile in length stretched from the continent to the island of Pharos, and divided the harbour into two. That which is to the northward preserved its name. A dike drawn from the island to the rock whereon was built the Pharos, secured it from the westerly winds. The other was called Eunofos, or the Safe Return. The former is called at present the new, the latter the old harbour: a bridge that joins the mole to the city, served for a communication between them. It was raised on lofty pillars sunk into the sea, and left a free passage for ships. The palace, which advanced beyond the promontory of Lochias, extended as far as the dike, and occupied more than a quarter of the city. Each of the Ptolemies added to its magnificence. It contained within its inclosure, the museum, an asylum for learned men, groves, and buildings worthy of royal majesty, and a temple where the body of Alexander was deposited in a golden coffin. The infamous Seleucus Cibyofactes violated this monument, carried off the golden coffin, and put a glass one in its place. In the great harbour was the little island of Anti-Rhodes, where stood a theatre, and a royal place of residence. Within the harbour of Eunofos was a smaller one, called Kiloitos, dug by the hand of man, which communicated with Lake Mareotis by a canal. Between this canal and the palace was the admirable temple of Serapis, and that of Neptune near the great place where the market was held. Alexandria extended likewise along the southern banks of the lake. Its eastern part presented to view the gymnasium, with its porticoes of more than 600 feet long, supported by several rows of marble pillars. Without the gate of Canopus was a spacious circus for the chariot races. Beyond that, the suburb of Nicopolis ran along the foreshore, and seemed a second Alexandria. A superb amphitheatre was built there with a race-ground, for the celebration of the quinquennalia.\n\nSuch is the description left us of Alexandria by the ancients, and above all by Strabo.\n\nThe architect employed by Alexander in this undertaking was the celebrated Dinocrates, who had acquired so much reputation by rebuilding the temple of Diana at Ephesus. The city was first rendered populous by Ptolemy Soter, one of Alexander's captains, who, after the death of the Macedonian monarch, being appointed governor of Egypt, soon assumed the title of king, and took up his residence at Alexandria, about 304 years before Christ.\nAlexandria. In the 35th year of Ptolemy Soter's reign, he took his son Ptolemy Philadelphus partner with him in the empire; and by this prince the city of Alexandria was much embellished. In the first year of his reign the famous watch-tower of Pharos was finished. It had been begun several years before by Ptolemy Soter; and, when finished, was looked upon as one of the wonders of the world. The same year, the island of Pharos itself, originally seven furlongs distant from the continent, was joined to it by a causeway. This was the work of Dexiphanes, who completed it at the same time that his son put the last hand to the tower. The tower was a large square structure of white marble; on the top of which fires were kept constantly burning, for the direction of sailors. The building cost 800 talents; which, if Attic, amounted to 165,000l.; if Alexandrian, to twice that sum.\n\nThe architect employed in this famous structure fell upon the following contrivance to usurp the whole glory to himself.\u2014Being ordered to engrave upon it the following inscription, \"King PTOLEMY to the Gods the Saviours, for the benefit of Sailors;\" instead of the king's name he substituted his own, and then filling up the hollow of the marble with mortar, wrote upon it the above-mentioned inscription. In process of time, the mortar being worn off, the following inscription appeared: \"SOSTRATUS the Cnidian, the son of Dexiphanes, to the Gods the Saviours, for the benefit of Sailors.\"\n\nThis year also was remarkable for the bringing of the image of Serapis from Pontus to Alexandria. It was set up in one of the suburbs of the city called Rhacotis, where a temple was afterwards erected to his honour, suitable to the greatness of that stately metropolis, and called, from the god worshipped there, Serapeum. This structure, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, surpassed in beauty and magnificence all others in the world, except the capitol at Rome.\n\nWithin the verge of this temple was the famous Alexandrian library. It was founded by Ptolemy Soter, for the use of an academy instituted in this city; and, by continual additions by his successors, became at last the finest library in the world, containing no fewer than 700,000 volumes. The method followed in collecting books for this library, was to seize all those which were brought into Egypt by Greeks or other foreigners. The books were transcribed in the museum by persons appointed for that purpose; the copies were then delivered to the proprietors, and the originals laid up in the library. Ptolemy Euergetes, having borrowed from the Athenians the works of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus, returned them only the copies, which he caused to be transcribed in as beautiful a manner as possible; presenting the Athenians at the same time with fifteen talents (upwards of 3000l. sterling) for the exchange.\n\nAs the museum was at first in that quarter of the city called Bruchion, near the royal palace, the library was placed there likewise; but when it came to contain 400,000 volumes, another library, within the Serapeum, was erected by way of supplement to it, and on that account called the daughter of the former. In this second library 300,000 volumes, in process of time, were deposited; and the two together contained the 700,000 volumes already mentioned. In the war carried on by Julius Caesar against the inhabitants of this city, the library in the Bruchion, with the 400,000 volumes it contained, was reduced to ashes. The library in the Serapeum, however, still remained; and here Cleopatra deposited 200,000 volumes of the Pergamene library, which Marc Antony presented her with. These, and others added from time to time, rendered the new library at Alexandria more numerous and considerable than the former; and though it was often plundered during the revolutions and troubles of the Roman empire, yet it was again and again repaired, and filled with the same number of books.\n\nFor 293 years Alexandria was held in subjection by the Ptolemies. Here is a list of these princes, with the dates of their respective reigns.\n\nPtolemy the son of Lagus, surnamed Soter, reigned 39 years, and died in the year of the world 3720. Ptolemy Philadelphus reigned 39 years, and died in 3758. Ptolemy Euergetes reigned 25 years, and died in 3783. Ptolemy Philopater reigned 17 years, and died in 3850. Ptolemy Epiphanes reigned 24 years, and died in 3824. Ptolemy Philometor reigned 37 years, and died in 3861. Ptolemy Euergetes, or Philocon, reigned 53 years, part with his brother Philometor and part alone. He died in 3888. Ptolemy Lathyrus reigned 36 years six months. He died in 3923. Cleopatra, the daughter of Lathyrus and wife of Alexander I., reigned six months. Alexander I., the nephew of Lathyrus, was established in 3924, and died in 3943. Alexander II., the son of Alexander I., was dethroned by the Alexandrians in 3939. Ptolemy Nothus, or Auletes, the son of Lathyrus, reigned 13 years, and died in 3953. Ptolemy, surnamed Dionysius or Bacchus, reigned three years eight months, and died in 3957. Cleopatra reigned from 3957, and killed herself in 3974.\n\nThis city, as we have already observed, soon became extremely populous, and was embellished both by its own princes and the Romans; but, like most other noted cities of antiquity, hath been the seat of terrible massacres. About 141 years before Christ, it was almost totally depopulated by Ptolemy Phyfeon. That barbarous monster, without the least provocation, gave free liberty to his guards to plunder his metropolis and murder the inhabitants at their pleasure. The cruelties practised on this occasion cannot be expressed; and the few who escaped were so terrified that they fled into other countries. Upon this, Phyfeon, that he might not reign over empty houses, invited thither strangers from the neighbouring countries; by whom the city was repeopled, and soon recovered its former splendour. On this occasion many learned men having been obliged to fly, proved the means of reviving learning in Greece, Asia Minor, the islands of the Archipelago, and other places, where it was almost totally lost.\n\nThe new inhabitants were not treated with much more kindness by Phyfeon than the old ones had been; for, on their complaining of his tyrannical behaviour, he resolved on a general massacre of the young men. Accordingly, when they were one day assembled in the gymnastum, or place of their public exercises, he ordered it to be set on fire; so that they all perished.\nAlexandria, ed., either in the flames, or by the swords of his mercenaries, whom the tyrant had placed at all the avenues.\n\nThough Julius Caesar was obliged to carry on a war for some time against this city, it seems not to have suffered much damage, except the burning of the library already mentioned. Before Caesar left Alexandria, in acknowledgment of the affiance he had received from the Jews, he confirmed all their privileges there, and even engraved his decree on a pillar of brass. This, however, did not prevent the massacre of 50,000 of them in this city about the year of Christ 67.\n\nThe city of Alexandria seems to have fallen into decay soon after this, and to have forfeited many of its ancient privileges, though for what offence is not known; but when Adrian visited Egypt, about the year 141, it was almost totally ruined. He repaired both the public and private buildings, not only restoring the inhabitants to their ancient privileges, but heaping new favours upon them; for which they returned him their solemn thanks, and conferred upon him what honours they could while he was present; but as soon as he was gone, they published the most bitter and virulent lampoons against him.\n\nThe fickle and satirical humour of the Alexandrians was highly disliked by Adrian, though he inflicted no punishment upon them for it; but when they lampooned Caracalla, he did not let them escape so easily. That tyrant, in the year 215, when he visited their city, having become the subject of their foolish satires, ordered a general massacre by his numerous troops, who were dispersed all over the city. The inhuman orders being given, all were murdered, without distinction of age or sex; so that in one night's time the whole city floated in blood, and every house was filled with carcasses. The monster who occasioned this had retired during the night to the temple of Serapis, to implore the protection of that deity; and, not yet satisfied with slaughter, commanded the massacre to be continued all the next day; so that very few of the inhabitants remained. As if even this had not been sufficient, he stripped the city of all its ancient privileges; suppressed the academy; ordered all strangers who lived there to depart; and that the few who remained might not have the satisfaction of seeing one another, he cut off all communication of one street with another, by walls built for that purpose, and guarded by troops left there.\n\nNotwithstanding this terrible disaster, Alexandria soon recovered its former splendour, as Caracalla was murdered a short time after. It was long esteemed the first city in the world, next to Rome; and we may judge of its magnificence, and the multitude of people contained in it, from the account of Diodorus Siculus, who relates, that in his time (44 years before Christ) Alexandria had on its rolls 300,000 freemen. Towards the middle of the fifth century, Amrou Ebn al Aas, Omar's general, took it by storm, after a siege of 14 months, and with the loss of 23,000 men. Heraclius, then emperor of Constantinople, did not send a single ship to its assistance. This prince affords an example very rare in history; he had displayed some vigour in the first year of his reign, and then suffered himself to be lulled into idleness and effeminacy. Awakened suddenly from his lethargy by the noise of the conquests of Cosroes, that scourge of the east, he Alexandria put himself at the head of his armies, distinguished himself as a great captain from his very first campaign, laid waste Persia for seven years, and returned to his capital covered with laurels: he then became a theologian on the throne, lost all his energy, and amused himself the rest of his life with disputing upon Monotheism, whilst the Arabs were robbing him of the finest provinces of his empire. Deaf to the cries of the unfortunate inhabitants of Alexandria, as he had been to those of the people of Jerusalem, who defended themselves for two years, he left them a sacrifice to the fortunate ascendant of the indefatigable Amrou. All their intrepid youth perished with their arms in their hands.\n\nThe victor, astonished at his conquest, wrote to the caliph, \"I have taken the city of the west. It is of an immense extent. I cannot describe to you how many wonders it contains. There are 4000 palaces, 4000 baths, 12,000 dealers in fresh oil, 12,000 gardeners, 40,000 Jews who pay tribute, 400 theatres or places of amusement.\"\n\nAt this time, according to the Arabian historians, Alexandria consisted of three cities, viz. Menna, or the port, which included Pharos, and the neighbouring parts; Alexandria, properly so called, where the modern Scardina now stands; and Nebita, probably the Necropolis of Josephus and Strabo.\n\nAt that time John, surnamed the grammarian, a famous Peripatetic philosopher, being in the city, and in high favour with Amrou Ebn al Aas the Saracen general, begged of him the royal library. Amrou replied, that it was not in his power to grant such a request; but that he would write to the caliph on that head; since, without knowing his pleasure, he dared not to dispose of a single book. He accordingly wrote to Omar, who was then caliph, acquainting him with the request of his friend: To which the ignorant tyrant replied, That if those books contained the same doctrine with the Koran, they could be of no use, since the Koran contained all necessary truths; but if they contained any thing contrary to that book, they ought not to be suffered; and therefore, whatever their contents were, he ordered them to be destroyed. Pursuant to this order, they were distributed among the public baths; where, for the space of six months, they served to supply the fires of those places, of which there was an incredible number in Alexandria.\n\nAfter the city was taken, Amrou thought proper to pursue the Greeks who had fled farther up the country; and therefore marched out of Alexandria, leaving but a very slender garrison in the place. The Greeks, who had before fled on board their ships, being apprised of this, returned on a sudden, surprized the town, and put all the Arabs they found therein to the sword; but Amrou, receiving advice of what had happened, suddenly returned, and drove them out of it with great slaughter; after which the Greeks were so intimidated, that he had nothing farther to fear from them.\u2014A few years after, however, Amrou being deprived of his government by the caliph Othman, the Egyptians were so much displeased with his dismission that they inclined to a revolt; and Constantine the Greek emperor, having received intelligence of their disaffection, began to meditate the reduction of Alexandria. For this purpose,\nAlexandria, he sent one Manuel, an eunuch, and his general, with a powerful army, to retake that place; which, by the affluence of the Greeks in the city, who kept a secret correspondence with the imperial forces while at sea, and joined them as soon as they had made a descent, he effected, without any considerable effusion of Christian blood. The caliph, now perceiving his mistake, immediately restored Amrou to his former dignity. This step was very agreeable to the natives; who having had experience of the military skill and bravery of this renowned general, and apprehending that they should be called to an account by the Greeks for their former perfidious conduct, had petitioned Othman to send him again into Egypt.\u2014Upon Amrou's arrival, therefore, at Alexandria, the Copts or natives, with the traitor Al-Mokawwas (who had formerly betrayed to Amrou the fortresses of Mefr) at their head, not only joined him, but supplied him with all kinds of provisions, exciting him to attack the Greeks without delay. This he did; and, after a most obstinate dispute which lasted several days, drove them into the town, where, for some time, they defended themselves with great bravery, and repelled the utmost efforts of the besiegers. This so exasperated Amrou, that he swore, \"If God enabled him to conquer the Greeks, he would throw down the walls of the city, and make it as easy of access as the house of a prostitute.\" Nor did he fail to execute his threat; for having taken the town by storm, he quite dismantled it, entirely demolishing the walls and fortifications. The lives of the citizens, however, were spared, at least as far as lay in the general's power; but many of them were put to the sword by the soldiers on their first entrance. In one quarter particularly, Amrou found them butchering the Alexandrians with unrelenting barbarity; to which, however, by his clement intervention, he put a stop, and on that spot erected a mosque, which he called the mosque of mercy.\n\nFrom this time Alexandria never recovered its former splendour. It continued under the dominion of the caliphs till the year 924, when it was taken by the Magrebians, two years after its great church had been destroyed by fire. This church was called by the Arabs Al-Kafaria, or Cofarea; and had formerly been a pagan temple, erected in honour of Saturn by the famous queen Cleopatra.\n\nThe city was soon after abandoned by the Magrebians; but in 928 they again made themselves masters of it; their fleet being afterwards defeated by that belonging to the caliph, Abul Kafem the Magrebian general retired from Alexandria, leaving there only a garrison of 300 men; of which Thmaal, the caliph's admiral, being apprised, he in a few days appeared before the town, and carried off the remainder of the inhabitants to an island in the Nile called Abuqir. This was done to prevent Abul Kafem from meeting with any entertainment at Alexandria, in case he should think proper to return. According to Eutychius, above 200,000 of the miserable inhabitants perished this year.\n\nWhat contributed to raise Alexandria to such a prodigious height of splendour as it enjoyed for a long time, was its being the centre of commerce between the eastern and western parts of the world. It was with the view of becoming master of this lucrative trade, that Alexander built this city, after having extirpated the Tyrians who formerly engrossed all the East India traffic. Of the immense riches which that trade afforded, we may form an idea, from considering that the Romans accounted it a point of policy to oppress the Egyptians, especially the Alexandrians; and after the defeat of Zenobia, there was a single merchant of Alexandria who undertook to raise and pay an army out of the profits of his trade. The Greek emperors drew prodigious tributes from Egypt, and yet the caliphs found their subjects in so good circumstances as to screw up their revenues to three hundred millions of crowns.\n\nThough the revolutions which happened in the government of Egypt, after it fell into the hands of the Mahometans, frequently affected this city to a very great degree; yet still the excellence of its port, and the innumerable conveniences resulting from the East India trade, to whomsoever were masters of Egypt, preserved Alexandria from total destruction, even when in the hands of the most barbarous nations. Thus, in the 13th century, when the barbarism introduced by the Goths, &c., began to wear off from the European nations, and they acquired a taste for the elegancies of life, the old mart of Alexandria began to revive; and the port, though far from recovering its former magnificence, grew once more famous by becoming the centre of commerce: but having fallen under the dominion of the Turks, and the paillage round the Cape of Good Hope being discovered by the Portuguese in 1499, a fatal blow was given to the Alexandrian commerce, and the city has since fallen into decay.\n\nAt present, the city of Alexandria is reckoned to have about 14,000 or 15,000 inhabitants; a strange conglomeration of different nations, as well as from various parts of the Turkish empire. They are in general given to thieving and cheating; and (like their predecessors) fedulous above all others, were they not kept in awe by the severity of their government. The British and French carry on a considerable commerce with them, and have each a confidant residing here. Some Venetian ships also sail thither yearly, but with French colours, and under the protection of France. The subjects of those kingdoms which keep no confidant here, are subjected to a tax by the Grand Signior: but the Jews have found out a method of indemnifying themselves for this disadvantage; namely, by selling their commodities cheaper than other foreigners can afford. They are also favoured by the farmers of the revenue; who know, that if they do not pay some private regard to them, the Jews have it in their power to cause fewer merchandizes come into their port during the two years that their farm lasts.\n\nThe present city is a kind of peninsula situated between the two ports. That to the westward was called by the ancients the Portus Eumolpus, now the Old Port, and is by far the best; Turkish vessels only are allowed to anchor there: the other called the New Port, is for the Christians; at the extremity of one of the arms of which stood the famous Pharos. The New Port, the only harbour for Europeans, is clogged up with sand, infomuch that in stormy weather ships are liable to bilge; and the bottom being also rocky, the cables soon chafe and part; so that one vessel driving against a second, and that against a third, they are perhaps all lost. Of this there was a fatal instance some years ago, when 42 vessels were dashed to pieces on the mole.\nAlexandria, in a gale of wind from the north-west, and numbers have been since lost there at different times. If it be asked in Europe, Why do they not repair the New Port? the answer is, That in Turkey they destroy everything, and repair nothing. The old harbour will be destroyed likewise, as the ballast of vessels has been continually thrown into it for the last 200 years. The spirit of the Turkish government is to ruin the labours of past ages, and destroy the hopes of future times, because the barbarity of ignorant despotic never considers tomorrow.\n\nIn time of war, Alexandria is of no importance; no fortification is to be seen; even the Farillon, with its lofty towers, cannot be defended. It has not four cannon fit for service, nor a gunner who knows how to point them. The 500 janizaries, who should form the garrison, reduced to half that number, know nothing but how to smoke a pipe. But Alexandria is a place of which the conquest would be of no value. A foreign power could not maintain itself there, as the country is without water. This must be brought from the Nile by the kalidj, or canal of 12 leagues, which conveys it thither every year at the time of the inundation. It fills the vaults or reservoirs dug under the ancient city, and this provision must serve till the next year. It is evident, therefore, that were a foreign power to take possession, the canal would be shut, and all supplies of water cut off. It is this canal alone which connects Alexandria with Egypt; for from its situation without the Delta, and the nature of the soil, it really belongs to the deserts of Africa. Its environs are sandy, flat, and sterile, without trees and without houses; where we meet with nothing but the plant which yields the kali, and a row of palm trees which follows the course of the kalidj or canal.\n\nThe city is governed like others in the same kingdom. (See Egypt.) It hath a small garrison of soldiers, part of which are Janizaries and Affairs; who are very haughty and insolent, not only to strangers, but to the mercantile and industrious part of the people, though ever so considerable and useful. The government is so remiss in favour of these wretches, that Mr Norden informs us, one of them did not hesitate to kill a farmer of the customs, for refusing to take leave of him than the duty imposed, and went off unpunished; it being a common salvo among them, that what is done cannot be undone.\n\nThe present condition of Alexandria is very despicable, being now so far ruined, that the rubbish in many places overtops the houses. The famous tower of Pharos has long since been demolished, and a castle, called Farillon, built in its place. The causeway which joined the island to the continent is broken down, and its place supplied by a stone bridge of several arches.\n\nSome parts of the old walls of the city are yet standing, and present us with a masterpiece of ancient masonry. They are flanked with large towers, about 200 paces distant from each other, with smaller ones in the middle. Below are magnificent cafemates, which may serve for galleries to walk in. In the lower part of the towers is a large square hall, whose roof is supported by thick columns of Thebaic stone. Above this are several rooms, over which there are platforms more than 20 paces square. The ancient reservoirs, vaulted with so much art, which extend under the whole town, Alexandria are almost entire at the end of 2000 years.\n\nOf Caesar's palace there remain only a few porphyry pillars, and the front, which is almost entire, and looks very beautiful. The palace of Cleopatra was built upon the walls facing the port, having a gallery on the outside, supported by several fine columns. Not far from this palace are two obelisks vulgarly called Cleopatra's Needles. They are of Thebaic stone, and covered with hieroglyphics. One is overturned, broken, and lying under the sand; the other is on its pedestal. These two obelisks, each of them of a single stone, are about 60 feet high, by seven feet square at the base. Denon, who went to Egypt along with the French army in 1798, supposes that these columns decorated the entrance of the palace of the Ptolemies, the ruins of which still exist at no great distance from the place of the obelisks. Towards the gate of Rosetta, are five columns of marble on the place formerly occupied by the porticoes of the gymnasium. The rest of the colonnade, the design of which was discoverable 100 years ago by Mallett, has since been destroyed by the barbarism of the Turks.\n\nBut what most engages the attention of travellers is the pillar of Pompey, as it is commonly called, situated at a quarter of a league from the southern gate. It is composed of red granite. The capital is Corinthian, with palm leaves, and not indented. It is nine feet high. The shaft and the upper member of the base are of one piece of 90 feet long, and 9 in diameter. The base is a square of about 15 feet on each side. This block of marble, 60 feet in circumference, rests on two layers of stone bound together with lead; which, however, has not prevented the Arabs from forcing out several of them, to search for an imaginary treasure. The whole column is 114 feet high. It is perfectly well polished, and only a little chipped on the eastern side. Nothing can equal the majesty of this monument; seen from a distance, it overtops the town, and serves as a signal for vessels. Approaching it nearer, it produces an astonishment mixed with awe. One can never be tired with admiring the beauty of the capital, the length of the shaft, nor the extraordinary simplicity of the pedestal. This last has been somewhat damaged by the instruments of travellers, who are curious to possess a relic of this antiquity; and one of the volutes of the column was immaturely brought down about twelve years ago, by a prank of some English captains, which is thus related by Mr Irwin.\n\nThese jolly sons of Neptune had been pushing about the cannon board one of the ships in the harbour, until a strange freak entered into one of their brains. The eccentricity of the thought occasioned it immediately to be adopted; and its apparent impossibility was but a spur for the putting it into execution. The boat Voyage and was ordered; and with proper implements for the attempt, these enterprising heroes pushed ashore, to drink a bowl of punch on the top of Pompey's pillar! At the spot they arrived; and many contrivances were proposed to accomplish the desired point. But their labour was vain; and they began to despair of success, when the genius who struck out the frolic happily suggested the means of performing it. A man was dispatched\nAlexandria-patched to the city for a paper kite. The inhabitants were by this time apprized of what was going forward, and flocked in crowds to be witnesses of the address and boldness of the English. The governor of Alexandria was told that these seamen were about to pull down Pompey's pillar. But whether he gave them credit for their respect to the Roman warrior, or to the Turkish government, he left them to themselves; and politely answered, that the English were too great patriots to injure the remains of Pompey. He knew little, however, of the disposition of the people who were engaged in this undertaking. Had the Turkish empire risen in opposition, it would not perhaps at that moment have deterred them. The kite was brought, and flown so directly over the pillar, that when it fell on the other side, the string lodged upon the capital. The chief obstacle was now overcome. A two-inch rope was tied to one end of the string, and drawn over the pillar by the end to which the kite was affixed. By this rope one of the seamen ascended to the top; and in less than an hour a kind of shroud was constructed, by which the whole company went up, and drank their punch amid the shouts of the astonished multitude. To the eye below, the capital of the pillar does not appear capable of holding more than one man upon it; but our seamen found it could contain no less than eight persons very conveniently. It is astonishing that no accident befell these madcaps, in a situation so elevated, that would have turned a landsman giddy in his sober senses. The only detriment which the pillar received, was the loss of the volute before mentioned; which came down with a thundering sound, and was carried to England by one of the captains, as a present to a lady who commissioned him for a piece of the pillar. The discovery which they made amply compensated for this mischief; as without their evidence, the world would not have known at this hour, that there was originally a statue on this pillar, one foot and ankle of which are still remaining. The statue must have been of a gigantic size; to have appeared of a man's proportion at so great an height.\n\nThere are circumstances in this story which might give it an air of fiction, were it not demonstrated beyond all doubt. Besides the testimonies of many eyewitnesses, the adventurers themselves have left us a token of the fact, by the initials of their names, which are very legible in black paint just beneath the capital.\n\nLearned men and travellers have made many fruitless attempts to discover in honour of what prince it was erected. The best informed have concluded, that it could not be in honour of Pompey, since neither Strabo nor Diodorus Siculus have spoken of it. The Arabian Abulfeda, in his Description of Egypt, calls it the Pillar of Severus. And history informs us*, that this emperor visited the city of Alexandria: That he granted a senate to its inhabitants, who until that time, under the subjection of a single Roman magistrate, had lived without any national council, as under the reign of the Ptolemies, when the will of the prince was their only law: That he did not confine his benefactions there; he changed several laws in their favour.* This column, therefore, Mr Savary concludes to have been erected by the inhabitants as a mark of their gratitude to Severus. And in a Greek inscription, now half effaced, but visible on the west side when the sun shines upon it, and which probably was legible Alexandria, in the time of Abulfeda, he supposes the name of Severus to have been preserved. He further observes, that this was not the only monument erected to him by the gratitude of the Alexandrians: for there is still seen in the midst of the ruins of Antinoe, built by Adrian, a magnificent pillar, the inscription on which is still remaining, dedicated to Alexander Severus.\n\nDenon whom we have already quoted, seems to be of a different opinion. \"We passed (says he) near Pompey's pillar. This monument is in the predicament of almost everything famous, which loses on a near scrutiny. It was named Pompey's pillar in the fifteenth century, when learning began to recover itself from the torpid state in which it had so long languished. At that epoch, men of science, but not observers, bestowed names on all the monuments; and these names have been handed down by tradition, and without being disputed, from century to century. A monument had been raised to Pompey at Alexandria: it had disappeared, and was thought to be recovered in this pillar or column, which has since been converted into a trophy erected to the memory of Septimius Severus. It is, however, placed on the ruins of the ancient city; and in the time of Septimius Severus, the city of the Ptolemies was not in a ruinous state. To support this column by a solid foundation, an obelisk has been sunk in the earth, on which is placed a very clumsy pedestal, having a fine shaft, and surmounted by a Corinthian capital of bad workmanship.\n\n\"If the shaft of this column, separating it from the pedestal and the capital, once belonged to an ancient edifice, it is an evidence of its magnificence, and of the skill with which it was executed. It ought therefore to be said, that what is called Pompey's pillar, is a fine column, and not a fine monument. It should be said, that the column of St Maria Maggiore, notwithstanding it is one of the finest in existence, has not the character of a monument; that it is merely a fragment; and that, if the columns of Trajan and Antoninus are not in the same predicament, it is because they appear as colossal cylinders, on which the history of the glorious expeditions of these two emperors is pompously displayed, and which, if reduced to their simple form and dimensions, would be nothing more than dull and heavy monuments.\n\n\"The earth about the foundations of Pompey's pillar having been cleared away by time, two fragments of an obelisk of white marble, the only monument of that substance which I have seen in Egypt, have been added to the original base, to render it more solid.\n\n\"Excavations made round the circumference of this column, would, no doubt, afford some information relative to its origin. The shaking of the earth, and the form it takes on treading on it, seem to attest that these researches would not be fruitless. They would perhaps discover the base and atrium of the portico to which this column belonged, which has been the subject of dissertations made by literati who have seen the drawings only, or whose information has been limited to the descriptions of travellers. These travellers have neglected to apprise them, that fragments of columns of the same substance and diameter are found in the vicinity; and that the shaking of the earth indicates the destruction of great edifices buried beneath, the forms of\nALE\n\nAlexandria which may be distinguished on the surface, such as a square of a considerable size, and a large circus, the principal dimensions of which may be measured, notwithstanding it is covered with sand and ruins.\n\n\"After having observed that the column, entitled Pompey's pillar, is very chaste both in style and execution; that the pedestal and capital are not formed of the same granite as the shaft; that their workmanship is heavy, and appears to be merely a rough draught; and that the foundations, made up of fragments, indicate a modern construction; it may be concluded, that this monument is not antique, and that it may have been erected either in the time of the Greek emperors, or of the caliphs; since, if the capital and pedestal are well enough wrought to belong to the former of these periods, they are not so perfect but that art may have reached so far in the latter.\" (Denon's Travels.)\n\nOn the south-west side of the city, at a mile's distance, are situated the catacombs, the ancient burial-place of Alexandria; and although they cannot be compared to those of the ancient Memphis, which the Arabs will not permit to be visited, in order to make the better market of their mummies, it is probable that, the method of embalming being the same, the form of these catacombs can only differ in their proportions. The Baron de Tott, in describing these, observes, \"that Nature not having furnished this part of Egypt with a ridge of rocks, like that which runs parallel with the Nile above Delta, the ancient inhabitants of Alexandria could only have an imitation by digging into a bed of solid rock; and thus they formed Necropolis, or \"City of the Dead.\" The excavation is from 30 to 40 feet wide, and 200 long, and 25 deep, and is terminated by gentle declivities at each end. The sides, cut perpendicularly, contain several openings, about 10 or 12 feet in width and height, hollowed horizontally; and which form, by their different branches, subterranean streets. One of these, which curiosity has disencumbered from the ruins and sands that render the entrance of others difficult or impossible, contains no mummies, but only the places they occupied. The order in which they were ranged is still to be seen. Niches, 20 inches square, sunk six feet horizontally, narrowed at the bottom, and separated from each other by partitions in the rock, seven or eight inches thick, divide into checkers the two walls of this subterranean vault. It is natural to suppose, from this disposition that each mummy was introduced with the feet foremost into the cell intended for its reception; and that new streets were opened, in proportion as these dead inhabitants of Necropolis increased.\" This observation, he adds, which throws a light on the catacombs of Memphis, may perhaps likewise explain the vast size and multitude, as well as the different elevations, of the pyramids in the Higher and Lower Egypt.\n\nAbout 70 paces from Pompey's pillar is the khalis or the canal of the Nile, which was dug by the ancient Egyptians, to convey the water of the Nile to Alexandria, and fill the cisterns under the city. On the side of the khalis are gardens full of orange and lemon trees, and the fields are full of caper and palm trees. On the top of a hill is a tower, on which a sentinel is always placed, to give notice, by means of a flag, of the ships that are coming into the port. From this hill may be seen the sea, the whole extent Alexandria of the city, and the parts round it.\n\nIn going along the sea-coast, there is a large basin cut out of the rock that lines the shore. On the sides of this basin, two beautiful palaces are hewn out by the chisel, with benches that run across them. A canal made zig-zag, for the purpose of stopping the sand by its different windings, conveys into them the water of the sea, as pure and transparent as crystal. Seated on the stone-bench, the water rises a little above the waist; while the feet softly repose on a fine sand. The waves of the sea are heard roaring against the rock, and foaming in the canal. The swell enters, raises you up, and leaves you; and thus alternately entering and retiring, brings a continual fresh supply of water, and a coolness which is truly delicious under a burning sky. This place is vulgarly called the Bath of Cleopatra. Some ruins announce that it was formerly ornamented.\n\nIn 1798 Alexandria was taken by the French under the command of Bonaparte. It fell into the hands of the British army in the year 1801, but by an article in the treaty of peace, dictated probably by mutual jealousy, it is to be restored to the Ottoman Porte, and again subjected to the barbarous policy of the Turkish government.\n\nAlexandria is about 50 leagues north of Cairo. E. Long. 31. 15. N. Lat. 31. 12.\n\nAlexandria, a strong and considerable city of Italy, belonging to the duchy of Milan, with a good castle, built in 1178 in honour of Pope Alexander III. This pope made it a bishopric, with several privileges and exemptions. Prince Eugene of Savoy took this city in 1706, after three days siege.

He distinguished himself during the reign of his brother Ethelred, in several engagements against the Danes; and upon his death succeeded to the crown, in the year 871, and the 22d of his age. At his ascending the throne, he found himself involved in a dangerous war with the Danes, and placed in such circumstances of distress as called for the greatest valour, resolution, and all the other virtues with which he was adorned. The Danes had already penetrated into the heart of his kingdom; and before he had been a month upon the throne, he was obliged to take the field against those formidable enemies. After many battles gained on both sides, he was at length reduced to the greatest distress, and was entirely abandoned by his subjects. In this situation, Alfred, conceiving himself no longer a king, laid aside all marks of royalty, and took shelter in the house of one who kept his cattle. He retired afterwards to the isle of \u00c6thelingey in Somersetshire, where he built a fort for the security of himself, his family, and the few faithful servants who repaired thither to him. When he had been about a year in this retreat, having been informed that some of his subjects had routed a great army of the Danes, killed their chiefs, and taken their magical standard (a), he issued his letters, giving notice where he was, and inviting his nobility to come and consult with him. Before they came to a final determination, Alfred, putting on the habit of a harp-\n\n(a) \"This (says Sir John Spelman) was a banner, with the image of a raven magically wrought by the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, on purpose for their expedition, in revenge of their father Lodebroch's murder, made, they say, almost in an instant, being by them at once begun and finished in a moment, and believed by the Danes to have carried great fatality with it, for which it was highly esteemed by them. It is pretended, that, being carried in battle, towards good success it would always seem to clap its wings, and make as if it would fly; but towards the approach of misfortune, it would hang down and not move.\" (Life of Alfred, p. 61.)\n\n(b) The Danes had possessed themselves of London in the time of his father; and had held it till now as a convenient place for them to land at, and fortify themselves in; neither was it taken from them but by a close siege. However, when it came into the king's hands, it was in a miserable condition, scarce habitable, and all its fortifications ruined. The king, moved by the importance of the place, and the desire of strengthening his frontier against the Danes, restored it to its ancient splendour. And observing, that through the confusion of the times, many, both Saxons and Danes, lived in a loose disorderly manner, without owning any government, he offered them now a comfortable establishment, if they would submit and become his subjects. This proposition was better received than he expected; for multitudes growing weary of a vagabond kind of life, joyfully accepted such an offer. (Chron. Sax. p. 88.)\nenemy, he obliged the Danes, settled in Northumberland and Essex, to give him hostages for their good behaviour. He then moved towards the invaders, and pitched his camp between their armies, to prevent their junction. A great body, however, moved off to Essex; and crossing the river, came to Farnham in Surrey, where they were defeated by the king's forces. Meanwhile the Danes settled in Northumberland, in breach of treaty, and notwithstanding the hostages given, equipped two fleets; and, after plundering the northern and southern coasts, failed to Exeter, and besieged it. The king, as soon as he received intelligence, marched against them; but before he reached Exeter, they had got possession of it. He kept them, however, blocked up on all sides; and reduced them at last to such extremities, that they were obliged to eat their horses, and were even ready to devour each other. Being at length rendered desperate, they made a general fall on the besiegers; but were defeated, though with great loss on the king's side. The remainder of this body of Danes fled into Essex, to the fort they had built there, and to their ships. Before Alfred had time to recruit himself, another Danish leader, whose name was Lof, came with a great army out of Northumberland, and destroyed all before him, marching on to the city of Werheal in the west, which is supposed to be Chester, where they remained the rest of that year. The year following they invaded North-Wales; and after having plundered and destroyed everything, they divided, one body returning to Northumberland, another into the territories of the East-Angles; from whence they proceeded to Essex, and took possession of a small island called Meresig. Here they did not long remain; for having separated, some sailed up the river Thames, and others up the Lea-road; where drawing up their ships, they built a fort not far from London, which proved a great check upon the citizens, who went in a body and attacked it, but were repulsed with great loss: at harvest time the king himself was obliged to encamp with a body of troops in the neighbourhood of the city, in order to cover the reapers from the excursions of the Danes. As he was one day riding by the side of the river Lea, after some observations he began to think that the Danish ships might be laid quite dry: this he attempted, and succeeded; so that the Danes deserted their fort and ships, and marched away to the banks of the Severn, where they built a fort, and wintered at a place called Quatbrig (c). Such of the Danish ships as could be got off, the Londoners carried into their own road; the rest they burnt and destroyed.\n\nAlfred enjoyed a profound peace during the three last years of his reign, which he chiefly employed in establishing and regulating his government, for the security of himself and his successors, as well as the ease and benefit of his subjects in general. After a troublesome reign of 28 years, he died on the 28th of October A.D. 900; and was buried at Winchester, in Hyde Abbey, under a monument of porphyry.\n\nAll our historians agree in distinguishing him as one of the most valiant, wisest, and best of kings that ever reigned in England; and it is also generally allowed, that he not only digested several particular laws still in being, but that he laid the first foundation of our present happy constitution. There is great reason to believe that we are indebted to this prince for trials by juries; and the Doomsday book, which is preserved in the exchequer, is thought to be no more than another edition of Alfred's book of Winchester, which contained a survey of the kingdom. It is said also, that he was the first who divided the kingdom into shires. What is ascribed to him is not a bare division of the country, but the settling a new form of judicature; for after having divided his dominions into shires, he subdivided each shire into three parts, called tythings. There are some remains of this ancient division in the ridings of Yorkshire, the laths of Kent, and the three parts of Lincolnshire. Each tything was divided into hundreds or wapentakes; and these again into tythings or dwellings of ten householders: each of these householders stood engaged to the king, as a pledge for the good behaviour of his family, and all the ten were mutually pledges for each other; so that if any one of the tythings was suspected of an offence, if the head boroughs or chiefs of the tythings would not be security for him, he was imprisoned; and, if he made his escape, the tything and hundred were fined to the king. Each shire was under the government of an earl, under whom was the reeve, his deputy; since, from his office, called foire-reeve, or sheriff. And so effectual were these regulations, that it is said he caused bracelets of gold to be hung up in the highways, as a challenge to robbers; and they remained untouched.\n\nIn private life, Alfred was the most amiable man in his dominions; of so equal a temper, that he never suffered either fadness or unbecoming gaiety to enter his mind; but appeared always of a calm, yet cheerful disposition, familiar to his friends, just even to his enemies, kind and tender to all. He was a remarkable economist of his time; and Asserius has given us an account of the method he took for dividing and keeping an account of it: he caused six wax-candles to be made, each of 12 inches long, and of as many ounces weight; on the candles the inches were regularly marked, and having found that one of them burnt just four hours, he committed them to the care of the keepers of his chapel, who from time to time gave him notice how the hours went: but as in windy weather the candles were wasted by the impression of the air on the flame, to remedy this inconvenience, he invented lanterns, there being then no glass in his dominions.\n\nThis prince, we are told, was 12 years of age before a master could be procured in the western kingdom.\n\n---\n\n(c) The king's contrivance is thought to have produced the meadow between Hertford and Bow; for at Hertford was the Danish fort, and from thence they made frequent excursions on the inhabitants of London. Authors are not agreed as to the method the king pursued in laying dry the Danish ships: Dugdale supposes that he did it by straightening the channels; but Henry of Huntingdon alleges, that he cut several canals, which exhausted its water.\nAlfred, to teach him the alphabet; such was the state of learning when Alfred began to reign. He had felt the misery of ignorance; and determined even to rival his contemporary Charlemagne in the encouragement of literature. He supposed to have appointed persons to read lectures at Oxford, and is hence considered as the founder of that university. By other proper establishments, and by a general encouragement to men of abilities, he did every thing in his power to diffuse knowledge throughout his dominions. Nor was this end promoted more by his countenance and encouragement than by his own example and his writings. For notwithstanding the lateness of his initiation, he had acquired extraordinary erudition; and, had he not been illustrious as a king, he would have been famous as an author. His works are, 1. Breviarium quoddam collectum ex Legibus Trajanorum, &c. Lib. i. A Breviary collected out of the laws of the Trojans, Greeks, Britons, Saxons, and Danes, in one book.

Paulinus Orosius's History of the Pagans. 3. St Gregory's Pastoral, &c. The first of these, with his prefaces to the others, together with his laws, were printed at Cambridge, 1644.

Algebra is a general method of reasoning, concerning the relations which magnitudes of every kind bear to each other in respect of quantity. It is sometimes called universal arithmetic; its first principles and operations being similar to those of common arithmetic. The symbols which it employs to denote magnitudes are, however, more general and more extensive in their application than those employed in that science; hence, and from the great facility with which the various relations of magnitudes to one another may be expressed, by means of a few signs or characters, the application of algebra to the resolution of problems is much more extensive than that of common arithmetic.\n\n2. There are various opinions as to the etymology of the name algebra. It is pretty certain, however, that the word is Arabic, and that from the Arabians the name, as well as the art itself, is derived. Lucas de Burgo, the first European author whose treatise on algebra was printed, calls it by the Arabic name Algebr\u00e0 e Almucabala, which is explained to denote the art of restitution and comparison, or opposition and comparison, or resolution and equation, all which agree well enough with the nature of this art. Besides this etymology of the name algebra, several others have been imagined; that, however, which we have just now given seems to be the most probable of any hitherto assigned.\n\n3. The origin of algebra, as well as that of most other branches of mathematical science, is involved in obscurity; there are indeed traces of it to be found in the works of some of the earliest philosophers and mathematicians, the subject of whose writings must necessarily have led them to the discovery; and, in some measure, to the application of this science.\n\n4. The oldest treatise of algebra, which has come down to the present times, was written by Diophantus of Alexandria, who flourished about the year 350 after Christ, and who wrote 13 books on algebra or arithmetic in the Greek language; though only six of these have hitherto been printed, and one book, which is imperfect, on multangular numbers. It was not, however, from this author, but from the Moors or Arabians, that this, as well as most other sciences, was received in Europe; and some writers are of opinion, that they again received it from the Greeks, while others suppose that they had it from the Persians; and that these last derived algebra, as well as the arithmetical method of computing by ten characters or digits, from the Indians.\n\n5. The Arabians themselves say, that it was invented by Mahomet ben Musa or son of Moses, who it seems flourished about the 8th or 9th century. It seems more probable that Mahomet was not the inventor, but only a person well skilled in the art; and that the Arabians received their knowledge of it from Diophantus, or other Greek writers, as they did that of geometry and some other sciences, which they improved and translated into their own language.\n\n6. However this may be, it seems to be pretty certain, that the science was first brought to Europe about the beginning of the 15th century, by Leonardus Pisanus, who travelled into Arabia and other eastern countries for the purpose of acquiring mathematical knowledge; and, in a short time, it began to be cultivated in Italy, where it was called l'Arte Magiore, \"the greater art,\" to distinguish it from common arithmetic, which was called l'Arte Minore, \"the lesser art.\" It was also known in that country by the name Regola de la Cofa, or \"rule of the thing,\" where by Cofa, or the thing, was meant the first, or simple power of the unknown quantity.\n\n7. Between the years 1470 and 1487 Lucas Pacioli or Lucas de Burgo, a Cordelier, or Minorite friar, published several treatises on arithmetic, algebra, and geometry; and, in 1494, his principal work, entitled Summa de Arithmetica Proporioni et Proportionatis was printed. The part of this work, which relates to algebra, and which he calls l'Arte Magiore; diuia dal vulgo la Regola de la Cofa over Algebra e Almucabala, may be considered as exhibiting a pretty accurate state of the science, as it was then known in Europe; and probably it was much the same in Africa and Asia, from whence the Europeans derived the knowledge of it. It appears from this work, that their knowledge extended no farther than quadratic equations, of which they used only the positive roots; that they used only one unknown quantity; that they used no marks nor signs for either quantities or operations, excepting a few abbreviations of the words or names themselves; and that the art was only employed in the resolution of certain numeral problems. So that either the Africans had not carried algebra beyond quadratic equations; or else (what indeed is not improbable) the Europeans had not learned the whole of the art, as it was then known to the former.\n\n8. After the publication of the books of Lucas de Burgo, algebra became more generally known and improved, especially in Italy; for about the year 1505, Scipio Ferreus who was then professor of mathematics at Bologna, found out a rule for resolving one case of a compound cubic equation; but, as appears to have been the custom of the times with respect to such matters, he kept the rule a profound secret from his contemporaries. The same thing was afterwards discovered in 1535 by Nicolas Tartalea, who then resided in Venice, and who had five years before found the resolution of two other cases of cubic equations.\n\n9. The next work upon algebra which was printed after the books of Lucas de Burgo, was written by Hieronymus Cardan, of Bologna, a very learned man, who published in 1539 his arithmetical writings, in nine books, at Milan, where he practised physic, and read public lectures on mathematics. The same author in 1545 published a tenth book, containing the whole doctrine of cubic equations, which had been in part communicated to him under an oath of secrecy.\nby Tartalea, but which, notwithstanding this circumstance, Cardan thought proper to publish, alleging (not altogether without reason) that he had made to many additions to Tartalea's discovery so as to render it in a manner his own. Accordingly we find, that even to the present times, the common rule for resolving cubic equations is generally known by the name of Cardan's rule, although it would certainly be more just to attribute it to its first inventor, Tartalea.\n\n10. Equations of the fourth order appear to have been first resolved by Lewis Ferrari, a disciple of Cardan's; and different methods of resolution were afterwards given by Descartes and others. This indeed is the greatest length that mathematicians have been able to carry the resolution of equations; for, with respect to those of the fifth, and all higher degrees, all attempts to resolve them, except in particular cases, have hitherto been found impracticable.\n\n11. After this period, writers on algebra became more numerous; and many improvements were gradually made, both in the notation and in the theory of the science. Among other writers who cultivated it with success may be reckoned Bombelli, another Italian mathematician; Stifelius and Scheutellius, both of Germany; Robert Recorde, an English mathematician; and many others.\n\n12. Among the mathematicians to whom algebra is particularly indebted, it is proper to mention Francis Vieta, a native of France, who wrote about the year 1600. Among various improvements in all parts of the science, he first introduced the general use of the letters of the alphabet, to denote indefinite given quantities, which, before his time, had only been done in some particular cases. The English mathematician, Harriot, deserves also to be particularly mentioned. His algebra, which was published after his death, in 1631, shows that he cultivated that science with great success. For, besides improving the notation, so as to render it nearly the same as it is at present, he first explained clearly a most important proposition in the theory of equations, namely, that an equation of any degree may be considered as produced by the continual multiplication of as many simple equations as there are units in the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity in that equation: Hence he showed the relation which subsists between the coefficients of the terms of an equation and its roots.\n\n13. Without mentioning all the writers on algebra who flourished about this time, and who severally contributed more or less to its improvement, we proceed to observe, that nothing has contributed more to the advancement of every branch of mathematical knowledge than the happy application which the celebrated philosopher Descartes made of algebra to the science of geometry; for his geometry, first published in 1637, may be considered rather as the application of algebra to geometry than as either algebra or geometry taken by itself as a science. Besides this happy union effected between the two sciences, Descartes contributed much to the improvement of both; and indeed he may be considered as having paved the way for all the discoveries which have since been made in mathematics.\n\n14. After the publication of Descartes' Geometry, the science of algebra may be considered as having attained some degree of perfection. It has, however, received many improvements from later writers who, pursuing the paths struck out by Harriot and Descartes, have produced many new and beautiful theories, both in algebra and geometry. The writers upon algebra from this time became too numerous, and the respective improvements made by each too minute, to be particularly noticed in this introduction. It is, however, necessary to mention another mathematician, to whom algebra lies under considerable obligations, namely, M. Fermat, who may be considered as the rival of Descartes; for it appears that he was in possession of the method of applying algebra to the improvement of geometry before the publication of the celebrated work of the latter philosopher. Besides, Fermat appears to have been deeply versed in the theory of indeterminate problems; and he republished the oldest and most esteemed treatise upon that subject which is known, namely, Diophantus's Arithmetic, to which he added many valuable notes of his own.\n\n15. Having now given a brief account of the origin of algebra, and of the writers who contributed the most to bring it to the state of perfection it had attained about the middle of the 17th century, which indeed was considerable, we shall conclude this introduction, by observing, that although its progress has since been very gradual, it has been upon the whole considerably improved; particularly by the labours of these foreign mathematicians, Schooten, Hudde, Van Heuraet, De Witte, Slusius, Huygens, &c. As to the algebraical writers of our own country, whose whole labours have been most conspicuous were Wallis, and more especially Sir I. Newton, to whom, among other things, we owe the invention of the binomial theorem: also Pell, Barrow, Kersey, Halley, Raphson, and many others. We now proceed to explain the science itself.\n\nNotation and Explanation of the Signs.\n\n16. In arithmetic there are ten characters, which being variously combined, according to certain rules, serve to denote all magnitudes whatever. But this method of expressing quantities, although of the greatest utility in every branch of the mathematics, (for we must always have recourse to it in the different applications of that science to practical purposes) is yet found to be inadequate, taken by itself, to the more difficult cases of mathematical investigation; and it is therefore necessary in many inquiries concerning the relations of magnitude, to have recourse to that more general mode of notation, and more extensive system of operations, which constitute the science of algebra.\n\n17. In algebra quantities of every kind may be denoted by any characters whatever, but those commonly used are the letters of the alphabet: And as in every mathematical problem, there are certain magnitudes given, in order to determine other magnitudes, which are unknown, the first letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, &c., are used to denote known quantities, while those to be found are represented by v, x, y, &c. the last letters of the alphabet.\n\n18. The sign + (plus) denotes that the quantity before which it is placed is to be added to some other quantity. Thus \\(a + b\\) denotes the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); \\(3 + 5\\) denotes the sum of 3 and 5, or 8.\n\n19. The sign \u2014 (minus) signifies that the quantity before\nNotation. before which it is placed is to be subtracted. Thus \\(a - b\\) denotes the excess of \\(a\\) above \\(b\\); \\(6 - 2\\) is the excess of 6 above 2, or 4.\n\n20. Quantities which have the sign + prefixed to them are called positive or affirmative; and such as have the sign \u2014 are called negative.\n\nWhen quantities are considered abstractedly, the terms positive and negative can only mean that such quantities are to be added or subtracted; for as it is impossible to conceive a number less than 0, it follows, that a negative quantity by itself is unintelligible. But, in considering the affections of magnitude, it appears, that in many cases, a certain opposition may exist in the nature of quantities. Thus, a person's property may be considered as a positive quantity, and his debts as a negative quantity. Again, any portion of a line drawn to the right hand may be considered as positive, while a portion of the same line, continued in the opposite direction, may be taken as negative.\n\nWhen no sign is prefixed to a quantity, + is always understood, or the quantity is to be considered as positive.\n\n21. Quantities which have the same sign, either + or \u2014, are said to have like signs. Thus, \\(+a\\) and \\(+b\\) have like signs, but \\(+a\\) and \\(-c\\) have unlike signs.\n\n22. A quantity which consists of one term, is said to be simple; but if it consist of several terms, connected by the signs + or \u2014, it is then said to be compound. Thus \\(+a\\) and \\(-c\\) are simple quantities; and \\(b + c\\), also \\(+a + b - d\\) are compound quantities.\n\n23. To denote the product arising from the multiplication of quantities; if they be simple, they are either joined together, as if intended to form a word, or else the quantities are connected together, with the sign \\(\\times\\) interposed between every two of them. Thus \\(ab\\), or \\(a \\times b\\), denotes the product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); also \\(abc\\), or \\(a \\times b \\times c\\) denotes the product of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\); the latter method is used when the quantities to be multiplied are numbers. If some of the quantities to be multiplied be compound, each of them has a line drawn over it called a vinculum, and the sign \\(\\times\\) is interposed between as before. Thus \\(a \\times c + d \\times e - f\\) denotes that \\(a\\) is to be considered as one quantity, the sum of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) as a second, and the difference between \\(e\\) and \\(f\\) as a third; and that these three quantities are to be multiplied into one another. Instead of placing a line over such compound quantities as enter a product, it is now common among mathematical writers to enclose each of them between two parentheses, so that the last product may be otherwise expressed thus, \\(a(c+d)(e-f)\\), or thus, \\(a \\times (c+d) \\times (e-f)\\).\n\n24. A number prefixed to a letter is called a numerical coefficient, and denotes how often that quantity is to be taken. Thus, \\(3a\\) signifies that \\(a\\) is to be taken three times. When no number is prefixed, the coefficient is understood to be unity.\n\n25. The quotient arising from the division of one quantity by another is expressed by placing the dividend above a line, and the divisor below it. Thus \\(\\frac{12}{3}\\) denotes the quotient arising from the division of 12 by 3, or 4; \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) denotes the quotient arising from the division of \\(b\\) by \\(a\\). This expression of a quotient is also called Addition, a fraction.\n\n26. The equality of two quantities is expressed by putting the sign = between them. Thus \\(a + b = c - d\\) denotes that the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is equal to the excess of \\(c\\) above \\(d\\).\n\n27. Simple quantities, or the terms of compound quantities, are said to be like, which consist of the same letter or letters. Thus \\(+ab\\) and \\(-5ab\\) are like quantities; but \\(+ab\\) and \\(+abb\\) are unlike.\n\nThere are some other characters which will be explained when we have occasion to use them; and in what follows we shall suppose that the operations of common arithmetic are sufficiently understood; for algebra, being an extension of that science, ought not to be embarrassed by the demonstration of its elementary rules.\n\nSect. I. Fundamental Operations.\n\n28. The primary operations in algebra are the same as in common arithmetic, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; and from the various combinations of these four, all the others are derived.\n\nProblem I. To Add Quantities.\n\n29. In addition there may be three cases: the quantities to be added may be like, and have like signs; or, they may be like, and have unlike signs; or, lastly, they may be unlike.\n\nCase 1. To add quantities which are like, and have like signs.\n\nRule. Add together the coefficients of the quantities, prefix the common sign to the sum, and annex the letter, or letters, common to each term.\n\nExamples.\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n+ & 7a \\\\\n+ & 3a \\\\\n+ & a \\\\\n+ & 2a\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(+13a\\)\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n- & 2ax \\\\\n- & ax \\\\\n- & 5ax \\\\\n- & 12ax\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(-20ax\\)\n\nCase 2. To add quantities which are like, but have unlike signs.\n\nRule. Add the positive coefficients into one sum, and the negative ones into another; then subtract the least of these sums from the greatest, prefix the sign of the greatest to the remainder, and annex the common letter, or letters, as before.\n\nExamples.\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n+ & 2ax \\\\\n- & ax \\\\\n- & 3ax \\\\\n+ & 9ax\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum of the pos. \\(+11ax\\)\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n+ & 6ab \\\\\n+ & ab \\\\\n+ & 7ab \\\\\n- & 13\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum of the pos. \\(+14ab\\)\n\nSum of the neg. \\(-4ab\\)\n\nSum required, \\(+7ax\\)\n\nSum required, \\(+1cab\\)\n\n\\(aa+\\)\n\nSubtraction.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\naa + 2ax & - xx = -4aab \\\\\n-2aa + 3ax & - 4xx + aab \\\\\n6aa - 5ax + 11xx & + 3aab \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(5aa\\) \\(+ 6ax\\) Sum, \\(0\\)\n\nCase 3. To add unlike quantities.\n\nRule. Put down the quantities, one after another, in any order, with their signs and coefficients prefixed.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2a & \\quad ax + 2ay \\\\\n3b & \\quad bb - 3bx \\\\\n-4c & \\quad \\text{Sum, } ax + 2ay + bb - 3bx \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(2a + 3b - 4c\\)\n\nProb. II. To Subtract Quantities.\n\n30. General Rule. Change the signs of the quantities to be subtracted, or suppose them changed, and then add them to the other quantities, agreeably to the rules of addition.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{From } 5a - 12b & \\quad \\text{From } 6x - 8y + 3 \\\\\n\\text{Subtract } 2a - 5b & \\quad \\text{Subtract } 2x + 9y - 2 \\\\\n\\text{Remainder } 3a - 7b & \\quad \\text{Remainder } 4x - 17y + 5 \\\\\n5xy - 2 + 8x - y & \\quad aa - ax - yy \\\\\n3xy - 8 - 8x - 3y & \\quad bb - by + zz \\\\\n2xy + 6 + 16x + 2y & \\quad aa - ax - yy - bb + by - zz \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n31. The reason of the rule for subtraction may be explained thus. Let it be required to subtract \\(2p - 3q\\) from \\(m + n\\). If we subtract \\(2p\\) from \\(m + n\\) there will remain \\(m + n - 2p\\); but if we are to subtract \\(2p - 3q\\), which is less than \\(2p\\), it is evident that the remainder will be greater by a quantity equal to \\(3q\\); that is, the remainder will be \\(m + n - 2p + 3q\\); hence the reason of the rule is evident.\n\nProb. III. To Multiply Quantities.\n\n32. General Rule for the Signs. If the quantities to be multiplied have like signs, the sign of the product is \\(+\\); but if they have unlike signs, the sign of the product is \\(-\\).\n\n33. The examples of multiplication may be referred to two cases; the first is when both the quantities are simple; and the second when one or both of them are compound.\n\nCase I. To multiply simple quantities.\n\nRule. Find the sign of the product by the general rule, and annex to it the product of the numeral coefficients, then set down all the letters, one after another, as in one word.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Multiply } +a & \\quad +b \\\\\n\\text{By } +c & \\quad -4a \\\\\n\\text{Product } +ac & \\quad -20ab \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nCase II. To multiply compound quantities.\n\nRule. Multiply every term of the multiplicand by all the terms of the multiplier, one after another, by the preceding rule, and collect their products into one sum, which will be the product required.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Multiply } 4a - 2b + c & \\quad 2x + y \\\\\n\\text{By } 3a & \\quad x - 2y \\\\\n\\text{Product } 12aa - 6ab + 3ac & \\quad 2xx + xy \\\\\n& \\quad - 4xy - 2yy \\\\\n& \\quad 2xx - 3xy - 2yy \\\\\naa - ab + bb & \\quad a - b + c \\\\\na + b & \\quad a + b - c \\\\\naac - aab + abb & \\quad aa - ab + ac \\\\\n+ aab - abb + bbb & \\quad + ab - bb + bc \\\\\naaa & \\quad * + bbb \\\\\naa & \\quad * * - bb + 2bc - cc \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n34. The reason of the rules for the multiplication of quantities may be explained in the following manner: Let it be required to multiply \\(a - b\\) by \\(c - d\\); because multiplication is a repeated addition of the multiplicand as often as the multiplier contains unity, therefore, \\(a - b\\) is to be taken as often as there are units in \\(c - d\\), and the sum will be the product required. Now if \\(a - b\\) be taken as often as there are units in \\(c\\), the result will evidently exceed the product required, and that by a quantity equal to \\(a - b\\), taken as often as there are units in \\(d\\). But, from the nature of addition \\(a - b\\) taken as often as there are units in \\(c\\), is \\(ca - cb\\), and for the same reason, \\(a - b\\) taken as often as there are units in \\(d\\) is \\(da - db\\); therefore, to obtain the product required, we must subtract \\(da - db\\) from \\(ca - cb\\); but from what has been shewn in subtraction, the remainder will be \\(ca - cb - da + db\\); therefore the product arising from the multiplication of \\(a - b\\) by \\(c - d\\) is \\(ca - cb - da + db\\); hence the reason of the general rule for the signs, as well as the other rules, is manifest.\n\n35. When several quantities are multiplied together so as to constitute a product, each of them is called a factor of that product; thus, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are factors of the product \\(abc\\); also \\(a + x\\), and \\(b - x\\) are factors of the product \\((a + x)(b - x)\\).\n\n36. The products arising from the continual multiplication of the same quantity are called powers of that quantity, which is called the root. Thus \\(aa\\), \\(aaa\\), \\(aaaa\\), &c. are powers of the root \\(a\\). These powers are commonly expressed, by placing above the root, towards the right hand, a figure, denoting how often the root is repeated. This figure serves to denote the power, and is called its index or exponent. Thus, the quantity \\(a\\) being considered as the root, or as the first power of \\(a\\), we have \\(aa\\) or \\(a^2\\) for its second power,\nDivision.\n\npower, \\(a^2\\) or \\(a^3\\) for its third power, \\(aaaa\\) or \\(a^4\\) for its fourth power, and so on.\n\n37. The second and third powers of a quantity are generally called its square and cube; and the fourth, fifth, and sixth powers are sometimes respectively called its biquadrate, sexfoil, and cubocube.\n\n38. By considering the notation of powers, and the rules for multiplication, it appears that powers of the same root are multiplied by adding their exponents. Thus \\(a \\times a^2 = a^3\\), also \\(x^3 \\times x^4 = x^7\\); and in general \\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\nProb. IV. To Divide Quantities.\n\n39. General Rule for the Signs. If the signs of the divisor and dividend be like, the sign of the quotient is +; but if they be unlike, the sign of the quotient is \u2212.\n\nThis rule is easily derived from the general rule for the signs in multiplication, by considering that the quotient must be such a quantity as when multiplied by the divisor shall produce the dividend, with its proper sign.\n\n40. The quotient arising from the division of one quantity by another may be expressed by placing the dividend above a line and the divisor below it, (\u00a7 25), but it may also be often expressed in a more simple manner by the following rules:\n\nCase 1. When the divisor is simple, and a factor of every term of the dividend.\n\nRule. Divide the coefficient of each term of the dividend by the coefficient of the divisor, and expunge out of each term the letter or letters in the divisor; the result is the quotient.\n\nEx. 1. Divide \\(12abc\\) by \\(3ac\\).\n\nFrom the method of notation, the quotient may be expressed thus \\(\\frac{12abc}{3ac}\\); but the same quotient, by the rule just given, is more simply expressed thus \\(4b\\).\n\nEx. 2. Divide \\(16a^3xy - 28a^2xz^3 + 4a^4x^3\\) by \\(4ax\\).\n\nThe quotient is \\(4ay - 7xz^3 + x^3\\).\n\nIf the divisor and dividend be powers of the same quantity, the division will evidently be performed by subtracting the exponent of the divisor from that of the dividend. Thus \\(a^3\\) divided by \\(a^2\\) has for a quotient \\(a^3 - 2 = a\\).\n\nCase 2. When the divisor is simple, but not a factor of the dividend.\n\nRule. The quotient is expressed by a fraction, of which the numerator is the dividend, and the denominator the divisor.\n\nThus the quotient of \\(3ab^2\\) divided by \\(2mbc\\) is the fraction \\(\\frac{3ab^2}{2mbc}\\).\n\nIt will sometimes happen, that the quotient found thus may be reduced to a more simple form, as shall be explained when we come to treat of fractions.\n\nCase 3. When the divisor is compound.\n\nRule. 1. The terms of the dividend are to be arranged according to the powers of some one of its letters, and those of the divisor according to the powers of the same letter.\n\n2. The first term of the dividend is to be divided by the first term of the divisor, observing the general rule for the signs; and this quotient being let down for a part of the quotient wanted, is to be multiplied by the whole divisor, and the product subtracted from the dividend. If nothing remain, the division is finished; but if there be a remainder, it is to be taken for a new dividend.\n\n3. The first term of the new dividend is next to be divided by the first term of the divisor, as before, and the quotient joined to the part already found, with its proper sign. The whole divisor is also to be multiplied by this part of the quotient, and the product subtracted from the new dividend; and thus the operation is to be carried on till there be no remainder, or till it appear that there will always be a remainder.\n\nTo illustrate this rule, let it be required to divide \\(8a^3 + 2ab - 15b^2\\) by \\(2a + 3b\\); the operation will stand thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&2a + 3b)8a^3 + 2ab - 15b^2(4a - 5b \\\\\n&\\quad 8a^3 + 12ab \\\\\n&\\quad - 10ab - 15b^2 \\\\\n&\\quad - 10ab - 15b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the terms of the divisor and dividend are arranged according to the powers of the quantity \\(a\\). We now divide \\(8a^3\\), the first term of the dividend, by \\(2a\\) the first term of the divisor; and thus get \\(4a\\) for the first term of the quotient. We next multiply the divisor by \\(4a\\), and subtract the product \\(8a^3 + 12ab\\) from the dividend; we thus get \\(-10ab - 15b^2\\) for a new dividend.\n\nBy proceeding in all respects as before, we find \\(-5b\\) for the second term of the quotient, and no remainder; the operation is therefore finished, and the whole quotient is \\(4a - 5b\\).\n\nThe following examples will also serve to illustrate the manner of applying the rule.\n\nEx. 1.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3a - b)3a^2 - 12a^2 - ab + 10ab - 2b^2(a^2 - 4a + 2b \\\\\n3a^3 - a^2b \\\\\n- 12a^2 + 10ab \\\\\n+ 6ab - 2b^2 \\\\\n+ 6ab - 2b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nEx. 2.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + b)a^2 + b^2(a^2 - ab + b^2 \\\\\na^3 + a^2b \\\\\n- a^2b + b^2 \\\\\n- a^2b - ab^2 \\\\\n+ ab^2 - b^2 \\\\\n+ ab^2 - b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nEx. 3.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^6 - b^6} = \\frac{(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)}{(a^3 - b^3)(a^3 + b^3)}\n\\]\n\nEx. 4.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1-x} = (1+x+x^2+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n41. Sometimes, as in this last example, the quotient will never terminate; in such a case it may either be considered as an infinite series, the law according to which the terms are formed being in general sufficiently obvious; or the quotient may be completed as in arithmetical division, by annexing to it a fraction, the numerator of which is the remainder, and denominator the divisor. Thus the quotient in last example may stand thus \\(1 + x + x^2 + \\ldots\\).\n\n42. The reason of the rule for division is sufficiently manifest. For in the course of the operation, all the terms of the quotient obtained by it are multiplied by all the terms of the divisor, and the products successively subtracted from the dividend, till nothing remain; and therefore must evidently be the true quotient.\n\nSect. II. Of Fractions.\n\n43. In the operation of division, the divisor may be sometimes less than the dividend, or may not be contained in it an exact number of times; in either case the quotient is expressed by means of a fraction. There can be no difficulty, however, in estimating the magnitude of such a quotient; if, for example it were the fraction \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\), we may consider it as denoting either that some unit is divided into 7 equal parts, and that 5 of these are taken, or that 5 times the same unit is divided into 7 equal parts, and one of them taken.\n\n44. In any fraction the upper number, or the dividend is called the numerator, and the lower number or the divisor is called the denominator. Thus in the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), \\(a\\) is the numerator, and \\(b\\) the denominator.\n\n45. If the numerator be less than the denominator, such a fraction is called a proper fraction; but if the numerator be either equal to, or greater than the denominator, it is called an improper fraction; and if a quantity be made up of an integer and a fraction, it is called a mixed quantity. Thus \\(\\frac{a}{a+x}\\) is a proper fraction; \\(\\frac{a}{a}\\), also \\(\\frac{a+x}{a}\\) are both improper fractions; and \\(b+\\frac{x}{a}\\) is a mixed quantity.\n\n46. The reciprocal of a fraction is another fraction, having its numerator and denominator respectively equal to the denominator and numerator of the former.\n\nThus \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) is the reciprocal of the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\n47. The following proposition is of great importance in the operations relating to fractions.\n\nIf the numerator and denominator of a fraction be either both multiplied, or both divided by the same quantity, the value of that fraction is the same as before.\n\nFor let any fraction \\(\\frac{b}{a} = c\\); then because \\(c\\) is the quotient arising from the division of \\(b\\) by \\(a\\), it follows that \\(b = ac\\); and multiplying both by any quantity \\(n\\), we have \\(nb = nac\\); let these equals be both divided by the same quantity \\(na\\), and the quotients will be equal, that is \\(\\frac{nb}{na} = \\frac{c}{a}\\); hence the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n48. From this proposition, it is obvious that a fraction may be very differently expressed, without changing its value, and that any integer may be reduced to the form of a fraction, by placing the product arising from its multiplication by any assumed quantity as the numerator, and the assumed quantity as the denominator of the fraction. It also appears that a fraction very complex in its form may often be reduced to another of the same value, but more simple, by finding a quantity which will divide both the numerator and denominator, without leaving a remainder. Such a common measure, or common divisor, may be either simple or compound; if it be simple, it is readily found by inspection, but if it be compound, it may be found as in the following problem.\n\n49. Prob. I. To find the greatest common Measure of two Quantities.\n\nRule 1. Range the quantities according to the powers of some one of the letters, as taught in division, leaving out the simple divisors of each quantity.\n\n2. Divide that quantity which is of most dimensions by the other one, and if there be a remainder, divide it by its greatest simple divisor; and then divide the last compound divisor by the resulting quantity, and if anything yet remains, divide it also by its greatest simple divisor, and the last compound divisor by the resulting quantity: proceed in this way till nothing remain, and the last divisor shall be the common measure required.\n\nNote. It will sometimes be necessary to multiply the dividends by simple quantities in order to make the divisions succeed.\n\nEx. 1. Required the greatest common measure of the quantities \\(a^2x - x^3\\) and \\(a^2 - 2ax + ax^2\\). The simple divisor \\(x\\) being taken out of the former of these quantities, and \\(a\\) out of the latter, they are reduced to \\(a^2 - x^2\\), and \\(a^2 - 2ax + x^2\\), and as the quantity \\(a\\) rises to the same dimensions in both, we may take either of them as the first divisor; let us take that which consists of fewest terms, and the operation will stand thus:\nFractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^2 - x^2}{a^2 - ax + x^2} = \\frac{-2ax + x^2}{-2x} \\]\n\nwhich divided by \\(-2x\\) is \\(a - x\\).\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^2 - ax}{a^2 - ax} \\]\n\nHence it appears that \\(a - x\\) is the greatest common measure required.\n\n**Ex. 2.** Required the greatest common measure of \\(8a^3b^3 - 10ab^3 + 2b^4\\) and \\(9a^3b - 9a^3b^3 + 3a^3b^3 - 3ab^3\\).\n\nIt is evident, from inspection, that \\(b\\) is a simple divisor of both quantities; it will therefore be a factor of the common measure required. Let the simple divisors be now left out of each quantity, and they are reduced to \\(4a^3 - 5ab + b^3\\) and \\(3a^3 - 3a^3b + ab^3 - b^3\\); but as the second of these is to be divided by the first, it must be multiplied by 4 to make the division succeed, and the operation will stand thus:\n\n\\[ (4a^3 - 5ab + b^3)(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3) \\]\n\nThis remainder is to be divided by \\(b\\), and the new dividend multiplied by 3, to make the division again succeed, and the work will stand thus:\n\n\\[ 3a^3 + ab - 4b^3(3a^3 + 4b^3) \\]\n\nThis remainder is to be divided by \\(19b\\), which being done, and the last divisor taken as a dividend as before, the rest of the operation will be as follows:\n\n\\[ a - b(3a^3 + 4b^3) \\]\n\nfrom which it appears that the compound divisor sought is \\(a - b\\), and remarking that the quantities proposed have also a simple divisor \\(b\\), the greatest common measure which is required will be \\(b(a - b)\\).\n\n**5c.** The reason of the rule given in this problem may be deduced from the following considerations.\n\n1. If two quantities have a compound divisor common to both, and they be either multiplied or divided by any simple quantities, the results will each have the same compound divisor. Thus the quantities \\(p(a - x)\\) and \\(q(a - x)\\) have the common divisor \\(a - x\\), and the quantities \\(np(a - x)\\) and \\(rq(a - x)\\) have each the very same divisor.\n\n2. In the operation of division, whatever quantity measures both the divisor and dividend, the same will also measure the remainder. For let \\(x\\) be such a quantity, then the divisor and dividend may be represented by \\(ax\\) and \\(bx\\); let \\(q\\) be the quotient, and the remainder will evidently be \\(bx - qx\\), which is evidently divisible by \\(x\\).\n\n3. Whatever quantity measures both the divisor and remainder, the same will also measure the dividend. For let the divisor be \\(ax\\), and the remainder \\(rx\\), then \\(q\\) denoting the quotient, the dividend will be \\(apx + rx\\), which, as well as the divisor and dividend, is divisible by \\(x\\).\n\n**5f.** Let us apply these observations to the last example. From the first observation, the reason for leaving out the simple quantities in the course of the operation, as well as for multiplying by certain other quantities, to make the divisions succeed, is obvious; and from the second observation it appears that whatever quantity measures \\(4a^3 - 5ab + b^3\\) and \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\), the same must measure \\(3a^3 + ab - 4b^3\\); the first remainder, as also \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\); the second remainder; but the only compound divisor which this last quantity can have is \\(a - b\\), which is also found to be a divisor of \\(3a^3 + ab - 4b^3\\), or of \\(3a^3b + ab^3 - 4b^3\\); the first remainder, therefore, by the third observation, \\(a - b\\) must also be a divisor of \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\), or of \\(4a^3 - 5ab + b^3\\), the first divisor, and therefore also it must be a divisor of \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\) the first dividend, so that \\(a - b\\) is the greatest common measure as was required.\n\n**52. Prob. II. To Reduce a Fraction to its lowest Terms.**\n\n**Rule.** Divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common measure, which may be found by prob. 1.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Reduce \\(\\frac{56a^3bc}{24abc}\\) to its lowest terms.\n\nIt appears from inspection, that the greatest common measure is \\(8ac\\), and dividing both numerator and denominator by this quantity, we have \\(\\frac{56a^3bc}{24abc} = \\frac{7ab}{3dc}\\).\n\n**Ex. 2.** Reduce \\(\\frac{a^3 - x^3}{a^3 - 2a^3x + ax^3}\\) to its lowest terms.\n\nWe have already found in the first example of prob. 1. that the greatest common measure of the numerator and denominator is \\(a - x\\); and dividing both by this quantity we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^3 - x^3}{a^3 - 2a^3x + ax^3} = \\frac{ax + x^3}{a^3 - ax} \\]\n\nIn like manner we find \\(\\frac{9a^3b - 9a^3b^3 + 3a^3b^3 - 3ab^3}{8a^3b^3 - 10ab^3 + 2b^4} = \\frac{9a^3 + 3ab^3}{8ab - 2b^3}\\); the common measure being \\(b(a - b)\\) as was shown in example 2, problem 1.\n\n**53. Prob. III. To Reduce a mixed Quantity to an improper Fraction.**\n\n**Rule.** Multiply the integer by the denominator of the fraction, and to the product add the numerator, and the denominator being placed under this sum will give the improper fraction required.\nEx. 1.

Prob. V. To Reduce Fractions of Different Denominators to Others of the Same Value Which Shall Have a Common Denominator.\n\nRule. Multiply each numerator separately into all the denominators except its own for the new numerators, and all the denominators together for the common denominator.\n\nEx. 1.

Reduce \\( \\frac{ax}{a - x} \\) and \\( \\frac{a^2 - x^2}{a + x} \\) to fractions of equal value and having a common denominator.\n\n\\[ ax(a + x) = a^2x + ax^2 \\]\n\\[ (a^2 - x^2)(a - x) = a^3 - a^2x - ax^2 + x^3 \\]\n\nnew numerators.\n\n\\[ a - x)(a + x) = a^2 - x^2 \\] the common denominator.\n\nHence \\( \\frac{ax}{a - x} = \\frac{a^2x + ax^2}{a^2 - x^2} \\)\n\\[ \\frac{a^2 - x^2}{a + x} = \\frac{a^3 - a^2x - ax^2 + x^3}{a^2 - x^2} \\]\n\n56. Prob. VI. To Add or Subtract Fractions.\n\nRule. Reduce the fractions to a common denominator, and add or subtract their numerators, and the sum or difference placed over the common denominator, is the sum or remainder required.\n\nEx. 1. Add together \\( \\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}, \\frac{e}{f} \\).\n\n\\[ \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{adf}{bd} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{bcf}{bd} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{e}{f} = \\frac{bde}{bd} \\]\n\nHence \\( \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{e}{f} = \\frac{adf + bcf + bde}{bd} \\) the sum required.\n\nEx. 2.

Prob. VII. To Multiply Fractions.\n\nRule. Multiply the numerators of the fractions for the numerator of the product, and the denominators for the denominator of the product.\n\nEx. 1. Multiply \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\times \\frac{d}{c} \\) by \\( \\frac{bd}{ac} \\) the product required.\n\nEx. 2. Multiply \\( \\frac{a + b}{c} \\times \\frac{a - b}{d} \\) by \\( \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{cd} \\), the product.\n\nIf it be required to multiply an integer by a fraction, the integer may be considered as having unity for a denominator. Thus \\( (a + x) \\times \\frac{3d}{c} = \\frac{a + x}{1} \\times \\frac{3d}{c} = \\frac{3ad + 3dx}{c} \\).\nMixed quantities may be multiplied after being reduced to the form of fractions by prob. 3. Thus\n\n\\[\n(b + \\frac{bx}{a}) \\times \\frac{a}{n} = \\frac{ab + bx}{a} \\times \\frac{a}{n} = \\frac{ab + abx}{an} = \\frac{ab + bx}{n}.\n\\]\n\n58. The reason of the rule for multiplication may be explained thus. If \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) is to be multiplied by \\( c \\), the product will evidently be \\( \\frac{ac}{b} \\); but if it is only to be multiplied by \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\), the former product must be divided by \\( d \\), and it becomes \\( \\frac{ac}{bd} \\) which is the product required.\n\nOr let \\( \\frac{a}{b} = m \\), and \\( \\frac{c}{d} = n \\), then \\( a = bm \\) and \\( c = dn \\) and \\( ac = bdmn \\); hence \\( mn \\), or \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ac}{bd} \\).\n\n59. Prob. VIII. To Divide Fractions.\n\nRule. Multiply the denominator of the divisor by the numerator of the dividend for the numerator of the quotient. Then multiply the numerator of the divisor by the denominator of the dividend for the denominator of the quotient.\n\nOr, multiply the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor, the product will be the quotient required.\n\nEx. 1. Divide \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) by \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n\\]\n\nthe quotient required, or \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{ad}{bc} \\) as before.\n\nEx. 2. Divide \\( \\frac{a^2 + ab}{2x} \\) by \\( \\frac{3a^3}{a - b} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3a^3}{a - b} \\div \\frac{a^2 + ab}{2x} = \\frac{6a^2}{6a^3} = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{6ax}\n\\]\n\nthe quotient.\n\nIf either the divisor or dividend be an integer quantity, it may be represented as a fraction, by placing unity for a denominator; or if it be a mixed quantity, it may be reduced to a fraction by prob. 3. and the operation of division performed agreeably to the rule.\n\n60. The reason of the rule for division may be explained thus, let it be required to divide \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) by \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\). If \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) is to be divided by \\( a \\), the quotient is \\( \\frac{c}{ad} \\); but if it is to be divided by \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\), then the last quotient must be multiplied by \\( b \\); thus we have \\( \\frac{cb}{ad} \\) for the quotient required. Or let \\( \\frac{a}{b} = m \\), and \\( \\frac{c}{d} = n \\), then \\( a = bm \\) and \\( c = dn \\); also \\( ad = bdm \\) and \\( bc = bdn \\); therefore \\( \\frac{bdn}{bdm} = \\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{bc}{ad} \\).\n\nSect. III. Of Involution and Evolution.\n\n61. In treating of multiplication, we have observed, that when a quantity is multiplied by itself any number of times, the product is called a power of that quantity, while the quantity itself, from which the powers are formed, is called the root (\u00a7 36.). Thus \\( a \\), \\( a^2 \\), and \\( a^3 \\) are the first, second, and third powers of the root \\( a \\); and in like manner \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\) denote the same powers of the root \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\).\n\n62. But before considering more particularly what relates to powers and roots, it will be proper to observe, that the quantities \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\), &c. admit of being expressed under a different form; for, like as the quantities \\( a \\), \\( a^2 \\), \\( a^3 \\), &c. are expressed as positive powers of the root \\( a \\), so the quantities \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\), &c. may be respectively expressed thus, \\( a^{-1} \\), \\( a^{-2} \\), \\( a^{-3} \\), &c. and considered as negative powers of the root \\( a \\).\n\n63. This method of expressing the fractions \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\) as powers of the root \\( a \\), but with negative indices, is a consequence of the rule which has been given for the division of powers; for we may consider \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) as the quotient arising from the division of any power of \\( a \\) by the next higher power, for example from the division of the 2d by the 3d, and so we have \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = a^{-2} \\); but since powers of the same quantity are divided by subtracting the exponent of the divisor from that of the dividend (\u00a7 40.), it follows, that \\( \\frac{a^4}{a^3} = a^{4-3} = a^{-1} \\); therefore the fraction \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) may also be expressed thus, \\( a^{-1} \\). By considering \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\) as equal to \\( \\frac{a^2}{a^4} \\), it will appear in the same manner that \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} = \\frac{a^2}{a^5} = a^{-3} \\); and, proceeding in this way, we get \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{a^2}{a^5} = a^{-2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} = \\frac{a^3}{a^6} = a^{-3} \\), &c. and so on, as far as we please. It also appears, that unity or 1 may be represented by \\( a^0 \\), where the exponent is a cypher, for \\( 1 = \\frac{a^0}{a^0} = a^{-0} = a^0 \\).\n\n64. The rules which have been given for the multiplication and division of powers with positive exponents will apply in every case, whether the exponents be positive or negative, and this must evidently take place, for the mode of notation, by which we represent fractional quantities as the powers of integers, but with negative exponents has been derived from those rules.\n\nThus \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\times a^3 \\) or \\( a^{-2} \\times a^3 = a^{-2+3} = a^1 = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), also \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\times \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{a^5} \\).\n612\n\nInvolution.\n\n\\[ \\frac{r}{x} \\text{ or } x^{-2} \\times x^{-3} = x^{-5} = \\frac{1}{x^5} \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{x^3} \\times x^3 = x^{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\times x^3 = x^4 + 1 = x^5 = 1. \\]\n\n65. From this method of notation it appears, that any quantity may be taken from the denominator of a fraction, and placed in the numerator, by changing the sign of its exponent; and hence it follows, that every fraction may also be represented as an integer quantity. Thus \\( \\frac{a^3}{bc^3} \\) denotes the same thing as \\( \\frac{a^3b^{-1}}{c^3} \\) or as \\( a^3b^{-1}c^{-3} \\), also \\( \\frac{a^3}{(x-1)^3} \\) may be otherwise expressed thus, \\( a^3(x-1)^{-3} \\).\n\nOf Involution.\n\n66. Involution is the method of finding any power of any assigned quantity, whether it be simple or compound; hence its rules are easily derived from the operation of multiplication.\n\nCase 1. When the quantity is simple.\n\nRule. Multiply the exponents of the letters by the index of the power required, and raise the coefficient to the same power.\n\nNote. If the sign of the quantity be + all its powers will be positive; but if it be \u2014, then all its powers whose exponents are even numbers are positive, and all its powers whose exponents are odd numbers are negative.\n\nEx. 1. Required the cube, or third power of \\( 2a^2x \\).\n\n\\[(2a^2x)^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2a^2x^3 = 8a^6x^3, \\text{ the answer.}\\]\n\nEx. 2. Required the fifth power of \\( -3a^2x^3 \\).\n\n\\[-(-3a^2x^3)^5 = -243a^{10}x^{15}, \\text{ the answer.}\\]\n\nEx. 3. Required the fourth power of \\( \\frac{-2ax^4}{3b^2y} \\).\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{-2ax^4}{3b^2y}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16a^4x^8}{81b^8y^4}, \\text{ the answer.}\\]\n\nCase 2. When the quantity is compound.\n\nRule. The powers must be found by a continual multiplication of the quantity by itself.\n\nEx. Required the first four powers of the binomial quantity \\( a+x \\).\n\n\\[ a+x \\text{ the root, or first power} \\]\n\n\\[ a^2+2ax+x^2 \\text{ the square, or second power} \\]\n\n\\[ a^3+3a^2x+3ax^2+x^3 \\text{ the cube, or third power} \\]\n\n\\[ a^4+4a^3x+6a^2x^2+4ax^3+x^4 \\text{ the fourth power.} \\]\n\nIf it be required to find the same powers of \\( a-x \\), it will be found, that\n\n\\[ a-x \\text{ is the root, or first power;} \\]\n\n\\[ a^2-2ax+x^2 \\text{ the square, or second power;} \\]\n\n\\[ a^3-3a^2x+3ax^2-x^3 \\text{ the cube, or third power;} \\]\n\n\\[ a^4-4a^3x+6a^2x^2-4ax^3+x^4 \\text{ the fourth power.} \\]\n\nHence it appears, that the powers of \\( a+x \\) differ from the powers of \\( a-x \\), only in this respect, that in the former the signs of the terms are all positive, but in the latter, they are positive and negative alternately.\n\n67. Besides the method of finding the powers of a compound quantity by multiplication, which we have just now explained, there is another, more general, as well as more expeditious, by which a quantity may be raised to any power whatever without the trouble of finding any of the inferior powers, namely, by means of what is commonly called the binomial theorem. This theorem may be expressed as follows. Let \\( a+x \\) be a binomial quantity, which is to be raised to any power denoted by the number \\( n \\), then \\((a+x)^n = a^n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^{n-2}x^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^{n-3}x^3 + \\cdots \\)\n\nThis series will always terminate when \\( n \\) is any whole positive number, by reason of some one of the factors \\( n-1, n-2, \\ldots \\) becoming zero; but if \\( n \\) be either a negative, or fractional number, the series will consist of an infinite number of terms; as, however, we mean to treat in this section only of the powers of quantities when their exponents are whole positive numbers we shall make no farther remarks upon any other; we shall afterwards give a demonstration of the theorem, and show its application to fractional and negative powers in treating of infinite series. The \\( n \\)th power of \\( a-x \\) will not differ from the same power of \\( a+x \\) but in the signs of the terms which compose it, for it will stand thus: \\((a-x)^n = a^n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^{n-2}x^2 + \\cdots \\)\n\nHere \\( n \\) the exponent of the power being 5, the first term \\( a^5 \\) of the general theorem will be equal to \\( a^5 \\), the second \\( na^{n-1}x = 5a^4x \\), the third \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^{n-3}x^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{1 \\cdot 2} a^3x^3 = 10a^3x^3 \\), the fourth \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^{n-4}x^4 = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^2x^4 = 30a^2x^4 \\), the fifth \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} a^{n-5}x^5 = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} ax^5 = 60ax^5 \\), and the sixth and last \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} a^{n-6}x^6 = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} x^6 = 120x^6 \\); the remaining terms...\nEvolution of the general theorem all vanish, by reason of the factor \\( n - 5 = 0 \\) by which each of them is multiplied, so that we get \\((a + x)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4x + 10a^3x^2 + 10a^2x^3 + 5ax^4 + x^5\\).\n\nEx. 2. It is required to raise \\( 2d - \\frac{2}{3} \\) to the third power.\n\nIn this case \\( n = 3 \\), so that if we put \\( a = 2d \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\) we have the first term of the general theorem, or \\( a^n = 8d^3 \\), the second \\( \\frac{n}{1} a^{n-1} x = 3 \\times 4d^2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 6d^2x \\), the third \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} a^{n-2} x^2 = 3 \\times 2d \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 2d^2x^2 \\), and the fourth and last term \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3} a^{n-3} x^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\), and since the signs of the terms of any power of \\( a + x \\) are \\( + \\) and \\( - \\) alternately we have \\( \\left( 2d - \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = 8d^3 - 6d^2x + 2d^2x^2 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3 \\).\n\n68. If the quantity to be involved consists of more than two terms, as if \\( p + q + r \\) were to be raised to the 2nd power, put \\( p = a \\) and \\( q = b \\) then \\( (p + q + r)^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = p^2 + 2pq + (q + r)^2 \\) but \\( 2pq = 2pq - 2pr \\), and by the general theorem \\( (q + r)^2 = q^2 + 2qr + r^2 \\), therefore, we get \\( (p + q + r)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + 2qr + r^2 \\); and by a similar method of procedure a quantity consisting of four or more terms may be raised to any power.\n\nOf Evolution.\n\n69. Evolution is the reverse of involution, or it is the method of finding the root of any quantity, whether simple or compound, which is considered as a power of that root; hence it follows that its operations, generally speaking, must be the reverse of those of involution.\n\n70. To denote that the root of any quantity is to be taken the sign \\( \\sqrt{} \\) (called the radical sign) is placed before it, and a small number placed over the sign to express the denomination of the root. Thus \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) denotes the square root of \\( a \\), \\( \\sqrt[3]{a} \\) its cube root, \\( \\sqrt[4]{a} \\) its fourth root, and in general, \\( \\sqrt[n]{a} \\) its \\( n \\)th root. The number placed over the radical sign is called the index or exponent of the root, and is usually omitted in expressing the square root, thus either \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) or \\( \\sqrt[2]{a} \\) denotes the square root of \\( a \\).\n\n71. Case 1. When roots of simple quantities are to be found.\n\nRule. Divide the exponents of the letters by the index of the root required, and prefix the root of the numeral coefficient, the result will be the root required.\n\nNote 1. The root of any positive quantity may be either positive or negative, if the index of the root be an even number; but if it be an odd number, the root can be positive only.\n\n2. The root of a negative quantity is also negative when the index of root is an odd number.\n\n3. But if the quantity be negative, and the index of the root even, then no root can be assigned.\n\nEx. 1. Required the square root of \\( 36a^2x^4 \\).\n\nHere the index of the root is 2, and the root of the coefficient 6, therefore \\( \\sqrt{36a^2x^4} = 6ax^2 \\) or \\( \\sqrt{36a^2x^4} = -6ax^2 \\); for either of these quantities, when multiplied by itself, produces \\( 36a^2x^4 \\); so that the root required is \\( \\pm 6ax^2 \\), where the sign \\( \\pm \\) denotes that the quantity to which it is prefixed may be considered either as positive or negative.\n\nEx. 2. Required the cube root of \\( 125a^6x^9 \\).\n\nHere the index of the root is 3, and the root of the coefficient 5, therefore \\( \\sqrt[3]{125a^6x^9} = 5a^2x^3 \\) the root required; and in like manner the cube root of \\( -125a^6x^9 \\) is found to be \\( -5a^2x^3 \\).\n\n72. If it be required to extract the square of \\( -a^2 \\), it will immediately appear that no root can be assigned; for it can neither be \\( +a^2 \\) nor \\( -a^2 \\), seeing that each of these quantities when squared produces \\( +a^4 \\), the root required is therefore said to be impossible, and may be expressed thus: \\( \\sqrt{-a^2} \\).\n\nThe root of a fraction is found by extracting that root out of both numerator and denominator. Thus the square root of \\( \\frac{4a^4}{9b^2y^6} \\) is \\( \\frac{2a^2}{3by^3} \\).\n\nCase 2. When the quantity of which the root is to be extracted is compound.\n\n73. I. To extract the square root.\n\nRange the terms of the quantity according the powers of the letters, as in division.\n\nFind the square root of the first term for the first part of the root sought, subtract its square from the given quantity, and divide the remainder by double the part already found, and the quotient is the second term of the root.\n\nAdd the second part to double the first, and multiply their sum by the second part, subtract the product from the remainder, and if nothing remain, the square root is obtained. But if there is a remainder, it must be divided by the double of the parts already found, and the quotient will give the third term of the root, and so on.\n\nEx. 1. Required the square root of \\( a^2 + 2ax + x^2 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\na^2 + 2ax + x^2 \\\\\n\\hline\na^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n2a + x \\\\\n\\times x \\\\\n\\hline\n2ax + x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nEx. 2. Required the square root of \\( x^4 - 2x^3 + \\frac{3}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{16}x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& x^4 - 2x^3 + \\frac{3}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{16}x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n& \\times x - 2x^3 + x^2 \\\\\n& = 2x^3 - 2x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x \\\\\n& \\times \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n& = \\ast \\ast \\ast\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n74. To understand the reason of the rule for finding the square root of a compound quantity, it is only necessary to involve any quantity, as \\( a + b + c \\) to the second power, and observe the composition of its square; for we have \\((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 2ac + 2bc + c^2\\), but \\(2ab + b^2 = (2a + b)b\\) and \\(2ac + 2bc + c^2 = (2a + 2b + c)c\\); therefore,\n\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + (2a + b)b + (2a + 2b + c)c\n\\]\n\nand from this expression the manner of deriving the rule is obvious.\n\nAs an illustration of the common rule for extracting the square root of any proposed number, we shall suppose that the root of 59049 is required.\n\nAccordingly we have \\((a + b + c)^2 = 59049\\), and from hence we are to find the values of \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &= 200 \\times 200 = 40000 \\\\\nb^2 &= 40 \\\\\nc^2 &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence 243 is the root required.\n\nThe same example when wrought by the common rule (see Arithmetic) will stand thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 &= 800000 \\\\\nb^3 &= 7 \\\\\nc^3 &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n75.

To extract the cube root.\n\nRange the terms of the quantity according to the powers of some one of the letters.\n\nFind the root of the first term, for the first part of the root sought; subtract its cube from the whole quantity, and divide the remainder by 3 times the square of the part already found, and the quotient is the second part of the root.\n\nAdd together, 3 times the square of the part of the root already found, 3 times the product of that part and the second part of the root, and the square of the second part; multiply the sum by the second part, and subtract the product from the first remainder, and if nothing remain, the root is obtained; but if there is a remainder, it must be divided by 3 times the square of the sum of the parts already found, and the quotient is a third term of the root, and so on, till the whole root is obtained.\n\nEx. Required the cube root of \\( a^3 + 3a^2x + 3ax^2 + x^3 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 + 3a^2x + 3ax^2 + x^3 & \\text{the root required.} \\\\\n3a^2 + 3ax + x^2 & \\text{the root required.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n76. The reason of the preceding rule is evident from the composition of a cube, for if any quantity as \\(a + b + c\\) be raised to the third power we have \\((a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3abc + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + c^3\\), and by considering in what manner the terms \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are developed from this expression for the cube of their sum, we also see the reason for the common rule for extracting the cube root in numbers. Let it be required to find the cube root of 13312053, where the root will evidently consist of three figures; let us suppose it to be represented by \\(a + b + c\\) and the operation for finding the numerical values of these quantities may stand as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 &= 800000 \\\\\nb^3 &= 7 \\\\\nc^3 &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe operation as performed by the common rule (see Arithmetic) will stand thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n13312053 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n\\hline\n12 \\\\\n18 \\\\\n9 \\\\\n\\hline\n1389 \\\\\n4167 \\\\\n\\hline\n1587 \\\\\n383 \\\\\n49 \\\\\n\\hline\n163579 \\\\\n1145053 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n77. III. To extract any other root.\n\nRule. Range the quantity, of which the root is to be found, according to the powers of its letters, and extract the root of the first term, and that shall be the first member of the root required.\n\nInvolving the first member of the root to a power less by unity than the number that denominates the root required, and multiply the power that arises by the number itself; divide the second term of the given quantity by the product, and the quotient shall give the second member of the root required.\n\nFind the remaining members of the root in the same manner by considering those already found as making one term.\n\nEx. Required the cube root of \\(x^6 + 6x^5 - 40x^3 + 96x - 64\\)\n\n\\[\n(x^3)^3 = x^6 + 6x^5 + 12x^4 + 8x^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x^3 + 2x - 4)^3 = x^6 + 6x^5 - 40x^3 + 96x - 64\n\\]\n\nIn this example, the cube root of \\(x^6\\), or \\(x^2\\), is the first member of the root, and to find a second member the first is raised to the power next lower, or to the second power, and also multiplied by 3, the index of the root required; thus we get \\(3x^4\\) for a divisor, by which the second term \\(6x^5\\) being divided, we find \\(2x\\) for the second member of the root. We must now consider \\(x^4 + 2x\\) as forming one term; accordingly having subtracted its cube from the quantity, of which the root is sought, we have \\(-12x^4\\), &c.; for a new dividend; and having also raised \\(x^3 + 2x\\) to the second power, and multiplied the result by 3, we find \\(3x^4 + 2x\\), &c., for a divisor. As it is only the terms which contain the highest powers of the dividend and divisor that we have occasion for, the remaining terms are expressed by &c. Having divided \\(-12x^4\\) by \\(3x^4\\), we find \\(-4\\)\n\nfor the third term of the root; and because it appears that \\(x^3 + 2x - 4\\), when raised to the third power, gives a result the very same with the proposed power, we conclude \\(x^3 + 2x - 4\\) to be the root sought.\n\n78. In the preceding examples, the quantities whose roots were to be found have been all such as could have their roots expressed by a finite number of terms; but it will frequently happen, that the root cannot be otherwise assigned than by a series consisting of an infinite number of terms: the preceding rules, however, will serve to determine any number of terms of the series. Thus the square root of \\(a^3 + x^2\\) will be found to be \\(a + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} - \\frac{5x^8}{128a^7} + \\ldots\\) and the cube root of \\(a^3 + x^3\\) will stand thus \\(a + \\frac{x^3}{3a} - \\frac{x^6}{9a^2} + \\frac{5x^9}{81a^3} - \\frac{10x^{12}}{243a^4} + \\ldots\\), &c. But as the extraction of roots in the form of series can be more easily performed by other methods, we shall refer the reader to Section 17, which treats of series, where this subject is again resumed.\n\nSect. IV. Of Surds.\n\n79. It has been already observed (71), that the root of any proposed quantity is found by dividing the exponent of the quantity by the index of the root; and the rule has been illustrated by suitable examples, in all which, however, the quotient expressing the exponent of the result is a whole number; but there may be cases in which the quotient is a fraction. Thus if the cube root of \\(a^2\\) were required, it might be expressed, agreeably to the method of notation already explained, either thus \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\), or thus \\(a^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\).\n\n80. Quantities which have fractional exponents are called surds, or imperfect powers, and are said to be irrational, in opposition to others with integral exponents which are called rational.\n\n81. Surds may be denoted by means of the radical sign, but it will often be more convenient to use the notation of fractional exponents; the following examples will show how they may be expressed either way.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a} = a^{\\frac{1}{3}}, \\quad \\sqrt[4]{ab} = b^{\\frac{1}{4}}, \\quad \\sqrt[4]{a^3b^4} = a^{\\frac{3}{4}}b^{\\frac{4}{4}}, \\quad \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = (a^2 + b^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\quad \\sqrt{(a - b)^2} = (a - b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\quad \\sqrt{ab} = (a + b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\\(a^{-\\frac{1}{2}}b^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\n82. The operations concerning surds depend on the following principle. If the numerator and denominator of a fractional exponent be either both multiplied, or both divided by the same quantity, the value of the power is the same. Thus \\(a^m = a^n\\). For let \\(a^m = b\\), then, raising both to the power \\(n\\), \\(a^m = b^n\\), and farther raising both to the power \\(c\\) we get \\(a^{mc} = b^{nc}\\); let the root \\(cn\\) be now taken and we find \\(a^{mc} = b^{nc}\\).\n\n83. Prob. I. To Reduce a Rational Quantity to the form of a Surd of any given denomination.\n\nRule. Reduce the exponent of the quantity to the form of a fraction of the same denomination as the given surd.\n\nEx. 1,\nEx. 1. Reduce \\(a^2\\) to the form of the cube root.\n\nHere the exponent 2 must be reduced to the form of a fraction having 3 for a denominator, which will be the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\); therefore \\(a^2 = a^{\\frac{6}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Reduce 5 to the form of the cube root, and \\(3ab^4\\) to the form of the square root.\n\nFirst \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt[3]{5 \\times 5 \\times 5} = \\sqrt[3]{125}\\).\n\nAnd \\(3ab^4 = 3^{\\frac{3}{4}} a^{\\frac{3}{4}} b^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (3^3 a^3 b^3)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt[4]{9a^3b^3}\\).\n\n84. Prob. II. To Reduce Surds of different denominations to others of the same value, and of the same denominations.\n\nRule. Reduce the fractional exponents to others of the same value, and having the same common denominator.\n\nEx. 1. Reduce \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[3]{b^2}\\), or \\(a^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\(b^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\) to other equivalent surds of the same denomination.\n\nThe exponents \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), when reduced to a common denominator, are \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{6}\\); therefore, the surds required are \\(a^{\\frac{3}{6}}\\) and \\(b^{\\frac{4}{6}}\\), or \\(\\sqrt[6]{a^3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[6]{b^4}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Reduce \\(3^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\(2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) to surds of the same denomination.\n\nThe new exponents are \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\), therefore we have \\(3^{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\sqrt[6]{3^1} = \\sqrt[6]{27}\\), and \\(2^{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\sqrt[6]{2^2} = \\sqrt[6]{4}\\).\n\nAnd in the same way the surds \\(A^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\), \\(B^{\\frac{n}{m}}\\) are reduced to these two \\(\\sqrt{A^n}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{B^m}\\).\n\n35. Prob. III. To Reduce Surds to their most simple terms.\n\nRule. Resolve the surd into two factors, so that one of them may be a complete power, having its exponent divisible by the index of the surd. Extract the root of that power, and place it before the remaining quantities, with the proper radical sign between them.\n\nEx. 1. Reduce \\(\\sqrt{48}\\) to its most simple terms.\n\nThe number 48 may be resolved into the two factors 16 and 3, of which the first is a complete square; therefore \\(\\sqrt{48} = (4^2 \\times 3)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4 \\times 3^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Reduce \\(\\sqrt{98a^4x}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{24a^3x + 40a^3x^3}\\), each to its most simple terms.\n\nFirst \\(\\sqrt{98a^4x} = (7^2 a^4 \\times 2x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 7a^2 \\times (2x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 7a^2 \\sqrt{2x}\\).\n\nAlso \\(\\sqrt{24a^3x + 40a^3x^3} = (2^3 a^3 (3x + 5x^3))^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2a \\sqrt{3x + 5x^3}\\).\n\n86. Prob. IV. To Add and Subtract Surds.\n\nRule. If the surds are of different denominations, reduce them to others of the same denomination, by prob. 2.; and then reduce them to their simplest terms by last problem. Then, if the surd part be the same in them all, annex it to the sum, or difference of the rational parts, with the sign of multiplication, and it will give the sum, or difference required. But if the surd part be not the same in all the quantities, they can only be added, or subtracted by placing the signs \\(+\\) or \\(-\\) between them.\n\nEx. 1. Required the sum of \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{48}\\).\n\nBy prob. 3., we find \\(\\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\), therefore \\(\\sqrt{27} + \\sqrt{48} = 3\\sqrt{3} + 4\\sqrt{3} = 7\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Required the sum of \\(3^{\\frac{3}{4}}\\) and \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}}\\).\n\n\\(3^{\\frac{3}{4}} = 3^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = 5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{5}{4} \\sqrt{2}\\),\n\ntherefore \\(3^{\\frac{3}{4}} + 5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{5}{4} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{8}{4} \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nEx. 3. Required the difference between \\(\\sqrt{80a^4x}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{20a^4x^3}\\).\n\n\\(\\sqrt{80a^4x} = (4^2 a^4 \\times 5x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4a^2 \\sqrt{5x}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{20a^4x^3} = (2^2 a^4 x^3 \\times 5x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2ax \\sqrt{5x}\\); therefore \\(\\sqrt{80a^4x} - \\sqrt{20a^4x^3} = (4a^2 - 2ax) \\sqrt{5x}\\).\n\n87. Prob. V. To Multiply and Divide Surds.\n\nRule. If they are surds of the same rational quantity, add and subtract their exponents.\n\nBut if they are surds of different rational quantities, let them be brought to others of the same denomination, by prob. 2. Then, by multiplying or dividing these rational quantities, their product, or quotient may be set under the common radical sign.\n\nNote. If the surds have any rational coefficients, their product or quotient must be prefixed.\n\nEx. 1. Required the product of \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3}\\).\n\n\\(\\sqrt[3]{a^2} \\times \\sqrt[3]{a^3} = a^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times a^{\\frac{3}{3}} = a^{\\frac{5}{3}} = a^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\), Ans.\n\nEx. 2. Divide \\(\\sqrt{a^3 - b^3}\\) by \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\).\n\nThese surds when reduced to the same denomination are \\((a^3 - b^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\((a + b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). Hence \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a^3 - b^3}}{\\sqrt{a + b}} = \\left(\\frac{(a^3 - b^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{(a + b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{(a^3 - b^3)}{(a + b)^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{(a + b)(a - b)}\\).\n\nEx. 3. Required the product of \\(5\\sqrt{8}\\) and \\(3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n\\(5\\sqrt{8} \\times 3\\sqrt{5} = 5 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{8} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 15 \\times \\sqrt{40} = 15 \\times \\sqrt{4 \\times 10} = 30\\sqrt{10}\\).\n\nEx. 4. Divide \\(8\\sqrt{56}\\) by \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{56}}{4\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{56}}{2\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{28}\\).\nEx. 5. Required the product of \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) and \\( x^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\), also the quotient arising from the division of \\( a^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) by \\( b^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\).\n\nFirst \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\times x^{\\frac{1}{n}} = x^{\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}} = x^{\\frac{m+n}{mn}} = \\sqrt[mn]{x^{m+n}} \\),\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{a^{\\frac{1}{m}}}{b^{\\frac{1}{n}}} = \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{mn}} = \\frac{mn}{\\sqrt{a^m b^n}} \\).\n\n88. Prob. VI. To Involve and Evolve Surds.\n\nSurds are involved or evolved in the same manner as any other quantities, namely, by multiplying or dividing their exponents by the index of the power, or root required. Thus the square of \\( 3^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times (3)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 9 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{9} \\). The \\( n \\)th power of \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) is \\( x^{\\frac{n}{m}} \\). The cube root of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2} \\) is \\( \\frac{6}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2} \\) and the \\( n \\)th root of \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) is \\( x^{\\frac{n}{m}} \\).\n\n89. If a compound quantity involve one or more surds, its powers may be found by multiplication. Thus the square of \\( 3 + \\sqrt{5} \\) is found as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3 + \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n3 + \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n9 + 3\\sqrt{5} \\\\\n+ 3\\sqrt{5} + 5 \\\\\n9 + 6\\sqrt{5} + 5 = 14 + 6\\sqrt{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthe square required.\n\n90. The square root of a binomial, or residual surd \\( A+B \\), or \\( A-B \\) may be found thus. Take \\( \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2} = D \\);\n\nthen \\( \\sqrt{A+B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A+D}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{A-D}{2}} \\),\n\nand \\( \\sqrt{A-B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A+D}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{A-D}{2}} \\).\n\nThus the square root of \\( 8 + 2\\sqrt{7} \\) is \\( 1 + \\sqrt{7} \\); and the square root of \\( 3 - \\sqrt{8} \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\). With respect to the extraction of the cube or any higher root no general rule can be given.\n\nSect. V. Of Proportion.\n\n91. In comparing together any two quantities of the same kind in respect of magnitude, we may consider how much the one is greater than the other, or else how many times the one contains either the whole, or some part of the other; or which is the same thing, we may consider either what is the difference between the quantities, or what is the quotient arising from the division of the one quantity by the other; the former of these is called their arithmetical ratio, and the latter their geometrical ratio. These denominations, however, have been assumed arbitrarily, and have little or no connexion with the relations they are intended to express.\n\nI. Of Arithmetical Proportion.\n\n92. When of four quantities the difference between the first and second is equal to the difference between the third and fourth, the quantities are called arithmetical proportions. Such, for example, are the numbers 2, 5, 9, 12; and, in general, the quantities \\( a, a+d, b, b+d \\). If the two middle terms are equal, the quantities constitute what are called three arithmetical proportions.\n\n93. The most material property of four arithmetical proportions is the following: If four quantities be arithmetically proportional, the sum of the extreme terms is equal to the sum of the means. Let the quantities be \\( a, a+d, b, b+d \\), where \\( d \\) is the difference between the first and second, and also between the third and fourth, the sum of the extremes is \\( a+b+d \\), and that of the means \\( a+d+b \\); so that the truth of the proportion is evident. Hence it follows, that if any three quantities be arithmetically proportional, the sum of the two extremes is double the mean.\n\n94. If any three terms of four arithmetical proportions be given, the fourth may be found from the preceding proposition. Let \\( a, b, c \\), be the first, second, and fourth terms, and let \\( x \\) the third term be required; because \\( a+c=b+x \\); therefore \\( x=a+c-b \\).\n\nIn like manner any two of three arithmetical proportions being supposed given, the remaining term may be readily found.\n\n95. If a series of quantities be such, that the difference between any two adjacent terms is always the same, these terms form a continued arithmetical proportion. Thus the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. form a series in continued arithmetical proportion, and, in general, such a series may be represented thus:\n\n\\( a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d, a+6d, \\&c. \\)\n\nwhere \\( a \\) denotes the first term, and \\( d \\) the common difference.\n\nBy a little attention to this series, we readily discover that it has the following properties:\n\n1. The last term of the series is equal to the first term, together with the common difference taken as often as there are terms after the first. Thus, when the number of terms is 7, the last term is \\( a+6d \\); and so on. Hence if \\( x \\) denote the last term, \\( n \\) the number of terms, and \\( a \\) and \\( d \\) express the first term, and common difference, we have \\( x=a+(n-1)d \\).\n\n2. The sum of the first and last term is equal to the sum of any two terms at the same distance from them. Thus suppose the number of terms to be 7, then the last term is \\( a+6d \\), and the sum of the first and last, \\( 2a+6d \\); but the same is also the sum of the second and last but one, of the third and last but two, and so on till we come to the middle term, which, because it is equally distant from the extremes, must be added to itself.\n\n96. From this last mentioned property we derive a rule for finding the sum of all the terms of the series. For if the sum of the first and last be taken, as also the sum of the second and last but one, of the third and last but two, and so on along the series till we come to the sum of the last and first terms, it is evident that we shall have as many sums as there are terms, and each equal to the sum of the first and last terms; but the aggregate of those sums is equal to all the terms of the series taken twice, therefore the sum of the first and last term, taken as often as there are terms, is equal to twice the sum of all the terms, so that if \\( s \\) denote that sum, we have \\( 2s=n(a+x) \\), and \\( s=\\frac{n}{2}(a+x) \\).\nHence the sum of the odd numbers \\(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \\ldots\\) continued to \\(n\\) terms, is equal to the square of the number of terms. For in this case \\(a = 1\\), \\(d = 2\\), \\(s = 1 + (n-1)d = 2n - 1\\), therefore \\(s = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 2n = n^2\\).\n\nII. Of Geometrical Proportion.\n\n97. When of four quantities, the quotient arising from the division of the first by the second is equal to that arising from the division of the third by the fourth, these quantities are said to be in geometrical proportion, or are called simply proportional. Thus \\(1, 2, 4, 8, \\ldots\\) are four numbers in geometrical proportion; and in general, \\(na, a, nb, b\\) may express any four proportions, for \\(\\frac{na}{a} = n\\), and also \\(\\frac{nb}{b} = n\\).\n\n98. To denote that any four quantities \\(a, b, c, d\\), are proportional, it is common to place them thus, \\(a : b :: c : d\\), or thus \\(a : b = c : d\\), which notation, when expressed in words, is read thus, \\(a\\) is to \\(b\\) as \\(c\\) to \\(d\\), or the ratio of \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) is equal to the ratio of \\(c\\) to \\(d\\).\n\nThe first and third terms of a proportion are called the antecedents, and the second and fourth, the consequents.\n\n99. When the two middle terms of a proportion are the same, the remaining terms, and that quantity, constitute three geometrical proportions; such are \\(4, 6, 9\\), and in general \\(na, a, \\frac{a}{n}\\). In this case the middle quantity is called a mean proportional between the other two.\n\n100. The principal properties of four proportional are the following:\n\n1. If four quantities be proportional, the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means. Let \\(a, b, c, d\\) be four quantities, such that \\(a : b :: c : d\\); then from the nature of proportions \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\); let these equal quotients be multiplied by \\(bd\\), and we have \\(\\frac{abd}{b} = \\frac{cbd}{d}\\), or \\(ad = bc\\). Hence it follows that when three quantities are proportional, the product of the extremes is equal to the square of the middle term. It also appears, that if any three of four proportional be given, the remaining one may be found. Thus let \\(a, b, c\\), the three first be given, and let it be required to find \\(x\\) the fourth term; because \\(a : b :: c : x\\), \\(ax = bc\\), and dividing by \\(a\\), \\(x = \\frac{bc}{a}\\). This conclusion may be considered as a demonstration of what is called the rule of three in arithmetic.\n\n2. If four quantities be such that the product of two of them is equal to the product of the other two, these quantities are proportional.\n\nLet \\(a, b, c, d\\) be the quantities, which are such that \\(ad = bc\\), if these equals be divided by \\(bd\\), we get \\(\\frac{ad}{bd} = \\frac{bc}{bd}\\) or \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\) hence it follows, from the definition given of proportions, (\\$97.) that \\(a : b :: c : d\\). From Geometric this property of proportions it appears, that if three cal Proportion quantities be such that the square of one of them be equal to the product of the other two, these quantities are three proportional.\n\n101. If four quantities are proportional, that is, if \\(a : b :: c : d\\), then will each of the following combinations or arrangements of the quantities be also four proportional.\n\n1st, By inversion \\(b : a :: d : c\\)\n2nd, By alternation \\(a : c :: b : d\\)\n3rd, By composition \\(a + b : a + c :: d + c\\)\nor \\(a + b : b :: c + d : d\\)\n4th, By division \\(a - b : a :: c - d : d\\)\nor \\(a - b : b :: c - d : d\\)\n5th, By mixing \\(a + b : a - b :: c + d : c - d\\)\n6th, By taking any equimultiples of the antecedents, and also any equimultiples of the consequents \\(na : pb :: nc : pd\\)\n7th, Or by taking any parts of the antecedents and consequents \\(\\frac{a}{n} : \\frac{b}{p} :: \\frac{c}{n} : \\frac{d}{p}\\)\n\nThat the preceding combinations of the quantities \\(a, b, c, d\\) are proportional, may be readily proved, by taking the products of the extremes and means; for from each of them we derive this conclusion, that \\(ad = bc\\), which is known to be true, from the original assumption of the quantities.\n\n102. If four quantities be proportional, and also other four, the product of the corresponding terms will be proportional.\n\nLet \\(a : b :: c : d\\),\nand \\(e : f :: g : h\\),\nThen \\(ae : bf :: cg : dh\\).\n\nFor \\(ad = bc\\) and \\(eh = fg\\) (\\$100.), therefore, multiplying together these equal quantities \\(ad \\cdot eh = bc \\cdot fg\\), or \\(ae \\cdot db = bf \\cdot cg\\), therefore by the second property (\\$100.), \\(ae : bf :: cg : dh\\).\n\n103. Hence it follows, that if there be any number of proportions whatever, the products of the corresponding terms will still be proportional.\n\n104. If a series of quantities be so related to each other, that the quotient arising from the division of any term by that which follows it is always the same quantity, these quantities are said to be in continued geometrical proportion, such as the numbers \\(2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \\ldots\\) &c. also \\(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\ldots\\) &c., and in general a series of such quantities may be represented thus, \\(a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, ar^5, \\ldots\\) &c. Here \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(r\\) the quotient of any two adjoining terms, which is also called the common ratio.\n\n105. By inspecting this series we find that it has the following properties:\n\n1. The last term is equal to the first, multiplied by the common ratio raised to a power, the index of which is one less than the number of terms. Therefore if \\(z\\) denote the last term, and \\(n\\) the number of terms, \\(z = ar^{n-1}\\).\n\n---\n\n* The quantities in this case must be all of the same kind, that is, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote surfaces, then \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) must also denote surfaces, but they cannot represent lines, &c.\n2. The product of the first and last term is equal to the product of any two terms equally distant from them; thus, supposing \\( ar^5 \\) the last term, it is evident that \\( a \\times ar^5 = ar \\times ar^4 = ar^2 \\times ar^3 \\), &c.\n\n106. The sum of all the terms may be found thus: let \\( s \\) represent that sum, then, supposing the number of terms to be fixed, \\( s = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ar^5 \\), and multiplying these equals by \\( r \\), \\( sr = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ar^5 + ar^6 \\). If from the lower line, or \\( sr = ar + ar^2 + \\ldots + ar^5 \\), we subtract the upper line, or \\( s = a + ar + \\ldots + ar^5 \\), the remainders will evidently be equal; but on the one side of the sum we have \\( sr - s = ar^6 - a \\); and on the other \\( ar^6 - a \\); therefore, \\( sr - s = ar^6 - a \\).\n\nand dividing by \\( r - 1 \\), \\( s = \\frac{ar^n - a}{r - 1} \\). Let us now, instead of 6, substitute \\( n \\) (for the number of terms put down was 6), and we have the following general rule for finding the sum of a series of quantities in continued geometrical proportion, \\( s = \\frac{ar^n - a}{r - 1} \\), or \\( s = \\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \\).\n\nSect. VI. Of the Reduction of Equations involving one unknown quantity.\n\n107. The general object of algebraic investigation is to discover certain unknown quantities, by comparing them with other quantities which are given, or supposed to be known. The relation between the known and unknown quantities is either that of equality, or else such as may be reduced to equality; and a proposition which affirms that certain combinations of quantities are equal to one another is called an equation. Such are the following, \\( \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{24}{x} \\), \\( 2x + 3y = xy \\); the first of these equations expresses the relation between an unknown quantity \\( x \\), and certain known numbers; and the second expresses the relation which the two indefinite quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) have to each other.\n\n108. When a quantity stands alone on one side of an equation, the terms on the other side are said to be a value of that quantity. Thus in the equation \\( x = ax + bx - c \\), the quantity \\( x \\) stands alone on one side, and \\( ax + bx - c \\) is its value.\n\n109. The conditions of a problem may be such as to require several equations and symbols of unknown quantities for their complete expression; these, however, by rules hereafter to be explained, may be reduced to one equation, involving only one unknown quantity and its powers, besides the known quantities; and the method of expressing that quantity, by means of the known quantities, constitutes the theory of equations, one of the most important, as well as most intricate branches of algebraic analysis.\n\n110. An equation is said to be resolved, when the unknown quantity is made to stand alone on one side, and only known quantities on the other side; and the value of the unknown quantity is called a root of the equation.\n\n111. Equations containing only one unknown quantity and its powers, are divided into different orders, according to the highest power of that quantity contained in any one of its terms. The equation, however, is supposed to be reduced to such a form, that the unknown quantity is found only in the numerators of the terms, and that the exponents of its powers are expressed by positive integers.\n\n112. If an equation contains only the first power of the unknown quantity, it is called a simple equation, or an equation of the first order. Such is \\( ax + bx = c \\), where \\( x \\) denotes an unknown, and \\( a, b, c \\) known quantities.\n\n113. If the equation contains the second power of the unknown quantity, it is said to be of the second degree, or is called a quadratic equation; such is \\( 4x^2 + 3x = 12 \\), and in general \\( ax^2 + bx = c \\). If it contains the third power of the unknown quantity, it is of the third degree, or is a cubic equation. Such are \\( x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x = 10 \\), and \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx = d \\), and so on, with respect to equations of the higher orders. A simple equation is sometimes said to be linear, or to be of one dimension. In like manner, quadratic equations are said to be equations of two dimensions, and cubic equations to be of three dimensions.\n\n114. When in the course of an algebraic investigation we arrive at an equation involving only one unknown quantity, that quantity will often be so entangled in the different terms, as to render several previous reductions necessary before the equation can be expressed under its characteristic form, so as to be resolved by the rules which belong to that form.\n\nThese reductions depend upon the operations which have been explained in the former part of this treatise, and the application of a few self-evident principles, namely, that if equal quantities be added to, or subtracted from equal quantities, the sums or remainders will be equal; if equal quantities be multiplied, or divided by the same quantity, the products or quotients will be equal; and, lastly, if equal quantities be raised to the same power, or have the same root extracted out of each, the results will still be equal.\n\nFrom these considerations are derived the following rules, which apply alike to equations of all orders, and are alone sufficient for the resolution of simple equations.\n\n115. Rule 1. Any quantity may be transposed from one side of an equation to the other, by changing its signs.\n\nThus, if \\( x - 3 = 5 \\)\nThen \\( x = 5 + 3 \\)\nOr \\( x = 8 \\)\n\nAnd if \\( 3x - 10 = 2x + 5 \\)\nThen \\( 3x - 2x = 5 + 10 \\)\nOr \\( x = 15 \\)\n\nAgain, if \\( ax + bx = cx - dx + e \\)\nThen \\( ax - cx + dx = e - b \\)\nOr \\( (a - c + d)x = e - b \\)\n\nThe reason of this rule is evident, for the transposing a quantity from one side of an equation to the other is nothing more than adding the same quantity to each side of the equation, if the sign of the quantity transposed was \\(-\\); or subtracting it, if the sign was \\(+\\).\n\nFrom this rule we may infer, that if any quantity be found on each side of the equation with the same sign, it may be left out of both. Also, that the signs of all the terms of an equation may be changed into\nReduction the contrary without affecting the truth of the equation.\n\nThus, if \\(a + x = b + a - c\\)\nThen \\(x = b + c\\)\nAnd if \\(a - x = b - d\\)\nThen \\(x = a - d - b\\)\n\n116. Rule 2. If the unknown quantity in an equation be multiplied by any quantity, that quantity may be taken away, by dividing all the other terms of the equation by it.\n\nIf \\(3x = 24\\)\nThen \\(x = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\\)\nIf \\(ax = b - c\\)\nThen \\(x = \\frac{b - c}{a}\\)\n\nHere equal quantities are divided by the same quantity, and therefore the quotients are equal.\n\n117. Rule 3. If any term of an equation be a fraction, its denominator may be taken away by multiplying all the other terms of the equation by that denominator.\n\nIf \\(x = \\frac{7}{5}\\)\nThen \\(x = 35\\)\nIf \\(x = \\frac{b - c + d}{a}\\)\nThen \\(x = ab - ac + ad\\)\nIf \\(a = b = c\\),\n\\(ax = bx\\).\n\nIn these examples, equal quantities are multiplied by the same quantity, and therefore the products are equal.\n\n118. The denominators may be taken away from several terms of an equation by one operation, if we multiply all the terms by any number which is a multiple of each of these denominators.\n\nThus, if \\(\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{x}{4} = 26\\).\n\nLet all the terms be multiplied by 12, which is a multiple of 2, 3, and 4, and we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12x}{2} + \\frac{12x}{3} + \\frac{12x}{4} = 312\n\\]\n\nOr \\(6x + 4x + 3x = 312\\)\nHence \\(13x = 312\\)\n\nUniversally, if \\(\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{x}{b} + \\frac{x}{c} = d - e\\).\n\nTo take away the denominators \\(a, b, c\\), let the whole equation be multiplied by \\(abc\\), their product, and we have\n\n\\[bcx - acx + abx = abc(d - e)\\]\nOr \\((bc - ac + ab)x = abc(d - e)\\);\n\n119. From the two last rules it appears that if all the terms of an equation be either multiplied or divided by the same quantity, that quantity may be left out of all the terms.\n\nIf \\(ax = ab - ac\\)\nThen \\(x = b - c\\)\nAnd if \\(\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{b}{a} + \\frac{c}{a}\\)\nThen \\(x = b + c\\).\n\n120. Rule. If the unknown quantity is found in any term which is a furd, let that furd be made to stand alone on one side of the equation, and the remaining terms on the opposite side; then involve each side to a power denoted by the index of the furd, and thus the unknown quantity shall be freed from the furd expression.\n\nIf \\(\\sqrt{x} + 6 = 10\\)\nThen by transposition \\(\\sqrt{x} = 10 - 6 = 4\\)\nAnd squaring both sides \\(\\sqrt{x} \\times \\sqrt{x} = 4 \\times 4\\)\nOr \\(x = 16\\).\n\nAlso, if \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = b + x\\)\nBy trans. \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = b + x\\)\nAnd squaring, \\(a^2 + x^2 = (b + x)^2 = b^2 + 2bx + x^2\\)\nHence \\(a^2 = b^2 + 2bx\\).\n\nAnd if \\(\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = a\\)\nThen \\(a^2 - b^2 = a^2\\).\n\n121. Rule 5. If the side of the equation, which contains the unknown quantity, be a perfect power, the equation may be reduced to another of a lower order, by extracting the root of that power out of each side of the equation.\n\nThus if \\(x^3 = 64a^3\\)\nThen, by extracting the cube root, \\(x = 8a\\)\nAnd if \\((a + x)^3 = b^3 - a^3\\)\nThen \\(a + x = \\sqrt[3]{b^3 - a^3}\\).\n\n122. The use of the preceding rules will be farther illustrated by the following examples:\n\nEx. 1. Let \\(2c - 3x = 60 - 7x\\)\nBy rule 1,\n\\(7x - 3x = 60 + 8 - 2x\\)\nOr \\(4x = 48\\)\nTherefore by rule 2, \\(x = 12\\).\n\nEx. 2. Let \\(ax - bx = cx + d\\)\nBy rule 1,\n\\(ax - cx = bx + d\\)\nOr \\((a - c)x = b + d\\)\nAnd by rule 2, \\(x = \\frac{b + d}{a - c}\\).\n\nEx. 3. Let \\(\\frac{x + 1}{2} + \\frac{x + 2}{3} = 16 - \\frac{x + 3}{4}\\)\nBy rule 3,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + 1 + 2x + 4 &= 32 - 2x + 6 \\\\\n3x + 3 + 2x + 4 &= 96 - 6x + 18 \\\\\n12x + 12 + 8x + 16 &= 384 - 6x - 18 \\\\\n20x + 28 &= 366 - 6x\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOr \\(26x = 338\\)\nHence, by rule 1, \\(26x = 338\\)\nAnd by rule 2, \\(x = 13\\).\n\nIn this example, instead of taking away the denominators one after another, they might have been all taken away at once, by multiplying the given equation by\nReduction by 12, which is divisible by the numbers 2, 3, and 4; thus we should have got $6x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 8 = 192 - 3x - 9$, and hence, as before, $x = 1$.\n\nEx. 4. Let $6x^3 - 20x^2 = 16x^2 + 2x^3$\n\nThen dividing by $2x^2$, $3x - 10 = 8 + x$\nAnd transposing, $3x - x = 8 + 10$\nOr $2x = 18$\nAnd therefore $x = 9$.\n\nEx. 5. Let $\\frac{b^2}{x} = c$\n\nThen $ax - b^2 = cx$\nAnd $ax - cx = b^2$\nWhence $x = \\frac{b^2}{a - c}$.\n\nEx. 6. Let $x - 6 = \\frac{x^2}{x + 24}$\n\nThen $(x - 6)(x + 24) = x^2$\nThat is $x^2 + 18x - 144 = x^2$\nTherefore $18x = 144$\nAnd $x = 8$.\n\nEx. 7. Let $ax + b^2 = \\frac{ax^2 + ac^2}{a + x}$\n\nThen $(a + x)(ax + b^2) = ax^2 + ac^2$\nOr $a^2x + ab^2 + ax^2 + b^2x = ax^2 + ac^2$\nHence $a^2x + b^2x = ac^2 - ab^2$\nAnd $x = \\frac{ac^2 - ab^2}{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\nEx. 8. Let $\\frac{1 - x}{1 + x} = a$\n\nThen $1 - x = a + ax$\nAnd $-x = ax = a - 1$\nOr changing the signs, $x + ax = 1 - a$\nHence, $x = \\frac{1 - a}{1 + a}$.\n\nEx. 9. Let $\\sqrt{12 + x} = 2 + \\sqrt{x}$\n\nThen by rule 4, $12 + x = 4 + 4\\sqrt{x} + x$\nAnd by transposition $8 = 4\\sqrt{x}$\nAnd by division $2 = \\sqrt{x}$\nAnd again by rule 4, $4 = x$.\n\nEx. 10. Let $x + \\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = \\frac{2a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}$\n\nThen, by rule 3, $x\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} + a^2 + x^2 = 2a^2$\nAnd by transposition, &c., $x\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2 - x^2$\nTherefore, by rule 4, $a^2x^2 + x^4 = a^4 - 2a^2x^2 + x^4$\nWhence $3a^2x^2 = a^4$\nAnd $x^2 = \\frac{a^2}{3}$, therefore, rule 5, $x = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nEx. 11. Let $\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = a$\n\nThen $1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = a + a\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\n\nAnd $1 - a = a\\sqrt{1 - x^2} + \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = (1 + a)\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\n\nWhence $\\frac{1 - a}{1 + a} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\n\nAnd, taking the square of both sides, $\\frac{(1 - a)^2}{(1 + a)^2} = 1 - x^2$\n\nTherefore, by transposition, $x^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - a)^2}{(1 + a)^2}$\n\nThat is, $x^2 = \\frac{(1 + a)^2 - (1 - a)^2}{(1 + a)^2} = \\frac{4a}{(1 + a)^2}$\n\nTherefore $x = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{1 + a}$.\n\nEx. 12. Let $a + x = \\sqrt{a^2 + x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}}$\n\nThen $(a + x)^2 = a^2 + x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nThat is, $a^2 + 2ax + x^2 = a^2 + x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nTherefore $2ax + x^2 = x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nAnd dividing by $x$, $2a + x = \\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nAgain taking the squares of both sides, $4a^2 + 4ax + x^2 = b^2 + x^2$\nWhence $4a^2 + 4ax = b^2$\nAnd $4ax = b^2 - 4a^2$; so that $x = \\frac{b^2 - 4a^2}{4a}$.\n\n123. In all these examples we have been able to determine the value of the unknown quantity by the rules already delivered, because in every case the first, or at most the second power of that quantity, has been made to stand alone on one side of the equation, while the other consisted only of known quantities; but the same methods of reduction serve to bring equations of all degrees to a proper form for solution. Thus if $\\frac{1 - p + q + r}{x + 1} = 1 - p - x + r$, by proper reduction, we have $x^3 + px^2 + qx = r$, a cubic equation, which may be resolved by rules to be afterwards explained.\n\nSect. VII. Of the Reduction of Equations involving more than one unknown quantity.\n\n124. Having shown in the last section in what manner an equation involving one unknown quantity may be resolved, or at least fitted for a final solution, we are next to explain the methods by which two or more equations, involving as many unknown quantities, may at last be reduced to one equation, and one unknown quantity.\n\nAs the unknown quantities may be combined together in very different ways, so as to constitute an equation, the methods most proper for their extermination must therefore be various. The three following, however, are of general application, and the last of them may be used with advantage, not only when the unknown quantity to be exterminated arises to the same power in all the equations, but also when the equations contain different powers of that quantity.\n\n125. Method 1. Observe which of the unknown quantities is the least involved, and let its value be found from each equation by the rules of last section.\n\nLet the values thus found be put equal to each other, and hence new equations will arise, from which\n\nReduction that quantity is wholly excluded. Let the same operation be now repeated with the new equations, and the unknown quantities exterminated one by one, till at last an equation be found, which contains only one unknown quantity.\n\nEx. Let it be required to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from these two equations.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 23 \\\\\n5x - 2y &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x &= 23 - 3y \\\\\nx &= \\frac{23 - 3y}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n5x &= 10 + 2y \\\\\nx &= \\frac{10 + 2y}{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\) be now put equal to each other.\n\nAnd we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{10 + 2y}{5} &= \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} \\\\\n2(10 + 2y) &= 5(23 - 3y) \\\\\n20 + 4y &= 115 - 15y \\\\\n19y &= 95 \\\\\ny &= 5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( x = \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} \\), or \\( x = \\frac{10 + 2y}{5} \\), from either of these values we find \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n126. Method 2. Let the value of the unknown quantity, which is to be exterminated, be found from that equation wherein it is last involved. Let this value, and its powers, be substituted for that quantity, and its respective powers in the other equations; and with the new equations thus arising, let the operation be repeated, till there remain only one equation, and one unknown quantity.\n\nEx. Let the given equations, as in last method, be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 23 \\\\\n5x - 2y &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation \\( x = \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} \\)\n\nAnd this value of \\( x \\) being substituted in the second equation, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n5 \\times \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} - 2y &= 10 \\\\\n115 - 15y - 4y &= 20 \\\\\n95 &= 19y \\\\\ny &= 5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd hence \\( x = \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} = 4 \\), as before.\n\n127. Method 3. Let the given equations be multiplied or divided by such numbers or quantities, whether known or unknown, that the term which involves the highest power of the unknown quantity may be the same in each equation.\n\nThen by adding or subtracting the equations, as occasion may require, that term will vanish, and a new equation emerge, wherein the number of dimensions of the unknown quantity in some cases, and in others the number of unknown quantities, will be diminished; and by a repetition of the same, or similar operations, a final equation may be at last obtained, involving only one unknown quantity.\n\nEx. Let the same example be taken, as in the illustration of the two former methods, namely,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 23 \\\\\n5x - 2y &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand from these two equations we are to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). To exterminate \\( x \\), let the first equation be multiplied by 5, and the second by 2, thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10x + 15y &= 115 \\\\\n10x - 4y &= 20\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the term involving \\( x \\) is the same in both equations, and it is obvious that by subtracting the one from the other, the resulting equation will contain only \\( y \\), and known numbers, for by such subtraction we find \\( 19y = 95 \\), and therefore \\( y = 5 \\).\n\nHaving got the value of \\( y \\), it is easy to see how \\( x \\) may be found, from either of the given equations; but it may also be found in the same manner as we found \\( y \\).\n\nFor let the first of the given equations be multiplied by 2, and the second by 3, and we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4x + 6y &= 46 \\\\\n15x - 6y &= 30\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBy adding these equations, we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n19x &= 76 \\\\\nx &= 4\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand therefore \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n128. The following examples will serve farther to illustrate these different methods of exterminating the unknown quantities from equations.\n\nEx. 1. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} &= 16 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{5} - \\frac{y}{9} &= 2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nRequired \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nBy Method 1.\n\nFrom the first equation we find \\( x = 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\)\n\nAnd from the second \\( x = 10 + \\frac{5y}{9} \\)\n\nTherefore \\( 10 + \\frac{5y}{9} = 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\)\n\nOr \\( 90 + 5y = 288 - 6y \\)\n\nHence \\( 11y = 198 \\)\n\nAnd \\( y = 18 \\)\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) being substituted in either of the values of \\( x \\), namely, \\( 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\) or \\( 10 + \\frac{5y}{9} \\) we find \\( x = 20 \\).\n\nBy Method 2.\n\nHaving found from the first given equation \\( x = 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\), let this value of \\( x \\) be substituted in the second, thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{5} \\left( 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\right) - \\frac{y}{9} &= 2 \\\\\n\\frac{32}{5} - \\frac{2y}{15} - \\frac{y}{9} &= 2 \\\\\n\\frac{198}{15} - \\frac{11y}{9} &= 2 \\\\\n18 &= y\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe value of \\( y \\) being now substituted in either of the given equations, we thence find \\( x = 20 \\) as before.\n\nBy Method 3.\n\nThe denominators of the two given equations being taken away by rule 3. of last section, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3x + 2y &= 96 \\\\\n9x - 5y &= 90\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom three times the first of these equations, or \\( 9x + 6y = 288 \\), let the second be subtracted, and there remains\n\n\\[\n11y = 198\n\\]\n\nAnd hence \\( y = 18 \\)\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) being now substituted in either of the equations \\( 3x + 2y = 96 \\), \\( 9x - 5y = 90 \\), we readily find \\( x = 20 \\).\n\n129. Having now shewn in what manner the different methods of exterminating the unknown quantities may be applied, we shall, in the remaining examples of this section, chiefly make use of the last method, because it is the most easy and expeditious in practice.\n\nEx. 2. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} - 12 &= \\frac{y}{4} + 8 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{y}{3} - 8 &= \\frac{2y}{4} + 27\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt is required to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the first equation we have \\( 4x - 96 = 2y + 64 \\).\nAnd from the second, \\( 12x + 12y + 20x - 48c = 3c9 \\)\n\\(-15x + 1620\\).\n\nThese two equations when abridged become\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4x - 2y &= 160 \\\\\n47x - 18y &= 2100\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\( y \\); from this last equation let 9 times the one preceding it be subtracted.\n\nThus we find \\( 11x = 660 \\)\nAnd \\( x = 60 \\)\nAnd because \\( 2y = 4x - 160 = 80 \\)\nTherefore \\( y = 40 \\).\n\nEx. 3. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nax + by &= c \\\\\ndx + fy &= g\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\( y \\), let the first equation be multiplied by \\( f \\) and the second by \\( b \\); and we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nafx + bfy &= cf \\\\\nbdx + bfy &= bg\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTaking now the difference between these equations we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nafx - bdx &= cf - bg \\\\\n(cf - bg) &= af - bd\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd therefore \\( x = \\frac{cf - bg}{af - bd} \\).\n\nIn the same manner may \\( y \\) be determined, by multiplying the first of the given equations by \\( d \\), and the second by \\( a \\); for we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nadx + bdy &= cd \\\\\nadx + aby &= ag\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand taking the difference as before, we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nbdy - aby &= cd - ag \\\\\ncd - ag &= bd - af\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd therefore \\( y = \\frac{bd - af}{cd - ag} \\).\n\nThis last example may be considered as a general solution of the following problem. Two equations expressing the relation between the first powers of two unknown quantities being given, to determine those quantities. For whatever be the number of terms in each equation, it will readily appear, as in example 2d, that by proper reduction, they may be brought to the same form as those given in the 3d example.\n\n130. Let us next consider such equations as involve three unknown quantities.\n\nEx. 4. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 29 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 62 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n\nWe shall in this example proceed according to the rules of the first method for exterminating the unknown quantities.\n\nFrom the first equation \\( x = 29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\)\nFrom the second \\( x = 62 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\)\nFrom the third \\( x = 20 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\).\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\) be put equal to each other, thus we get the two following equations.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} &= 62 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\\\\n29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} &= 20 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAgain, from these two equations, by transposition, &c., we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= 33 - \\frac{3z}{2} \\\\\ny &= 27 - \\frac{3z}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( 33 - \\frac{3z}{2} = 27 - \\frac{3z}{2} \\)\n\nAnd hence, by reduction \\( z = 12 \\)\nWhence also \\( y = 33 - \\frac{3z}{2} = 9 \\)\nAnd \\( x = 29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} = 8 \\).\n\nEx. 5. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 62 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{4} + \\frac{z}{5} &= 47 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{y}{5} + \\frac{z}{6} &= 38\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n\nHere the given equations, when cleared from fractions, become\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n12x + 8y + 6z &= 1488 \\\\\n20x + 15y + 12z &= 2820 \\\\\n30x + 24y + 20z &= 4560\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\( z \\) by the third method, let the first equation be multiplied by 10, the second by 5, and the third by 3; the results will be these:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n120x + 80y + 60z &= 14880 \\\\\n100x + 75y + 60z &= 14100 \\\\\n90x + 72y + 60z &= 13680\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nLet the second equation be now subtracted from the first, and the third from the second, and we have\n\n\\[2ax + 5y = 780\\]\n\\[10x + 3y = 420\\]\n\nNext to exterminate \\(y\\), let the first of these equations be multiplied by 3, and the second by 5, hence\n\n\\[60x + 15y = 2340\\]\n\\[50x + 15y = 2100\\]\n\nSubtracting now the latter equation from the former.\n\n\\[10x = 240\\]\n\nHence \\(x = 24\\)\n\nTherefore \\(y = \\frac{420 - 10x}{3} = 60\\)\n\nAnd \\(z = \\frac{1448 - 12x - 8y}{6} = 120\\).\n\n131. From the preceding examples, it is manifest in what manner any number of unknown quantities may be determined, by an equal number of equations, which contain only the first power of those quantities, in the numerators of the terms. Such are the following:\n\n\\[ax + by + cz = n\\]\n\\[dx + ey + fz = p\\]\n\\[gx + hy + kz = q\\]\n\nwhere \\(a, b, c, \\&c.\\) represent known, and \\(x, y, z\\) unknown quantities; and in every case of this kind, the unknown quantities may be directly found, for they will be always expressed by whole numbers, or rational fractions, provided that the known quantities \\(a, b, c, \\&c.\\) are also rational.\n\n132. We shall now add a few examples, in which the equations that result from the extermination of an unknown quantity arise to some of the higher degrees; and therefore their final solution must be referred to the sections which treat of those degrees.\n\nEx. 6. Let \\(x = y = 2\\), and \\(xy + 5x - 6y = 120\\); it is required to exterminate \\(x\\).\n\nFrom the first equation \\(x = y + 2\\); which value being substituted in the other equation according to the second general method (\u00a7126) it becomes\n\n\\[(y + 2)y + 5(y + 2) - 6y = 120\\]\n\nthat is, \\(y^2 + 2y + 5y + 10 - 6y = 120\\)\n\ntherefore the equation required is \\(y^2 + y = 110\\).\n\nEx. 7. There is given \\(x + y = a\\), and \\(x^2 + y^2 = b\\) to exterminate \\(x\\).\n\n- From the first equation \\(x = a - y\\), and \\(x^2 = (a - y)^2\\).\n- And from the second \\(x^2 = b - y^2\\).\n\nTherefore \\((a - y)^2 = b - y^2\\)\n\nThat is \\(a^2 - 2ay + y^2 = b - y^2\\)\n\nHence \\(2y^2 - 2ay = b - a^2\\); an equation involving only \\(y\\).\n\nEx. 8. Given \\(\\begin{cases} ax + bx + cy = d \\\\ fxy + gx + hy = k \\end{cases}\\) To exterminate \\(y\\).\n\nFrom the first equation we find \\(y = \\frac{d - bx}{ax + c}\\).\n\nAnd from the second \\(y = \\frac{k - gx}{fx + b}\\)\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{d - bx}{ax + c} = \\frac{k - gx}{fx + b}\\), an equation in which the unknown quantity \\(y\\) is not found.\n\nEx. 9. Given \\(\\begin{cases} y^2 - 3xy + ay = x^2 \\\\ y^2 + 2ax - by = 4x^2 - b^2 \\end{cases}\\) To exterminate \\(y\\).\n\nAs the coefficient of \\(y^2\\) is unity in both equations, if their difference be taken the highest power of \\(y\\) will vanish; but to give a general solution, let the terms of the equations be brought all to one side and made equal to 0, thus,\n\n\\[y^2 - (3x + a)y - x^2 = 0\\]\n\\[y^2 - by + 2ax - 4x^2 + b^2 = 0\\]\n\nLet us in the first equation put \\(i = A, -(3x + a) = B, -x^2 = C\\); and in the second, \\(i = D, -b = E, 2ax - 4x^2 + b^2 = F\\) and the two equations become\n\n\\[Ay^2 + By + C = 0\\]\n\\[Dy^2 + Ey + F = 0\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\(y^2\\), let the first equation be multiplied by \\(D\\), and the second by \\(A\\), and we have\n\n\\[ADy^2 + BDy + CD = 0\\]\n\\[ADy^2 + AFy + AF = 0\\]\n\nTherefore, taking the difference of these equations,\n\n\\[(BD - AE)y + CD - AF = 0\\]\n\nAnd \\(y = \\frac{AF - CD}{BD - AE}\\)\n\nAgain, to find another value of \\(y\\), multiply the first equation by \\(F\\), and the second by \\(C\\), then\n\n\\[AFy^2 + BFy + CF = 0\\]\n\\[CDy^2 + CY + CF = 0\\]\n\nTherefore, subtracting as before, we get\n\n\\[(AF - CD)y + (BF - CE)y = 0\\]\n\nAnd dividing by \\(y\\) \\((AF - CD)y + BF - CE = 0\\),\n\nTherefore, \\(y = \\frac{CE - BF}{AF - CD}\\).\n\nLet this value of \\(y\\) be put equal to the former value, thus we have \\(\\frac{AF - CD}{BD - AE} = \\frac{CE - BF}{AF - CD}\\),\n\nAnd therefore \\((AF - CD)^2 = (BD - AE)(CE - BF)\\).\n\nNow as \\(y\\) does not enter this equation, if we restore the values of \\(A, B, C, \\&c.\\) we have the following equation which involves only \\(x\\), and known quantities.\n\n\\[(b^2 + 2ax - 3x^2)^2 = (a + b - 3x)(bx^2 - (a - 3x)(2ax - 4x^2 + b^2))\\] this equation when properly reduced will be of the fourth order, and therefore its final resolution belongs not to this place.\n\nSect. VIII. Questions producing Simple Equations.\n\n133. When a problem is proposed to be resolved by the algebraic method of analysis, its true meaning ought in the first place to be perfectly understood, so that, if necessary, it may be freed from all superfluous and ambiguous expressions; and its conditions exhibited in the clearest point of view possible. The several quantities concerned in the problem are next to be denoted by proper symbols, and their relations to one another expressed agreeably to the algebraic notation.\n\nThus\nThus we shall obtain a series of equations, which, if the question be properly limited, will enable us to determine all the unknown quantities required by the rules already delivered in the two preceding sections.\n\n134. In reducing the conditions of a problem to equations, the following rule will be of service. Suppose that the quantities to be determined are actually found, and then consider by what operations the truth of the solution may be verified; then, let the same operations be performed upon the quantities, whether known or unknown, and thus all the conditions of the problem will be reduced to a series of equations, such as is required. For example; suppose that it is required to find two numbers, such, that their sum is 20, and the quotient arising from the division of their difference by the lesser 3; then if we denote the greater of the two numbers by \\( x \\), and the lesser by \\( y \\), and proceed as if to prove the truth of the solution, we shall have \\( x+y=20 \\) for the sum of the numbers, and \\( x-y=3 \\) for their difference. Now as the former must be equal to 20, and the latter divided by \\( y \\) equal to 3; the first condition of the problem will be expressed by this equation \\( x+y=20 \\), and the second by \\( \\frac{x-y}{y}=3 \\), and from these, the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may easily be found.\n\n135. When the conditions of a problem have been expressed by equations, or as it were translated from the common language into that of algebra; we must next consider, whether the problem be properly limited; for in some cases, the conditions may be such as to admit of innumerable solutions; and in others, they may involve an absurdity; and thus render the problem altogether impossible.\n\n136. Now by considering the examples of last section, it will readily appear, that to determine any number of unknown quantities, there must be given as many equations, as there are unknown quantities. These equations, however, must be such as cannot be derived from each other; and they must not involve any contradiction; for, in the one case, the problem would admit of an unlimited number of answers; and in the other case, it would be impossible. For example, if it were required to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from these two equations, \\( 2x-3y=13 \\), \\( 4x-6y=26 \\); as the latter equation is a consequence of the former (for each term of the one is the half of the corresponding term of the other) it is evident, that innumerable values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) might be found to satisfy both equations. Again, if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) were to be determined from these equations, \\( x+2y=8 \\), \\( 3x+6y=26 \\), it will quickly appear, that it is impossible to find such values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), as will satisfy both equations; for from the first of them, we find \\( 3x=24-6y \\); and from the second, \\( 3x=26-6y \\); and therefore \\( 24-6y=26-6y \\), or \\( 24=26 \\), which is absurd; and so also must have been the conditions from which this conclusion is drawn.\n\n137. But there is yet another case in which a problem may be impossible; and that is, when there are more equations than unknown quantities; for it appears, that in this case, by the rules of last section, we would at least find two equations, each involving the same unknown quantity. Now unless these equations happened to agree, the problem would admit of no solution. Upon the whole, therefore, it appears, that a problem is limited, when the conditions afford just as many independent equations, as there are unknown quantities to be determined; if there be fewer equations the problem is indeterminate; but if there be more, the problem in general admits of no solution whatever.\n\n138. In expressing the conditions of a problem by equations, it will, in general, be convenient to introduce as few symbols of unknown quantities as possible. Therefore, if two quantities be sought and their sum be given, suppose it \\( =s \\), then if the one quantity be represented by \\( x \\), the other may be denoted by \\( s-x \\). If again their difference be given \\( =d \\), the quantities may be denoted by \\( x \\) and \\( d+x \\), or by \\( x \\) and \\( x-d \\). If their product be given \\( =p \\), the quantities are \\( x \\) and \\( \\frac{p}{x} \\); and so on.\n\n139. We shall now apply the preceding observations to some examples, which are so chosen as to admit of being resolved by simple equations.\n\nEx. 1. What is that number, to which if there be added its half, its third, and its fourth part, the sum will be 50.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the number sought. Then its half will be \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\), its third \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) and its fourth \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{x}{4}=50 \\).\n\nHence we find \\( 24x+12x+8x+6x=1200 \\)\n\nOr \\( 50x=1200 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x=24 \\).\n\nThus it appears, that the number sought is 24, which upon trial will be found to answer the conditions of the question.\n\nEx. 2. A post is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of its length in the mud, \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) in the water, and 10 feet above the water, what is its whole length?\n\nLet its length be \\( x \\) feet, then the part in the mud is \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), and that in the water \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\); therefore, from the nature of the question\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{x}{3} + 10 = x. \\]\n\nFrom which equation we find \\( 7x+120=12x \\), and \\( x=24 \\).\n\nEx. 3. Two travellers set out at the same time from London and York, whose distance is 150 miles; one of them goes 8 miles a day, and the other 7; in what time will they meet?\n\nSuppose that they meet after \\( x \\) days.\n\nThen the one traveller has gone \\( 8x \\) miles, and the other \\( 7x \\) miles; now the sum of the distances they travel is, by the question, equal to the distance from London to York.\n\nTherefore \\( 8x+7x=150 \\)\n\nThat is \\( 15x=150 \\), and \\( x=10 \\) days.\n\nEx. 4. A labourer engaged to serve for 40 days, upon these conditions; that for every day he worked he was to receive 20d. but for every day he played, or was absent, he was to forfeit 8d.; now at the end\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of days he worked.\n\nThen will \\( 40 - x \\) be the number of days he was idle.\n\nAlso \\( 20x = 20x \\) is the sum he earned, in pence.\n\nAnd \\( 8(40-x) = 320 - 8x \\) is the sum he forfeited.\n\nNow the difference of these two was \\( 11.11s. 8d. \\) or \\( 380d. \\)\n\nTherefore \\( 20x - (320 - 8x) = 380 \\)\n\nThat is \\( 28x = 700 \\)\n\nHence \\( x = 25 \\) is the number of days he worked.\n\nAnd \\( 40 - x = 15 \\) is the number of days he was idle.\n\nEx. 5. A market woman bought a certain number of eggs at 2 a-penny, and as many at 3 a-penny; and sold them all out again at 5 for 2d.; but instead of getting her own money for them, as she expected, she lost 4d.: what number of eggs did she buy?\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of eggs of each sort.\n\nThen will \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) be the price of the first sort,\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) be the price of the second sort.\n\nNow the whole number being \\( 2x \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2x} : \\frac{2}{4x} = \\text{price of both sorts at } 5 \\text{ for } 2d.\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{4x}{5} = 4 \\), by the question.\n\nHence \\( 15x + 10x - 24x = 120 \\),\n\nAnd \\( x = 120 \\), the number of each sort.\n\nEx. 6. A bill of 120l. was paid in guineas and moidores; the number of pieces of both sorts that were used was 120; how many were there of each?\n\nLet the number of guineas be \\( x \\).\n\nThen the number of moidores will be \\( 100 - x \\).\n\nAlso the value of the guineas, reckoned in shillings, will be \\( 21x \\); and that of the moidores \\( 27(100-x) = 2700 - 27x \\).\n\nTherefore, by the question, \\( 21x + 2700 - 27x = 2400 \\).\n\nHence we find \\( 6x = 300 \\) and \\( x = 50 \\).\n\nSo that the number of pieces of each sort was 50.\n\nEx. 7. A footman agreed to serve his master for 3l. a-year, and livery; but was turned away at the end of 7 months, and received only 2l. 13s. 4d. and his livery; what was its value?\n\nSuppose \\( x \\) the value of the livery, in pence.\n\nThen his wages for a year were to be \\( x + 1920 \\) pence.\n\nBut for 7 months he received \\( x + 640 \\) pence.\n\nNow he was paid in proportion to the time he served.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{m} \\quad \\frac{m}{m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( 12 : 7 : : x + 1920 : x + 640 \\)\n\nAnd taking the product of the extremes, and means.\n\n\\[\n12x + 7680 = 7x + 13440.\n\\]\n\nHence \\( 5x = 5760d. \\) and \\( x = 1152d. = 4l. 16s. \\)\n\nEx. 8. A person at play lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his money, and then won 3 shillings; after which he lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of what he then had; and then won 2 shillings; lastly, he lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of what he then had; and this done, found he had only 12 shillings left; what had he at first?\n\nSuppose he began play with \\( x \\) shillings.\n\nHe lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his money, or \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), and had left \\( x - \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{3x}{4} \\).\n\nHe won 3s. and had then \\( \\frac{3x}{4} + 3 = \\frac{3x + 12}{4} \\).\n\nHe lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{3x + 12}{4} \\), or \\( \\frac{x + 4}{4} \\), and had left \\( \\frac{3x + 12}{4} - \\frac{x + 4}{4} = \\frac{2x + 8}{4} \\).\n\nHe won 2s. and had then \\( \\frac{2x + 8}{4} + 2 = \\frac{2x + 16}{4} \\).\n\nHe lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{2x + 16}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{2x + 16}{28} \\), and had left \\( \\frac{2x + 16}{4} - \\frac{2x + 16}{28} = \\frac{12x + 96}{28} \\).\n\nAnd because he had now 12s. left, we have this equation \\( \\frac{12x + 96}{28} = 12 \\).\n\nHence \\( 12x = 240 \\) and \\( x = 20 \\).\n\nEx. 9. Two tradesmen A and B are employed upon a piece of work, A can perform it alone in 15 hours, and B in 10 hours; in what time will they do it when working together.\n\nSuppose that they can do it in \\( x \\) hours, and let the whole work be denoted by 1.\n\nThen \\( \\frac{b}{a} : \\frac{b}{b} : : 1 : \\frac{x}{15} \\) is the part of the work done by A.\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{b}{a} : \\frac{b}{b} : : 1 : \\frac{x}{10} \\) is the part done by B.\n\nNow by the question, they are to perform the whole work between them;\n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{x}{15} + \\frac{x}{10} = 1 \\),\n\nHence \\( 25x = 150 \\) and \\( x = 6 \\) hours.\n\nEx. 10. The sum of any two quantities being given \\( = s \\), and their difference \\( = d \\), it is required to find each of the quantities.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the greater of the two quantities, and \\( y \\) the lesser.\n\nThen \\( x + y = s \\), and \\( x - y = d \\).\n\nTaking the sum of the equations we get \\( 2x = s + d \\).\n\nAnd subtracting the second from the first, \\( 2y = s - d \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x = \\frac{s + d}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{s - d}{2} \\).\n\nEx. 11. A gentleman distributing money among some poor people, found he wanted 10s. to be able to give each 5s. therefore he gave only 4s. to each, and had 5s. left. Required the number of shillings and poor people.\n\nLet the number of shillings be \\( x \\), and that of the poor people \\( y \\), then from the nature of the question we have these two equations.\n\n\\[\n5y = x + 10 \\quad 4y = x - 5\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( x = 5y - 10 \\),\n\nAnd from the second, \\( x = 4y + 5 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( 5y - 10 = 4y + 5 \\),\n\nHence \\( y = 15 \\), and \\( x = 4y + 5 = 65 \\).\nEx. 12. A farmer kept a servant for every 40 acres of ground he rented, and on taking a lease of 104 more acres, he engaged 5 additional servants, after which he had a servant for every 36 acres. Required the number of servants and acres.\n\nSuppose that he had at first $x$ servants, and $y$ acres.\n\nFrom the first condition of the question $x = \\frac{y}{40}$\n\nAnd from the second $x + 5 = \\frac{y + 104}{36}$\n\nBy comparing the values of $x$, as found from these equations, we have $\\frac{y + 104}{36} - 5 = \\frac{y}{40}$.\n\nHence $40(y + 104) - 7200 = 36y$, so that $4y = 3240$.\n\nTherefore $y = 760$, and $x = \\frac{y}{40} = 19$.\n\nEx. 13. Two persons, A and B, were talking of their ages; says A to B, seven years ago I was just three times as old as you were then, and seven years hence I shall be just twice as old as you will be. What is their present ages?\n\nLet the ages of A and B be $x$ and $y$ respectively. Their ages seven years ago were $x - 7$ and $y - 7$, and seven years hence they will be $x + 7$ and $y + 7$.\n\nTherefore by the question $x - 7 = 3(y - 7)$ and $x + 7 = 2(y + 7)$.\n\nFrom the first equation, $x = 3y - 14$,\n\nAnd from the second $x = 2y + 7$.\n\nTherefore $3y - 14 = 2y + 7$, hence $y = 21$.\n\nAnd because $x = 2y + 7$, therefore $x = 49$.\n\nEx. 14. A hare is 50 leaps before a greyhound, and takes 4 leaps to the greyhound's 3, but 2 of the greyhound's leaps are as much as 3 of the hare's. How many leaps must the greyhound take to catch the hare?\n\nIn this example there is only one quantity required, it will, however, be convenient to make use of two letters; therefore let $x$ denote the number of leaps of the greyhound, and $y$ those of the hare; then, by considering the proportion between the number of leaps each takes in the same time, we have\n\n$3 : 4 :: x : y$, hence $3y = 4x$.\n\nAgain, by considering the proportion between the number of leaps each must take to run the same distance, we find $x : 50 + y :: 2 : 3$, hence $100 + 2y = 3x$.\n\nFrom the first equation we find $6y = 8x$,\n\nAnd from the second $6y = 9x - 300$,\n\nHence $9x - 300 = 8x$, and $x = 300$.\n\nEx. 15. To divide the number 90 into 4 such parts, that if the first be increased by 2, the second diminished by 2, the third multiplied by 2, and the fourth divided by 2; the sum, difference, product, and quotient, shall be all equal to each other.\n\nIn this question there are four quantities to be determined; but instead of introducing several letters, having put $x$ to denote the first of them, we may find an expression for each of the remaining ones, as follows:\n\nBecause $x + 2 =$ second quantity \u2014 2,\n\nTherefore $x + 4 =$ the second quantity.\n\nAnd because $x + 2 =$ third $\\times 2$,\n\nTherefore $\\frac{x + 2}{2} =$ the third quantity.\n\nAnd in like manner $2(x + 2) =$ the fourth quantity,\n\nNow by the question, the sum of all the four = 90,\n\nTherefore $x + x + 4 + \\frac{x + 2}{2} + 2(x + 2) = 90$;\n\nHence $9x = 162$, and $x = 18$.\n\nTherefore the numbers required are 18, 22, 10, and 43.\n\nEx. 16. A and B together can perform a piece of work in 12 hours, A and C in 20, and B and C in 15 hours; in what time will each be able to perform it when working separately?\n\nThat we may give a general solution, let us suppose A and B can perform the work in $a$ hours, A and C in $b$ hours, and B and C in $c$ hours. Let $x$, $y$, and $z$, denote the times in which A, B, and C, could perform it respectively, if each wrought alone; and let the whole work be represented by 1.\n\nHH\n\nThen $x : a :: \\frac{a}{x} =$ the part done by A in $a$ hours.\n\n$y : a :: \\frac{a}{y} =$ the part done by B in $b$ hours.\n\nAlso $x : b :: \\frac{b}{x} =$ the part done by A in $b$ hours.\n\n$z : b :: \\frac{b}{z} =$ the part done by C in $c$ hours.\n\nAnd $y : c :: \\frac{c}{y} =$ the part done by B in $c$ hours.\n\n$z : c :: \\frac{c}{z} =$ the part done by C in $c$ hours.\n\nNow by the question we have the three following equations.\n\n$\\frac{a}{x} + \\frac{a}{y} + \\frac{b}{x} + \\frac{b}{y} + \\frac{c}{x} + \\frac{c}{y} = 1$.\n\nLet the first equation be divided by $a$, the second by $b$, and the third by $c$, thus we have\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}$.\n\nIf these be added together, and their sum divided by 2, we find\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c}$.\n\nFrom this equation let each of the three last be subtracted in its turn; thus we get\n\n$\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c} = \\frac{ab + ac + bc}{2abc}$\n\n$\\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c} = \\frac{abc - ac + bc}{2abc}$\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c} = \\frac{abc - ab + ac}{2abc}$\n\nHence $z = \\frac{2abc}{ab + ac + bc} = \\frac{7200}{120} = 60$\n\n$y = \\frac{2abc}{ab - ac + bc} = \\frac{7200}{360} = 20$\n\n$x = \\frac{2abc}{ab + ac + bc} = \\frac{7200}{240} = 30$.\nSect. IX. Of Quadratic Equations.\n\n140. We are next to explain the manner of resolving equations of the second degree, or quadratic equations. These involve the second power of the unknown quantity, as has been already observed (\u00a7 113.) and may be divided into two kinds, pure and affected.\n\n141. I. Pure quadratic equations are such as after proper reduction have the square of the unknown quantity in one term, while the remaining terms contain only known quantities. Thus, \\(x^2 = 64\\), and \\(ax^2 + bx = c\\) are examples of pure quadratics.\n\n142. II. Affected quadratic equations, contain the square of the unknown quantity in one term, and its first or simple power in another, and the remaining terms consist entirely of known quantities. Such are the following, \\(x^2 + 3x = 28\\), \\(2x^2 - 33 - 5x\\), \\(ax^2 + bx = c = d\\).\n\n143. The manner of resolving a pure quadratic equation is sufficiently evident; if the unknown quantity be made to stand alone on one side, with unity as a coefficient, while the other side consists entirely of known quantities, and if the square root of each side be taken, we shall immediately obtain the value of the simple power of the unknown quantity as already directed by Rule 5th of Sect. VI.\n\n144. In extracting the square root of any quantity, however, it is necessary to observe, that the sign of the root may be either \\(+\\) or \\(-\\). This is an evident consequence of the rule for the signs in multiplication; for since by that rule any quantity, whether positive or negative, if multiplied by itself, will produce a positive quantity, and therefore the square of \\(+\\) \\(a\\), as well as that of \\(-\\) \\(a\\) is \\(+\\) \\(a^2\\); so on the contrary, the square root of \\(+\\) \\(a^2\\) is to be considered either as \\(+\\) \\(a\\) or as \\(-\\) \\(a\\), and may accordingly be expressed thus \\(=\\pm a\\).\n\n145. Having remarked that the square of any quantity whatever be its sign, is always positive; it evidently follows, that no real quantity whatever, when multiplied by itself, can produce a negative quantity; and therefore, if the square root of a negative quantity be required, no such root can be assigned. Hence it also follows, that if a problem requires for its solution the extraction of the square root of a negative quantity, some contradiction must necessarily be involved, either in the conditions of the problem, or in the process of reasoning by which that solution has been obtained.\n\n146. When an affected quadratic equation is to be resolved, it may always, by proper reduction, be brought to one or other of the three following forms.\n\n1. \\(x^2 + px = q\\)\n2. \\(x^2 - px = q\\)\n3. \\(x^2 - px = -q\\)\n\nBut as the manner of resolving each of the three forms is the very same, it will be sufficient if we consider any one of them.\n\n147. Resuming therefore the first equation, or \\(x^2 + px = q\\); let us compare the side of it which involves the unknown quantity \\(x\\) with the square of a binomial \\(x + a\\); that is, let us compare \\(x^2 + px\\) with \\(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^2\\); and it will presently appear, that if we suppose \\(p = 2a\\), or \\(\\frac{p}{2} = a\\), the quantities \\(x^2 + px\\) and \\(x^2 + 2ax\\) will be equal; and as \\(x^2 + 2ax\\) is rendered a complete square, by adding to it \\(a^2\\), so also may \\(x^2 + px\\) be completed into a square, by adding to it \\(\\frac{p^2}{4}\\), which is equal to \\(a^2\\); therefore, let \\(\\frac{p^2}{4}\\) be added to both sides of the equation \\(x^2 + px = q\\), and we have\n\n\\[x^2 + px + \\frac{p^2}{4} = \\frac{p^2}{4} + q,\\]\n\nor \\((x + \\frac{p}{2})^2 = \\frac{p^2}{4} + q\\);\n\nand extracting the square root of each side, \\(x + \\frac{p}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{4} + q}\\); hence \\(x = \\frac{-p}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{4} + q}\\).\n\n148. From these observations, we derive the following general rule for resolving affected quadratic equations.\n\n1. Transpose all the terms involving the unknown quantity to one side, and the known quantities to the other side, and so that the term involving the square of the unknown quantity may be positive.\n\n2. If the square of the unknown quantity be multiplied by a coefficient, let all the other terms be divided by it, so that the coefficient of the square of the unknown quantity may be 1.\n\n3. Add to both sides the square of half the coefficient of the unknown quantity itself, and the side of the equation involving the unknown quantity will now be a complete square.\n\n4. Extract the square root of both sides of the equation, by which it becomes simple with respect to the unknown quantity; and, by transposition, that quantity may be made to stand alone on one side of the equation, while the other side consists of known quantities; and therefore the equation is resolved.\n\nNote. The square root of the first side of the equation is always equal to the sum, or difference of the unknown quantity, and half the coefficient of the second term. If the sign of that term be \\(+\\), it is equal to the sum, but if it be \\(-\\), then it is equal to the difference.\n\nEx. 1. Given \\(x^2 + 2x = 35\\), to determine \\(x\\).\n\nHere the coefficient of the second term is 2, therefore, adding the square of its half to each side, we have\n\n\\[x^2 + 2x + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36\\]\n\nAnd extracting the square root \\(x + 1 = \\sqrt{36} = \\pm 6\\)\n\nHence \\(x = \\pm 6 - 1\\), that is \\(x = \\pm 5\\), or \\(x = \\pm 7\\), and either of these numbers will be found to satisfy the equation for \\(5 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 5 = 35\\), also \\(-7 \\times -7 + 2 \\times -7 = 35\\).\n\nEx. 2. Given \\(\\frac{x^2}{6} - 12 = x\\) to find \\(x\\).\n\nThis equation, when reduced, becomes \\(x^2 - 6x = 72\\). And by completing the square, \\(x^2 - 6x + 9 = 72 + 9 = 81\\).\n\nHence, by extracting the square root, \\(x - 3 = \\pm 9\\).\n\nAnd \\(x = \\pm 9 + 3\\), therefore \\(x = \\pm 12\\), or \\(x = \\pm 6\\), and upon trial we find that each of these values satisfies\nQuadratic Equations.\n\nSolve the original equation, for \\( \\frac{12 \\times 12}{6} - 12 = 12 \\), also\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6x - 6}{6} - 12 = -6.\n\\]\n\nEx. 3. Given \\( x^2 + 28 = 11x \\), to find \\( x \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 - 11x = -28 \\).\n\nAnd, completing the square, \\( x^2 - 11x + \\frac{121}{4} = \\frac{121}{4} \\)\n\n\\[-28 = \\frac{9}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, by extracting the root, \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nHence \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), that is \\( x = +7 \\), or \\( x = +4 \\).\n\nIn the first two examples, we found one positive value for \\( x \\) in each, and also one negative value, but in this example both the values of \\( x \\) are positive, and upon trial each of them is found to satisfy the equation; for \\( 7 \\times 7 + 28 = 11 \\times 7 \\), also \\( 4 \\times 4 + 28 = 11 \\times 4 \\).\n\nAs at first sight it appears remarkable, that in every quadratic equation the unknown quantity admits always of two distinct values, or roots, it will be proper to consider a little farther the circumstances upon which this peculiarity depends. This is the more necessary, as the property of the unknown quantity admitting of several values is not peculiar to quadratics, but takes place also in equations of the higher degrees, where the cause of the ambiguity requires an explanation somewhat different from that which we have already given in the present case.\n\nLet us again consider the equation \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0 \\), which forms the first of the three preceding examples; by transposing all the terms to one side, the same equation may be also expressed thus, \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0 \\); so that we shall have determined \\( x \\), when we have found such a number, as when substituted for it in the quantity \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 \\) will render the result equal to 0.\n\nBut \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 \\) is the product of these two factors \\( x - 5 \\) and \\( x + 7 \\), as may be proved by actual multiplication; therefore to find \\( x \\) we have \\( (x - 5)(x + 7) = 0 \\); and as a product can only be reduced to 0, when one of its factors is reduced to 0, it follows, that either of the two factors \\( x - 5 \\) or \\( x + 7 \\) may be assumed = 0; if \\( x - 5 = 0 \\), then \\( x = 5 \\); but if \\( x + 7 = 0 \\), then \\( x = -7 \\), so that the two values of \\( x \\), or two roots of the equation \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0 \\) are \\( +5 \\) and \\( -7 \\), as we have already found in a different manner.\n\nWhat has been just now shown in a particular case is true of any quadratic equation whatever, that is, if \\( x^2 + px = q \\), or by bringing all the terms to one side, \\( x^2 + px - q = 0 \\), it is always possible to find two factors \\( x + a \\) and \\( x - b \\), such, that \\( x^2 + px - q = (x + a)(x - b) \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are known quantities which depend only upon \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) the given numbers in the equation, and hence that to have \\( (x - a)(x + b) = 0 \\), we may either assume \\( x - a = 0 \\), or \\( x + b = 0 \\), it evidently follows that the conditions of the equation \\( x^2 + px - q = 0 \\), or \\( x^2 + px = q \\) are alike satisfied by taking \\( x = +a \\) or \\( x = -b \\).\n\nFrom these considerations, it follows, that \\( x \\) can have only two values in a quadratic equation; for if it could be supposed to have three, or more values, then it would be possible to resolve \\( x^2 + px - q \\) into as many factors \\( x - a \\), \\( x - b \\), &c., but the product of more than two factors must necessarily contain the third or higher powers of \\( x \\); and as \\( x^2 + px - q \\) contains no higher power than the second, therefore no such resolution can take place.\n\nSince it appears that \\( x^2 + px - q \\) may be considered as the product of two factors \\( x - a \\), and \\( x + b \\), let us examine the nature of these factors; accordingly, taking their product by actual multiplication, we find it \\( x^2 + (b - a)x - ab \\); and since this quantity must be equal to \\( x^2 + px - q \\), it follows, that \\( b - a = p \\) and \\( ab = q \\), or, changing the signs of the terms of both equations, \\( a - b = -p \\), \\( ab = -q \\). Now if we consider that \\( +a \\) and \\( -b \\) are the roots of the equation \\( x^2 + px = q \\); it is evident that \\( a - b \\) is the sum of the roots, and \\( -ab \\) their product. So that from the equations \\( a - b = -p \\), and \\( -ab = q \\), we derive the following proposition relating to the roots of any quadratic equation. The sum of the roots of any quadratic equation \\( x^2 + px = q \\) is equal to \\( -p \\), that is to the coefficient of the second term, having its sign changed; and their product is equal to \\( -q \\), or to the latter side of the equation, having its sign also changed.\n\nThis proposition enables us to resolve several important questions concerning the roots of a quadratic equation, without actually resolving that equation. Thus we learn from it, that if \\( q \\), the term which does not involve the unknown quantity (called sometimes the absolute number) be positive, the equation has one of its roots positive, and the other negative; but if that term be negative, the roots are either both positive or both negative. It also follows, that in the former case the root which is denoted by the least number will have the same sign with the second term, and in the latter case, the common sign of the roots will be the contrary to that of the second term.\n\nFrom this property of the roots we may also derive a general solution to any quadratic equation \\( x^2 + px = q \\); for we have only to determine two quantities whose sum is \\( -p \\), and product \\( -q \\), and these quantities shall be the two values of \\( x \\), or the two roots of the equation.\n\nWithout considering the signs of the roots, let us call them \\( v \\) and \\( z \\), then\n\n\\[ v + z = -p \\quad \\text{and} \\quad vz = -q \\]\n\nFrom the square of each side of the first equation let four times the second be subtracted and we have\n\n\\[ v^2 - 2vz + z^2 = p^2 + 4q, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (v - z)^2 = p^2 + 4q, \\]\n\ntherefore, by extracting the square root, \\( v - z = \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q} \\); from this equation, and from the equation \\( v + z = -p \\), we readily obtain \\( v = \\frac{-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2} \\)\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-p \\mp \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{that is, if} \\quad v = \\frac{-p + \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{then} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-p - \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{and if} \\quad v = \\frac{-p - \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{then} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-p + \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}. \\]\n\nBut the value of \\( v \\), upon the one supposition, is the same as the value of \\( z \\) upon the other supposition, and vice versa, therefore in reality the only two distinct\nEx. 1. It is required to divide the number 10 into two such parts, that the sum of their squares may be 58.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the one number. Then, since their sum is 10, we have \\( 10 - x \\) for the other.\n\nAnd by the question \\( x^2 + (10-x)^2 = 58 \\)\n\nThat is \\( x^2 + 10x - 2x^2 + x^2 = 58 \\)\n\nOr \\( 2x^2 - 20x + 100 = 42 \\)\n\nHence \\( x^2 - 10x = 21 \\)\n\nAnd completing the square \\( x^2 - 10x + 25 = 25 - 21 = 4 \\)\n\nHence, by extracting the root, \\( x - 5 = \\pm \\sqrt{4} = \\pm 2 \\)\n\nAnd \\( x = 7 \\) or \\( x = 3 \\)\n\nIf we take the greatest value of \\( x \\), viz. 7, then the other number \\( 10 - x \\) will be 3; and if we take the least value of \\( x \\), viz. 3, then the other number is 7.\n\nThus it appears, that the greatest value of the one number corresponds to the least value of the other; and indeed this must necessarily be the case, seeing that both numbers are alike concerned in the question. Hence upon the whole, the only numbers that will answer the conditions of the question are 7 and 3.\n\nEx. 2. What two numbers are those whose product is 28; and such, that twice the greater, together with thrice the lesser is equal to 26.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the greatest and \\( y \\) the least number, then, from the nature of the question, we have these two equations\n\n\\[\nxy = 28, \\quad 2x + 3y = 26.\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation we have \\( y = \\frac{28}{x} \\).\n\nAnd from the second \\( y = \\frac{26 - 2x}{3} \\).\n\nHence, \\( \\frac{26 - 2x}{3} = \\frac{28}{x} \\).\n\nAnd, reducing, \\( 26x - 2x^2 = 84 \\)\n\nOr \\( 2x^2 - 26x = -84 \\)\n\nHence \\( x^2 - 13x = -42 \\)\n\nAnd comp. the eq. \\( x^2 - 13x + \\frac{169}{4} = \\frac{169}{4} - 42 = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nHence, by extracting the root \\( x - \\frac{13}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore \\( x = \\frac{13}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThat is \\( x = 7 \\), or \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nAnd since \\( y = \\frac{28}{x} \\), we have \\( y = 4 \\), or \\( y = \\frac{14}{3} \\).\n\nThus we have obtained two sets of numbers, which fulfil the conditions required, viz.\n\n\\( x = 7, y = 4 \\); Or \\( x = 6, y = \\frac{14}{3} \\).\n\nAnd besides these, there can be no other numbers.\n\nEx. 3. A company dining together at an inn, find their bill amount to 175 shillings; two of them were not allowed to pay, and the rest found, that their shares amounted to 10 shillings a man more than if they had all paid. How many were in company?\n\nSuppose their number to be \\( x \\).\n\nThen, if all had paid, the share of each would have been \\( \\frac{175}{x} \\).\nQuadratic Equations.\n\nBut, because only \\( x - 2 \\) paid, the share of each was\n\n\\[\n\\frac{175}{x-2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by the question,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{175}{x-2} = 10.\n\\]\n\nAnd by proper reduction \\( 175x - 175x + 350 = 10x^2 \\)\n\nThat is \\( 10x^2 - 20x = 350 \\)\n\nOr \\( x^2 - 2x = 35 \\)\n\nAnd comp. the sq. \\( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 36 \\)\n\nHence, by extracting the root, \\( x^2 + 1 = 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( x = 4 \\), or \\( x = -7 \\). But from the nature of the question, the negative root can be of no use; therefore \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nEx. 4. A merchant sold a piece of cloth for 24l. and gained as much per cent as the cloth cost him; what was the price of the cloth?\n\nSuppose that it cost \\( x \\) pounds,\n\nThen the gain was \\( 24 - x \\),\n\nAnd by the question \\( 100 : x :: x : 24 - x \\),\n\nTherefore, taking the product of the extremes and means,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2400 - 100x}{x} = x^2,\n\\]\n\nOr \\( x^2 + 100x = 2400 \\),\n\nAnd comp. the sq. \\( x^2 + 100x + 2500 = 4900 \\),\n\nHence, taking the root, \\( x + 50 = \\pm 70 \\),\n\nAnd \\( x = 20 \\) or \\( x = -120 \\).\n\nHere, as in the last question, the negative root cannot apply; therefore \\( x = 20 \\) pounds, the price required.\n\nEx. 5. A grazier bought as many sheep as cost him 60l. out of which he reserved 15, and sold the remainder for 54l. and gained 2s. each upon them. How many sheep did he buy, and what did each cost him?\n\nSuppose that he bought \\( x \\) sheep,\n\nThen each would cost him \\( \\frac{1200}{x} \\) shillings.\n\nTherefore, after reserving 15, he sold each of the remaining \\( x - 15 \\) for \\( \\frac{1200}{x} + 2 \\) shillings;\n\nHence, he would receive for them \\( (x - 15)(\\frac{1200}{x} + 2) \\) shillings. And, because 54l. = 1080 shillings, we have by the question\n\n\\[\n(x - 15)(\\frac{1200}{x} + 2) = 1080.\n\\]\n\nWhich by proper reduction becomes \\( x^2 + 45x = 9000 \\).\n\nOr, completing the square, \\( x^2 + 45x + \\frac{2025}{4} = \\frac{38025}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore, extracting the root, &c. \\( x = \\pm \\frac{195}{2} \\pm \\frac{45}{2} \\).\n\nAnd taking the positive root, \\( x = 75 \\), the number of sheep; and consequently \\( \\frac{1200}{75} = 16 \\) shillings the price of each.\n\nEx. 6. What number is that, which, when divided by the product of its two digits, the quotient is 3; and if 18 be added to it, the digits are inverted. Let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote the digits; then the number itself will be expressed by \\( 10x + y \\); and that number, in which the digits are inverted, by \\( 10y + x \\). Thus the conditions of the problem will be expressed by these two equations,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10x + y}{xy} = 3, \\quad 10x + y + 18 = 10y + x.\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation we have \\( y = \\frac{10x}{3x - 1} \\).\n\nAnd from the second \\( y = x + 2 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x + 2 = \\frac{10x}{3x - 1} \\).\n\nAnd \\( 3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 10x \\).\n\nHence \\( x^2 - \\frac{5}{3}x = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nAnd comp. sq. \\( x^2 - \\frac{5}{3}x + \\frac{25}{9} = \\frac{37}{9} \\).\n\nTherefore, taking the root \\( x = \\frac{5}{3} \\pm \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nSo that \\( x = 2 \\), or \\( x = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nHere it is evident that the negative root is useless; hence we have \\( y = x + 2 = 4 \\), and 24 for the number required.\n\nEx. 7. It is required to find two numbers whose product is 100; and the difference of their square roots 3.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the one number; then \\( \\frac{100}{x} \\) must denote the other.\n\nNow by the question \\( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{x}} - \\sqrt{x} = 3 \\).\n\nHence we have \\( 10 - x = 3 \\sqrt{x} = 3x^{1/2} \\).\n\nOr \\( x + 3x^{1/2} = 10 \\).\n\nAnd comp. the sq. \\( x + 3x^{1/2} + \\frac{9}{4} = 10 + \\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\nand taking the root \\( x^{1/2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{17}{2} \\).\n\nSo that \\( x^{1/2} = 5 \\) or \\( x^{1/2} = -2 \\),\n\nand therefore \\( x = 25 \\) or \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nIf \\( x = 4 \\), the other number is \\( \\frac{100}{4} = 25 \\), and if \\( x = 25 \\), then the other number is 4; so that, in either case, the two numbers which answer the conditions of the question are 4 and 25.\n\nEx. 8. It is required to find two numbers, of which the product shall be 6, and the sum of their cubes 35.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the one number, then \\( \\frac{6}{x} \\) will be the other.\n\nTherefore, by the question, \\( x^2 + \\frac{216}{x^3} = 35 \\).\n\nHence \\( x^6 + 216 = 35x^3 \\).\n\nOr \\( x^6 - 35x^3 = -216 \\).\n\nThis equation, by putting \\( x^3 = y \\), becomes \\( y^2 - 35y = -216 \\).\n\nHence we find \\( y = 27 \\), or \\( y = 8 \\).\n\nAnd since \\( x^3 = y \\); therefore \\( x = 3 \\), or \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nIf \\( x = 3 \\), then the other number is 2, and if \\( x = 2 \\), the other number is 3; so that 2 and 3 are the numbers required.\n\nIn general, if it be required to find two numbers, which are exactly alike concerned in a question that produces a quadratic equation; the two numbers sought will be the roots of that equation. A similar observation applies to any number of quantities which require for the determination the resolution of an equation of any degree whatever.\n\nSect. X. Of Equations in General.\n\n160. Before we proceed to the resolution of cubic, and the higher orders of equations, it will be proper to\nEquations to explain some general properties, which belong to\nequations of every degree; and also certain operations,\nwhich must frequently be performed upon equations,\nbefore they are fitted for a final solution.\n\n161. In treating of equations in general, we shall\nsuppose all the terms transposed to one side, and put\nequal to 0; this we have already done in exploiting\nthe nature of quadratics, and in like manner an equa-\ntion of the fourth degree will stand thus:\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) denotes an unknown quantity, and \\( p, q, r, s \\)\nknown quantities, either positive or negative. In this\nequation the coefficient of the highest power of \\( x \\)\nis unity, but if it had been any other quantity, that\nquantity might have been taken away, and the equa-\ntion reduced to the above form, by rules already ex-\nplained, Sect. VI.\n\n162. The terms of an equation being thus arranged,\nif such a quantity be found, as when substituted for \\( x \\),\nwill render both sides \\( = 0 \\), and therefore satisfy the\nequation, that quantity whether it be positive or nega-\ntive, or even imaginary, is to be considered as a root\nof the equation. But we have seen that every qua-\ndratic equation has always two roots, real or imagi-\nnary, we may therefore suppose that a similar diversity\nof roots will take place in all equations of a higher de-\ngree; and this supposition we shall presently find to be\nwell founded, by means of the following proposition\nwhich is of great importance in the theory of equa-\ntions.\n\nIf a root of any equation, as \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\), be\nrepresented by \\( a \\), the first side of that equation is divi-\nsible by \\( x - a \\).\n\nFor since \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\)\n\nAnd also \\( a^4 + pa^3 + qa^2 + ra + s = 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, by subtraction, \\( x^4 - a^4 + p(x^3 - a^3) + q(x^2 - a^2) + r(x - a) = 0 \\).\n\n163. But any quantity of this form \\( x^n - a^n \\), where\n\\( n \\) denotes a whole positive number, is equal to\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x^{n-1}+ax^{n-2}+a^2x^{n-3}+\\ldots+a^{n-2}x+a^{n-1}),\n\\]\n\nas may be easily proved by multiplication; therefore,\nputting \\( x = a, b, c \\) successively, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 - a^4 &= (x-a)(x^3 + ax^2 + a^2x + a^3) \\\\\nx^3 - a^3 &= (x-a)(x^2 + ax + a^2) \\\\\nx^2 - a^2 &= (x-a)(x+a) \\\\\nx - a &= x-a\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand by substitution, and collecting into one term, the\ncoefficients of the like powers of \\( x \\), the equation\n\n\\[ x^4 - a^4 + p(x^3 - a^3) + q(x^2 - a^2) + r(x - a) = 0 \\]\n\nbecomes\n\n\\[\n(x-a)[x^3 + (a+p)x^2 + (a^2+pa+q)x + a^3 + pa + q] + r = 0,\n\\]\n\nso that putting \\( p' = a + p, q' = a^2 + pa + q, r' = a^3 + pa + q + r \\), we have\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-a)(x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r') \\]\n\nHence, if the proposed equation \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s \\)\nbe divided by \\( x - a \\), the quotient will be \\( x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r' \\),\nan integer quantity, and since the same mode\nof reasoning will apply to any equation whatever; the\ntruth of the proposition is evident.\n\n164. We have found that \\( (x-a)(x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r') = 0 \\),\nand as a product becomes \\( = 0 \\), when any\none of its factors \\( = 0 \\), therefore, the equation will have\nits conditions fulfilled, not only when \\( x = a = 0 \\), but\nalso when \\( x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r' = 0 \\).\n\nLet us now suppose that \\( b \\) is a root of this equation,\nthen by reasoning exactly as in last article, and putting\n\\( p'' = b + p', q'' = b^2 + pb + q' \\), we shall have\n\n\\[ x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r' = (x-b)(x^2 + p''x + q'') = 0 \\]\n\nand therefore\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-a)(x-b)(x^2 + p''x + q'') = 0 \\]\n\n165. By proceeding in the same manner with the\nquadratic equation \\( x^2 + p''x + q'' = 0 \\), we shall find that\nif \\( c \\) denote one of its roots, then\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-c)(x^2 + p''x + q'') \\]\n\nSo that if we put \\( d = (c + p'') \\), we at last find\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) \\]\n\nand since each of the factors \\( x-a, x-b, x-c, x-d \\)\nmay be assumed \\( = 0 \\); it follows, that there are four\ndifferent values of \\( x \\), which will render the equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nnamely, \\( x = a, x = b, x = c, x = d \\).\n\n166. The mode of reasoning which has been just\nnow employed in a particular case, may be applied to\nan equation of any order whatever; we may therefore\nconclude, that every equation may be considered as the\nproduct of as many simple factors, as the number de-\nnoting its order contains unity; and therefore, that\nthe number of roots in any equation is precisely equal\nto the exponent of the highest power of the unknown\nquantity contained in that equation.\n\n167. By considering equations of all degrees as\nformed from the product of factors \\( x-a, x-b, x-c, \\)\n&c., we discover a number of curious relations, which\nsubsist between the roots of any equation whatever,\nand its coefficients. Thus, if we limit the number of\nfactors to four, and suppose that \\( a, b, c, d \\), are the roots\nof this equation of the fourth degree\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwe shall also have \\( (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = 0 \\); and\ntherefore, by actual multiplication\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 - a^4 &+ ab &+ ac &- abc \\\\\n-x^3 &+ ad &+ bc &- abd \\\\\n-x^2 &+ bd &+ cd &- acd \\\\\n-x &+ cd &- bcd \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n168. If we compare together the coefficients of the\nsame powers of \\( x \\), we find the following series of equa-\ntions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c + d &- p \\\\\nab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd &- q \\\\\nabc + abd + acd + bcd &- r \\\\\nabcd &- s\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand as a similar series of equations will be obtained\nfor every equation whatever, we hence derive the fol-\nlowing propositions, which are of the greatest impor-\ntance in the theory of equations.\n\n1. The coefficient of the second term of any equa-\ntion taken with a contrary sign, is equal to the sum\nof all the roots.\n\n2. The coefficient of the third term is equal to the\nsum of the products of the roots multiplied together\ntwo and two.\n\n3. The coefficient of the fourth term, taken with a\ncontrary\nEquations contrary sign, is equal to the sum of the roots multiplied together three and three, and so on for the remaining coefficients, till we come to the last term of the equation, which is equal to the product of all the roots, having their signs changed.\n\n169. Instead of supposing an equation to be produced by multiplying together simple equations, we may consider it as formed by the product of equations of any degree, provided that the sum of their dimensions is equal to that of the proposed equation. Thus, an equation of the fourth degree may be formed either from a simple and cubic equation, or from two quadratic equations.\n\n170. If \\( n \\) denote the degree of an equation, we have shewn, that by considering it as the product of simple factors, that equation will have \\( n \\) divisors of the first degree; but if we suppose the simple factors to be combined two and two, they will form quantities of the second degree, which are also factors of the equation; and since there may be formed \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) such combinations, any equation will admit of \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) divisors of the second degree.\n\n171. For example, the equation \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\) which we have considered as equal to\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = 0\n\\]\n\nmay be formed by the product of two factors of the second degree, in these five different ways.\n\nBy the product of \\((x-a)(x-b)\\) and \\((x-c)(x-d)\\)\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x-c)(x-b)(x-d)\n\\]\n\nThus an equation of the fourth degree may have \\( \\frac{4 \\times 3}{1 \\times 2} = 6 \\) quadratic divisors.\n\n172. By combining the simple factors three and three, we shall have divisors of the third degree, of which the number for an equation of the \\( n \\)th order will be \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3} \\); and so on.\n\n173. When the roots of an equation are all positive, its simple factors will have this form \\( x-a, x-b, x-c, \\ldots \\), &c., and if for the sake of brevity we take only these three, the cubic equation which results from their product will have this form\n\n\\[\nx^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p = a + b + c, q = ab + ac + bc, r = abc \\), and here it appears that the signs of the terms are \\( + \\) and \\( - \\) alternately.\n\nHence we infer, that when the roots of an equation are all positive, the signs of its terms are positive and negative alternately.\n\n174. If again the roots of the equation be all negative, and therefore its factors \\( x+a, x+b, x+c \\), then \\( p, q \\) and \\( r \\) being as before, the resulting equation will stand thus:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0.\n\\]\n\nAnd hence we conclude, that when the roots are all negative, there is no change whatever in the signs.\n\n175. In general, if the roots of an equation be all real, that equation will have as many positive roots as there are changes of the signs from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), or from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\); and the remaining roots are negative. This rule, however, does not apply when the equation has imaginary roots, unless such roots be considered as either positive or negative.\n\n176. That the rule is true when applied to quadratic equations will be evident from Sec. IX. With respect to cubic equations, the rule also applies when the roots are either all positive, or all negative, as we have just now shewn.\n\nWhen a cubic equation has one positive root, and the other two negative, its factors will be \\( x-a, x+b, x+c \\), and the equation itself.\n\n\\[\nx^3 - ax^2 - bx - cx = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere there must always be one change of the signs, since the first term is positive, and the last negative; and there can be no more than one; for if the second term is negative, or \\( b+c \\) less than \\( a \\), then \\((b+c)^2\\) will be less than \\((b+c)a\\); but \\((b+c)^2\\) is always greater than \\( bc \\), therefore \\( bc \\) will be much less than \\((b+c)a\\) or \\( ab+ac \\), so that the third term must also be negative, and therefore in this case only one change of the signs.\n\nIf again the second term be positive, then because the sign of the last term is negative, whatever be the sign of the third term, there can still be no more than one change of the signs.\n\nWhen the equation has two positive roots and one negative, its factors are \\( x-a, x-b, x+c \\), and the equation.\n\n\\[\nx^3 - ax^2 - bx - cx = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere there must always be two changes of the signs; for if \\( a+b \\) be greater than \\( c \\), the second term is negative, and the last term being always positive, there must be two changes, whether the sign of the third term be positive or negative. If again \\( a+b \\) be less than \\( c \\), and therefore the second term positive; it may be shewn as before, that \\( ab \\) is much less than \\( ac+bc \\); and hence the third term will be negative; so that in either case there must be two changes of the signs.\n\nWe may conclude therefore, upon the whole, that in cubic equations there are always as many positive roots, as changes of the signs from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), or from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\); and by the same method of reasoning, the rule will be found to extend to all equations whatever.\n\n177. It appears from the manner in which the coefficients of an equation are formed from its roots, that when the roots are all real, the coefficients must consist entirely of real quantities. But it does not follow, on the contrary, that when the coefficients are real, the roots are also real; for we have already found, that in a quadratic equation, \\( x^2 + px + q = 0 \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) denote real quantities, the roots are sometimes both imaginary.\n\n178. When the roots of a quadratic equation are imaginary, they have always this form \\( a + \\sqrt{-b}, a - \\sqrt{-b} \\), which quantities may also be expressed thus,\nLet \\((x-a)(x-b)(x+c)=0\\) be any proposed equation which is to be transformed into another, having its roots greater or less than those of the proposed equation by the given quantity \\(n\\); then, because the roots of the transformed equation are to be \\(+a=n,+b=n\\) and \\(-c=n\\), the equation itself will be \\((y-n-a)(y-n-b)(y-n+c)=0\\).\n\nHence the reason of the following rule is evident.\n\nIf the new equation is to have its roots greater than those of the proposed equation, instead of \\(x\\) and its powers, substitute \\(y-n\\) and its powers; but if the roots are to be less, then instead of \\(x\\) substitute \\(y+n\\); and in either case, a new equation will be produced, the roots of which shall have the property required.\n\n183. By means of the preceding rule, an equation may be changed into another, which has its roots either all positive, or all negative; but it is chiefly useful in preparing cubic and biquadratic equations for a solution, by transforming them into others of the same degrees, but which want their second term.\n\nLet \\(x^3+px^2+qx+r=0\\) be any cubic equation; if we substitute \\(y+n\\) for \\(x\\), the equation is changed into the following:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^3 + 3ny^2 + 3n^2y + n^3 \\\\\n+ p(y^2 + 2ny + n^2) + q(y + n) + r = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, that this equation may want its second term, it is evident, that we have only to suppose \\(3n+p=0\\), or \\(n=-\\frac{p}{3}\\), for this assumption being made, and the value of \\(n\\) substituted in the remaining terms, the equation becomes\n\n\\[\ny^3 + (q-\\frac{p^2}{3})y + \\frac{2p^3}{27} - \\frac{pq}{3} + r = 0,\n\\]\n\nor, putting \\(\\frac{p^2}{3}+q=q'\\), and \\(\\frac{2p^3}{27}-\\frac{pq}{3}+r=r'\\) the same equation may also stand thus,\n\n\\[\ny^3 + q'y + r' = 0.\n\\]\n\n184. In general, any equation whatever may be transformed into another, which shall want its second term by the following rule.\n\nDivide the coefficient of the second term of the proposed equation by the exponent of the first term, and add the quotient, with its sign changed, to a new unknown quantity; this sum being substituted for the unknown quantity in the proposed equation, a new equation will be produced, which will want the second term, as required.\n\n185. By this rule, any affected quadratic equation may be readily resolved; for by transforming it into another equation, which wants the second term, we thus reduce its solution to that of a pure quadratic. Thus if the quadratic equation \\(x^2-5x+6=0\\) be proposed; by substituting \\(y+\\frac{5}{2}\\) for \\(x\\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^2 + 5y + \\frac{25}{4} \\\\\n- 5y - \\frac{25}{4} \\\\\n+ 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y^2 + \\frac{25}{4} = 0,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\(y=\\pm\\frac{5}{2}\\), and since \\(x=y+\\frac{5}{2}\\), therefore \\(x=\\pm\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{5}{2}=0\\).\n\n186. It has been shewn (\\$169) that in any equation, the coefficient of the second term, having its sign changed, is equal to the sum of all the roots, or abstracting\n\n187. Instead of taking away the second term from an equation, any other term may be made to vanish by an assumption similar to that which has been employed to take away the second term. Thus if in \u00a7 183, we assume \\( y^2 + 2py + q = 0 \\), by resolving this quadratic equation, a value of \\( n \\) will be found, which when substituted in the equation, will cause the third term to vanish; and by the resolution of a cubic equation the third term might be taken away; and so on.\n\n188. Another species of transformation, of use in the resolution of equations, is that by which an equation, having the coefficients of some of its terms expressed by fractional quantities, is changed into another, the coefficients of which are all integers.\n\nLet \\( x^3 + \\frac{p}{a}x^2 + \\frac{q}{b}x + \\frac{r}{c} = 0 \\) denote an equation to be so transformed; and let us assume \\( y = abcx \\); and therefore \\( x = \\frac{y}{abc} \\), then by substitution, our equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^3}{a^3b^3c^3} + \\frac{p}{a^2b^2c^2}y^2 + \\frac{q}{abc}y + \\frac{r}{c} = 0\n\\]\n\nand multiplying the whole equation by \\( a^3b^3c^3 \\), we have\n\n\\[\ny^3 + p'y^2 + q'y + r' = 0\n\\]\n\nThus we have an equation free from fractions, while at the same time the coefficient of the highest power of the unknown quantity is unity, as before.\n\n189. This transformation may always be performed by the following rule. Instead of the unknown quantity substitute a new unknown quantity divided by the product of all the denominators; then, by proper reduction, the equation will be found to have the form required.\n\n190. If, however, the equation have this form,\n\n\\[\nx^3 + \\frac{p}{a}x^2 + \\frac{q}{a}x + \\frac{r}{a} = 0,\n\\]\n\nit will be sufficient to assume \\( y = ax \\), and therefore \\( x = \\frac{y}{a} \\); for then we have\n\n\\[\ny^3 + py^2 + qy + r = 0\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( y^3 + py^2 + qy + r = 0 \\),\n\nwhich last equation has the form required.\n\nSect. XI. Of Cubic Equations.\n\n191. Cubic equations, as well as equations of every higher degree, are, like quadratics, divided into two classes; they are said to be pure, when they contain only one power of the unknown quantity; and affected, when they contain two or more powers of that quantity.\n\n192. Pure cubic equations are therefore of this form \\( x^3 = 125 \\), or \\( x^3 = -27 \\), or in general \\( x^3 = r \\); and hence it appears, that the value of the simple power of the unknown quantity may always be found, without difficulty, by extracting the cube root of each side of the equation; thus from the first of the three preceding examples we find \\( x = 5 \\), from the second \\( x = -3 \\), and from the third \\( x = \\sqrt[3]{-27} \\).\n\n193. It would seem at first sight, that the only value which \\( x \\) can have in the cubic equation \\( x^3 = r \\), or putting \\( r = c^3 \\), \\( x^3 - c^3 = 0 \\), is this one, \\( x = c \\); but since \\( x^3 - c^3 \\) may be resolved into these two factors \\( x - c \\) and \\( x^2 + cx + c^2 \\), it follows, that besides the value of \\( x \\) already found, which results from making the factor \\( x - c = 0 \\), it has yet other two values, which may be found by making the other factor \\( x^2 + cx + c^2 = 0 \\); and accordingly by resolving the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + cx = -c^2 \\), we find these values to be \\( \\frac{-c + \\sqrt{-3c^2}}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{-c - \\sqrt{-3c^2}}{2} \\), or \\( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c \\) and \\( \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c \\).\n\nThus it appears that any cubic equation of this form \\( x^3 = c^3 \\), or \\( x^3 - c^3 = 0 \\) has these three roots\n\n\\[\nx = c, \\quad x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c, \\quad x = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c,\n\\]\n\nthe first of which is real, but the two last are imaginary. If, however, each of the imaginary values of \\( x \\) be raised to the third power, the same results will be obtained as from the real value of \\( x \\); the original equation \\( x^3 - c^3 = 0 \\) may also be reproduced, by multiplying together the three factors \\( x - c, x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c, x = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c \\).\n\n194. Let us now consider such cubic equations as have all their terms, and which are therefore of this form\n\n\\[\nx^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) denote known quantities, either positive or negative.\n\nIt has been shown (\u00a7 184) how an equation having all its terms may be transformed into another, which wants the second term; let us therefore assume \\( x = y - \\frac{A}{3} \\), as directed in that article, then, by proper substitution, the above equation will be changed into another of this form\n\n\\[\ny^3 + qy + r = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) denote known quantities, whether positive or negative, now the roots of this equation being once found, it is evident that those of the former may also be readily obtained by means of the assumed equation \\( x = y - \\frac{A}{3} \\).\n\n195. Resuming, therefore, the equation \\( y^3 + qy + r = 0 \\), let us suppose \\( y = v + z \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\nv^3 + 3v^2z + 3vz^2 + z^3 + qv + rz = 0\n\\]\n\nThus we have got a new equation, which, as it involves two unknown quantities \\( v \\) and \\( z \\), may be resolved into any two other equations, which will simplify the determination of those quantities.\n\nNow it appears, that the only way in which we can divide\nCubic Equations.\n\ndivide that equation into two others, so as to simplify the question, is the following\n\n\\[3v^2z + 3vz^2 + qv + qz = 0\\]\n\n\\[v^3 + z^3 + r = 0\\]\n\nThe first of these equations may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[(3vz + q)(v + z) = 0\\]\n\nHence we must either suppose that \\(v + z = 0\\), or that \\(3vz + q = 0\\); but the former supposition cannot be admitted, without supposing also that \\(y = 0\\), which does not agree with the hypothesis of the equation \\(y^3 + gy + r = 0\\); therefore we must adopt the latter. So that to determine \\(v\\) and \\(z\\) we have these two equations\n\n\\[3vz + q = 0, \\quad v^3 + z^3 + r = 0.\\]\n\nFrom the first, we find \\(vz = -\\frac{q}{3}\\), and \\(v^3z^3 = -\\frac{q^3}{27}\\);\n\nand from the second \\(v^3 + z^3 = -r\\), so that to determine the quantities \\(v^3\\) and \\(z^3\\), we have given their sum, and product; now this is a problem which we have already resolved when treating of quadratic equations, \u00a7155; and by proceeding in the same manner, in the present case, we shall find\n\n\\[v^3 = -\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}, \\quad z^3 = -\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3},\\]\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}}.\\]\n\nand \\(y = v + z = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}}.\\)\n\nThus we have at last obtained a value of the unknown quantity \\(y\\), in terms of the known quantities \\(q\\) and \\(r\\); therefore the equation is resolved.\n\n196. But this is only one of three values which \\(y\\) may have; let us, for the sake of brevity, put\n\n\\[A = -\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}, \\quad B = -\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3},\\]\n\nand denote the imaginary expressions\n\n\\[\\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\]\n\nby \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Then, from what has been shewn (\u00a7193), it is evident that \\(v\\) and \\(z\\) have each these three values\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt[3]{A}, \\quad v = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A}, \\quad v = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A},\\]\n\n\\[z = \\sqrt[3]{B}, \\quad z = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{B}, \\quad z = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{B}.\\]\n\nTo determine the corresponding values of \\(v\\) and \\(z\\), we must consider that \\(vz = -\\frac{q}{3} = \\sqrt{AB}\\); now if we observe that \\(\\alpha \\beta = 1\\), it will immediately appear that \\(v + z\\) has these three values\n\n\\[v + z = \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[v + z = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\beta \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[v + z = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{B}.\\]\n\nHence the three values of \\(y\\) are also these\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\beta \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{B}.\\]\n\nThe first of these formulae is commonly known by the name of Cardan's rule; but it is well known that Cardan was not the inventor, and that it ought to be attributed to Nicholas Tartalea, and Scipio Ferreus, who discovered it much about the same time, and independently of each other (see the Introduction.)\n\n197. The formulae given in last article for the roots of a cubic equation may be put under a different form, and perhaps better adapted to the purposes of arithmetical calculation as follows. Because \\(vz = -\\frac{q}{3}\\),\n\ntherefore \\(z = -\\frac{q}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{v} = -\\frac{q}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{A}}\\); hence \\(v + z = \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}}\\); thus it appears that the three values of \\(y\\) may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}}.\\]\n\n198. To show the manner of applying these formulae, let it be required to determine \\(x\\) from the cubic equation\n\n\\[x^3 + 3x^2 + 9x - 13 = 0.\\]\n\nAnd as this equation has all its terms, the first step towards its resolution is to transform it into another which shall want the second term, by substituting \\(y = 1\\) for \\(x\\) as directed (\u00a7184). The operation will stand thus\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx^3 &= y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1 \\\\\n+ 3x^2 &= + 3y^2 - 6y + 3 \\\\\n+ 9x &= + 9y - 9 \\\\\n- 13 &= - 13\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe transformed equation is \\(y^3 + 6y - 20 = 0\\),\n\nwhich being compared with the general equation\n\n\\[y^3 + gy + r = 0\\]\n\ngives \\(g = 6, r = -20\\); hence\n\n\\[A = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the first formula of last article gives \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}} - \\frac{2}{3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}}}\\); but as this expression involves a radical quantity, let the square root of 108 be taken and added to 10, and the cube root of the sum found; thus we have \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}} = 2.732\\), nearly, and...\nCubic Equations, and therefore \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{108}} = \\frac{2}{2.732} = .732 \\); hence we at last find one of the values of \\( y \\) to be \\( 2.732 - .732 = 2 \\).\n\nIn finding the cube root of the radical quantity \\( \\sqrt[3]{10 + \\sqrt{108}} \\) we have taken only its approximate value, so as to have the expression for the root under a rational form, and in this way we can always find, as near as we please, the cube root of any furd of the form \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) where \\( b \\) is a positive number. But it will sometimes happen that the cube root of such a furd can be expressed exactly by another furd of the same form; and accordingly, in the present case, it appears that the cube root of \\( 10 + \\sqrt{108} \\) is \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\), as may be proved by actually raising \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\) to the third power. Hence we find \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{108}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2(1 - \\sqrt{3})}{(1 + \\sqrt{3})(1 - \\sqrt{3})} = -(1 - \\sqrt{3}) \\); so that we have \\( y = 1 + \\sqrt{3} + 1 - \\sqrt{3} = 2 \\), as before.\n\nThe other two values of \\( y \\) will be had by substituting \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( 1 - \\sqrt{3} \\) for \\( \\sqrt[3]{A} \\) and \\( \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{A}}{2} \\) in the second and third formulae of last article, also restoring the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). We thus have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-9}}{2} \\times (1 + \\sqrt{3}) + \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-9}}{2} \\times (1 - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nSo that the three values of \\( y \\) are\n\n\\[\n+2, -1 + \\sqrt{-9}, -1 - \\sqrt{-9}\n\\]\n\nand since \\( x = y + 1 \\), the corresponding values of \\( x \\) are\n\n\\[\n+1, -2 + \\sqrt{-9}, -2 - \\sqrt{-9}\n\\]\n\nthus it appears that one of the roots of the proposed equation is real and the other two imaginary.\n\nThe two imaginary roots might have been found otherwise, by considering that since one root of the equation is \\( 1 \\), the equation must be divisible by \\( x - r \\) (\\$163). Accordingly the division being actually performed, and the quotient put \\( = 0 \\), we have this quadratic equation\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 4x + 13 = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich, when resolved by the rule for quadratics, gives \\( x = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{-9} \\), the same imaginary values as before.\n\n199. In the application of the preceding formul\u00e6 (\\$196 and 197) to the resolution of the equation \\( y^3 + qy + r = 0 \\), it is necessary to find the square root of \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} + \\frac{r^2}{4} \\); now when that quantity is positive, as in the equation \\( y^3 + 6y - 20 = 0 \\), which was resolved in last article, no difficulty occurs, for its root may be found, either exactly, or to as great a degree of accuracy as we please.\n\nAs, however, the coefficients \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) are independent of each other, it is evident that \\( q \\) may be negative, and such that \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} \\) is greater than \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} \\); in this case the expression \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} + \\frac{r^2}{4} \\) will be negative, and therefore its square root an imaginary quantity. Let us take as an example this equation \\( y^3 - 6y + 4 = 0 \\); here \\( q = -6 \\), \\( r = 4 \\), \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} = 9 \\), \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} = 1 \\), hence, by recurring to the formul\u00e6 (\\$196), we have \\( A = 2 + 2\\sqrt{-1} \\), \\( B = 2 - \\sqrt{-1} \\), and therefore the three roots of the equation expressed thus\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 + 2\\sqrt{-1}}} + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - 2\\sqrt{-1}}}\n\\]\n\nHere all the roots appear under an imaginary form; but we are certain from the theory of equations as explained in Sect. X. that every cubic equation must have at least one real root. The truth is, as we shall show immediately, that in this case, so far from any of the roots being imaginary (as in the former example), they are all real; for it appears by actual involution that the imaginary expression \\( 2 + 2\\sqrt{-1} \\) is the cube of this other imaginary expression \\( -1 + \\sqrt{-1} \\), and, in like manner, that \\( 2 - 2\\sqrt{-1} \\) is the cube of \\( -1 - \\sqrt{-1} \\), so that we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 + 2\\sqrt{-1}}} + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - 2\\sqrt{-1}}} = -1 + \\sqrt{-1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 + \\sqrt{-1}) + \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 - \\sqrt{-1}) = 1 + \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 + \\sqrt{-1}) + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 - \\sqrt{-1}) = 1 - \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n200. We now proceed to prove in general, that as often as the roots of the equation \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\) are real, \\( q \\) is negative, and \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} \\) greater than \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} \\); and, on the contrary, that if \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} \\) be greater than \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} \\) the roots are all real.\n\nLet us suppose \\( a \\) to be a real root of the proposed equation,\n\nThen \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\)\n\nAnd \\( a^3 + qa + r = 0 \\)\n\nAnd therefore by subtraction \\( x^3 - a^3 + q(x-a) = 0 \\); hence, dividing \\( x^3 - a^3 \\), also \\( q(x-a) \\) by \\( x-a \\), we have\n\n\\[\nx^2 + ax + a^2 + q = 0\n\\]\n\nThis quadratic equation is formed from the two remaining roots of the proposed equation, and by resolving it we find\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{a}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} - q}\n\\]\n\nAnd as, by hypothesis, all the roots are real, it is evident that \\( q \\) must necessarily be negative, and greater than \\( \\frac{a^2}{4} \\); for otherwise the expression \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} - q} \\) would be imaginary. Let us change the sign of \\( q \\), and put\nCubic Equations.\n\nPut \\( q = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + d \\); thus the roots of the equation \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\) will be\n\n\\[\na, -\\frac{1}{2}a + \\sqrt{d}, -\\frac{1}{2}a - \\sqrt{d},\n\\]\n\nand here \\( d \\) is a positive quantity.\n\nTo find an expression for \\( r \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), let \\( \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + d \\) be substituted for \\( q \\) in the equation \\( a^3 + qa + r = 0 \\); we thence find \\( r = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + ad \\); so that to compare together the quantities \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) we have these equations,\n\n\\[\nq = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + d,\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + ad.\n\\]\n\nIn order to make this comparison, let the cube of \\( \\frac{1}{4}q \\) be taken, also the square of \\( \\frac{1}{4}r \\), the results are\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{4}q \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{64}a^9 + \\frac{3}{64}a^6d + \\frac{3}{64}a^3d^2 + \\frac{1}{64}d^3,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{4}r \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{16}a^6 + \\frac{1}{8}a^3d + \\frac{1}{16}d^2,\n\\]\n\nand therefore, by subtraction,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{64}a^9 + \\frac{3}{64}a^6d + \\frac{3}{64}a^3d^2 + \\frac{1}{64}d^3 - \\frac{1}{16}a^6 - \\frac{1}{8}a^3d - \\frac{1}{16}d^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow the square of any real quantity being always positive, it follows that \\( \\frac{1}{64}a^9 + \\frac{3}{64}a^6d + \\frac{3}{64}a^3d^2 + \\frac{1}{64}d^3 \\) will be positive when \\( d \\) is positive; hence it is evident that in this case \\( \\frac{1}{4}q \\) must be greater than \\( \\frac{1}{4}r \\); and that the contrary cannot be true unless \\( d \\) be negative, that is, unless that \\( -\\frac{1}{2}a + \\sqrt{d}, -\\frac{1}{2}a - \\sqrt{d} \\), the two other roots of the equation, are imaginary. If we suppose \\( d = 0 \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{4}q = \\frac{1}{4}r \\), and the roots of the equations, which in this case are all real, are \\( a, -\\frac{1}{2}a, -\\frac{1}{2}a \\).\n\nUpon the whole, therefore, we infer, that since a cubic equation has always one real root, its roots will be all real as often as \\( q \\) is negative, and \\( \\frac{1}{4}q \\) greater than \\( \\frac{1}{4}r \\); and consequently, that in this case the formulae for the roots must express real quantities notwithstanding their imaginary form.\n\nLet \\( y^3 - gy + r = 0 \\) denote any equation of the form which has been considered in last article, namely, that which has its roots all real, then, if we put \\( a = -\\frac{1}{2}r \\), \\( b = \\frac{1}{4}q^3 - \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\), one of the roots, as expressed by the first formula, \u00a7 196, will be\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}}.\n\\]\n\nThis expression, although under an imaginary form, must (as we have shown in last article) represent a real quantity. It will sometimes happen, as in last example, \u00a7 199, that the two surds which compose the root are perfect cubes of the form \\( (A + B\\sqrt{-1})^3 \\) and \\( (A - B\\sqrt{-1})^3 \\), and then the value of \\( y \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nA + B\\sqrt{-1} + A - B\\sqrt{-1} = 2A.\n\\]\n\nBut the rules for determining when this is the case depend upon trials, and are besides troublesome in the application. And if we attempt by a direct process to investigate the numerical values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we are brought to a cubic equation, of the very same form as that whose root is required.\n\nThis imaginary expression for a real quantity has greatly perplexed mathematicians; and much pains has been taken to obtain the root under another form, but without success. Accordingly the case of cubic equations, in which the roots are all real, is now called the irreducible case.\n\nIt is remarkable that the expression\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}},\n\\]\n\nand in general,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is any power of 2, admits of being reduced to another form in which no impossible quantity is found.\n\nThus \\( \\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}} = \\sqrt[3]{2a + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\),\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\sqrt{2a + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\right)^3},\n\\]\n\nas is easily proved by first squaring the imaginary formulae, and then taking the square root of each. But when \\( n = 3 \\), it does not seem that such reduction can possibly take place.\n\nIf each of the surds be expanded into an infinite series and their sum be taken, the imaginary quantity \\( \\sqrt{-1} \\) will vanish; and thus the root may be found by a direct process. There are, however, other methods which seem preferable, and the following which is derived from the application of algebra to geometry seems to be the best.\n\nIt will be demonstrated in Sect. XXV, that if \\( a \\) denote an arch of a circle, the relation between the cosine of the arch and the cosine of \\( \\frac{a}{3} \\), one-third of that arch is expressed by the following cubic equation.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cof. } \\frac{a}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3} = \\text{ cof. } a.\n\\]\n\nLet us assume \\( \\text{cof. } \\frac{a}{3} = \\frac{y}{n} \\); then, by substitution, the equation is transformed into the following\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^3}{n^3} - \\frac{3y}{4n} = \\text{ cof. } a.\n\\]\n\nOr\n\n\\[\ny^3 - \\frac{3y^3}{4} = n^3 \\times \\text{ cof. } a.\n\\]\n\nAnd in this cubic equation one of the roots is evidently \\( y = n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3} \\). Now from the arithmetic of sines it appears that \\( \\text{cof. } a, \\text{ cof. } (360^\\circ - a) \\) and \\( \\text{cof. } (360^\\circ + a) \\) are all expressed by the same quantity; therefore the equation must have for a root, not only \\( n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3} \\), but also \\( n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ - a}{3} \\), and \\( n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ + a}{3} \\). But from the arithmetic of sines \\( \\text{cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ - a}{3} = \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3} \\), and \\( \\text{cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ + a}{3} = \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3} \\). Therefore the three roots of the equation are\n\n\\[\nn \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3}, -n \\times \\text{ fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3}, -n \\times \\text{ fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3}.\n\\]\n\nLet us next suppose that \\( y^3 - gy + r = 0 \\) is a cubic equa-\nCubic Equations whose roots are required, and let us compare it with the former equation \\( y^3 - \\frac{3n^2}{4} y = n^3 \\times \\text{cof. } a; \\) then it is evident that if we assume the quantities \\( n \\) and cof. \\( a \\), such that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3n^2}{4} = q, \\quad n^3 \\times \\text{cof. } a = r\n\\]\n\nthe two equations will become identical, and thus their roots will be expressed by the very same quantities. But from these two assumed equations we find\n\n\\[\nn = \\sqrt{\\frac{4q}{3}}, \\quad \\text{cof. } a = \\frac{r}{n^3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{27r^2}{4q^3}} = \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}}\n\\]\n\nand since the cosine of an arch cannot exceed unity, therefore, \\( \\frac{27r^2}{4q^3} \\) must be a proper fraction, that is \\( 4q^3 \\) must exceed \\( 27r^2 \\); or \\( \\frac{27}{4} q^3 \\) must exceed \\( \\frac{3}{4} r^2 \\); if we now recollect that \\( q \\) is a negative quantity it will immediately appear that the proposed equation must necessarily belong to the irreducible case.\n\n206. The rule, therefore which we derive from the preceding analysis for resolving that case is as follows:\n\nLet \\( y^3 - qy = r \\) be the proposed equation.\n\nFind in the trigonometrical tables an arch \\( a \\), whose natural cosine \\( = \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}} \\).\n\nThe roots of the equation are\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{cof. } \\frac{a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3}\n\\]\n\nThese formul\u00e6 will apply, whether \\( r \\) be positive or negative, by proper attention to the signs: If, however, \\( r \\) be negative, or the equation have this form, \\( y^3 - qy = -r \\), the following will be more convenient:\n\nFind in the tables an arch \\( a \\), whose fine \\( = \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}} \\).\n\nThen the roots of the equation are\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{fin. } \\frac{a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{cof. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{cof. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe last formul\u00e6 are derived from the equation\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{fin. } \\frac{a}{3} \\right) = \\text{fin. } a\n\\]\n\nin the same manner as the former were found from the first equation of last article.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to find the roots of the equation \\( x^3 - 3x = 1 \\).\n\nHere \\( \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{6\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2} = \\text{cof. } 60^\\circ = \\text{cof. } \\pi \\).\n\nHence\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\text{ cof. } \\frac{60^\\circ}{3} = 2 \\text{ cof. } 20^\\circ = 1.8793852\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -2 \\text{ fin. } \\frac{150^\\circ}{3} = -2 \\text{ fin. } 50^\\circ = -1.5320888\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -2 \\text{ fin. } \\frac{30^\\circ}{3} = -2 \\text{ fin. } 10^\\circ = -0.3472964\n\\]\n\nEx. 2.

XII. Of Biquadratic Equations.\n\n207. When a biquadratic equation contains all its terms, it has this form,\n\n\\[\nx^4 + A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, D \\), denote any known quantities whatever.\n\n208. We shall first consider pure biquadratics, or such as contain only the first and last terms, and therefore are of this form \\( x^4 = b^4 \\). In this case it is evident that \\( x \\) may be readily had by two extractions of the square root; by the first we find \\( x^2 = b^2 \\) and by the second \\( x = b \\). This, however, is only one of the values which \\( x \\) may have; for since \\( x^4 = b^4 \\), therefore \\( x^4 - b^4 = 0 \\); but \\( x^4 - b^4 \\) may be resolved into two factors \\( x^2 - b^2 \\) and \\( x^2 + b^2 \\), each of which admit of a similar resolution; for \\( x^2 - b^2 = (x - b)(x + b) \\) and \\( x^2 + b^2 = (x - b\\sqrt{-1})(x + b\\sqrt{-1}) \\). Hence it appears that the equation \\( x^4 - b^4 = 0 \\) may also be expressed thus:\n\n\\[\n(x - b)(x + b)(x - b\\sqrt{-1})(x + b\\sqrt{-1}) = 0,\n\\]\n\nso that \\( x \\) may have these four values,\n\n\\[\n\\pm b, \\pm b\\sqrt{-1},\n\\]\n\ntwo of which are real and the others imaginary.\n\n209. Next to pure biquadratic equations, in respect of easiness of resolution, are such as want the second and fourth terms, and therefore have this form,\n\n\\[\nx^4 + q x^2 + s = 0.\n\\]\n\nThese may be resolved in the manner of quadratic equations; for if we put \\( y^2 = x^2 \\) we have\n\n\\[\ny^4 + q y^2 + s = 0,\n\\]\n\nfrom which we find \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-q \\pm \\sqrt{q^2 - 4s}}{2}} \\), and therefore \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-q \\pm \\sqrt{q^2 - 4s}}{2}} \\).\n\n210. When a biquadratic equation has all its terms, the manner of resolving it is not so obvious as in the two former cases, but its resolution may be always reduced to that of a cubic equation. There are various methods by which such a reduction may be effected; the following, which we select as one of the most ingenious, was first given by Euler in the Peterburgh Commentaries, and\nBiquadratic and afterwards explained more fully in his Elements of Algebra.\n\nWe have already explained \u00a7 184, in what manner an equation which is complete in its terms may be transformed into another equation of the same degree, but which wants the second term; therefore, any proposed biquadratic equation may be reduced to this form,\n\n\\[ y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\]\n\nwhere the second term is wanting, and where \\( p, q, r \\) denote any known quantities whatever.\n\n211. That we may form any equation similar to the above, let us assume \\( y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\), and let us also suppose that the letters \\( a, b, c \\) denote the roots of the cubic equation\n\n\\[ z^3 + Pz^2 + Qz - R = 0 \\]\n\nthen from the theory of equations we have\n\n\\[ a + b + c = -P, \\quad ab + ac + bc = Q, \\quad abc = R. \\]\n\nLet us now square the assumed formula\n\n\\[ y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}, \\]\n\nand we obtain\n\n\\[ y^2 = a + b + c + 2(\\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt{ac} + \\sqrt{bc}) \\]\n\nor substituting \\(-P\\) for \\(a + b + c\\), and transposing,\n\n\\[ y^2 + P = 2(\\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt{ac} + \\sqrt{bc}). \\]\n\nLet this equation be also squared and we have\n\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 + P^2 = 4(ab + ac + bc) + 8(\\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{ab^2c} + \\sqrt{a^2bc} + \\sqrt{a^2b^2c}), \\]\n\nand since \\( ab + ac + bc = Q \\),\n\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 + P^2 = 4Q + 8\\sqrt{Ry}. \\]\n\nThus we have obtained the biquadratic equation\n\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 - 8\\sqrt{Ry} + P^2 - 4Q = 0, \\]\n\none of the roots of which \\( y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\), and in which \\( a, b, c \\) are the roots of the cubic equation\n\n\\[ z^3 + Pz^2 + Qz - R = 0. \\]\n\n212. That we may apply this resolution to the proposed equation \\( y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\), we must express the assumed coefficients \\( P, Q, R \\) by means of \\( p, q, r \\) the coefficients of that equation. For this purpose let us compare together the equations;\n\n\\[ y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\]\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 - 8\\sqrt{Ry} + P^2 - 4Q = 0, \\]\n\nand it immediately appears that \\( 2P = p, -8\\sqrt{R} = q, P^2 - 4Q = r \\); and from these three equations we find\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{p}{2}, \\quad Q = \\frac{p^2 - 4r}{16}, \\quad R = \\frac{q^2}{64}. \\]\n\nHence it follows, that the roots of the proposed equation are generally expressed by the formula \\( y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\); where \\( a, b, c \\) denote the roots of this cubic equation\n\n\\[ z^3 + \\frac{P}{2}z^2 + \\frac{P^2 - 4r}{16}z - \\frac{q^2}{64} = 0. \\]\n\n213. But to find each particular root, we must consider, that as the square root of a number may be either positive or negative, so each of the quantities \\( \\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{c} \\) may have either the sign \\(+ \\) or \\(- \\) prefixed to it; and hence our formula will give eight different expressions for the root. It is, however, to be observed, that as the product of the three quantities \\( \\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{c} \\) must be equal to \\( \\sqrt{R} \\) or to \\(-\\frac{q^2}{8} \\), therefore when \\( q \\) is positive, their product must be a negative quantity; and this can only be effected by making either one or three of them negative; again, when \\( q \\) is negative, their product must be a positive quantity, so that in this case they must either be all positive, or two of them must be negative. These considerations enable us to determine, that four of the eight expressions for the root belong to the case in which \\( q \\) is positive, and the other four to that in which it is negative.\n\n214. We shall now give the result of the preceding investigation, in the form of a practical rule, for resolving biquadratic equations; and as the coefficients of the cubic equation which has been found, \u00a7 212, involve fractions, we shall transform it into another, in which the coefficients are integers, by supposing\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{v}{4}. \\]\n\nThus the equation \\( z^3 + \\frac{P}{2}z^2 + \\frac{P^2 - 4r}{16}z - \\frac{q^2}{64} = 0 \\) becomes, after reduction, \\( v^3 + 2pv^2 + (p^2 - 4r)v - q^2 = 0 \\);\n\nit also follows, that since the roots of the former equation are \\( a, b, c \\), the roots of the latter are \\( \\frac{a}{4}, \\frac{b}{4}, \\frac{c}{4} \\), so that our rule may now be expressed thus:\n\nLet \\( y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\) be any biquadratic equation wanting its second term. Form this cubic equation\n\n\\[ v^3 + 2pv^2 + (p^2 - 4r)v - q^2 = 0, \\]\n\nand find its roots, which let us denote by \\( a, b, c \\).\n\nThen the roots of the proposed biquadratic equation are\n\nwhen \\( q \\) is negative\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} - \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} - \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}). \\]\n\nwhen \\( q \\) is positive\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}). \\]\n\n215. This resolution of biquadratic equations suggests the following general remarks upon the nature of their roots.\n\n1. It is evident from the form of the roots, that if the cubic equation\n\n\\[ v^3 + 2pv^2 + (p^2 - 4r)v - q^2 = 0 \\]\n\nhave all its roots real, and positive, those of the biquadratic equation shall be all real.\n\n2. Since the last term of the cubic equation is negative, when its three roots are real, they must either be all positive, or two of them must be negative and one positive; for the last term is equal to the product of all the roots taken with contrary signs, \u00a7 169; so that in this last case two of the three quantities \\( a, b, c \\) must be negative, and therefore all the four roots of the biquadratic equation imaginary. If, however, the two negative roots be equal, they will destroy each other in two of the roots of the biquadratic equation, which will then become real and equal. Let us suppose for example that \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are negative, and equal; the two first values of \\( y \\) in each column become then imaginary,\nBiquadratic, and the remaining values of \\( y \\) are in the first set of roots \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a}, y = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a} \\), and in the second \\( y = +\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a}, y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a} \\).\n\n3. When the cubic equation has only one real, and two imaginary roots, its real root must necessarily be positive. For the imaginary roots can only come from a quadratic equation, having its last term positive, Sect. IX, and therefore of this form \\( v^2 + Av + B = 0 \\), hence, the simple factor which contains the remaining root must have this form \\( v - r \\), otherwise the last term of the cubic equation could not be negative.\n\nBy resolving the equation \\( v^3 + Av + B = 0 \\), we find\n\n\\[ v = -\\frac{A}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{A^2}{4} - B}; \\]\n\nhere, the roots being supposed imaginary, \\( \\frac{A^2}{4} - B \\) must be a negative quantity. That we may simplify the form of the roots, let us put \\( -\\frac{A}{2} = a \\) and \\( \\frac{A^2}{4} - B = -\\beta^2 \\); then\n\n\\[ v = -a \\pm \\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad v = -a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}. \\]\n\nHence we have\n\n\\[ a = a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad b = a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad c = r; \\]\n\nso that in two of the four values of \\( y \\), we have a quantity of this form\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt{a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} \\]\n\nbut this quantity, although it appears to be imaginary, is indeed real; for if we first square it, and then take its square root, it becomes\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2a + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + \\beta^2}} \\]\n\nwhich is a real quantity. The two other roots involve this other expression\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} - \\sqrt{a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} \\]\n\nwhich, being treated in the same manner as the former, becomes\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2a - 2\\sqrt{a^2 + \\beta^2}} \\]\n\nan imaginary quantity, and therefore the roots, into which it enters, are imaginary.\n\n4. We may discover from the coefficients of the proposed biquadratic equation in what case the roots of the cubic equation are all real; for this purpose the latter is to be transformed into another which shall want the second term by assuming \\( v = u - \\frac{2p}{3} \\); thus it becomes\n\n\\[ u^3 - \\left( \\frac{p^2}{3} + 4r \\right) u - \\frac{2p^3}{27} + \\frac{8rp}{3} - q^2 = 0; \\]\n\nand in this equation the three roots will be real when\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{p^2}{3} + 4r \\right)^3 \\text{ is greater than } \\frac{4}{27} \\left( \\frac{2p^3}{27} - \\frac{8rp}{3} + q^2 \\right). \\]\n\n216. As an example of the method of resolving a biquadratic equation, let it be required to determine the roots of the following,\n\n\\[ x^4 - 25x^3 + 65x - 36 = 0. \\]\n\nVol. I. Part II.\n\nBy comparing this equation with the general formula, Reciprocal Equations, we have \\( p = -25, q = +65, r = -36 \\), hence\n\n\\[ 2p = -50, p^2 - 4r = 769, q^2 = 3600, \\]\n\nand the cubic equation to be resolved is\n\n\\[ v^3 - 50v^2 + 769v - 3600 = 0; \\]\n\nthe roots of which are found by the rules for cubics, to be 9, 16, and 25, so that we have \\( \\sqrt{a} = 3, \\sqrt{b} = 4, \\sqrt{c} = 5 \\). Now in this case \\( q \\) is positive, therefore\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{(-3 - 4 - 5)}{-6} = 6 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{(-3 + 4 + 5)}{+3} = 3 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{(3 - 4 - 5)}{-2} = 2 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{(3 + 4 - 5)}{+1} = 1. \\]\n\n217. We have now explained the particular rules by which the roots of equations belonging to each of the first four orders may be determined; and this is the greatest length mathematicians have been able to go in the direct resolution of equations; for as to those of the fifth, and all higher degrees, no general method has hitherto been found, either for resolving them directly, or for reducing them to others of an inferior degree.\n\nIt even appears that the formul\u00e6 which express the roots of cubic equations are by no means of universal application; for in one case, that is, when the roots are all real, they become illusory, so that no conclusion can be drawn from them. The same observation will also apply to the formul\u00e6 for the roots of biquadratic equations, because, before they can be applied, it is always necessary to find the roots of a cubic equation. But in either cubics or biquadratic equations, even when the formul\u00e6 involve no imaginary quantities, and therefore can be always applied, it is more convenient in practice to employ some other methods which we are hereafter to explain.\n\nSect. XIII. Of Reciprocal Equations.\n\n218. Although no general resolution has hitherto been given of equations belonging to the fifth, or any higher degree; yet there are particular equations of all orders, which by reason of certain peculiarities in the nature of their roots, admit of being reduced to others of a lower degree, and thus, in some cases, equations of the higher orders may be resolved by the rules which have been already explained for the resolution of equations belonging to the first four orders.\n\n219. When the coefficients of the terms of an equation form the same numerical series, whether taken in a direct or an inverted order, as in this example\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nthat equation may always be transformed into another of a degree denoted by half the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity, if that exponent be an even number, or by half the exponent diminished by unity, if it be an odd number.\n\nThe same observation will also apply to any equation of this form\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwhere the given quantity \\( a \\) and the unknown quantity \\( x \\) are\nReciprocal \\( x \\) are precisely alike concerned; for by substituting \\( ay \\) for \\( x \\), it becomes\n\n\\[\na^4 + p a^3 y + q a^2 y^2 + p a y^3 + a^4 = 0;\n\\]\n\nand dividing by \\( a^4 \\),\n\n\\[\ny^4 + p y^3 + q y^2 + p y + 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nan equation of the same kind as the former.\n\n220. That we may effect the proposed transformation upon the equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + p x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nlet every two terms which are equally distant from the extremes be collected into one, and the whole be divided by \\( x^4 \\), thus we have\n\n\\[\nx^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} + p \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + q = 0.\n\\]\n\nLet us assume \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = z \\)\n\nThen \\( x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = z^2 \\) and \\( x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = z^2 - 2 \\)\n\nThus the equation \\( x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} + p \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + q = 0 \\)\n\nbecomes \\( z^4 + p z^2 + q - 2 = 0 \\).\n\nAnd since \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = z \\), therefore \\( x^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \\).\n\n221. Hence upon the whole, to determine the roots of the biquadratic equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + p x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nwe have the following rule.\n\nForm this quadratic equation\n\n\\[\nz^4 + p z^2 + q - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nand find its roots, which let us suppose denoted by \\( z' \\) and \\( z'' \\). Then the four roots of the proposed equation will be found by resolving two quadratic equations\n\n\\[\nx^2 - z' x + 1 = 0, \\quad x^2 - z'' x + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\n222. It may be observed respecting these two quadratic equations, that since the last term of each is unity, if we put \\( a, a' \\) to denote the roots of the one, and \\( b, b' \\) those of the other, we have from the theory of equations \\( a a' = 1 \\), and therefore \\( a' = \\frac{1}{a} \\); also \\( b b' = 1 \\), and \\( b' = \\frac{1}{b} \\); now \\( a, a', b, b' \\) are also the roots of the equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + p x + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that the proposed equation has this peculiar property, that the one half of its roots are the reciprocals of the other half; and to that circumstance we are indebted for the simplicity of its resolution.\n\n223. The following equation\n\n\\[\nx^6 + p x^5 + q x^4 + r x^3 + s x^2 + p x + 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is of the sixth order, admits of a resolution in all respects similar to the former; for by putting it under this form\n\n\\[\nx^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} + p \\left( x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} \\right) + q \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + r = 0,\n\\]\n\nand putting also \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = z \\), so that \\( x^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \\), we with equal roots.\n\nhave \\( x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} = z^3 - 2 \\)\n\n\\[\nx^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} = z^3 - 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = z^3 - 3z\n\\]\n\nHence, by substitution, the proposed equation is transformed into the following cubic equation\n\n\\[\nz^3 + p z^2 + (q - 3) z + r - 2p = 0.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, putting \\( z', z'', z''' \\) to denote its roots, the six roots of the proposed equation will be had by resolving these three quadratics\n\n\\[\nx^2 - z' x + 1 = 0, \\quad x^2 - z'' x + 1 = 0, \\quad x^2 - z''' x + 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nand here it is evident, as in the former case, that the roots of each quadratic equation are the reciprocals of each other, so that the one half of the roots of the proposed equation are the reciprocals of the other half.\n\n224. The method of resolution we have employed in the two preceding examples is general for all equations whatever, in which the terms placed at equal distances from the first and last have the same coefficients, and which are called reciprocal equations, because any such equation has the same form when you substitute for \\( x \\) its reciprocal \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\n225. If the greatest exponent of the unknown quantity in a reciprocal equation is an odd number, as in this example\n\n\\[\nx^5 + p x^4 + q x^3 + r x^2 + p x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nthe equation will always be satisfied by substituting \\(-1\\) for \\( x \\); hence \\(-1\\) must be a root of the equation, and therefore the equation must be divisible by \\( x + 1 \\).\n\nAccordingly, if the division be actually performed, we shall have in the present case\n\n\\[\nx^4 + (p - 1)x^3 + (q - p - 1)x^2 + (r - q - p)x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nanother reciprocal equation, in which the greatest exponent of \\( x \\) is an even number, and therefore resolvable in the manner we have already explained.\n\nSect. XIV. Of Equations which have Equal Roots.\n\n226. When an equation has two or more of its roots equal to one another, those roots may always be discovered, and the equation reduced to another of an inferior degree, by a method of resolution which is peculiar to this class of equations; and which we now proceed to explain.\n\n227. Although the method of resolution we are to employ will apply alike to equations having equal roots, of every degree, yet, for the sake of brevity, we shall take a biquadratic equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + r x + s = 0\n\\]\n\nthe roots of which may be generally denoted by \\( a, b, c, d \\). Thus we have, from the theory of equations,\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = x^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + r x + s\n\\]\n\nLet us put\n\n\\[\nA = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) \\quad A'' = (x-a)(x-c)(x-d)\n\\]\n\\[\nA' = (x-a)(x-b)(x-d) \\quad A''' = (x-b)(x-c)(x-d)\n\\]\n\nThen,\nThen, by actual multiplication, we have\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA &= x^3 - ax + ab \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ac \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bc \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA' &= x^3 - ax + ab \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ad \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bd \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA'' &= x^3 - ax + ac \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ad \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bd \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA''' &= x^3 - ax + ac \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ad \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bd \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nand taking the sum of these four equations\n\n\\[ A + A' + A'' + A''' = 4x^3 - 3ax + 2ab + 2ac + 2ad + 2bd + 2cd \\]\n\nBut since \\(a, b, c, d\\) are the roots of the equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[ 3(a + b + c + d) = 3p \\]\n\\[ 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) = 2q \\]\n\\[ -(abc + abd + acd + bcd) = r \\]\n\nTherefore, by substitution\n\n\\[ A + A' + A'' + A''' = 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r \\]\n\n228. Let us now suppose that the proposed biquadratic equation has two equal roots, or \\(a = b\\), then \\(x = a = -b\\), and since one or other of these equal factors enters each of the four products \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\); it is evident that \\(A + A' + A'' + A'''\\) or \\(4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r\\) must be divisible by \\(x - a\\) or \\(x - b\\). Thus it appears that if the proposed equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nhas two equal roots, each of them must also be a root of this equation\n\n\\[ 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r = 0; \\]\n\nfor when the first of these equations is divisible by \\((x - a)^n\\) the latter is necessarily divisible by \\(x - a\\).\n\n229. Let us next suppose that the proposed equation has three equal roots or \\(a = b = c\\), then two at least of the three equal factors \\(x - a, x - b, x - c\\) must enter each of the four products \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\); so that in this case \\(A + A' + A'' + A'''\\) or \\(4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r\\) must be twice divisible by \\(x - a\\). Hence it follows that as often as the proposed equation has three equal roots, two of them must also be equal roots of the equation\n\n\\[ 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r = 0 \\]\n\n230. Proceeding in the same manner, it may be shewn that whatever number of equal roots are in the proposed equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nthey will all remain except one, in this equation\n\n\\[ 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r = 0, \\]\n\nwhich is evidently derived from the former, by multiplying each of its terms by the exponent of \\(x\\) in that with equal term, and then diminishing the exponent by unity.\n\n231. If we suppose that the proposed equation has two equal roots or \\(a = b\\), and also two other equal roots, or \\(c = d\\), then, by reasoning as before, it will appear that the equation derived from it must have one root equal to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), and another equal to \\(c\\) or \\(d\\), so that when the former is divisible both by \\((x - a)^n\\) and \\((x - c)^m\\), the latter will be divisible by \\((x - a)(x - c)\\).\n\n232. The same mode of reasoning may be extended to all equations whatever; so that if we suppose\n\n\\[ x^n + Px^{n-1} + Qx^{n-2} + \\ldots + Sx + T + U = 0 \\]\n\nan equation of the \\(n\\)th degree to have a divisor of this form\n\n\\[ (x - a)^n(x - d)^m(x - f)^r \\ldots &c. \\]\n\nThe equation\n\n\\[ mx^{n-1} + (m-1)Px^{n-2} + (m-2)Qx^{n-3} \\ldots + 2Sx + T = 0, \\]\n\nwhich is of the next lower degree, will have for a divisor\n\n\\[ (x - a)^{n-1}(x - d)^{m-1}(x - f)^{r-1} \\ldots &c. \\]\n\nand as this last product must be a divisor of both equations, it may always be discovered by the rule which has been given (\\$49) for finding the greatest common divisor of two algebraic quantities.\n\n233. Again, as this last equation must, in the case of equal roots, have the same properties as the original equation; therefore, if we multiply each of its terms by the exponent of \\(x\\), and diminish that exponent by unity, as before, we have\n\n\\[ m(m-1)x^{n-2} + (m-1)(m-2)Px^{n-3} + (m-2)(m-3)Qx^{n-4} \\ldots + 2Sx + T = 0, \\]\n\na new equation, which will have for a divisor\n\n\\[ (x - a)^{n-2}(x - d)^{m-2}(x - f)^{r-2}, \\]\n\nwhere the exponent of the factors are one less than those of the equation from which it was derived; and as this last divisor is also a divisor of the original equation, it may be discovered in the same manner as the former, namely, by finding the greatest common measure of both equations; and so on we may proceed as far as we please.\n\n234. As a particular example, let us take this equation\n\n\\[ x^5 - 13x^4 + 67x^3 - 171x^2 + 216x - 108 = 0, \\]\n\nand apply to it the method we have explained, in order to discover whether it has equal roots, and if so, what they are. We must therefore seek the greatest common measure of the proposed equation and this other equation, which is formed agreeably to what has been shewn \u00a7 228;\n\n\\[ 5x^4 - 52x^3 + 201x^2 - 342x + 216 = 0 \\]\n\nand the operation being performed, we find that they have a common divisor \\(x^3 - 8x^2 + 21x - 18\\), which is of the third degree and consequently may have several factors. Let us therefore try whether the last equation and the following\n\n\\[ 20x^3 - 156x^2 + 402x - 342 = 0, \\]\n\nwhich is derived from it, as directed in \u00a7 228, have any common divisor; and by proceeding as before, we find\nEquations find that they admit of this divisor \\( x - 3 \\), which is also a factor of the last divisor \\( x^2 - 8x + 21 = 18 \\), and therefore the product of remaining factors is immediately found by division to be \\( x^4 - 5x^3 + 6 \\) which is evidently resolvable into \\( x - 2 \\) and \\( x - 3 \\).\n\nThus it appears upon the whole, that the common divisor of the original equation, and that which is immediately derived from it, is \\( (x - 2)(x - 3)^2 \\); and that the common divisor of the second and third equations is \\( x - 3 \\). Hence it follows that the proposed equation has \\( (x - 2)^2 \\) for one factor, and \\( (x - 3)^3 \\) for another factor; so that the equation itself may be expressed thus, \\( (x - 2)^2(x - 3)^3 = 0 \\), and the truth of this conclusion may be easily verified by multiplication.\n\n**Sect. XV. Resolution of Equations whose Roots are Rational.**\n\n235. It has been shewn in \u00a7 169 that the last term of any equation is always the product of its roots taken with contrary signs: Hence it follows that when the roots are rational they may be discovered by the following rule.\n\nBring all the terms of the equation to one side; find all the divisors of the last term, and substitute them successively for the unknown quantity in the equation. Then each divisor, which produces a result equal to 0, is a root of the proposed equation.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let \\( x^4 - 4x^3 - 7x + 10 = 0 \\) be the proposed equation.\n\nThen, the divisors of 10 the last term are 1, 2, 5, 10, each of which may be taken either positively, or negatively, and these being substituted successively for \\( x \\), we obtain the following results.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n+1 & 1 & -4 & 7 & 10 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 4 & -1 & 12 \\\\\n+2 & 8 & -16 & 14 & 10 \\\\\n-2 & -8 & 16 & -14 & 10 \\\\\n+5 & 125 & -100 & 35 & 10 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHere the divisors which produce results equal to 0 are \\( +1, -2 \\) and \\( +5 \\), and therefore these numbers are the three roots of the proposed equation.\n\n236. When the number of divisors to be tried happens to be considerable, it will be convenient to transform the proposed equation into another, in which the last term has fewer divisors. This may, in general, be done by forming an equation, the roots of which are greater or less than those of the proposed equation by some determinate quantity, as in the following example:\n\n**Ex. 2.** Let \\( y^4 - 4y^3 - 8y + 32 = 0 \\) be proposed.\n\nHere the divisors to be tried are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, each taken either positively or negatively; but to prevent the trouble of so many substitutions, let us transform the equation, by putting \\( x + 1 \\) for \\( y \\).\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^4 &= x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 \\\\\n-4y^3 &= -4x^3 - 12x^2 - 12x - 4 \\\\\n-8y &= -8x - 8 \\\\\n+32 &= +32 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( x^4 - 6x^3 - 16x + 21 = 0 \\)\n\nThe roots of which are the imaginary quantities \\( -2 + \\sqrt{-3} \\) and \\( -2 - \\sqrt{-3} \\); so that since \\( y = x + 1 \\), the roots of the equation \\( y^4 - 4y^3 - 8y + 32 = 0 \\) are these,\n\n\\( y = +2, y = +4, y = -1 + \\sqrt{-3}, y = -1 - \\sqrt{-3} \\).\n\nIf this literal equation were proposed\n\n\\[\nx^3 - (3a + b)x^2 + (2a^2 + 3ab)x - 2a^2b = 0,\n\\]\n\nby proceeding as before, we should find \\( x = a, x = 2a, x = b \\) for the roots.\n\n237. To avoid the trouble of trying all the divisors of the last term, a rule may be investigated for restricting the number to very narrow limits as follows:\n\nSuppose that the cubic equation \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 \\) is to be resolved. Let it be transformed into another, the roots of which are less than those of the proposed equation by unity: this may be done by assuming \\( y = x - 1 \\), and the last term of the transformed equation will be \\( 1 + p + q + r \\). Again, by assuming \\( y = x + 1 \\) another equation will be formed whose roots exceed those of the proposed equation by unity, and the last term of this other transformed equation will be \\( -1 + p - q + r \\). And here it is to be observed, that these two quantities \\( 1 + p + q + r \\) and \\( -1 + p - q + r \\) are formed from the proposed equation \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r \\) by substituting in it successively \\( +1 \\) and \\( -1 \\) for \\( x \\).\n\nNow the values of \\( x \\) are some of the divisors of \\( r \\), which is the term left in the proposed equation, when \\( x \\) is supposed \\( = 0 \\); and the values of the \\( y \\)'s are some of the divisors of \\( 1 + p + q + r \\) and \\( -1 + p - q + r \\) respectively; and these values are in arithmetical progression, increasing by the common difference unity; because \\( x = 1, x = -1 \\) are in that progression; and it is obvious, that the same reasoning will apply to an equation of any degree whatever. Hence the following rule.\n\nSubstitute in place of the unknown quantity, successively, three or more terms of the progression 1, 0, -1, &c., and find all the divisors of the sums that result, then take out all the arithmetical progressions that can be found among these divisors, whose common difference is 1, and the values of \\( x \\) will be among these terms of the progressions, which are the divisors of the result arising from the substitution of \\( x = 0 \\). When the series increases, the roots will be positive; and, when it decreases, they will be negative.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let it be required to find a root of the equation \\( x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 0 \\).\nIn this example there is only one progression, 4, 3, 2, the term of which opposite to the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\) being 3, and the series decreasing, we try if \\( -3 \\) substituted for \\( x \\) makes the equation vanish, and as it succeeds, it follows that \\( -3 \\) is one of its roots. To find the remaining roots, if \\( x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 \\) be divided by \\( x + 3 \\), and the quotient \\( x^2 - 4x + 2 \\) put \\( = 0 \\), they will appear to be \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nEx. 2. Let the proposed equation be\n\n\\[\nx^4 + x^3 - 29x^2 - 9x + 180 = 0.\n\\]\n\nTo find its roots.\n\nHere there are four progressions, two increasing and two decreasing; hence, by taking their terms, which are opposite to the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\), we have these four numbers to be tried as roots of the equation \\( +3, +4, -3, -5 \\); all of which are found to succeed.\n\n238. If any of the coefficients of the proposed equation be a fraction, the equation may be transformed into another, having the coefficient of the highest power unity, and those of the remaining terms integers by \u00a7 189 and the roots of the transformed equation being found, those of the proposed equation may be easily derived from them.\n\nFor example, if the proposed equation be \\( x^3 - \\frac{3}{4}x^2 + \\frac{3}{4}x - 6 = 0 \\). Let us assume \\( x = \\frac{y}{4} \\); thus the equation is transformed to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^3}{64} - \\frac{7y^2}{64} + \\frac{35y}{16} - 6 = 0,\n\\]\n\nOr \\( y^3 - 7y^2 + 140y - 384 = 0 \\),\n\none root of which is \\( y = 3 \\); hence \\( x = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nThe proposed equation being now divided by \\( x - \\frac{3}{4} \\) is reduced to this quadratic \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\) the roots of which are both impossible.\n\n239. When the coefficients of an equation are integers, and that of the highest power of the unknown quantity unity, if its roots are not found among the divisors of the last term, we may be certain that, whether the equation be pure or affected, its roots cannot be exactly expressed either by whole numbers or rational fractions. This may be demonstrated by means of the following proposition. If a prime number \\( P \\) be a divisor of the product of two numbers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\); it will also be a divisor of at least one of the numbers.\n\nLet us suppose that it does not divide \\( B \\), and that \\( B \\) is greater than \\( P \\); then, putting \\( q \\) for the greatest number of times that \\( P \\) can be had in \\( B \\), and \\( B' \\) for the remainder, we have \\( \\frac{B}{P} = q + \\frac{B'}{P} \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AB}{P} = qA + \\frac{AB'}{P}.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears, that if \\( P \\) be a divisor of \\( AB \\), it is also a divisor of \\( AB' \\). Now \\( B' \\) is less than \\( P \\), for it is the remainder which is found in dividing \\( B \\) by \\( P \\); therefore, seeing we cannot divide \\( B' \\) by \\( P \\), let \\( P \\) be divided by \\( B' \\), and \\( q' \\) put for the quotient, also \\( B'' \\) for the remainder; again let \\( P \\) be divided by \\( B'' \\), and \\( q'' \\) put for the quotient, and \\( B''' \\) for the remainder, and so on; and as \\( P \\) is supposed to be a prime number, it is evident that this series of operations may be continued till a remainder be found equal to unity, which will at last be the case, for the divisors are the successive remainders of the divisions, and therefore each is less than the divisor which preceded it. By performing these operations we obtain the following series of equations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP &= q'B' + B'' \\\\\nP &= q''B'' + B''', \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand therefore\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nB' &= \\frac{P - B''}{q'} \\\\\nB'' &= \\frac{P - B'''}{q''}, \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence we have \\( AB' = \\frac{AP - AB''}{q'} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{q'AB'}{P} = \\frac{AP - AB''}{P} = A - \\frac{AB''}{P}.\n\\]\n\nNow, if \\( AB \\) be divisible by \\( P \\), we have shewn that \\( AB' \\), and consequently \\( q'AB' \\) is divisible by \\( P \\); therefore, from the last equation, it appears that \\( AB'' \\) must also be divisible by \\( P \\).\n\nAgain, from the preceding series of equations, we have \\( AB'' = \\frac{AP - AB'''}{q''} \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{q''AB''}{P} = \\frac{AP - AB'''}{P} = A - \\frac{AB'''}{P};\n\\]\n\nhence we conclude that \\( AB'' \\) is also divisible by \\( P \\).\n\nProceeding in this manner, and observing that the series of quantities \\( B', B'', B''', &c. \\) continually decrease till one of them \\( = 1 \\), it is evident that we shall at last come to a product of this form \\( A \\times 1 \\), which must\nEquations must be divisible by \\( P \\), and hence the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n241. It follows from this proposition, that if the prime number \\( P \\), which we have supposed not to be a divisor of \\( B \\), is at the same time not a divisor of \\( A \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( AB \\) the product of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n242. Let \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\) be a fraction in its lowest terms, then the numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) have no common divisor; but from what has been just now shewn, it appears, that if a prime number be not a divisor of \\( a \\) it cannot be a divisor of \\( a \\times a \\) or \\( a^2 \\), and in like manner, that if a prime number is not a divisor of \\( b \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( b \\times b \\) or \\( b^2 \\); therefore, it is evident that \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) have no common divisor, and thus the fraction \\( \\frac{b^2}{a^2} \\) is also in its lowest terms.\n\nHence it follows that the square of any fractional quantity is still a fraction, and cannot possibly be a whole number; and, on the contrary, that the square root of a whole number cannot possibly be a fraction; so that all such whole numbers as are not perfect squares can neither have their roots expressed by integers nor by fractions.\n\n243. Since that if a prime number is not a divisor of \\( a \\), it is also not a divisor of \\( a^2 \\), therefore if it is not a divisor of \\( a \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( a \\times a^3 \\) or \\( a^4 \\), \u00a7 241, and by reasoning in this way, it is obvious that if a prime number is not a divisor of \\( a \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( a^2 \\); also, that if it is not a divisor of \\( b \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( b^2 \\), therefore if \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\) is a fraction in its lowest terms \\( \\frac{b^2}{a^2} \\) is also a fraction in its lowest terms; so that any power whatever of a fraction is also a fraction, and on the contrary, any root of a whole number is also a whole number. Hence it follows that if the root of a whole number is not expressible by an integer, such root cannot be expressed by a fraction, but is therefore irrational or incommensurable.\n\n244. Let us next suppose that\n\n\\[\nx^n + Px^{n-1} + Qx^{n-2} + \\cdots + Tx + U = 0\n\\]\n\nis any equation whatever, in which \\( P, Q, \\ldots \\) denote integer numbers; then if its roots are not integers they cannot possibly be rational fractions. For if possible, let us suppose \\( x = \\frac{b}{a} \\), a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, then, by substitution\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^n}{b^n} + \\frac{Pa^{n-1}}{b^n} + \\frac{Qa^{n-2}}{b^n} + \\cdots + \\frac{Tb}{b^n} + \\frac{U}{b^n} = 0\n\\]\n\nand, reducing all the terms to a common denominator,\n\n\\[\na^n + Pa^{n-1}b + Qa^{n-2}b^2 + \\cdots + Tab^{n-1} + Ub^n = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich equation may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[\na^n + b(Pa^{n-1} + Qa^{n-2}b + \\cdots + Tab^{n-1} + Ub^n) = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere the equation consists of two parts, one of which is divisible by \\( b \\). But by hypothesis \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) have no common measure, therefore \\( a^n \\) is not divisible by \\( b \\), \u00a7 243, hence it is evident that the two parts of the equation cannot destroy each other as they ought to do; therefore \\( x \\) cannot possibly be a fraction.\n\nSect. XVI. Resolution of Equations by Approximation.\n\n245. When the roots of an equation cannot be accurately expressed by rational numbers, it is necessary to have recourse to the methods of approximation, and by these we can always determine the numerical values of the roots to as great a degree of accuracy as we please.\n\n246. The application of the methods of approximation is rendered easy by means of the following principles:\n\nIf two numbers, either whole or fractional, be found, which, when substituted for the unknown quantity in any equation, produce results with contrary signs; we may conclude that at least one root of the proposed equation is between those numbers, and is consequently real.\n\nLet the proposed equation be\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 15 = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich, by collecting the positive terms into one sum, and the negative into another, may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 10x - (5x^2 + 15) = 0\n\\]\n\nthen, to determine a root of the equation, we must find such a number as when substituted for \\( x \\) will render\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 10x = 5x^2 + 15.\n\\]\n\nLet us suppose \\( x \\) to have every degree of magnitude from 0 upwards in the scale of number, then \\( x^3 + 10x \\) and \\( 5x^2 + 15 \\) will both continually increase, but with different degrees of quickness, as appears from the following table.\n\n| Successive values of \\( x \\): | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c. |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| \\( x^3 + 10x \\):            | 0, 11, 28, 57, 104, 175, 276, &c. |\n| \\( 5x^2 + 15 \\):           | 15, 20, 35, 60, 95, 140, 195, &c. |\n\nBy inspecting this table, it appears that while \\( x \\) increases from 0 to a certain numerical value, which exceeds 3, the positive part of the equation, or \\( x^3 + 10x \\), is always less than the negative part, or \\( 5x^2 + 15 \\); so that the expression\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 15\n\\]\n\nmust necessarily be negative.\n\nIt also appears that when \\( x \\) has increased beyond that numerical value, and which is evidently less than 4, the positive part of the equation, instead of being less than the negative part, is now greater, and therefore the expression\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 15\n\\]\n\nis changed from a negative to a positive quantity.\n\n247. Hence we may conclude that there is some real and determinate value of \\( x \\), which is greater than 3, but less than 4, and which will render the positive and negative parts of the equation equal to one another; therefore that value of \\( x \\) must be a root of the proposed equation; and as what has been just now shewn in a particular case will readily apply to any equation whatever, the truth of what has been asserted at \u00a7 246 is obvious.\n\n248. Two\n248. Two limits, between which all the roots of any equation are contained, may be determined by the following proposition.\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the greatest negative coefficient in any equation. Change the signs of the terms taken alternately, beginning with the second, and let \\( N' \\) be the greatest negative coefficient after the signs are changed. The positive roots of the equation are contained between 0 and \\( N+1 \\), and the negative roots between 0 and \\( -N'-1 \\).\n\nSuppose the equation to be\n\n\\[\nx^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich may be also expressed thus\n\n\\[\nx^4 \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{x} + \\frac{q}{x^2} + \\frac{r}{x^3} + \\frac{s}{x^4}\\right) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThen, whatever be the values of the coefficients \\( p, q, r, \\) &c., it is evident that \\( x \\) may be taken so great as to render each of the quantities \\( \\frac{p}{x}, \\frac{q}{x^2}, \\frac{r}{x^3}, \\frac{s}{x^4} \\) as small as we please, and therefore their sum, or \\( \\frac{p}{x} + \\frac{q}{x^2} + \\frac{r}{x^3} + \\frac{s}{x^4} \\), less than 1; but in that case the quantity\n\n\\[\nx^4 \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{x} + \\frac{q}{x^2} + \\frac{r}{x^3} + \\frac{s}{x^4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nor \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s \\)\n\nwill be positive, and such, that the first term \\( x^4 \\) is greater than the sum of all the remaining terms, therefore also \\( x^4 + qx^2 \\) the sum of the positive terms will be much greater than \\( px^3 + rx + s \\) the sum of the negative terms alone.\n\nHence it follows, that if a number be found, which when substituted for \\( x \\), renders the expression \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s \\) positive, and which is also such that every greater number has the same property, that number will exceed the greatest positive root of the equation.\n\nNow, if we suppose \\( N \\) to be the greatest negative coefficient, it is evident that the positive part of the equation, or \\( x^4 + qx^2 \\), is greater than \\( px^3 + rx + s \\), provided that \\( x^4 \\) is greater than \\( Nx^4 + Nx^3 + Nx^2 + N \\), or \\( N(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) \\); but \\( x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = x^4 - 1 \\), therefore a positive result will be obtained, if for \\( x \\) there be substituted a number such that \\( x^4 > \\frac{Nx^4 - 1}{x - 1} \\) or \\( x^4 - Nx^4 = N \\). Now this last condition will evidently be fulfilled if we take \\( x^4 = Nx^4 \\), and from this equation we find \\( x = N + 1 \\); but it further appears that the same condition will also be fulfilled as often as \\( x^4 - Nx^4 \\) or \\( x^4 - N \\), that is \\( x > N + 1 \\), therefore \\( N + 1 \\) must be a limit to the greatest positive root of the proposed equation, as was to be shewn.\n\n249. If \\( y \\) be substituted for \\( +x \\), the equation\n\n\\[\ny^4 + py^3 + qy^2 + ry + s = 0\n\\]\n\nwill be transformed into\n\n\\[\ny^4 + py^3 + qy^2 + ry + s = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich equation differs from the former only in the signs of the second, fourth, &c. Approximation terms; and as the positive roots of this half equation are the same as the negative roots of the proposed equation, it is evident that their limit must be such as has been assigned.\n\n250. From the two preceding propositions it will not be difficult to discover, by means of a few trials, the nearest integers to the roots of any proposed numerical equation, and those being found, we may approximate to the roots continually, as in the following example:\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 4x^3 - 3x + 27 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere the greatest negative coefficient being 4, it follows, \u00a7 248, that the greatest positive root is less than 5. If \\( y \\) be substituted for \\( x \\), the equation is transformed to\n\n\\[\ny^4 + 4y^3 + 3y + 27 = 0\n\\]\n\nan equation having all its terms positive; therefore, it can have no positive roots, and consequently the proposed equation can have no negative roots; its real roots must therefore be contained between 0 and \\( +5 \\).\n\n251. To determine the limits of each root in particular, let 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, be substituted successively for \\( x \\); thus we obtain the following corresponding results.\n\n| Substitutions for \\( x \\) | Results |\n|--------------------------|---------|\n| 0                        | +27     |\n| 1                        | +21     |\n| 2                        | +5      |\n| 3                        | -9      |\n| 4                        | +15     |\n\nHence it appears that the equation has two real roots, one between 2 and 3, and another between 3 and 4.\n\n252. That we may approximate to the first root, let us suppose \\( x = 2 + y \\), where \\( y \\) is a fraction less than unity, and therefore its second, and higher powers but small in comparison to its first power; hence, in finding an approximate value of \\( y \\), they may be rejected.\n\nThus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 &= +16 + 32y, \\\\\n-4x^3 &= -32 - 48y, \\\\\n-3x &= -6 - 3y, \\\\\n+27 &= +27\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\( o = 5 - 19y \\) nearly\n\nand \\( y = \\frac{5}{19} = .26 \\), therefore, for a first approximation, we have \\( x = 2.26 \\).\n\nLet us next suppose \\( x = 2.26 + y' \\), then, rejecting as before the second and higher powers of \\( y' \\) on account of their smallness, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 &= +26.087 + 46.172y' + \\text{&c.} \\\\\n-4x^3 &= -46.172 - 61.291y' + \\text{&c.} \\\\\n-3x &= -6.780 - 3y', \\\\\n+27 &= +27\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\( o = .135 - 18.119y' \\) nearly\n\nHence \\( y' = \\frac{.135}{18.119} = .0075 \\) and \\( x = 2.26 + y' = 2.2675 \\).\n\nThis value of \\( x \\) is true to the last figure, but a more accurate value may be obtained by supposing \\( x = 2.675 + y'' \\), and finding the value of \\( y'' \\) in the same manner as we have already found those of \\( y' \\) and \\( y \\); and thus the...\nApproximation may be continued till any required degree of accuracy be obtained.\n\nThe second root of the equation, which we have already found to be between 3 and 4, may be investigated in the same manner as the first, and will appear to be 3.6797; the approximation being carried on to the fourth figure of the decimal, in determining each root.\n\n253. In the preceding example we have shown how to approximate to the roots of an affected equation, but the same method will also apply to pure equations. For example, let it be required to determine \\( x \\) from this equation \\( x^2 = 2 \\).\n\nBecause \\( x \\) is greater than 1, and less than 2, but nearer to the former number than to the latter, let us assume \\( x = 1 + y \\), then rejecting the powers of \\( y \\) which exceed the first, we have \\( x^2 = 1 + 2y \\), and therefore \\( 2 = 1 + 3y \\), and \\( y = \\frac{1}{3} \\) nearly, hence \\( x = 1.3 \\) nearly.\n\nLet us next assume \\( x = 1.3 + y' \\), then proceeding as before, we find \\( 2 = 2.197 + 5.07y' \\), hence \\( y' = -\\frac{1.197}{5.07} = -0.39 \\), and \\( x = 1.3 - 0.39 = 1.26 \\) nearly.\n\nTo find a still nearer approximation let us suppose \\( x = 1.26 + y'' \\), then from this assumption we find \\( y'' = -0.00079 \\), and therefore \\( x = 1.259921 \\), which value is true to the last figure.\n\n254. By assuming an equation of any order with literal coefficients, a general formula may be investigated, for approximating to the roots of equations belonging to that particular order.\n\nLet us take for an example the cubic equation\n\n\\[ x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0, \\]\n\nand suppose that \\( x = a + y \\), where \\( a \\) is nearly equal to \\( x \\), and \\( y \\) is a small fraction. Then, by substituting \\( a + y \\) for \\( x \\) in the proposed equation, and rejecting the powers of \\( y \\) which exceed the first, on account of their smallness, we have\n\n\\[ a^3 + pa^2 + qa + r + (3a^2 + 2pa + q)y = 0. \\]\n\nHence \\( y = -\\frac{a^3 + pa^2 + qa + r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} \\)\n\nand \\( x = a - \\frac{a^3 + pa^2 + qa + r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} = \\frac{2a^3 + pa^2 - r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} \\).\n\n255. Let it be required to approximate to a root of the cubic equation \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \\). Here \\( p = 2 \\), \\( q = 3 \\) and \\( r = -5 \\); and by trials it appears that \\( x \\) is between 2 and 3, but nearest the latter number; therefore for the first approximation \\( a \\) may be supposed = 3, hence we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2a^3 + pa^2 - r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} = \\frac{123}{42} = 2.93. \\]\n\nBy substituting \\( \\frac{6}{11} \\) for \\( a \\) in the formula, and proceeding as before, a value of \\( x \\) would be found more exact than the former, and so on we may go as far as we please.\n\n256. The method we have hitherto employed for approximating to the roots of equations is known by the name of The method of successive substitutions, and was first proposed by Newton. It has been since improved by Lagrange, who has given it a form which has the advantage of shewing the progress made in the approximation by each operation. This improved form we now proceed to explain.\n\nLet \\( a \\) denote the whole number, next less to the root sought, and \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\) a fraction, which when added to \\( a \\),\n\n\\[ x = a + \\frac{1}{y}. \\]\n\nIf this value of \\( x \\) be substituted in the proposed equation, a new equation involving \\( y \\) will be had, which, when cleared of fractions, will necessarily have a root greater than unity.\n\nLet \\( b \\) be the whole number which is next less than that root, then, for a first approximation, we have \\( x = a + \\frac{1}{b} \\). But \\( b \\) being only an approximate value of \\( y \\), in the same manner as \\( a \\) is an approximate value of \\( x \\), we may suppose \\( y = b + \\frac{1}{y'} \\), then, by substituting \\( b + \\frac{1}{y'} \\) for \\( y \\), we shall have a new equation, involving only \\( y' \\), which must be greater than unity; putting therefore \\( b' \\) to denote the next whole number less than the root of the equation involving \\( y' \\), we have \\( y = b + \\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{bb' + 1}{b'} \\),\n\nand substituting this value in that of \\( x \\) the result is\n\n\\[ x = a + \\frac{b'}{bb' + 1} \\]\n\nfor a second approximate value of \\( x \\).\n\nTo find a third value we may take \\( y' = b' + \\frac{1}{y''} \\), then if \\( b'' \\) denote the next whole number less than \\( y'' \\), we have \\( y' = b' + \\frac{1}{b''} = \\frac{bb' + b'' + 1}{b'b'' + 1} \\) and\n\n\\[ x = a + \\frac{b'b'' + 1}{bb'b'' + b'' + b} \\]\n\nand so on to obtain more accurate approximations.\n\n257. We shall apply this method to the following example\n\n\\[ x^3 - 7x + 7 = 0. \\]\n\nHere the positive roots must be between 0 and 8 let us therefore substitute successively, 0, 1, 2, . . . to 8 and we obtain results as follow:\n\n| Substitutions | Results |\n|---------------|---------|\n| 0             | +7, +1, +1, +13, +43, +97, +181, +301, +465, |\n\nbut as these results have all the same sign, nothing can be concluded respecting the magnitude of the roots from that circumstance alone. It is, however, observable, that while \\( x \\) increases from 0 to 1 the results decrease; but that whatever successive magnitudes \\( x \\) has greater than 2, the results increase; we may therefore reasonably conclude that if the equation have any positive roots they must be between 1 and 2. Accordingly by substituting 1, 2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8 successively for \\( x \\) we find these results +3.28, -0.56, -1.04, +2.32, and...\nApproximation, and as there are here two changes of the signs, it follows that the equation has two positive roots, one between 1.2 and 1.4, and another between 1.6 and 1.8.\n\nHence it appears that to find either value of \\( x \\) we may assume \\( x = 1 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), thus, by substitution, we have\n\n\\[\ny' - 4y^2 + 3y + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe limit of the positive roots of this last equation is 5, and by substituting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 successively for \\( y \\), it will be found to have two, one of which is between 1 and 2, and the other between 2 and 3. Therefore for a first approximation we have\n\n\\[\nx = 1 + \\frac{1}{y}, \\quad x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\text{that is } x = 2, \\quad x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTo approach nearer to the first value of \\( y \\), let us take\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + \\frac{1}{y}, \\quad \\text{and therefore}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' - 2y^2 - y + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis last equation will be found to have only one real root between 2 and 3, from which it appears that \\( y = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and \\( x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nLet us next suppose \\( y' = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), hence we find\n\n\\[\ny'' - 3y'^2 - 4y' - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nand from this equation \\( y'' \\) is found to be between 4 and 5. Taking the least limit we have\n\n\\[\ny' = 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}, \\quad y = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}, \\quad x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nIt is easy to continue this process by assuming \\( y' = 4 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and so on, as far as may be judged necessary.\n\nWe return to the second value of \\( x \\), which was found \\( = \\frac{3}{2} \\) by the first approximation, and which corresponds to \\( y = 2 \\). Putting \\( y = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and substituting this value in the equation \\( y' - 4y^2 + 3y + 1 = 0 \\), which was formerly found, we get\n\n\\[\ny' - 4y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nthis equation, as well as the corresponding equation employed in determining the other value of \\( x \\), has only one root greater than unity, which root being between 1 and 2, let us take \\( y' = 1 \\), we thence find\n\n\\[\ny = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nPut \\( y = 1 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and we thence find by substitution\n\n\\[\ny' - 3y'^2 - 4y' - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nan equation which gives \\( y'' \\) between 4 and 5, hence as before,\n\n\\[\ny' = 5, \\quad y = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThat we may proceed in the approximation we have only to suppose \\( y'' = 4 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and so on. The equation \\( x^3 - 7x + 7 \\) has also a negative root between -3 and -4, and to find a nearer value we may put \\( x = -3 \\), hence we have \\( y' - 2y^2 - 9y - 1 = 0 \\), and \\( y > 2 \\), \\( y < 2 \\) and therefore, for the first approximation, \\( x = -3 - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{6}{2} \\). By putting \\( y = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), &c. we may obtain successive values of \\( x \\), each of which will be more exact than that which preceded it.\n\n258. The successive equations which involve \\( y \\), \\( y' \\), \\( y'' \\), &c., have never more than one root greater than unity, unless that two or more roots of the proposed equation are contained between the limits \\( a \\) and \\( a + 1 \\), but when that circumstance has place, as in the preceding example, some one of the equations involving \\( y \\), \\( y' \\), &c. will have more than one root greater than unity, and from each root a series of equations may be derived, by which we may approximate to the particular roots of the proposed equation contained between the limits \\( a \\) and \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nSect. XVII. Of Infinite Series.\n\n259. The resolving of any proposed quantity into a series, is a problem of considerable importance in the application of algebra to the higher branches of the mathematics, and there are various methods by which it may be performed, suited to the particular forms of the quantities which may become the subject of consideration.\n\n260. Any rational fraction may be resolved into a series by the common operation of algebraic division as in the following examples:\n\nEx. 1. To change \\( \\frac{ax}{a-x} \\) into an infinite series\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(ax)ax & (x + \\frac{x^2}{a} + \\frac{x^3}{a^2} + \\frac{x^4}{a^3} + \\ldots, \\&c. \\\\\n\\frac{ax}{a-x} & x^2 + \\frac{x^3}{a} + \\frac{x^4}{a^2} + \\frac{x^5}{a^3} + \\ldots, \\&c.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus it appears, that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{a-x} = x + \\frac{x^2}{a} + \\frac{x^3}{a^2} + \\frac{x^4}{a^3} + \\ldots, \\&c.\n\\]\n\nHere the law of the series being evident, the terms may be continued at pleasure.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to convert \\( \\frac{a^2}{(a+x)^2} \\) into an infinite series\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + 2ax + x^2)^a &= \\left(1 - \\frac{2x}{a} + \\frac{3x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{4x^3}{a^3} + \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n&= a^2 + 2ax + x^2 \\\\\n&- 2ax - x^2 \\\\\n&+ 3x^2 + \\frac{2x^3}{a} \\\\\n&+ 3x^3 + \\frac{6x^4}{a^2} + \\frac{3x^4}{a^2} \\\\\n&- \\frac{4x^3}{a} - \\frac{3x^4}{a^2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{a^2}{(a+x)^2} = 1 - \\frac{2x}{a} + \\frac{3x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{4x^3}{a^3} + \\frac{5x^4}{a^4} + \\ldots\\), the law of continuation being evident.\n\n261. A second method by which algebraic quantities, whether rational or irrational, may be converted into series, and which is also of very extensive use in the higher parts of the mathematics, consists in assuming a series with indeterminate coefficients, and having its terms proceeding according to the powers of some quantity contained in the proposed expression.\n\nThat we may explain this method, let us suppose that the fraction \\(\\frac{a^2}{a^2 + ax + x^2}\\) is to be converted into a series proceeding by the powers of \\(x\\); we are therefore to allume\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{a^2 + ax + x^2} = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) denotes these terms of the series into which \\(x\\) does not at all enter; \\(Bx\\) the terms which contain only the first power of \\(x\\); \\(Cx^2\\) the terms which contain only the second power, and so on. Let both sides of the equation be multiplied by \\(a^2 + ax + x^2\\) so as to take away the denominator of the fraction, and let the numerator \\(a^2\\) be transposed to the other side, so that the whole expression may be \\(= 0\\), then\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\{a^2A + a^2B\\}x + \\{a^2C + a^2D\\}x^2 + \\{a^2E + a^2D\\}x^3 + \\ldots & = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow the quantities \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) being supposed to be entirely independent of any particular value of \\(x\\), it follows that the whole expression can only be \\(= 0\\), upon the supposition that the terms which multiply the same powers of \\(x\\) are separately \\(= 0\\); for if that were not the case, it would follow that \\(x\\) had a certain determinate relation to the quantities \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) which is contrary to what we have all along supposed. To determine the quantities \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) therefore, we have this series of equations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2A - a^2 &= 0 & \\text{Hence } A = 1 \\\\\na^2B + aA &= 0 & \\text{B} = -\\frac{1}{a} \\\\\na^2C + aB + A &= 0 & \\text{C} = -\\frac{1}{a^2} \\\\\na^2D + aC + B &= 0 & \\text{D} = -\\frac{1}{a^3} \\\\\na^2E + aD + C &= 0 & \\text{E} = -\\frac{1}{a^4} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the law of relation which takes place among the quantities \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) is evident, viz., that if \\(P, Q, R, \\ldots\\) denote any three coefficients which immediately follow each other\n\n\\[\na^2R + aQ + P = 0\n\\]\n\nand from this equation, by means of the coefficients already determined, we find \\(F = 0, G = \\frac{1}{a^2}, H = \\frac{1}{a^3}, K = 0, \\ldots\\)\n\nTherefore, resuming the assumed equation, and substituting for \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) their respective values, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{a^2 + ax + x^2} = 1 - \\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{3x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{4x^3}{a^3} + \\frac{5x^4}{a^4} - \\frac{7x^5}{a^5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n262. As a second example of the method of indeterminate coefficients, let it be required to express the square root of \\(a^2 - x^2\\) by means of a series. For this purpose we might allume\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nbut as we would find the coefficients of the odd powers of \\(x\\), each \\(= 0\\), let us rather allume\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthen, squaring both sides, and transposing, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\{A^2 + 2AB\\}x + \\{2AC + 2AD\\}x^2 + \\{2BC\\}x^3 + \\ldots \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\(A^2 - a^2 = 0\\) and \\(A = a\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2AB + 1 &= 0 & B = -\\frac{1}{2a} \\\\\n2AC + B^2 &= 0 & C = -\\frac{1}{8a^2} \\\\\nAD + BC &= 0 & D = -\\frac{1}{16a^3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand substituting for \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) their values\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = a - \\frac{x^2}{2a} + \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} - \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThis method of resolving a quantity into an infinite series will be found more expeditious than any other, as often as the operations of division and evolution are to be performed at the same time, as in these expressions \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}\\).\n\n263. The binomial theorem affords a third method of resolving quantities into series, but before we explain this method it will be proper to shew how the theorem itself may be investigated.\n\nLet \\(a + x\\) be any binomial quantity, which is to be raised\nraised to a power denoted by \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) denote any numbers either positive or negative. Or because \\( a + x = a(1 + \\frac{x}{a}) \\), if we put \\( \\frac{x}{a} = y \\), then \\( (a + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = a^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\times (1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\); therefore instead of \\( a + x \\) we may consider \\( 1 + y \\), which is somewhat more simple in its form.\n\n264. By considering some of the first powers of \\( 1 + x \\), viz.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1 + x)^1 &= 1 + x \\\\\n(1 + x)^2 &= 1 + 2x + x^2 \\\\\n(1 + x)^3 &= 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3 \\\\\n(1 + x)^4 &= 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4 \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nit appears that the powers of \\( 1 + x \\) have this form\n\n\\[\n1 + Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) are numbers which are altogether independent of any particular value of \\( x \\). It also appears that the series cannot contain any negative power of \\( x \\); for if any of its terms had this form \\( \\frac{Q}{x^n} \\), then, the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\) would render that term indefinitely great, whereas the whole series ought in that case to be reduced to unity.\n\n265. Let us therefore assume\n\n\\[\n(1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + Ay + By^2 + Cy^3 + Dy^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThen we have also\n\n\\[\n(1 + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet us put \\( (1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = u, (1 + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = v \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n(1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = u^m, (1 + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = v^m \\]\nthen, taking the difference between the two series, we have\n\n\\[\nu^m - v^m = A(y - x) + B(y^2 - x^2) + C(y^3 - x^3) + D(y^4 - x^4) + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nBut from the equation originally assumed we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{n}(1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}Ay + \\frac{m}{n}By^2 + \\frac{m}{n}Cy^3 + \\frac{m}{n}Dy^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}Ay + \\frac{m}{n}By^2 + \\frac{m}{n}Cy^3 + \\frac{m}{n}Dy^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nAnd as the coefficients of the terms have no connexion with any particular value of \\( y \\), it follows, that the coefficient of any power of \\( y \\) on the one side of the equation must be equal to the coefficient of the same power of \\( y \\) on the other side. Therefore, to determine \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) we have the following series of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}A &+ \\frac{m}{n}B + \\frac{m}{n}C + \\frac{m}{n}D + \\ldots \\\\\n&= \\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}A + \\frac{m}{n}B + \\frac{m}{n}C + \\frac{m}{n}D + \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\[ A = \\frac{m}{n} \\quad \\text{Hence } A = \\frac{m}{n} \\]\n\n\\[ 2B + A = \\frac{m}{n}A \\quad B = \\frac{A(m-1)}{2} = \\frac{A(m-n)}{2n} \\]\n\n\\[ 3C + 2B = \\frac{m}{n}B \\quad C = \\frac{B(m-2)}{3} = \\frac{B(m-2n)}{3n} \\]\n\n\\[ 4D + 3C = \\frac{m}{n}C \\quad D = \\frac{C(m-3)}{4} = \\frac{C(m-3n)}{4n} \\]\n\n\\[ 5E + 4D = \\frac{m}{n}D \\quad E = \\frac{D(m-4)}{5} = \\frac{D(m-4n)}{5n} \\]\n\n&c.\n\nOr, substituting for \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. their values as determined from the preceding equations:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{m}{n} \\]\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{m(m-n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot n^2} \\]\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot n^3} \\]\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)(m-3n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot n^4} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)(m-3n)(m-4n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot n^5} \\]\n\n&c.\n\n267. Refining now the assumed equation,\n\n\\[(1+y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + Ay + By^2 + Cy^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nAnd observing that \\( \\frac{x}{a} = y \\) and \\( (a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n}(1+y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\)\n\nwe have\n\n\\[(a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n} \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{n} \\frac{A(m-n)x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{B(m-2n)}{3n} \\right.\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{x^3}{a^3} + \\frac{C(m-3n)x^4}{4n} + \\ldots \\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. denote the coefficients of the preceding terms, or\n\n\\[(a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n} \\frac{m}{n} x + \\frac{m(m-n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot n^2} \\frac{m}{n} x^2 + \\]\n\n\\[\\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot n^3} \\frac{m}{n} x^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nand either of these formulae may be considered as a general theorem for raising a binomial quantity \\( a+x \\) to any power whatever.\n\n268. In determining the value of the expression\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} \\quad \\text{when } u = v \\]\n\nit has been taken for granted that \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) is positive, but the same conclusion will be obtained when \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) is negative. For, changing \\( +m \\) into \\( -m \\), and observing that\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{v^m - u^m}{u^m v^m} \\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} \\left( \\frac{v^m - u^m}{u^m v^m} \\right) = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} \\left( \\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^m v^m} \\right) \\]\n\nNow we have already found, that when \\( u = v \\), the fraction \\( \\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} \\) becomes \\( \\frac{mu^{m-x}}{nu^{n-x}} \\), therefore in the same case\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} \\times \\frac{mu^{m-x}}{nu^{n-x}} = \\frac{mu^{m-x}}{nu^{n-x}} \\]\n\nand from this last expression we derive the same value for \\( u^m \\) or \\( (1+y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\) as before, regard being had to the change of the sign of the exponent.\n\n269. If we suppose \\( m \\) to be a positive integer, and \\( n = 1 \\) the series given in last article for the powers of \\( a+x \\) will always terminate, as appears also from the operation of involution; but if \\( m \\) be negative, or \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) a fraction, the series will consist of an indefinite number of terms. Examples of the application of the theorem have been already given upon the first supposition, when treating of involution; we now proceed to show how it is to be applied to the expansion of algebraic quantities into series upon either of the two last hypotheses.\n\n270. Ex. 1. It is required to express \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r+z)^3} \\) by means of a series.\n\nBecause \\( \\frac{r}{r+z} = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{z}{r}} \\),\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r+z)^3} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{z}{r}\\right)^3} = \\left(1+\\frac{z}{r}\\right)^{-3} \\)\n\nLet \\( \\left(1+\\frac{z}{r}\\right)^{-3} \\) be compared with \\( (a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\) and we have\n\n\\[ a = 1, \\quad x = \\frac{z}{r}, \\quad m = -3, \\quad n = 1. \\]\n\nHence, by substituting these values of \\( a, x, m, n \\) in the first general formula of (\\$267) we have\n\n\\[\\frac{r}{(r+z)^3} = 1 - \\frac{3z}{r} + \\frac{3z^2}{r^2} - \\frac{3z^3}{r^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nEx. 2.\nEx. 2. It is required to express \\( \\sqrt{a + b} \\) by the form of a series.\n\nBecause \\( a + b = a \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\)\n\nTherefore \\( \\sqrt{a + b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b}{a}} = a^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\)\n\nBy comparing \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\) with \\( (a + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\) we have \\( a = 1, x = \\frac{b}{a}, m = 1, n = 3 \\),\n\nand substituting as in last example\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a + b} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\na^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{3a} - \\frac{1.2b^2}{36a^2} + \\frac{1.2.5b^4}{36.9a^3} - \\frac{1.2.5.8b^6}{36.9.12a^4} + \\ldots \\right) \\\\\n= a^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{3a} - \\frac{b^2}{9a^2} + \\frac{5b^4}{81a^3} - \\frac{10b^6}{243a^4} + \\ldots \\right)\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\n\nEx. 3. It is required to resolve \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\) into a series.\n\nBecause \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = r^3 \\times (r^3 + z^3)^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\), if we raise \\( r^3 + z^3 \\) to the \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\) power, and multiply the resulting series by \\( r^3 \\), we shall have the series required. Or the given quantity may be reduced to a more simple form thus;\n\nbecause \\( r^3 + z^3 = r^3 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right) \\)\n\nTherefore \\( (r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = r^3 \\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}. \\text{ Hence}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\n\\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\\\\n= 1 - \\frac{2z^3}{3r^3} + \\frac{2.5z^6}{36r^6} - \\frac{2.5.8z^9}{36.9r^9} + \\frac{2.5.8.11z^{12}}{36.9.12r^{12}} + \\ldots\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\n\nEx. 4. It is required to find a series equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} \\).\n\nFirst by the binomial theorem we have\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (a^2 + x^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = a + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^2} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = (a^2 - x^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2a^2} + \\frac{3x^4}{8a^4} + \\frac{5x^6}{16a^6} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by taking the product of the two series, and proceeding in the operation only to such terms as involve the 6th power of \\( x \\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{x^4}{2a^4} + \\frac{x^6}{2a^6} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nSect. XVIII. Of the Reversion of Series.\n\n271. The method of indeterminate coefficients, which we have already employed when treating of infinite series, may also be applied to what is called the reverting of series; that is, having any quantity expressed by an infinite series composed of the powers of another quantity, to express, on the contrary, the latter quantity by means of an infinite series composed of the powers of the former.\n\n272. Let \\( y = n + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + \\ldots \\), &c.\n\nThen to revert the series we must find the value of \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). For this purpose we shall transpose \\( n \\), and put \\( z = y - n \\), then\n\n\\[\nz = ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + \\ldots, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nNow when \\( x = 0 \\), it is evident that \\( z = 0 \\), therefore we may assume for \\( x \\) a series of this form\n\n\\[\nx = A + Bz + Cz^2 + Dz^3 + \\ldots, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) denote quantities as yet unknown, but which are entirely independent of the quantity \\( x \\). To determine those quantities let the first, second, third, &c., powers of the series\n\n\\[\nAz + Bz^2 + Cz^3 + Dz^4 + \\ldots, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\nbe found by multiplication, and substituted for \\( x, x^2, \\ldots \\), &c. respectively, in the equation\n\n\\[\n0 = -x + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-ax &= aAx + aBx^2 + aCx^3 + aDx^4 + \\ldots \\\\\n+bx^2 &= bAx^2 + 2bABx^3 + 2bACx^4 + \\ldots \\\\\n+cx^3 &= cAx^3 + 3cABx^4 + \\ldots \\\\\n+dx^4 &= dAx^4 + \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand, putting the coefficients of \\( x, x^2, x^3, \\ldots \\) each \\(=0\\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\naA &= 0 \\\\\naB + bA &= 0 \\\\\naC + 2bAB + cA &= 0 \\\\\naD + 2bAC + bB + 3cAB + dA &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthese equations give\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= \\frac{1}{a} \\\\\nB &= \\frac{-b}{a^2} \\\\\nC &= \\frac{2b^2 - ac}{a^5} \\\\\nD &= \\frac{5b^3 - 5abc + a^2d}{a^7}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nTherefore \\( x = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{b}{a^2}x^2 + \\frac{2b^2 - ac}{a^5}x^3 - \\frac{5b^3 - 5abc + a^2d}{a^7}x^4 + \\ldots \\)\n\n---\n\n273. As an example of the application of this formula, let it be required to determine \\( x \\) from the equation\n\n\\[\ny = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nIn this case we have\n\n\\[\nz = y, \\quad a = 1, \\quad b = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad c = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad d = -\\frac{1}{4}, \\quad \\ldots\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting these values, we have\n\n\\[\nx = y + \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{6} + \\frac{y^4}{24} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n---\n\n274. In the equation\n\n\\[\nay + by^2 + cy^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nin which both sides are expressed by series, and it is required to find \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), we must assume, as before,\n\n\\[\ny = Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand substitute this series and its powers for \\( y \\) and its powers in the proposed equation, afterwards, by bringing all the terms to one side, and making the coefficients of each power of \\( y \\) \\(=0\\), a series of equations will be had by which the quantities \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) may be determined.\n\n---\n\nSect. XIX. Of Logarithms and Exponential Quantities.\n\n275. All positive numbers may be considered as powers of any one given affirmative number. The powers of 2 for instance may become equal, either exactly, or nearer than by any assignable difference, to all numbers whatever, from 0 upwards. If the exponents be integers we shall have only the numbers which form the geometrical progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &c. but the intermediate numbers may be expressed, at least nearly, by means of fractional exponents. Thus the numbers from 0 to 10 may be expressed by the powers of 2 as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^0 &= 1 \\\\\n2^{1.585} &= 6 \\\\\n2^{2.897} &= 7 \\\\\n2^{3.322} &= 8 \\\\\n2^{3.710} &= 9 \\\\\n2^{3.922} &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn like manner may fractions be expressed by the powers of 2. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} &= 2^{-1} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{1.585}} &= 2^{-1.585} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{2.897}} &= 2^{-2.897} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{3.322}} &= 2^{-3.322} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{3.710}} &= 2^{-3.710} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{3.922}} &= 2^{-3.922}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere it is observable that the exponents are now negative.\n\nIn the same manner may all numbers be expressed by the powers of 10. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10^0 &= 1 \\\\\n10^{-1} &= \\frac{1}{10} \\\\\n10^{-1.585} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n10^{-2.897} &= \\frac{1}{7} \\\\\n10^{-3.322} &= \\frac{1}{8} \\\\\n10^{-3.710} &= \\frac{1}{9} \\\\\n10^{-3.922} &= \\frac{1}{10}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\n---\n\n276. Even a fraction might be taken in place of 2, or 10, in the preceding examples, and such exponents might be found as would give its powers equal to all numbers from 0 upwards. There are therefore no limitations with respect to the magnitude of the number, by the powers of which all other numbers are to be expressed, except that it must neither be equal to unity, nor negative. If it were \\(=1\\), then all its powers would also be \\(=1\\), and if it were negative, there are numbers to which none of its powers could possibly be equal.\n\n277. If therefore \\( y \\) denote any number whatever, and \\( r \\) a given number, a number \\( x \\) may be found, such, that \\( r^x = y \\), and \\( x \\), that is the exponent of \\( r \\) which gives a number equal to \\( y \\), is called the logarithm of \\( y \\).\n\n278. The given number \\( r \\), by the powers of which all other numbers are expressed, is called the radical number of the logarithms which are the indices of those powers.\n\n279. From the preceding definition of logarithms their properties are easily deduced, as follows:\n\n1. The sum of two logarithms is equal to the logarithm of their product. Let \\( y \\) and \\( y' \\) be two numbers, and \\( x \\) and \\( x' \\) their logarithms, so that \\( r^x = y \\), and \\( r^{x'} = y' \\), then \\( r^x \\times r^{x'} = y \\times y' \\), hence, from the definition, \\( x + x' \\) is the logarithm of \\( yy' \\), that is the sum of the logarithms of \\( y \\) and \\( y' \\) is the logarithm of \\( yy' \\).\n\n2. The difference of the logarithms of two numbers is equal to the logarithm of their quotient; for if\n\nOf Logarithms, &c., if \\( r^n = y \\) and \\( r^m = y' \\), then \\( \\frac{r^n}{r^m} = \\frac{y}{y'} \\) or \\( r^{n-m} = \\frac{y}{y'} \\),\n\ntherefore, by the definition, \\( x - x' \\) is the logarithm of \\( \\frac{y}{y'} \\); that is the difference of the logarithms of \\( y \\) and \\( y' \\)\n\nis the logarithm of \\( \\frac{y}{y'} \\).\n\n3. Let \\( n \\) be any number whatever; then, \\( \\log_N N^n = n \\times \\log_N N \\). For \\( N^n \\) is \\( N \\) multiplied into itself \\( n \\) times, therefore the logarithm of \\( N^n \\) is equal the logarithm of \\( N \\) added to itself \\( n \\) times, or to \\( n \\times \\log_N N \\).\n\n280. From these properties of logarithms it follows, that if we possess tables by which we can assign the logarithm corresponding to any given number, and also the number corresponding to any given logarithm, the operations of multiplication and division of numbers may be reduced to the addition and subtraction of their logarithms, and the operations of involution and evolution to the more simple operations of multiplication and division. Thus if two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are to be multiplied together, by taking the sum of their logarithms, we obtain the logarithm of their product, and, by inspecting the table, the product itself. A similar observation applies to the quotient of two numbers and also to any power or to any root of a number.\n\n281. The general properties of logarithms are independent of any particular value of the radical number, and hence there may be various systems of logarithms, according to the radical number employed in their construction. Thus if the radical number be \\( r \\), we shall have the common system of logarithms, but if it were \\( 27182818 \\) we should have the logarithms first constructed by Lord Napier, which are called hyperbolic logarithms.\n\n282. We have already observed (\\$ 277), that the relation between any number and its logarithm is expressed by the equation \\( r^n = y \\), where \\( y \\) denotes a number, \\( x \\) its logarithm, and \\( r \\) the radical number of the system, and any two of these three quantities being given, the remaining one may be found. If either \\( y \\) or \\( r \\) were the quantity required, the question would involve no difficulty; if, however, the exponent \\( x \\) were considered as the unknown quantity while \\( r \\) and \\( y \\) were supposed given, the equation to be resolved would be of a different form than any that we have hitherto considered: Equations of this form are called exponential equations, to resolve such an equation is evidently the same thing as to determine the logarithm of a given number, and this problem we shall now proceed to investigate.\n\n283. We therefore resolve the equation \\( r^n = y \\), where \\( r, x, \\) and \\( y \\) denote as before, we are to find a value of \\( x \\) in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( y \\). Let us suppose \\( r = 1 + a \\) and \\( y = 1 + v \\), then, our equation will stand thus\n\n\\[\n(1 + a)^n = 1 + v.\n\\]\n\nSo that, by raising both sides to the power \\( n \\), where \\( n \\) denotes an indefinite number, which is to disappear in the course of the investigation, we have \\( (1 + a)^n = (1 + v)^n \\), and resolving both sides of the equation into series by means of the binomial theorem,\n\n\\[\n1 + nx + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1 + nv + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} v^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} v^3 + \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, subtracting unity from both sides, and dividing by \\( n \\), we have\n\n\\[\nxa + \\frac{x(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{x(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= v + \\frac{n-1}{1 \\cdot 2} v^2 + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} v^3 + \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nand by supposing the factors which constitute the terms of each series to be actually multiplied, and the products arranged according to the powers of \\( n \\), the last equation will have this form\n\n\\[\nxa + \\left( Pn + Qn^2 + \\frac{x}{3} a^3 + \\left( P'n + Q'n^2 + Rn^3 \\right) a^4 + \\cdots \\right),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= v + \\left( pn + qn^2 + \\frac{v}{3} a^3 + \\left( p'n + q'n^2 + r'n^3 \\right) a^4 + \\cdots \\right).\n\\]\n\nHere the coefficients of the powers of \\( n \\), viz. \\( P, P', P'', \\ldots \\), \\( Q, Q', Q'', \\ldots \\), \\( R, R', R'', \\ldots \\), also \\( p, p', p'', \\ldots \\), \\( q, q', q'', \\ldots \\), \\( r, r', r'', \\ldots \\), are expressions which denote certain combinations of the powers of \\( x \\) in the first series, and certain numbers in the second; but as they are all to vanish in the course of the investigation, it is not necessary that they should be expressed in any other way than by a single letter.\n\n284. Now each side of this last equation may evidently be resolved into two parts, one of which is entirely free from the quantity \\( n \\), and the other involves that quantity, hence the same equation may also stand thus,\n\n\\[\nxa + \\frac{x}{2} a^2 + \\frac{x}{3} a^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ Pna^2 + \\left( P'n + Q'n^2 + Rn^3 \\right) a^4 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= v + \\frac{v}{2} v^2 + \\frac{v}{3} v^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ pnv^2 + \\left( p'n + q'n^2 \\right) v^3 + \\left( p'n + q'n^2 + r'n^3 \\right) v^4 + \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nThis equation must hold true, whatever be the value of \\( n \\), which is a quantity entirely arbitrary, and therefore ought to vanish from the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( v \\); hence it follows that the terms on each side of the equation, which involve \\( n \\), ought to destroy each other, and thus there will remain\nmain only the part of each side, which does not involve logarithms, &c., that is\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nor \\( (x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\ldots) \\)\n\nLet us now put \\( A \\) to denote the constant multiplier\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} - \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand substitute for \\( v \\), its value \\( y - 1 \\), thus we at last find\n\n\\[ x = \\log_y = \\frac{1}{A}(y - 1) - \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(y - 1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(y - 1)^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand by this formula the logarithm of any number a little greater than unity may be readily found.\n\n285. If \\( y \\) be nearly \\( = 2 \\) the series will, however, converge too slowly to be of use, and if it exceed \\( 2 \\), the series will diverge, and therefore cannot be directly applied to the finding of its logarithm. But a series which shall converge faster and be applicable to every case may be investigated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\log_n = \\frac{1}{A}(2z + z^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2z + z^3) + \\frac{1}{5}(2z + z^5) + \\ldots \\]\n\nBut \\( \\log_n = \\log_n + \\log_z \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\log_n = \\log_n + \\frac{1}{A}(2z + z^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2z + z^3) + \\frac{1}{5}(2z + z^5) + \\ldots \\]\n\nThis series gives the logarithm of \\( n + z \\) by means of the logarithm of \\( n \\), and converges very fast when \\( n \\) is considerable.\n\n287. It appears from the series which have been found for \\( \\log_y \\) in \u00a7 284 and 285, that the logarithm of a number is always the product of two quantities; one of these is variable, and depends upon the number itself, but the other, viz. \\( \\frac{1}{A} \\), is constant, and depends entirely on the radical number of the system. This quantity has been called by writers on logarithms the modulus of the system.\n\n288. The most simple system of logarithms in respect to facility of computation is that in which \\( \\frac{1}{A} = 1 \\) or \\( A = 1 \\). The logarithms of this system are the same as those first invented by Napier, and are also called hyperbolic logarithms.\n\nThe hyperbolic logarithm of any numbers, \\( y \\) is therefore (\\$ 284)\n\n\\[ y - 1 = \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(y - 1)^3}{3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand that of \\( r \\), the radical number of any system is\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{v^2}{2} + \\frac{v^3}{3} - \\frac{v^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nBecause \\( \\log_r(1 + v) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{v^2}{2} + \\frac{v^3}{3} - \\frac{v^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right) \\)\n\nBy substituting \\( -v \\) for \\( +v \\) we have\n\n\\[ \\log_r(1 - v) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( -\\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{v^3}{3} + \\frac{v^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\log_r(1 + v) - \\log_r(1 - v) = \\log_r \\frac{1 + v}{1 - v} \\),\n\ntherefore, subtracting the latter series from the former we have\n\n\\[ \\log_r \\frac{1 + v}{1 - v} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( 2v + \\frac{2v^3}{3} + \\frac{2v^5}{5} + \\frac{2v^7}{7} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nPut \\( \\frac{1 + v}{1 - v} = y \\), then \\( v = \\frac{y - 1}{y + 1} \\) and the last series becomes\n\n\\[ \\log_r y = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{2(y - 1)}{y + 1} + \\frac{2(y - 1)^3}{3(y + 1)^3} + \\frac{2(y - 1)^5}{5(y + 1)^5} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nThis series will always converge whatever be the value of \\( y \\), and by means of it the logarithms of small numbers may be found with great facility.\n\n286. When a number is composite, its logarithm will most easily be found, by adding together the logarithms of its factors; but if it be a prime number, its logarithm may be derived from that of some convenient composite number, either greater or less and an infinite series. Let \\( n \\) be a number of which the logarithm is already found; then substituting \\( \\frac{n + z}{n} \\) for \\( y \\) in the last formula we have\n\n\\[ \\log_n = \\frac{1}{A}(2z + z^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2z + z^3) + \\frac{1}{5}(2z + z^5) + \\ldots \\]\n\nbut this last series is the same as we have denoted by \\( A \\); hence it follows, that the modulus of any system is the reciprocal of the hyperbolic logarithm of the radical number of that system. Thus it appears, that the logarithms of numbers, according to any proposed system, may be readily found from the hyperbolic logarithm of the same numbers, and the hyperbolic logarithm of the radical number of that system.\n\n289. Let \\( L \\) denote the hyp. log. of any number, and \\( l, l' \\) the logarithms of the same number according to two other systems whose moduli are \\( m \\) and \\( m' \\); then\n\n\\[ l = mL, \\quad l' = m'L \\]\n\ntherefore \\( \\frac{l}{m} = \\frac{l'}{m'} \\) and \\( m : m' :: l : l' \\)\n\nThat is, the logarithms of the same number, according to different systems, are directly proportional to the moduli of those systems, and therefore have a given ratio to one another.\n\n290. We shall now apply the series here investigated to the calculation of the hyperbolic logarithm of 10, the reciprocal of which is the modulus of the common system.\nOf Logarithms; and also to the calculation of logarithms, &c.\n\nThe hyp. log. of 10 may be obtained by substituting 10 for \\( y \\) in the formula\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } y = \\frac{2(y-1)}{y+1} + \\frac{2(y-1)^3}{3(y+1)} + \\frac{2(y-1)^5}{5(y+1)} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nbut the resulting series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^9}{11} + \\frac{2^9}{3 \\cdot 11^3} + \\frac{2^9}{5 \\cdot 11^5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nconverges too slowly to be of any practical utility, it will therefore be better to derive the logarithm of 10 from those of 2 and 5. By substituting 2 in the formula we have\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } 2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^5} + \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 3^7} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthis series converges very fast, so that by reducing its terms to decimal fractions, and taking the sum of the first seven terms we find the hyp. log. of 2 to be 0.6931472.\n\nThe hyp. log. of 5 may be found in the same manner, but more easily from the formula given in \u00a7 286. For the log. of 2 being given, that of 4 = 2\u00b2 is also given \u00a7 279. Therefore, substituting log. 4 = 2 log. 2 for log. n, and 1 for \\( x \\), in the series\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } (n+x) = \\text{hyp. log. } n + 2 \\left( \\frac{x}{2n+x} + \\frac{x^3}{7(2n+x)^3} + \\ldots \\right)\n\\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } 5 = \\text{hyp. log. } 2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{3^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^5} + \\ldots \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe first three terms of this series are sufficient to give the result true to the seventh decimal, so that we have hyp. log. 5 = 1.6931479, and\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } 10 = \\text{hyp. log. } 2 + \\text{hyp. log. } 5 = 2.3025851.\n\\]\n\nHence the modulus of the common system of logarithms, or\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\text{hyp. log. } 10}\n\\]\n\nis found = 0.4342945. The same number, because of its great utility in the construction of tables of logarithms, has been calculated to a much greater number of decimals. A celebrated calculator of the last century, Mr. A. Sharp, found it to be\n\n\\[\n0.434294481902351827651128918916605082294397005803666566114454.\n\\]\n\nHaving found the hyp. log. of 2 to be 0.6931472 the common logarithm of 2 is had immediately, by multiplying the hyp. log. of 2 by the modulus of the system, thus we find\n\n\\[\n\\text{com. log. } 2 = 0.4342945 \\times 0.6931472 = 0.3010300.\n\\]\n\n291. We have already observed \u00a7 282, that to determine the logarithm of a given number, is the same problem as to determine the value of \\( x \\) in an equation of this form \\( a^x = b \\), where the unknown quantity is an exponent. But in order to resolve such an equation, it is not necessary to have recourse to series; for a table of logarithms being once supposed constructed, the value of \\( x \\) may be determined thus. It appears from \u00a7 279, that \\( x \\times \\log. a = \\log. b \\). Hence it follows,\n\nVol. I. Part II.\n\nthat \\( x = \\frac{\\log. b}{\\log. a} \\). The use of this formula will appear in next section which treats of computations relative to annuities.\n\n292. The theory of logarithms requires the solution of this other problem. Having given the radical number of a system, and a logarithm, to determine the corresponding number. Or having given the equation \\( r^n = y \\), where \\( r \\), \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote as in \u00a7 282, to find a series which shall express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( x \\).\n\n293. For this purpose, let us suppose \\( r = 1 + a \\), then our equation becomes \\( y = (1 + a)^x \\), which, may also be expressed thus:\n\n\\[\ny = [(1 + a)^x]^n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an indefinite quantity, which is to disappear in the course of the investigation.\n\nBy the binomial theorem we have\n\n\\[\n(1 + a)^n = 1 + na + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthis equation, by multiplying together the factors which compose the terms of the series, and arranging the results according to the powers of \\( n \\), may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[\n(1 + a)^n = 1 + An + Bn^2 + Cn^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere it will readily appear that\n\n\\[\nA = a - \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} - \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nas to the values of \\( B \\), \\( C \\), &c., it is of no importance to know them, for they will all disappear in the course of the investigation. Hence, by substituting for \\( (1 + a)^n \\) its value, as expressed by the last series, we have\n\n\\[\ny = (1 + An + Bn^2 + Cn^3 + \\ldots)^n\n\\]\n\nand expanding the latter part of this equation by means of the binomial theorem it becomes\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + \\frac{x}{n}(An + Bn^2 + \\ldots) + \\frac{x(x-n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot n^2}(An + Bn^2 + \\ldots)^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nBut \\( An + Bn^2 + \\ldots = n(A + Bn + \\ldots) \\) also \\( (An + Bn^2 + \\ldots)^2 = n^2(A + Bn + \\ldots)^2 \\), and \\( (An + Bn^2 + \\ldots)^3 = n^3(A + Bn + \\ldots)^3 \\), &c., therefore, by leaving out of each term of the series the powers of \\( n \\) which are common to the numerator and denominator, the equation will stand thus\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + x(A + Bn + \\ldots) + \\frac{x(x-n)}{1 \\cdot 2}(A + Bn + \\ldots)^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nNow \\( n \\) is here an arbitrary quantity, and ought, from the nature of the original equation, to disappear from the value of \\( y \\); the terms of the equation which are multiplied\nInterest and multiplied by \\( n \\) ought therefore to destroy each other; and this being the case, the equation is reduced to\n\n\\[\nr^n = y = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2 A}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^3 A^2}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{x^4 A^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand since we have found\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} + \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (r-1)^2 + \\frac{(r-1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(r-1)^4}{4}\n\\]\n\nIt is evident from \u00a7 288 that \\( A \\) is the hyperbolic logarithm of the radical number of the system.\n\n294. If in the equation \\( r^n = y \\) we suppose \\( x = 1 \\), the value of \\( y \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nr = 1 + \\frac{A}{1} + \\frac{A^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{A^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nHere the radical number is expressed by means of its hyperbolic logarithm. Again, if we suppose \\( x = \\frac{1}{A} \\), then\n\n\\[\nr^{\\frac{1}{A}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThus it appears that the quantity \\( r^{\\frac{1}{A}} \\) is equal to a constant number, which, by taking the sum of a sufficient number of terms of the series, will be found \\( = 2.718281828459045 \\ldots \\). Let us denote this number by \\( e \\), then \\( r^{\\frac{1}{A}} = e \\), and hence \\( r = e^A \\). Now if we remark that \\( A \\) is the hyp. log. of \\( r \\) it must be evident (\\$ 277 and 278) that \\( e \\) is the radical number of the hyperbolic system of logarithms.\n\nAgain, since \\( r^{\\frac{1}{A}} = e \\), therefore \\( \\frac{1}{A} \\times \\log_r r = \\log_e e \\)\n\nand \\( A = \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\), here \\( \\log_r r \\) and \\( \\log_e e \\) denote logarithms taken according to any system whatever.\n\n295. If we now resume the equation,\n\n\\[\nr^n = y = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2 A}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^3 A^2}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand substitute for \\( A \\) its value \\( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\) we shall have the following general expression for any exponential quantity whatever\n\n\\[\nr^n = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} \\left( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\right) + \\frac{x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} \\left( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\right)^2 + \\frac{x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\left( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\right)^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich by supposing \\( r = e \\) becomes\n\n\\[\ne^n = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nSect. XX. Of Interest and Annuities.\n\n296 The theory of logarithms finds its application in some measure to calculations relating to interest and annuities; these we now proceed to explain. There are two hypotheses, according to either of which money put out at interest may be supposed to be improved. We may suppose that the interest, which is always proportional to the sum lent, or principal, is also proportional to the time during which the principal is employed; and on this hypothesis the money is said to be improved at simple interest. Or we may suppose that the interest, which ought to be paid to the lender at successive stated periods, is added to the principal instead of being actually paid, and thus their amount converted into a new principal; when money is laid out according to this second hypothesis, it is said to be improved at compound interest.\n\n297. In calculations relating to interest, the things to be considered are the principal, or sum lent; the rate of interest, or sum paid for the use of 100l. for one year; the time during which the principal is lent; and the amount, or sum of the principal and interest at the end of that time.\n\nLet \\( p \\) denote the principal, 1l. being the unit.\n\n\\( r \\) the interest of 1l. for one year, at the given rate.\n\n\\( t \\) the time, one year being the unit.\n\n\\( a \\) the amount.\n\nWe shall now examine the relations which subsist between those quantities, according to each of the two hypotheses of simple and compound interest.\n\nI. Simple Interest.\n\n298. Because the interest of 1l. for one year is \\( r \\), the interest of 1l. for \\( t \\) years must be \\( rt \\), and the interest of \\( p \\) pounds for the same time \\( prt \\), hence we have this formula\n\n\\[\np + prt = a\n\\]\n\nfrom which we find\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{a}{1 + rt}, \\quad r = \\frac{a - p}{pt}, \\quad t = \\frac{a - p}{pr}\n\\]\n\nAs the manner of applying these formulae to questions relating to simple interest is sufficiently obvious, we proceed to consider compound interest.\n\nII. Compound Interest.\n\n299. In addition to the symbols already assumed, let \\( R = 1 + rt \\) amount of 1l. in one year, then, from the nature of compound interest, \\( R \\) is also the principal at the beginning of the second year. Now, interest being always proportional to the principal we have\n\n\\[\n1 : r : : R : rR = \\text{the interest of } R \\text{ for a year},\n\\]\n\nand \\( R + rR = (1 + r)R = R^2 = \\text{amount of } R \\text{ in a year}, \\)\n\ntherefore \\( R^2 \\) is the amount of 1l. in two years, which sum being assumed as a new principal, we find, as before, its interest for a year to be \\( rR^2 \\), and its amount \\( R^2 + rR^2 = (1 + r)R^2 = R^3 \\); so that \\( R^3 \\) is the amount of 1l. in three years. Proceeding in this manner we find in general that the amount of 1l. in \\( t \\) years is \\( R^t \\), and of \\( p \\) pounds \\( pR^t \\), hence we have this formula\n\n\\[\npR^t = a\n\\]\nAnnuities, which from the nature of logarithms may also be expressed thus:\n\n\\[ \\log_p + t \\times \\log_R = \\log_a \\]\n\nHence we find\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{a}{R^t} \\quad R = t \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{p}} \\]\n\nor, by logarithms,\n\n\\[ \\log_p = \\log_a - t \\times \\log_R \\quad \\log_R = \\frac{\\log_a - \\log_p}{t} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\log_a - \\log_p}{\\log_R} \\]\n\n300. As an example of the use of these formulas, let it be required to determine what sum improved at 5 per cent. compound interest will amount to \u00a3500 in 42 years. In this case we have given \\( a = 500 \\), \\( r = 0.05 \\), \\( R = 1.05 \\), \\( t = 42 \\), to find \\( p \\).\n\nFrom\n\n\\[ \\log_p = \\log_a - \\log_R = 2.6989700 \\]\nsubtract\n\\[ t \\times \\log_R = 42 \\times \\log_1.05 = 0.8899506 \\]\n\nremains \\( \\log_p = 1.8090194 \\)\n\ntherefore \\( p = 64.421 = 64l. 8s. 5d. \\) the sum required.\n\nEx. 2. In what time will a sum laid out at 4 per cent. compound interest be doubled.\n\nLet any sum be expressed by unity, then we have given \\( p = 1 \\), \\( r = 0.04 \\), \\( R = 1.04 \\), \\( a = 2 \\), to find \\( t \\).\n\nFrom the formula\n\n\\[ \\log_p = \\log_a - \\log_R = \\log_2 \\]\n\\[ \\log_R = \\log_1.04 \\]\n\nwe find \\( t = \\frac{3010300}{0170333} = 17.7 \\) years nearly.\n\n301. In treating of compound interest we have supposed the interest to be joined to the principal at the end of every year. But we might have supposed it to be added at the end of every half year or every quarter, or even every instant, and suitable rules might have been found for performing calculations according to each hypothesis. As such suppositions are, however, never made in actual business, we shall not at present pay any thing more of them.\n\nIII. Annuities.\n\n302. An annuity is a payment made annually for a term of years, and the chief problem relating to it is to determine its present worth, that is the sum a person ought to pay immediately to another, upon condition of receiving from the latter a certain sum annually for a given time. In resolving this problem, it is supposed that the buyer improves his annuity from the time he receives it, and the seller the purchase money in a certain manner during the continuance of the annuity, so that at the end of the time, the amount of each may be the same. There may be various suppositions as to the way in which the annuity and its purchase money may be improved; but the only one commonly applied to practice is the highest improvement possible of both, viz. by compound interest. As the taking compound interest is, however, prohibited by law, the realizing of this supposed improvement requires punctual payment of interest, and therefore the interest in such calculations is usually made low.\n\n303. Let \\( A \\) denote the annuity;\n\\( P \\) the present worth, or purchase money;\n\\( t \\) the time of its continuance;\nlet \\( r \\) and \\( R \\) denote as before.\n\nThe seller, by improving the price \\( P \\) at compound interest during the time \\( t \\), has \\( PR^t \\).\n\nThe purchaser is supposed to receive the first annuity \\( A \\) at the end of one year, which being improved for \\( t-1 \\) years amounts to \\( AR^{t-1} \\). He receives the second year's annuity at the end of the second year, which being improved for \\( t-2 \\) years amounts to \\( AR^{t-2} \\). In like manner the third year's annuity becomes \\( AR^{t-3} \\), and so on to the last year's annuity, which is simply \\( A \\). Therefore, the whole amount of the improved annuities is the geometrical series.\n\n\\[ A + AR + AR^2 + AR^3 + \\ldots + AR^{t-1} \\]\n\nthe sum of which, by \u00a7 106, is \\( A \\frac{R^t - 1}{R - 1} = A \\frac{R^t - 1}{r} \\),\n\nand since this sum must be equal to the amount of the purchase money, or \\( PR^t \\), we have\n\n\\[ PR^t = A \\frac{R^t - 1}{r} \\]\n\nand from this equation, we find\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\quad A = \\frac{PR^t}{R^t - 1} = \\frac{\\log A - \\log (A - rP)}{\\log R} \\]\n\nAs to \\( r \\), it can only be found by the resolution of an equation of the \\( t \\) order.\n\n304. To find the present value of an annuity in reversion, that is an annuity which is to commence at the end of \\( n \\) years, and continue during \\( t \\) years; first find its value for \\( n+t \\) years, and then for \\( n \\) years, and subtract the latter from the former. We thus obtain the following formula\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{rR^n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\]\n\n305. If the annuity is to commence immediately, and to continue for ever, then, because in this case \\( R^t \\) is infinitely great, and therefore \\( \\frac{1}{R^t} = 0 \\), the formula\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{r} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\]\n\nbecomes simply \\( P = \\frac{A}{r} \\).\n\nAnd if the annuity is to commence after \\( n \\) years and continue for ever, the formula\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{rR^n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\]\n\nbecomes \\( P = \\frac{A}{rR^n} \\).\n\nSect. XXI. Of continued Fractions.\n\n306. Every quantity which admits of being expressed by a common fraction may also be expressed in\nthe form of what is called a continued fraction. The nature of such fractions will be easily understood by the following example.\n\nLet the common fraction be $\\frac{314159}{100000}$, or which is the same $3 + \\frac{14159}{10000}$. Since $10000 = 7 \\times 14159 + 887$, therefore $\\frac{14159}{10000} = \\frac{14159}{7 \\times 14159 + 887} = \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{887}{14159}}$ and\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{887}{14159}}.$$  \n\nNow $\\frac{887}{14159} = \\frac{887}{15 \\times 887 + 854} = \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{854}{887}}$, and substituting this for $\\frac{887}{15159}$ in the value of $\\frac{314159}{100000}$ already found we have\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{854}{887}}}.$$  \n\nAgain, $\\frac{854}{887} = \\frac{854}{854 + 33} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{33}{854}}$, which being substituted as before, gives\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{1}{25 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{4}}}}}.$$  \n\nBy operations similar to the preceding we find\n\n$$\\frac{33}{854} = \\frac{1}{25 + \\frac{29}{33}}, \\quad \\frac{29}{33} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4}{29}}, \\quad \\frac{4}{29} = \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{4}},$$  \n\ntherefore, by substitution\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{1}{25 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{4}}}}}.$$  \n\nBy an operation, in all respects the same as has been just now performed may any fraction whatever be reduced to the form\n\n$$a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d + \\ldots}}},$$  \n\nand it is then called a continued fraction.\n\n307. It is easy to see in what manner the inverse of the preceding operation is to be performed, or a continued fraction reduced to a common fraction.\n\nThus if the continued fraction be\n\n$$a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d + \\ldots}}},$$  \n\nit will evidently be reduced to a common fraction by adding the reciprocal of $d$ to $b$, and the reciprocal of that sum to $b$, and again the reciprocal of this last sum to $a$; now the reciprocal of $d$, or $\\frac{1}{d}$ added to $c$ is $c + \\frac{1}{d} = \\frac{cd + 1}{d}$, again the reciprocal of this sum, or $\\frac{d}{cd + 1}$, added to $b$ is $b + \\frac{d}{cd + 1} = \\frac{bcd + b + d}{cd + 1}$, and the reciprocal of this last quantity, viz. $\\frac{cd + 1}{bcd + b + d}$ when added to $a$ gives\n\n$$\\frac{abcd + ab + ad + cd + 1}{bcd + b + d} = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d}}}.$$  \n\n308. This manner of expressing a fraction enables us to find a series of other fractions, that approach in value to any given one, and each of them expressed in the smallest numbers possible. Thus in the example $\\frac{314159}{100000}$ which has been resolved into a continued fraction, \u00a7 306, and which is known to express nearly the proportion of the diameter of a circle to its circumference; if we take only the first two terms of the continued fraction, and put $\\pi$ for $\\frac{314159}{100000}$, we shall have\n\n$$\\pi = 3 + \\frac{1}{7} = 3.\\overline{142857}$$  \n\nnearly, and this is the proportion which was found by Archimedes.\n\nAgain by taking the first three terms we have\n\n$$\\pi = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{106} = 3.\\overline{142857}$$  \n\nwhich is nearer the truth than the former.\n\nAnd by taking the first four terms we have\n\n$$\\pi = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{1}{13}}} = 3.\\overline{142857}$$  \n\nwhich is the proportion assigned by Metius, and is more exact than either of the preceding. These results are alternately greater and less than the truth.\n\n309. Among continued fractions, those have been particularly distinguished in which the denominators, after a certain number of changes, are continually repeated in the same order. Such for example is the fraction\n\n$$1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\ldots}}}},$$  \n\nThe amount of this fraction, though continued ad infinitum, may be easily found; for leaving out the first term, which is an integer, let us suppose\n\n$$x = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\ldots}}}},$$  \n\nThen since after the second, all the terms return in the\nContinued the same order, it follows that their amount is also \\( x \\), thus we have\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3 + x}\n\\]\n\nHence \\( x = \\frac{3 + x}{6 + 2x + 1} \\) and \\( x^2 + 3x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{15}}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore \\( x + 1 \\), or the sum of the series, \\( = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{15}}{2} \\)\n\nIn general if \\( x = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\ldots \\), &c.\n\nwe find \\( x = \\frac{b}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{b}{a}} \\). Though the denominators did not return in the same order till after a greater interval, the value of the fraction would still be expressed by the root of a quadratic equation. And conversely, the roots of all quadratic equations may be expressed by periodical continued fractions, and may often by that means be very readily approximated in numbers, without the trouble of extracting the square root.\n\n310. The reduction of a decimal into the form of a continued fraction sometimes renders the law of its continuation evident. Thus we know that \\( \\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356 \\ldots \\) but from the bare inspection of this decimal we discover no rule for its further continuation. If, however, it be reduced into a continued fraction, it becomes\n\n\\[\n= 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\ldots}} , \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nand hence we see it what way it may be continued to any degree of accuracy.\n\n311. When the root of any equation is found by the method explained in \u00a7 256, the value of the unknown quantity is evidently expressed by a continued fraction.\n\nFor if \\( x \\) be the root sought, we have \\( x = a + \\frac{1}{y}, y = b + \\frac{1}{y'}, y' = b' + \\frac{1}{y''}, y'' = b'' + \\frac{1}{y'''}, \\ldots \\), where \\( a, b', b'', \\ldots \\) denote the whole numbers, which are next less than the true values of \\( x, y, y', y'' \\), &c. If therefore in the value of \\( x \\) we substitute \\( b + \\frac{1}{y'} \\), for \\( y \\), it becomes\n\n\\[\nx = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{y'}}\n\\]\n\nAgain, if in this second value of \\( x \\) we substitute \\( b' + \\frac{1}{y''} \\) for \\( y \\) it becomes\n\n\\[\nx = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{b' + \\frac{1}{y''}}}\n\\]\n\nThe next value of \\( x \\) is in like manner found to be\n\n\\[\nx = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{b' + \\frac{1}{b'' + \\frac{1}{y'''}}}}\n\\]\n\nand so on continually.\n\nSect. XXII. Of Indeterminate Problems.\n\n312. When the conditions of a question are such that the number of equations exceeds the number of unknown quantities, that question will admit of innumerable solutions, and is therefore said to be indeterminate. Thus, if it be required to find two numbers subject to no other limitation than that their sum be 12, we have two unknown quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and only one equation, viz. \\( x + y = 12 \\), which may evidently be satisfied by innumerable different values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), if fractional solutions be admitted. It is, however, usual in such questions as this, to restrict the values of the numbers sought to positive integers, and therefore, in this case, we can have only these nine solutions;\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\\\\ny &= 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhich indeed may be reduced to five, for the first four become the same as the last four, by simply changing \\( x \\) into \\( y \\), and the contrary.\n\n313. Indeterminate problems are of different orders according to the dimensions of the equation which is obtained after all the unknown quantities, but two have been exterminated by means of the given equations. Those of the first order lead always to equations of this form,\n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a, b, c \\) denote given whole numbers, and \\( x, y \\) two numbers to be found, so that both may be integers. That this condition may be fulfilled, it is necessary that the coefficients \\( a, b \\) have no common divisor which is not also a divisor of \\( c \\); for if \\( a = md \\) and \\( b = me \\), then \\( ax + by = mdx + mey = c \\), and \\( dx + ey = \\frac{c}{m} \\); but \\( d, e, x, y \\) are supposed to be whole numbers, therefore \\( \\frac{c}{m} \\) is a whole number, hence \\( m \\) must be a divisor of \\( c \\).\n\n314. We proceed to illustrate the manner of resolving indeterminate equations of the first order by some numerical examples.\n\nEx. 1. Given \\( 2x + 3y = 25 \\), to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in whole positive numbers.\n\nFrom the given equation we have \\( x = \\frac{25 - 3y}{2} = 12 - y + \\frac{1 - y}{2} \\); now since \\( x \\) must be a whole number it follows that \\( \\frac{1 - y}{2} \\) must be a whole number. Let us assume \\( \\frac{1 - y}{2} = z \\), then \\( 1 - y = 2z \\) and \\( y = 1 - 2z \\), and since \\( x = 12 - y + \\frac{1 - y}{2} = 12 - y + z \\), therefore \\( x = 12 - 1 + 2z + z \\); hence we have\n\n\\[\nx = 11 + 3z, \\quad y = 1 - 2z\n\\]\nwhere \\( z \\) might be any whole number whatever, if there were no limitation as to the signs of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\); but since these quantities are required to be positive, it is evident from the value of \\( y \\), that \\( z \\) must either be 0 or negative, and from the value of \\( x \\) that, abstracting from the sign, it must be less than 4; hence \\( z \\) may have these three values 0, -1, -2, -3.\n\nIf \\( z = 0 \\), \\( z = -1 \\), \\( z = -2 \\), \\( z = -3 \\).\n\nThen \\( \\{x = 11, y = 8, z = 5, y = 2\\} \\)\n\n\\( \\{y = 1, y = 3, y = 5, y = 7\\} \\)\n\nEx. 2. It is required to divide 100 into such parts that the one may be divisible by 7 and the other by 11.\n\nLet 7 \\( x \\) be the first part, and 11 \\( y \\) the second, then by the question \\( 7x + 11y = 100 \\), and\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{100 - 11y}{7} = 14 - y + \\frac{2 - 4y}{7}; \\]\n\nhence it appears that \\( \\frac{2 - 4y}{7} \\) must be a whole number. Let us assume \\( \\frac{2 - 4y}{7} = z \\), then \\( s = 14 - y + z \\) and\n\n\\[ 4y = 2 - 7z \\text{ or } y = \\frac{2 - 7z}{4} = \\frac{2 - 3z}{4} - z, \\text{ therefore } \\frac{2 - 3z}{4} \\]\n\nmust be a whole number. Assume \\( \\frac{2 - 3z}{4} = t \\), then \\( y = t - z \\), and \\( 3z = 2 - 4t \\), or \\( z = \\frac{2 - 4t}{3} = \\frac{2 - t}{3} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{2 - t}{3} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nAssume now \\( \\frac{2 - t}{3} = v \\), then \\( z = v - t \\) and \\( t = 2 - 3v \\), here it is evident \\( v \\) may be any whole number taken at pleasure, so that to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) we have the following series of equations:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 - 3v}{3} \\]\n\\[ z = v - t = 4v - 2 \\]\n\\[ y = t - z = 4 - 7v \\]\n\\[ w = 14 - y + z = 11v + 8. \\]\n\nNow from the value of \\( y \\) it appears, that \\( v \\) must either be 0, or negative; but from the value of \\( x \\) we find that \\( v \\) cannot be a negative whole number, therefore \\( v \\) can only be 0; hence the only values which \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can have in whole numbers are \\( x = 8, y = 4 \\).\n\nEx. 3. It is required to find all the possible ways in which 60l. can be paid in guineas and moidores only.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of guineas and \\( y \\) the number of moidores. Then the value of the guineas, expressed in shillings, is 21x, and that of the moidores 27y, therefore from the nature of the question 21x + 27y = 1200, or, dividing the equation by 3, 7x + 9y = 400, hence \\( x = \\frac{400 - 9y}{7} = 57 - y + \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} \\), so that \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nAssume \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} = x \\), then \\( x = 57 - y + z \\) and \\( 2y = 1 \\)\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nAssume \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} = v \\), then \\( y = v - 3z \\) and \\( z = 1 - 2v \\)\n\ntherefore \\( v \\) may be taken any whole number at pleasure, and \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may be determined by the following equations\n\n\\[ x = 1 - 2v \\]\n\\[ y = v - 3z = 7v - 3 \\]\n\\[ x = 57 - y + z = 61 - 9v \\]\n\nFrom the value of \\( x \\), it appears that \\( v \\) cannot exceed 6, and from the value of \\( y \\), that it cannot be less than 1.\n\nHence if \\( v = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\),\n\nwe have \\( x = 52, 43, 34, 25, 16, 7 \\)\n\\( y = 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39 \\).\n\n315. In the foregoing examples the unknown quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) have each a determinate number of positive values, and this will evidently be the case as often as the proposed equation is of this form \\( ax + by = c \\). If, however, \\( b \\) be negative, that is, if the equation be of this form \\( ax - by = c \\), or \\( ax = by + c \\), we shall have questions of a different kind, admitting each of an infinite number of solutions, these, however, are to be resolved in the same manner as the preceding, as will appear from the following example.\n\nEx. 4. A person buys some horses and oxen, he pays 31 crowns for each horse, and 20 crowns for each ox, and he finds that the oxen cost him seven crowns more than the horses. How many did he buy of each?\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of horses, and \\( y \\) that of the oxen, then by the question\n\n\\[ 20x = 31y + 7, \\text{ and } x = \\frac{31y + 7}{20} = y + \\frac{11y + 7}{20}. \\]\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{11y + 7}{20} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{11y + 7}{20} = v \\), then \\( x = y + v \\) and \\( y = \\frac{20v - 7}{11} = v + \\frac{9v - 7}{11} \\); hence \\( \\frac{9v - 7}{11} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{9v - 7}{11} = t \\), then \\( y = v + t \\) and \\( v = \\frac{11t + 7}{9} + \\frac{2t + 7}{9} \\); therefore \\( \\frac{2t + 7}{9} \\) is a whole number.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{2t + 7}{9} = s \\), then \\( v = s + r \\) and \\( t = \\frac{9s - 7}{2} = 4s + \\frac{s - 7}{2} \\); therefore \\( \\frac{s - 7}{2} \\) is a whole number.\n\nPut \\( \\frac{s - 7}{2} = r \\), then \\( t = 4s + r \\) and \\( s = 2r + 7 \\).\n\nHaving now no longer any fractions, we return to the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) by the following series of equations\nThe least positive values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) will evidently be obtained by making \\( r = -3 \\), and innumerable other values will be had by putting \\( r = -2, r = -1, r = 0, r = +1, \\) &c. Thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 5, 36, 67, 98, 129, 160, 191, 222, \\text{&c.} \\\\\ny &= 3, 23, 43, 63, 83, 103, 123, 143, \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\neach series forming an arithmetical progression, the common difference in the first being 31 and in the second 20.\n\n316. If we consider the manner in which the numbers \\( x, y \\), in this example, are determined, from the succeeding quantities \\( v, t, \\) &c., we shall immediately perceive that the coefficients of those quantities are the same as the successive quotients which arise in the arithmetical operation for finding the greatest common measure of 20 and 31, the coefficients of the given equation \\( 20x = 31y + 7 \\). The operation performed at length will stand thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n20 & 31 & (1) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n11 & 20 & (1) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n9 & 11 & (1) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n2 & 9 & (4) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n1 & 2 & (2) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHence we may form a series of numeral equations which, when compared with the series of literal equations expressing the relations between \\( x, y, v, \\) &c., as put down in the following table, will render the method of determining the latter from the former sufficiently obvious\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n31 &= 1 \\times 20 + 11 \\\\\n20 &= 1 \\times 11 + 9 \\\\\n11 &= 1 \\times 9 + 2 \\\\\n9 &= 4 \\times 2 + 1 \\\\\n2 &= 2 \\times 1 + 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd as every question of this kind may be analyzed in the same manner, we may hence form the following general rule for resolving indeterminate problems of the first order.\n\n317. Let \\( bx = ay + n \\) be the proposed equation in which \\( a, b, n \\) are given integers, and \\( x, y \\) numbers to be found. Let \\( a \\) be the greatest of the two numbers \\( a, b \\), and let \\( A \\) denote the greatest multiple of \\( b \\) which is contained in \\( a \\), and \\( c \\); the remainder also let \\( B \\) denote the greatest multiple of \\( c \\) contained in \\( b \\), and \\( d \\) the remainder; and \\( C \\) the greatest multiple of \\( d \\) contained in \\( c \\), and \\( e \\) the remainder; and so on, till one of the remainders be found equal to \\( c \\). The numbers \\( A, B, C \\) afford a series of equations from which another series may be derived as in the following table.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= Ab + c \\\\\nb &= Bc + d \\\\\nc &= Cd + e \\\\\nd &= De + f \\\\\ne &= Ef + g \\\\\nf &= Fg + o \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand in the last equation of the second series any number whatever may be put for \\( q \\), it is also to be observed that the given number \\( n \\) is to have the sign \\( + \\) prefixed to it, if the number of equations be odd, but \\( - \\) if that number be even. Having formed the second series of equations, the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may be thence found as in the foregoing examples. We proceed to show the application of the rule.\n\nEx. 5. Required a number which being divided by 11 leaves the remainder 3, but being divided by 19 leaves the remainder 5.\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the number, and \\( x, y \\) the quotients which arise from the respective divisions, then we have \\( N = 11x + 3 \\), also \\( N = 19y + 5 \\), hence \\( 11x + 3 = 19y + 5 \\) and \\( 11x = 19y + 2 \\), an equation which furnishes the following table.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n19 &= 1 \\times 11 + 8 \\\\\n11 &= 1 \\times 8 + 3 \\\\\n8 &= 2 \\times 3 + 2 \\\\\n3 &= 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\\\\n2 &= 2 \\times 1 + 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( r \\) may be assumed of any value whatever,\n\nHence we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns &= 2r + 2 \\\\\nt &= s + r = 3r + 2 \\\\\nv &= 2t + s = 8r + 6 \\\\\ny &= v + t = 11r + 8 \\\\\nx &= y + v = 19r + 14 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand the number required \\( N = 209u + 157 \\) where it is evident that the least number which can express \\( N \\) is 157.\n\nEx. 6. \\[ \\begin{cases} 3x + 5y + 7z = 560 \\\\ 9x + 25y + 49z = 2920 \\end{cases} \\] To determine \\( x, y, z \\)\n\nGiven \\[ \\begin{cases} 9x + 25y + 49z = 2920 \\end{cases} \\] in whole numbers.\n\nFrom 7 times the first equation subtract the second; thus we have \\( 12x + 10y = 1000 \\), or \\( 6x + 5y = 500 \\) and from this last equation by proceeding as in the foregoing examples we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 500 - 5v \\\\\ny &= 6v - 500\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be substituted in either of the original equations; in the first, for example, as being the most simple, and we find \\( 7x + 15z = 1560 \\).\n\nThis last equation being resolved in the same manner we find\nand hence it appears that the only values which \\( t \\) can have so as to give whole positive numbers for \\( x, y, z \\) are 209 and 210, thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 15 \\\\\ny &= 82 \\\\\nz &= 15 \\\\\n\\text{or} \\quad x &= 50 \\\\\ny &= 40 \\\\\nz &= 30.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n318. If an equation was proposed involving three unknown quantities, as \\( ax + by + cz = d \\), by transposition we have \\( ax + by - d = cz \\) and, putting \\( d - cz = e' \\), \\( ax + by = e' \\). From this last equation we may find values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) of this form\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= mr + nc', \\\\\ny &= m'r + n'c,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nor \\( x = mr + n(d - cz) \\), \\( y = m'r + n(d - cz) \\)\n\nwhere \\( z \\) and \\( r \\) may be taken at pleasure, except in so far as the values of \\( x, y, z \\) may be required to be all positive, for from such restriction the values of \\( z \\) and \\( r \\) may be confined within certain limits to be determined from the given equation.\n\n319. We proceed to indeterminate problems of the second degree. These produce equations of the three following forms,\n\nI. \\( y = \\frac{a}{b + cx} \\), II. \\( y = \\frac{a + bx}{c + dx} \\), III. \\( y = \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} \\).\n\nIn all these equations \\( a, b, c \\) denote given numbers; in the two first \\( x \\) is to be determined so that \\( y \\) may be an integer, and in the third \\( x \\) is to be determined so that \\( y \\) may be a rational quantity.\n\n320. In the equation \\( y = \\frac{a}{b + cx} \\) it is evident \\( b + cx \\) must be a divisor of \\( a \\), let \\( d \\) be one of its divisors, then \\( b + cx = d \\), and \\( x = \\frac{d - b}{c} \\), hence, to find \\( x \\) we must search among the divisors of \\( a \\) for one such that if \\( b \\) be subtracted from it the remainder may be divisible by \\( c \\), and the quotient will be such a value of \\( x \\) as is required.\n\n321. When \\( y = \\frac{a + bx}{c + dx} \\), if \\( d \\) be a divisor of \\( b \\), \\( x \\) will be taken out of the numerator if we divide it by \\( c + dx \\) and this form is then reduced to the preceding. But if \\( d \\) is not a divisor of \\( b \\), multiply both sides by \\( d \\), then \\( dy = da + dbx \\) or \\( dy = b + ad - bc \\), and so \\( x \\) is found by making \\( c + dx \\) equal to a divisor of \\( ad - bc \\).\n\nExample: Given \\( x + y + 2xy = 195 \\) to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in whole numbers.\n\nFrom the given equation \\( y = \\frac{195 - x}{1 + 2x} \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n2y = \\frac{391 - 2x}{1 + 2x} = -1 + \\frac{391}{1 + 2x}.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( 391 = 17 \\times 23 \\)\n\nhence we must assume \\( 1 + 2x = 17 \\), or \\( 1 + 2x = 23 \\), the first supposition gives us \\( x = 8, y = 11 \\); and the second \\( x = 11, y = 8 \\), the same result in effect as the former.\n\n322. It remains to consider the formula \\( y = \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} \\) where \\( x \\) is to be found so that \\( y \\) may be a rational quantity, but as the condition of having \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) also integers would add greatly to the difficulty of the problem and produce researches of a very intricate nature, we must be satisfied for the most part with fractional values. The possibility of rendering the proposed formula a square depends altogether upon the coefficients \\( a, b, c \\) and there are four cases of the problem, the solution of each of which is connected with some peculiarity in their nature.\n\n323. Case 1. Let \\( a \\) be a square number, then, putting \\( g^2 \\) for \\( a \\), we have \\( y = \\sqrt{g^2 + bx + cx^2} \\). Suppose \\( g^2 + bx + cx^2 = g + mx \\) then \\( g^2 + bx + cx^2 = g^2 + 2gmx + m^2x^2 \\), or \\( bx + cx^2 = 2gmx + m^2x^2 \\), that is \\( b + cx = 2gm + m^2x \\), hence\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{2gm - b}{c - m^2}, \\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{g^2 + bx + cx^2} = \\frac{cg - bm + gm^2}{c - m^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( m \\) may be any rational quantity either whole or fractional.\n\n324. Case 2. Let \\( c \\) be a square number \\( = g^2 \\), then putting \\( \\sqrt{a + bx + gx^2} = m + gx \\), we find \\( a + bx + gx^2 = m^2 + 2mgx + g^2x^2 \\), or \\( a + bx = m^2 + 2mgx \\), hence we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{m^2 - a}{b - 2mg}, \\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{a + bx + gx^2} = \\frac{bm - gm^2 - ag}{b - 2mg}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( m \\), as before, may be taken at pleasure.\n\n325. Case 3. When neither \\( a \\) nor \\( c \\) are square numbers, yet, if the expression \\( a + bx + cx^2 \\) can be resolved into two simple factors as \\( f + gx \\) and \\( h + kx \\) the irrationality may be taken away as follows.\n\nAssume \\( \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} = \\sqrt{(f + gx)(b + kx)} = m \\)\n\n\\( (f + gx) \\), then \\( (f + gx)(b + kx) = m^2 + (f + gx)^2 \\), or \\( b + kx = m^2(f + gx) \\), hence we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{fm^2 - b}{k - gm^2}, \\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{(f + gx)(b + kx)} = \\frac{(fk - gh)m}{k - gm^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand in these formul\u00e6 \\( m \\) may be taken at pleasure.\n\n326. Case 4. The expression \\( a + bx + cx^2 \\) may be transformed into a square as often as it can be resolved into two parts, one of which is a complete square, and the other a product of two simple factors; for then it has this form \\( p^2 + qr \\), where \\( p, q, r \\) are quantities which contain no power of \\( x \\) higher than the first. Let us assume \\( \\sqrt{p^2 + qr} = p + mq \\); thus we have \\( p^2 + qr = p^2 + 2mpq + m^2q^2 \\) and \\( r = 2mp + m^2q \\), and as this equation involves only the first power of \\( x \\) we may by proper reduction obtain from it rational values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as in the three foregoing cases.\n\n327. If we can by trials discover any one value of \\( x \\) which renders the expression \\( \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} \\) rational we may immediately reduce the quantity under the radical sign to the above-mentioned form, and thence find a general expression from which as many more values of \\( x \\) may be determined as we please. Thus let us suppose that \\( p \\) is a value of \\( x \\) which satisfies the con-\nIndeterminate Pro-\nblems.\n\nTherefore, by subtraction,\n\n\\[ y^2 - q^2 = b(x - p) + c(x^2 - p^2) = (b + cp + cx)(x - p) \\]\n\nand \\( y = \\sqrt{q^2 + (b + cp + cx)(x - p)} \\). The quantity under the radical sign being now reduced to the preferable form, it may be rendered rational by the substitution pointed out in last article.\n\n328. The application of the preceding general methods of resolution to any particular case is very easy; we shall therefore conclude with a very few examples.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to find two square numbers whose sum is a given square number.\n\nLet \\( a^2 \\) be the given square number, and \\( x^2, y^2 \\), the numbers required. Then by the question \\( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \\), and \\( y = \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\). This equation is evidently of such a form as to be resolvable by the method employed in case 1. Accordingly by comparing \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\) with the general expression \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + bx + cx^2} \\) we have \\( g = a, b = 0, c = -1 \\), and substituting these values in the formulae of \u00a7 323, also \\( n \\) for \\( m \\), we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2an}{n^2 + 1}, \\quad y = \\frac{a(n^2 - 1)}{n^2 + 1} \\]\n\nhence the numbers required are\n\n\\[ x^2 = \\frac{4a^2n^2}{(n^2 + 1)^2}, \\quad y^2 = \\frac{a^2(n^2 - 1)^2}{(n^2 + 1)^2} \\]\n\nIf \\( a = n^2 + 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is any number whatever, the square numbers \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\) will both be integers, viz. \\( x^2 = 4n^2 \\) and \\( y^2 = (n^2 - 1)^2 \\). Let us suppose \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( a = n^2 + 1 = 5 \\), and \\( a^2 = 25 \\), hence \\( x^2 = 4n^2 = 16 \\), \\( y^2 = (n^2 - 1)^2 = 9 \\). Thus it appears that the square number 25 may be resolved into two other square numbers 9 and 16.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to find two square numbers whose difference shall be equal to a given square number \\( b^2 \\).\n\nThis question may be resolved in the same manner as the last. Or, without referring to any former investigation, let \\( (x + n)^2 \\) and \\( x^2 \\) be the numbers sought, then \\( (x + n)^2 - x^2 = b^2 \\), that is \\( 2nx + n^2 = b^2 \\), hence\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{b^2 - n^2}{2n} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + n = \\frac{b^2 + n^2}{2n} \\]\n\nSo that the numbers sought are\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{b^2 + n^2}{2n} \\right)^2, \\quad \\left( \\frac{b^2 - n^2}{2n} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) may be any number whatever. If for example \\( b^2 = 25 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( x = 12 \\) and \\( x + n = 13 \\); so that the numbers required are 144 and 169.\n\nEx. 3. It is required to determine \\( x \\), so that \\( \\frac{x^2 + x}{2} \\) may be a rational square.\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the side of the square required, then \\( \\frac{x^2 + x}{2} = y^2 \\) and \\( 4x^2 + 4x = 8y^2 \\). Let the first part of this equation be completed into a square by adding 1 to each side, then \\( 4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 1 + 8y^2 \\), and taking the root \\( 2x + 1 = \\sqrt{1 + 8y^2} \\), so that we have to make \\( 1 + 8y^2 \\) a square. Assume\n\n\\[ 1 + 8y^2 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{2p}{q} \\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{2p}{q}y + \\frac{p^2}{q^2}y^2 \\]\n\nthen \\( 8y = \\frac{2p}{q}y + \\frac{p^2}{q^2}y^2 \\). Hence by proper reduction \\( y = \\frac{2pq}{8q^2 - p^2} \\) and\n\nsince \\( 2x + 1 = \\sqrt{1 + 8y^2} = \\frac{8q^2 + p^2}{8q^2 - p^2} \\), therefore \\( x = \\frac{8q^2 - p^2}{8q^2 + p^2} \\)\n\nand \\( \\frac{x^2 + x}{2} = \\frac{4p^2q^2}{(8q^2 + p^2)^2} \\), a rational square as was required.\n\nSect. XXXIII. Of the Resolution of Geometrical Problems.\n\n329. When a geometrical problem is to be resolved by algebra, the figure which is to be the subject of investigation must be drawn, so as to exhibit as well the known quantities, connected with the problem, as the unknown quantities, which are to be found. The conditions of the problem are next to be attentively considered, and such lines drawn, or produced, as may be judged necessary to its solution. This done, the known quantities are to be denoted by symbols in the usual manner, and also such unknown quantities as can most easily be determined; which may be either those directly required, or others from which they can be readily found. We must next proceed to deduce from the known geometrical properties of the figure a series of equations, expressing the relations between the known and unknown quantities; these equations must be independent of each other and as many in number as there are unknown quantities. Having obtained a suitable number of equations, the unknown quantities are to be determined in the same manner as in the resolution of numerical problems.\n\n330. No general rule can be given for drawing the lines, and selecting the quantities most proper to be represented by symbols, so as to bring out the simplest conclusion; because different problems require different methods of solution. The best way to gain experience in this matter is to try the solution of the same problem in different ways, and then apply that which succeeds best to other cases of the same kind, when they afterwards occur. The following particular directions however may be of some use.\n\n1. In preparing the figure by drawing lines, let them be either parallel or perpendicular to other lines in the figure, or so as to form similar triangles. And if an angle be given, it will be proper to let the perpendicular be opposite to that angle, and to fall from one end of a given line, if possible.\n\n2. In selecting the quantities for which symbols are to be substituted, those are to be chosen, whether required or not, which lie nearest the known or given parts of the figure, and by means of which the next adjacent parts may be expressed by addition and subtraction only, without the intervention of roots.\n\n3. When two lines, or quantities, are alike related to other parts of the figure, or problem, the best way is to substitute for neither of them separately but to substitute for their sum, or difference, or rectangle, or the sum of their alternate quotients, or some line or lines in the figure, to which they have both the same relation.\n4. When the area, or the perimeter of a figure is given, or such like parts of it as have only a remote relation to the parts required: it is sometimes of use to assume another figure similar to the proposed one, having one side equal to unity, or some other known quantity. For from hence the other parts of the figure may be found by the known proportions of like sides or parts, and so an equation will be obtained.\n\n331. We shall now give the algebraical solutions of some geometrical problems.\n\n**Prob. 1.** In a right angled triangle, having given the base, and the sum of the hypothenuse and perpendicular, to find both these two sides.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (Plate XIV. fig. 1.) represent the proposed triangle, right angled at \\(B\\). Let \\(AB\\), the given base, be denoted by \\(b\\), and \\(AC + BC\\) the sum of the hypothenuse and perpendicular by \\(s\\); then if \\(x\\) be put for \\(BC\\) the perpendicular, the hypothenuse \\(AC\\) will be \\(s - x\\). But from the nature of a right angled triangle \\(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\\), that is\n\n\\[b^2 + x^2 = (s - x)^2 = s^2 - 2sx + x^2.\\]\n\nHence \\(b^2 = s^2 - 2sx\\), and \\(x = \\frac{s^2 - b^2}{2s} = BC\\). Also\n\n\\[s - x = \\frac{s^2 - b^2}{2s} = AC.\\] Thus the perpendicular and hypothenuse are expressed by means of the known quantities \\(b\\) and \\(s\\) as required.\n\nIf a solution in numbers be required, we may suppose \\(AB = b = 3\\) and \\(AC + CB = s = 9\\), then\n\n\\[BC = \\frac{s^2 - b^2}{2s} = 4,\\] and \\(AC = \\frac{s^2 + b^2}{2s} = 5.\\)\n\n**Prob. 2.** In a right angled triangle, having given the hypothenuse, also the sum of the base and perpendicular, it is required to determine both these two sides.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 1.) represent the proposed triangle, right angled at \\(B\\). Put \\(a = AC\\) the given hypothenuse, and \\(s = AB + BC\\) the given sum of the sides, then if \\(x\\) be put for \\(AB\\), the base, \\(s - x\\) will denote \\(BC\\) the perpendicular.\n\nNow from the nature of right angled triangles \\(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\\), therefore \\(x^2 + (s - x)^2 = a^2\\), or \\(x^2 + s^2 - 2sx + x^2 = a^2\\), hence we have this quadratic equation \\(x^2 - sx = \\frac{a^2 - s^2}{2}\\), which being resolved, by completing the square, we find \\(x = \\frac{s \\pm \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2} = AB\\), and \\(s - x = \\frac{s \\mp \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2} = BC\\). Thus it appears that either of the two quantities \\(\\frac{s + \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2}, \\frac{s - \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2}\\) may be taken for \\(AB\\), but whichever of the two be taken, the remaining one is necessarily equal to \\(BC\\).\n\n**Prob. 3.** It is required to inscribe a square in a given triangle.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 2.) be the given triangle, and \\(EFGH\\) the inscribed square. Draw the perpendicular \\(AD\\) cutting \\(EF\\) the side of the square in \\(K\\), then, because the triangle is given, the perpendicular \\(AD\\) may be considered as given. Let \\(BC = b\\), \\(AD = p\\), and considering \\(AK\\) as the unknown quantity, (because from it the square may be readily determined), let \\(AK = v\\); then \\(KD = EF = p - x\\).\n\nThe triangles \\(ABC, AEF\\) are similar; therefore \\(AD : BC :: AK : EF\\); that is \\(p : b :: x : p - x\\). Hence by taking the product of the extremes and means, \\(px = bx\\), and \\(x = \\frac{p^2}{p + b} = AK\\). If the side of the square be required, it may be immediately found by subtracting \\(AK\\) from \\(AD\\) the perpendicular. Thus we have \\(p - \\frac{p^2}{p + b} = KD = EF\\). Hence it appears that we may either take \\(AK\\) a third proportional to \\(AD + BC\\) and \\(AD\\), or take \\(DK\\) a fourth proportional to \\(AD + BC, AD\\) and \\(BC\\), and the point \\(K\\) being found, the manner of constructing the square is sufficiently obvious.\n\n**Prob. 4.** Having given the area of a rectangle inscribed in a given triangle, it is required to determine the sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 3.) be the given triangle, and \\(EDGF\\) the rectangle whose sides are required. Draw the perpendicular \\(CI\\) cutting \\(DG\\) in \\(H\\). Put \\(AB = b\\), \\(CI = p\\), \\(DG = EF = x\\), \\(DE = HI = y\\), then \\(CH = p - y\\). Let \\(a^2\\) denote the given area.\n\nThe triangles \\(CDG, CAB\\) are similar, hence\n\n\\[CH : DG :: CI : AB, \\text{ or } p - y : x :: p : b.\\]\n\nSo that to determine \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we have these two equations\n\n\\[xy = a^2, \\quad lp - ly = px.\\]\n\nFrom the first equation we find \\(y = \\frac{a^2}{x}\\), and from the second \\(y = \\frac{bp - px}{b}\\), therefore \\(\\frac{bp - px}{b} = \\frac{a^2}{x}\\) hence \\(x^2 - bx = \\frac{a^2 b}{p}\\), and from this quadratic equation, by completing the square, &c. we find\n\n\\[x = \\frac{b}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{a^2 b}{p}}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{a^2}{x} = \\frac{p}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{4} - \\frac{pa^2}{b}}.\\]\n\nHence it appears that if \\(\\frac{a^2 b}{p}\\) be less than \\(\\frac{b^2}{4}\\), that is if \\(a^2\\) be less than \\(\\frac{pb}{4}\\), there are two different rectangles, having the same area, which may be inscribed in the given triangle. It also appears that to render the problem possible, the given space \\(a^2\\) must not be greater than \\(\\frac{pb}{4}\\), that is, than half the area of the given triangle.\n\n**Prob. 5.** In a triangle, there are given, the base, the vertical angle, and the sum of the sides about that angle to determine each of these sides.\n\nLet us suppose that \\(ABC\\) (fig. 4.) is the triangle, of which there is given the base \\(AC\\), the vertical angle \\(ABC\\).\nABC and the sum of the sides AB, BC. Put AC = a,\nAB + BC = b, cosine of \u2220ABC = c, and let AB, BC,\nthe sides required, be denoted by x and y.\n\nLet CD be drawn from either of the angles at the base\nperpendicular to the opposite side AB, then, rad.: cof.\nB :: CB : BD; therefore BD = cof. B \u00d7 CB = cy.\n\nNow, from the principles of geometry, AC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2\n+ BC\u00b2 - 2AB \u00d7 BD. Hence, and from the question,\nwe have these two equations\n\n\\[ x + y = b, \\quad x^2 - 2cxy + y^2 = a^2. \\]\n\nFrom the square of the first of these equations, viz.\n\\[ x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = b^2, \\] let the second be subtracted, thus we\nhave \\( 2(1+c)xy = b^2 - a^2, \\) and \\( xy = \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{1+c}. \\)\n\nAgain,\nfrom the square of the first equation let the double of\nthis last equation, viz. \\( 4xy = 2(b^2 - a^2), \\) be subtracted,\nand the result is \\( x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}, \\) so that\nby taking the square root of this last equation we ob-\ntain\n\n\\[ x - y = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}}. \\]\n\nThus we have found the difference between the sides;\nnow their sum is given = b, hence, by adding \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the dif-\nference to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the sum we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}}; \\]\n\nand subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the difference from \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the sum\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{b}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}}. \\]\n\nIf the angle at B be a right angle this problem be-\ncomes the same as prob. 2.\n\n332. By a method of investigation, in all respects si-\nmilar to that which has been employed in these ex-\namples, any proposed geometrical problem may be re-\nduced to an algebraic equation, the roots of which will\nexhibit arithmetical values of that geometrical magni-\ntude which constitutes the unknown quantity in the\nequation. But the roots of algebraic equations may\nalso be expressed by geometrical magnitudes, and hence\na geometrical construction of a problem may be derived\nfrom its algebraic solution. For example, quadratic\nequations, which all belong to one or other of these\nthree forms,\n\n\\[ x^2 + ax = bc, \\quad x^2 - ax = bc, \\quad x^2 - ax = -bc \\]\n\nor \\( x(x + a) = bc, \\quad x(x - a) = bc, \\quad x(a - x) = bc \\)\n\nmay be constructed as follows.\n\n333. Construction of the first and second forms. Let\na circle EABD (fig. 5.) be described with a radius\n= la, in which, from any point A in the circumference\napply a chord \\( AB = b - c \\) (b being supposed greater\nthan c) and produce AB so that BC = c; then AC = a.\n\nLet H be the centre of the circle, join CH cutting\nthe circumference in D and E, then, in the first case, the\npositive value of x shall be represented by CD, and in\nthe second by CE. For, by construction DE = a, there-\nfore, if CD be called \\( x \\), then CE = \\( x + a \\), but if CE\n= \\( x \\), then CD = \\( x - a \\). Now by the elements of geo-\nmetry EC \u00d7 CD = AC \u00d7 CB, that is \\( x(x + a) = bc \\) or\n\\( x^2 + ax = bc \\), which equation comprehends the first and\nsecond cases.\n\nIf the negative roots be required, that of the first\ncase will be CE and that of the second CD.\n\nWhen b and c are equal the construction will be ra-\nther more simple, for then AB vanishing, AC will coin-\ncide with the tangent CF. Therefore if a right an-\ngled triangle HFC be constructed whose legs HF and\nFC are equal respectively to \\( \\frac{1}{2}a \\) and \\( b \\), then will CD,\nthe value of \\( x \\) in the first case be equal to CH - HF\nand CE, the value of \\( x \\) in the latter, = CH + HF.\n\n334. Construction of the third form.\u2014Let a circle\nEADB (fig. 6.) be described with a radius = \\( \\frac{1}{2}a \\) as\nbefore, in which apply a chord \\( AB = b + c \\), and take\nAC = b. Through C draw the diameter DCE, then\neither DC or EC will be positive roots of the equation.\nFor since ED = a, if either EC or CD = \\( x \\), the remain-\ning part of the diameter shall be \\( a - x \\), now by the\nnature of the circle EC \u00d7 CD = AC \u00d7 CB, that is \\( x \\)\n\\((a - x) = bc \\) or \\( x^2 - ax = -bc \\), hence it is evident that\nthe roots are rightly determined.\n\nIf b and c are equal the construction will be the\nsame, only it will then not be necessary to describe\nthe whole circle; for since AC will be perpendicular\nto the diameter, if a right angled triangle HCA be\nconstructed, having its hypotenuse HA = \\( \\frac{1}{2}a \\) and base\nAC = b, the roots of the equation will be expressed by\nAH + HC and AH - HC.\n\n335. If b and c be so unequal, that \\( b - c \\) in the first\ntwo cases, or \\( b + c \\) in the third, is greater than \\( a \\), then,\ninstead of these quantities, \\( \\frac{1}{2}b \\) and \\( 2c \\), or in general\n\\( \\frac{b}{n} \\) and \\( nc \\) (where \\( n \\) is any number whatever) may be\nused. Or a mean proportional may be found between\nb and c, and the construction performed as directed in\neach case when b and c are equal.\n\n336. It appears from \u00a7 333 and 334, that every\ngeometrical problem which produces a quadratic equa-\ntion may be constructed by means of a straight line\nand a circle, or is a plane problem, hence on the con-\ntrary, if a problem can be constructed by straight lines\nand circles, its algebraic resolution will not produce\nan equation higher than a quadratic. Cubic and bi-\nquadratic equations may be constructed geometrically\nby means of any two conic sections, hence it follows\nthat every geometrical problem which requires for its\nconstruction two conic sections, will, when resolved by\nalgebra, produce a cubic or biquadratic equation.\n\nSect. XXIV. Of the Loci of Equations.\n\n337. When an equation contains two indeterminate\nquantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then for each particular value of \\( x \\)\nthere may be as many values of \\( y \\) as it has dimensions\nin that equation.

To these we may add a French factory at Callo, under the direction of the company of the French Bastion.\u2014The western government hath the towns of Oran, Tremecen, Moftagan, Tenez, and Secrery with its cattle and garrison.\u2014The southern government hath neither town, village, nor even a houle, all the inhabitants living in tents, which obliges the dey and his forces to be always encamped.\n\nInhabitants. The inhabitants along the sea coasts are a mixture of different nations; but chiefly Moors and Morecos driven out of Catalonia, Arragon, and other parts of Spain. Here are also great numbers of Turks, who come from the Levant to seek their fortune; as well as multitudes of Jews and Christians taken at sea, who are brought thither to be sold for slaves. The Berebers are some of the most ancient inhabitants of the country; and are supposed to be descended from the ancient Sabaeans, who came hither from Arabia Felix under the conduct of one of their princes. Others believe them to be some of the Canaanites driven out of Palestine by Joshua. These are dispersed all over Barbary, and divided into a multitude of tribes under their respective chiefs; most of them inhabit the mountainous parts; some range from place to place, and live in tents, or portable huts; others in scattered villages; they have nevertheless, kept themselves for the most part from intermixing with other nations. The Berebers are reckoned the richest of all, go better clothed, and carry on a much larger traffic of cattle, hides, wax, honey, iron, and other commodities. They have also some artisans in iron, and some manufacturers in the weaving branch.\u2014The name of Bereber is supposed to have been originally given them on account of their being first settled in some desert place. Upon their increasing in process of time, they divided themselves into five tribes, probably on account of religious differences, called the Zinbagians, Mysamedias, Zenetii, Hoares, and Gomeres; and these having produced 600 families, subdivided themselves into a great number of petty tribes.\u2014To these we may add the Zuwawabs, by European authors called Azaguer, or Affaguer, who are likewise dispersed over most parts of Barbary and Numidia. Great numbers of these inhabit the mountainous parts of Cucu, Labez, &c., leading a wandering pastoral life. But the most numerous inhabitants are the Moors and Arabians. The former are very stout and warlike, and skilful horsemen; but so addicted to robbing, that one cannot safely travel along the country at a distance from the towns without a guard, or at least a marabout or saint for a safeguard. For as they look upon themselves to be the original proprietors of the country, and not only as disposed of by the rest of the inhabitants, but reduced by them to the lowest state of poverty, they make no scruple to plunder all they meet by way of reprisal. The inhabitants in general have a pretty fair complexion; they are robust and well proportioned. People of distinction wear their beard; they have rich clothes made of silk, embroidered with flowers of gold, and turbans enriched with jewels. The Turks, who compose the military force, have great privileges, pay no taxes, are never publicly punished, and rarely in private. The lowest soldier dominates over the most distinguished Moors at pleasure. If he finds them better mounted than himself, he exchanges horses without ceremony. The Turks alone have the privilege of carrying firearms. Many good qualities, however, distinguish them in spite of this excess of deportment. They never game for money, not even for trifles; and they never profane the name of the Deity. They soon forget their private quarrels; and after the first proxim of relentment is over, it is infamy for a Turk to keep in remembrance the injuries he has received. In this respect certainly they are less barbarous than other nations that boast of their civilization. See Moors.\n\nThe climate of Algiers is in most places so temperate, and there is a constant verdure; the leaves of the foil trees being neither parched up by heat in summer, nor nipped by the winter's cold. They begin to bud in February; in April the fruit appears in its full bigness, and is commonly ripe in May. The foil, however, is excessively various; some places being very hot, dry, and barren, on which account they are generally suffered to lie uncultivated by the inhabitants, who are very negligent. These barren places, especially such as lie on the southern side, and are at a great distance from the sea, harbour vast numbers of wild animals, as lions, tigers, buffaloes, wild boars, flags, porcupines, monkeys, ostriches, &c. On account of their barrenness, they have but few towns, and those thinly peopled; though some of them are advantageously situated for trading with Bildulgerid and Negroland, as to drive a considerable traffic with them.\n\nThe most considerable rivers of Algiers are: (1.) The Rivers, or Ziz, which runs across the province of Tremecen and the desert of Anguid, falling into the Mediterranean near the town of Tabecrita, where it has the name of Sirut. (2.) The Haregol, supposed the Sign of Ptolemy, comes down from the great Atlas, crosses the desert of Anguid, and falls into the sea about five leagues from Oran. (3.) The Mina, supposed the Chlematis of Ptolemy, a large river, which runs through the plains of Bathala, and falls into the sea near the town of Arzew. This river hath lately received the name of Cena, who rebuilt the town of Barthalam after it had been destroyed. (4.) The Shellif, Zilef or Zilif, descending from the Mount Gnaeexeris, runs through some great deserts, the lake Titteri, the frontiers of Tremecen, and Tenez, falling into the sea a little above the city of Moftagan. (5.) The Celef, supposed to be the Caribena of the ancients, falls into the sea about three leagues west of Algiers, after a short course of 18 or 20 leagues. (6.) The Huez-alguir, supposed to be the Nalabata or Na'aba of the ancients, and called by the Europeans Zinganir, runs down with a swift course through some high mountains of Cucu, and falls into the sea near Bujeyah. Whilst the city of Bujeyah was in the hands of the Harbours of Christians, the mouth of this river was so choked up by sand, that no vessel could come up into it: but in cleared by accident.\nvery soon after it was taken by the Moors, the great rains swelled it to such a degree, that all the sand and mud was carried off; so that galleys and other vessels have ever since entered it with ease, where they lie safe from storms, and all winds but that which blows from the north. (7.) Suf-Gemar, or Suf-Gimmar al-Rummiel, supposed to be the Amygdala of Ptolemy, hath its source in Mount Auras, on the confines of Atlas; thence runs through some barren plains, and the fruitful ones of Constantine, where its stream is greatly increased by some other rivers it receives; from thence running northward, along the ridges of some high mountains, it falls into the sea a little east of Gergi. (8.) The Ladeg, or Ludeg, runs down from Mount Atlas through part of Constantine, and falls into the sea a little eastward of Bona. (9.) Guadi, or Guadel Barbar, springs from the head of Orbus, or Urbs, in Tripoli, runs through Bujejah, and falls into the sea near Tabarea.\n\nThe Algerine kingdom made formerly a considerable part of the Mauritania Tingitana (see Mauritania), which was reduced to a Roman province by Julius Caesar, and from him also called Mauritania C\u00e6sariensis.\u2014In the general account of Africa, it has been noticed, that the Romans were driven out of that continent by the Vandals; these by Beliferius, the Greek emperor Justinian's general; and the Greeks in their turn by the Saracens. This last revolution happened about the middle of the seventh century; and the Arabs continued matters of the country, divided into a great number of petty kingdoms or states, under chiefs of their own choosing, till the year 1051.\n\nThis year, one Abubeker-ben-Omer, or, as the Spaniards authors call him, Abu-Texefien, an Arab of the Zinthagian tribe, being provoked at the tyranny of those despots, gathered, by the help of his marabouts or saints, a most powerful army of malcontents, in the southern provinces of Numidia and Libya. His followers were nicknamed Morabites or Morabites; by the Spaniards Almoravides; probably from their being assembled principally by the saints who were also called Morabites. The caliph of Kayem's forces were at this time taken up with quelling other revolts in Syria, Mecopotamia, &c. and the Arabs in Spain engaged in the most bloody wars; so that Texefien having nothing to fear from them, had all the success he could wish against the Arabian cheyks or petty tyrants, whom he defeated in many battles, and at last drove them not only out of Numidia and Libya, but out of all the western parts, reducing the whole province of Tingitania under his dominion.\n\nTexefien was succeeded by his son Yusef, or Joseph, a brave and warlike prince. In the beginning of his reign, he laid the foundation of the city of Morocco, which he designed to make the capital of his empire. While that city was building, he sent some of his marabouts ambassadors to Tremezen (now a province of Algiers), at that time inhabited by a powerful and insolent sect of Mahometans called Zeneti. The design of this embassy was to bring them back to what he called the true faith; but the Zeneti, despising his offers, assembled at Amaf, or Amas, their capital, murdered the ambassadors, and invaded Joseph's dominions with an army of 30,000 men.\n\nThe king hearing of their infamous proceedings, speedily mustered his army, and led it by long marches into their country, destroying all with fire and sword; while the Zeneti, instead of opposing his progress, retired as fast as possible towards Fez, in hopes of receiving assistance from thence. In this they were miserably deceived: the Fezzans marched out against them in a hostile manner; and coming up with the unhappy Zeneti, encumbered with their families and baggage, and ready to expire with hunger and weariness, they cut them all to pieces, except a small number who were mostly drowned in attempting to swim across a river, and some others who in their flight perished by falling from the high adjacent rocks. In the mean time Joseph reduced their country to a mere desert; which was, however, soon peopled by a numerous colony of Fezzans, who settled there under the protection of the reigning kings. In this war it is computed that near a million of the Zeneti, men, women, and children, lost their lives.\n\nThe restless and ambitious temper of Joseph did not let him remain long at peace. He quickly declared war against the Fezzans, reduced them to become his tributaries, and extended his conquests all along the Mediterranean. He next attacked some Arabian cheyks who had not yet submitted to his jurisdiction; and pursued them with such fury, that neither the Libyan deserts, nor ridges of the most craggy rocks, could shelter them from his arms. He attacked them in such of their retreats, castles, and fortresses, as were till then deemed impregnable; and at last subdued them, to the great grief of the other African nations, who were greatly annoyed by the ravages committed by his numerous forces.\n\nThus was founded the empire of the Morabites: which, however, was of no long duration; that race being in the 12th century driven out by Mohavedin, a marabout. This race of priests was expelled by Ab-Sharifs of dulac governor of Fez; and he, in the 13th century, Hacen, stripped of his new conquests by the sharifs of Hacen, who the descendants of those Arabian princes whom Abu-Texefien had formerly expelled.\n\nThe better to secure their new dominions, the sharifs divided them into several little kingdoms or provinces; and among the rest the present kingdom of Algiers was divided into four, namely, Tremezen, Tenez, Algiers Proper, and Bujejah. The four first monarchs laid to good a foundation for a lasting balance of power between their little kingdoms, that they continued for some centuries in mutual peace and amity; but at length the king of Tremezen having ventured to violate some of their articles, Abul-Farez, king of Tenez, declared war against him, and obliged him to become his tributary. This king dying soon after, and having divided his kingdom among his three sons, new discord arose; which Spain taking advantage of, a powerful fleet and army was sent against Barbary, under the count of Navarre, in 1505. This commandant soon made himself master of the important cities of Oran, Bujejah, and some others; which alarmed the Algerines, that they put themselves under the protection of Selim Eutemi, a noble and warlike Arabian prince. He came to their assistance with a great number of his bravest subjects, bringing with him his wife Zaphira, and a son then about 12 years old. This, however, was not sufficient to prevent the Spaniards...\nnards from landing a number of forces near Algiers that same year, and obliging that metropolis to become tributary to Spain. Nor could Prince Selim hinder them from building a strong fort on a small island opposite to the city, which terrified their corsairs from falling either in or out of the harbour.\n\nTo this galling yoke the Algerines were obliged to submit till the year 1516; when, hearing of the death of Ferdinand king of Spain, they sent an embassy to Aruch Barbarossa, who was at this time no less dreaded for his valour than his surprising success, and was then sent on a cruise with a squadron of galleys and barks. The purport of the embassy was, that he should come and free them from the Spanish yoke; for which they agreed to pay him a gratuity answerable to so great a service. Upon this Barbarossa immediately dispatched 18 galleys and 30 barks to the affluence of the Algerines: while he himself advanced towards the city with 800 Turks, 3000 Jigelites, and 2000 Moorish volunteers. Instead of taking the nearest road to Algiers, he directed his course towards Sharifbel, where Hafizan, another famed corsair, had settled himself. Him he surprised, and obliged to surrender; not without a previous promise of friendship: but no sooner had Barbarossa got him in his power, than he cut off his head; and obliged all Hafizan's Turks to follow him in his new expedition.\n\nOn Barbarossa's approach to Algiers, he was met by Prince Eutemi, attended by all the people of that metropolis, great and small; who looked for deliverance from this abandoned villain, whom they accounted invincible. He was conducted into the city amidst the acclamations of the people, and lodged in one of the noblest apartments of Prince Eutemi's palace, where he was treated with the greatest marks of distinction. Elated beyond measure with this kind reception, Barbarossa formed a design of becoming king of Algiers; and fearing some opposition from the inhabitants, on account of the excesses he suffered his soldiery to commit, murdered Prince Eutemi, and caused himself to be proclaimed king; his Turks and Moors crying out as he rode along the streets, \"Long live King Aruch Barbarossa, the invincible king of Algiers, the chosen of God to deliver the people from the oppression of the Christians; and destruction to all that shall oppose, or refuse to own him as their lawful sovereign.\" These last threatening words so intimidated the inhabitants, already apprehensive of a general massacre, that he was immediately acknowledged king. The unhappy princess Zaphira, it is said, poisoned herself, to avoid the brutality of this new king, whom she unsuccessfully endeavoured to stab with a dagger.\n\nBarbarossa was no sooner seated on the throne, than he treated his subjects with such cruelty, that they fled to shut up their houses and hide themselves when he appeared in public. In consequence of this, a plot was soon formed against him; but being discovered, he caused twenty of the principal conspirators to be beheaded, their bodies to be buried in a dunghill, and laid a heavy fine on those who survived. This so terrified the Algerines, that they never afterwards durst attempt anything against either Barbarossa or his successors.\n\nIn the mean time, the son of Prince Eutemi having fled to Oran, and put himself under the protection of Algiers, the marquis of Gomarez, laid before that nobleman a plan for putting the city of Algiers into the hands of the king of Spain. Upon this, young Selim Eutemi was sent to Spain, to lay his plan before Cardinal Ximenes; who having approved of it, sent a fleet with 10,000 land forces, under the command of Don Francisco, or, as others call him, Don Diego de Vera, to drive out the Turks, and restore the young prince. But the fleet was no sooner come within sight of land, than it was dispersed by a storm, and the greatest part of the ships dashed against the rocks. Most of the Spaniards were drowned; and the few who escaped to shore were either killed by the Turks or made slaves.\n\nThough Barbarossa had nothing to boast on this occasion, his pride and insolence were now fanned to such a degree, that he imagined himself invincible, and that the very elements conspired to make him so. The Arabians were so much alarmed at his success, that they implored the affluence of Hamidel Abdes king of Tenez, to drive the Turks out of Algiers. That prince readily undertook to do what was in his power for this purpose, provided they agreed to settle the kingdom on himself and his descendants. This proposal being accepted, he immediately set out at the head of 10,000 Moors; and, upon his entering the Algerine dominions, was joined by all the Arabians in the country. Barbarossa engaged him, only with 1000 Turkish musqueteers and 500 Granada Moors; totally defeated his numerous army; pursued him to the very gates of his capital, which he easily made himself master of; and having given it up to be plundered by the Turks, obliged the inhabitants to acknowledge him as their sovereign. This victory, however, was chiefly owing to the advantage which his troops had from their fire-arms; the enemy having no other weapons than arrows and javelins.\n\nNo sooner was Barbarossa become master of the kingdom of Tenez, than he received an embassy from the inhabitants of Tremecen; inviting him to come to their affluence against their then reigning prince, with whom they were dissatisfied on account of his having dethroned his nephew, and forced him to fly to Oran; offering him even the sovereignty, in case he accepted of their proposal. The king of Tremecen, not suspecting the treachery of his subjects, met the tyrant with an army of 6000 horse and 3000 foot: but Barbarossa's artillery gave him such an advantage, that the king was at length forced to retire into the capital; which he had no sooner entered, than his head was cut off, and sent to Barbarossa, with a fresh invitation to come and take possession of the kingdom. On his approach, he was met by with the inhabitants, whom he received with complaisance, and many fair promises; but beginning to tyrannize as usual, his new subjects soon convinced him that they were not so passive as the inhabitants of Algiers. Apprehending, therefore, that his reign might prove uneasy and precarious, he entered into an alliance with the king of Fez; after which, he took care to secure the rest of the cities in his new kingdom, by garrisoning them with his own troops. Some of these, however, revolted soon after; upon which he sent one of his corsairs, named Efeander, a man no less cruel than himself, to reduce them. The Tremecenians now began to re-\npent in good earnest of their having invited such a tyrant to their assistance; and held consultations on the most proper means of driving him away, and bringing back their lawful prince Abuchen Men; but their cabals being discovered, a great number of the conspirators were massacred in the most cruel manner. The prince had the good luck to escape to Oran, and was taken under the protection of the marquis of Gomarez, who sent immediate advice of it to Charles V., then lately arrived in Spain, with a powerful fleet and army. That monarch immediately ordered the young king a succour of 10,000 men, under the command of the governor of Oran; who, under the guidance of Abuchen Men, began his march towards Tremecen; and in their way they were joined by Prince Selim, with a great number of Arabs and Moors. The first thing they resolved upon was, to attack the important fortress of Calau, situated between Tremecen and Algiers, and commanded by the corsair Escander at the head of about 300 Turks. They invested it closely on all sides, in hopes Barbarossa would come out of Tremecen to its relief, which would give the Tremecenians an opportunity of keeping him out. That tyrant, however, kept close in his capital, being embarrassed by his fears of a revolt, and the politic delays of the king of Fez, who had not sent the auxiliaries he promised. The garrison of Calau, in the meantime, made a brave defence; and, in a sally they made at night, cut off near 300 Spaniards. This encouraged them to venture a second time; but they were now repulsed with great loss, and Escander himself wounded; soon after which, they surrendered upon honourable terms; but were all massacred by the Arabians, except 16, who clung close to the stirrups of the king, and of the Spanish general.\n\nBarbarossa being now informed that Abuchen Men, with his Arabs, accompanied by the Spaniards, were in full march to lay siege to Tremecen, thought proper to come out, at the head of 1500 Turks and 5000 Moorish horse, in order to break his way through the enemy; but he had not proceeded far from the city, before his council advised him to return and fortify himself in it. This advice was now too late; the inhabitants being resolved to keep him out, and open their gates to their own lawful prince as soon as he appeared. In this distress Barbarossa saw no way left but to retire to the citadel, and there defend himself till he could find an opportunity of stealing out with his men and all his treasure. Here he defended himself vigorously; but his provisions failing him, he took advantage of a subterraneous back way, which he had caused to be dug up for that purpose; and, taking his immense treasure with him, stole away as secretly as he could. His flight, however, was soon discovered; and he was so closely pursued, that to amuse, as he hoped, the enemy, he caused a great deal of his money, plate, jewels, &c. to be scattered all the way, thinking they would not fail to stop their pursuit to gather it up. This stratagem, however, failed, through the vigilance of the Spanish commander, who being himself at the head of the pursuers, obliged them to march on, till he was come up close to him on the banks of the Huezda, about eight leagues from Tremecen. Barbarossa had just crossed the river with his vanguard, when the Spaniards came up with his rear on the other side, and cut them all off; and then crossing the water, overtook him at a small distance from it. Here a bloody engagement ensued, in which the Turks fought like as many lions; defeated but, being at length overpowered by numbers, they and killed were all cut to pieces, and Barbarossa among the rest, by the Spaniards in the 44th year of his age, and four years after he had raised himself to the royal title of Yigel and the adjacent country; two years after he had acquired the sovereignty of Algiers, and scarce a twelvemonth after the reduction of Tremecen. His head was carried to Tremecen on the point of a spear; and Abuchen Men proclaimed king, to the joy of all the inhabitants. A few days after the fight, the king of Fez made his appearance at the head of 20,000 horse, near the field of battle; but hearing of Barbarossa's defeat and death, marched off with all possible speed, to avoid being attacked by the enemy.\n\nThe news of Barbarossa's death spread the utmost consternation among the Turks at Algiers; however, they cauled his brother Hayradin to be immediately proclaimed king. The Spanish commander now sent back the emperor's forces, without making any attempt upon Algiers; by which he lost the opportunity of driving the Turks out of that country; while Hayradin, justly dreading the consequences of the tyranny of his officers, fought the protection of the Grand Signior. This was readily granted, and himself appointed bashaw or viceroy of Algiers; by which means he received such considerable reinforcements, that the unhappy Algerines durst not make the least complaint; and such numbers of Turks resorted to him, that he was not only capable of keeping the Moors and Arabs in subjection at home, but of annoying the Christians at sea. His first step was to take the Spanish fort He takes above mentioned, which was a great nuisance to his men, the Spaniards. The Spaniards held out to the last extremity; but being all slain or wounded, Hayradin easily became master of the place.\n\nHayradin next set about building a strong mole for the safety of his ships. In this he employed 30,000 Christian slaves, whom he obliged to work without intermission for three years; in which time the work was completed. He then caused the fort he had taken from the Spaniards to be repaired, and placed a strong garrison in it, to prevent any foreign vessels from entering the harbour without giving an account of themselves. By these two important works, Hayradin soon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but also by the maritime Christian powers, especially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the Grand Signior with his success, and obtained from him a fresh supply of money, by which he was enabled to build a stronger fort, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of an enemy. All these have since received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occasion for them.\n\nIn the mean time the sultan, either out of a sense of the great services Hayradin had done, or perhaps out of jealousy lest he should make himself independent, raised Hayradin to the dignity of bashaw of the empire, and appointed Haffan Aga, a Sardinian renegade, an intrepid warrior, and an experienced officer, to succeed him as bashaw of Algiers. Haffan had no sooner taken possession of his new government, than he began to pursue his ravages on the Spanish coast with greater\ngreater fury than ever; extending them to the ecclesiastical state, and other parts of Italy. But Pope Paul III., being alarmed at this, exhorted the emperor Charles V. to send a powerful fleet to suppress those frequent and cruel piracies; and, that nothing might be wanted to render the enterprise successful, a bull was published by his holiness, wherein a plenary abolution of sins, and the crown of martyrdom, was promised to all those who either fell in battle or were made slaves; the emperor on his part needed no spur; and therefore let fall at the head of a powerful fleet consisting of 120 ships and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 chosen troops, and an immense quantity of money, arms, ammunition, &c. In this expedition many young nobility and gentry attended as volunteers, and among these many knights of Malta, so remarkable for their valour against the enemies of Christianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles in his expedition, and the wives and daughters of the officers and soldiers followed them with a design to settle in Barbary after the conquest was finished. All these meeting with a favourable wind, soon appeared before Algiers; every ship displaying the Spanish colours on the stern, and another at the head, with a crucifix to serve them for a pilot.\n\nBy this prodigious armament, the Algerines were thrown into the utmost consternation. The city was surrounded only by a wall with scarce any outworks. The whole garrison consisted of 800 Turks and 6000 Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly disciplined and accoutred; the rest of their forces being dispersed in the other provinces of the kingdom, to levy the usual tribute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spaniards landed without opposition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the course of a spring which supplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmost distress, Hassan received a summons to surrender at discretion, on pain of being put to the sword with all the garrison. The herald was ordered to extol the vast power of the emperor both by sea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Christian religion. But to this Hassan only replied, that he must be a madman who would pretend to advise an enemy, and that the advised must still act more madly who would take counsel of such an adviser. He was, however, on the point of surrendering the city, when advice was brought him that the forces belonging to the western government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was resolved to defend it to the utmost. Charles, in the mean time, resolving upon a general assault, kept a constant firing upon the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garrison, he looked upon as already in his hands. But while the dourwan, or Algerine senate, were deliberating on the most proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad prophet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the assembly, and foretold the speedy destruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was soon accomplished in a very surprising and unexpected manner: for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful storm of wind, rain, and hail, arose from the north, accompanied with violent shocks of earthquakes, and a dismal and universal darkness both by sea and land; so that the sun, moon, and elements, seemed to combine together for the destruction of the Spaniards. In that one night, some say in less than half an hour, 86 ships and 15 galleys were destroyed, with all their crews and military stores; by which the army on shore was deprived of all means of subsisting in these parts. Their camp also, which spread itself along the plain under the fort, was laid quite under water by the torrents which descended from the neighbouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into some better situation, were cut in pieces by the Moors and Arabs; while several galleys and other vessels, endeavouring to gain some neighbouring creeks along the coasts, were immediately plundered, and their crews massacred, by the inhabitants.\n\nThe next morning Charles beheld the sea covered with the fragments of so many ships, and the bodies of Algiers men, horses, and other creatures, swimming on the rafts, waves; at which he was so disheartened, that abandoning his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, he marched at the head of his army, though in no small disorder, towards Cape Malabux, in order to reembark in those few vessels which had weathered the storm. But Hassan, who had caused his motions to be watched, allowed him just time to get to the shore, when he fell out and attacked the Spaniards in the midst of their hurry and confusion to get into their ships, killing great numbers, and bringing away a still greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers, where he celebrated with great rejoicings his happy deliverance from such distresses and danger.\n\nSoon after this, the prophet Yufet, who had foretold the destruction of the Spaniards, was not only declared the deliverer of his country, but had a considerable gratuity decreed him, with the liberty of exercising his prophetic function unmolested. It was not long, however, before the marabouts, and some interpreters of the law, made a strong opposition against him; remonstrating to the bashaw, how ridiculous and scandalous it was to their nation, to ascribe the deliverance of it to a poor fortune-teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of an eminent saint of their own profession. But though the bashaw and his douwan seemed, out of policy, to give into this last notion, yet the impression which Yufet's predictions and their late accomplishments had made upon the minds of the common people, proved too strong to be eradicated; and the spirit of divination and conjuring has since got into such credit among them, that not only their great statesmen, but their priests, marabouts, and fanatics, have applied themselves to that study, and dignified it with the name of Mahomet's Revelations.\n\nThe unhappy Spaniards had scarcely reached their fresh calms, when they were attacked by a fresh storm, in which several more of them perished; one ship in particular, containing 700 soldiers, besides sailors, sunk in the emperor's sight, without a possibility of saving a single man. At length, with much labour, they reached the port of Buzyab, at that time possessed by the Spaniards, whither Hassan king of Tunis soon after repaired, with a supply of provisions for the emperor, who received him graciously, with fresh assurances of his favour and protection. Here he dismissed the few remains of the Maltese knights and their forces, who embarked in three shattered galleys, and with much difficulty\nAlgiers, ficulty and danger reached their own country. Charles himself stood no longer than till the 16th of November, when he set sail for Carthagena, and reached it on the 25th of the same month. In this unfortunate expedition upwards of 120 ships and galleys were lost, above 300 colonels and other land and sea officers, 8000 soldiers and marines, besides those destroyed by the enemy on the reembarkation, or drowned in the last storm.\n\nThe number of prisoners was so great, that the Algerines sold some of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.\n\nHassan, elated with this victory, in which he had very little share, undertook an expedition against the king of Tlemcen, who, being now deprived of the alliance of the Spaniards, was forced to procure a peace by paying a vast sum of money, and becoming tributary to him. The bashaw returned to Algiers, laden with riches; and soon after died of a fever, in the 66th year of his age.\n\nFrom this time the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines in any considerable degree. In 1555, they lost the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salha Rais, Hassan's successor; who next year set out on a new expedition, which he kept a secret, but was suspected to be intended against Oran; but he was scarcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time raged violently in the city, broke out in his groin, and carried him off in 24 hours.\n\nImmediately after his death the Algerine soldiery chose a Corsican renegade, Hassan Corfo, in his room, till they should receive farther orders from the Porte. He did not accept of the bashawship without a good deal of difficulty; but immediately proceeded the intended expedition against Oran, despatching a messenger to acquaint the Porte with what had happened. They had hardly begun their hostilities against the place, when orders came from the Porte, expressly forbidding Hassan Corfo to begin the siege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to raise it immediately. This news was received with great grief by the whole fleet and army, as they thought themselves sure of success, the garrison being at that time very weak. Nevertheless, as they dared not disobey, the siege was immediately raised.\n\nCorfo had hardly enjoyed his dignity four months, before news came, that eight galleys were bringing a new bashaw to succeed him; one Tekelli, a principal Turk of the Grand Signor's court; upon which the Algerines unanimously resolved not to admit him. By the treachery of the Levantine soldiery, however, he was admitted at last, and the unfortunate Corfo thrown over a wall in which a number of iron hooks were fixed; one of which catching the ribs of his right side, he hung three days in the most exquisite torture before he expired.\n\nTekelli had no sooner entered upon his new government, than he behaved with such cruelty and rapacity, that he was assassinated even under the dome of a faint, by Yulef Calabres, the favourite renegade of Hassan Corfo; who for this service was unanimously chosen bashaw, but died of the plague six days after his election.\n\nYulef was succeeded by Hassan the son of Hayraddin, who had been formerly recalled from his bashawship, when he was succeeded by Salha Rais; and now had the good fortune to get himself reinstated in his employment. Immediately on his arrival, he engaged Algiers in a war with the Arabs, by whom he was defeated with great loss. The next year, the Spaniards under Hassan took an expedition against Moftagan, under the command of the count d'Alcandela; but were utterly defeated, the commander himself killed, and 12,000 men taken prisoners. This disaster was owing to the inconsiderate rashness, or rather madness, of the commander; which was so great, that, after finding it impossible to rally his scattered forces, he rushed, sword in hand, into the thickest of the enemy's ranks, at the head of a small number of men, crying out, \"St Jago! St Jago! the victory is ours, the enemy is defeated!\" soon after which he was thrown from his horse, and trampled to death.\n\nHassan having had the misfortune to disoblige his subjects by allowing the mountaineers of Cuco to buy ammunition at Algiers, was sent in irons to Constantinople, while the aga of the janizaries, and general of the land forces, supplied his place. Hassan easily found means to clear himself; but a new bashaw was appointed, called Achmet; who had no sooner arrived than he lent the two deputy-bashaws to Constantinople, where their heads were struck off.\u2014Achmet was a man of such infatuated avarice, that, upon his arrival at Algiers, all ranks of people came in crowds to make him presents; which he the more greedily accepted, as he had bought his dignity by the money he had amassed while head gardener to the Sultan. He enjoyed it, however, only four months; and after his death, the state was governed other four months by his lieutenant; when Hassan was a third time sent viceroy to Algiers, where he was received with the greatest demonstrations of joy.\n\nThe first enterprise in which Hassan engaged, was the siege of the fort of Marsalquivir, situated near the city Oran, which he designed to invest immediately after. The army employed in this siege consisted of 26,000 foot and 10,000 horse, besides which he had a fleet consisting of 32 galleys and galliots, together with three French vessels laden with biscuit, oil, and other provisions. The city was defended by Don Martin de Cordova, brother of the count d'Alcandela, who had been taken prisoner in the battle where that nobleman was killed, but had obtained his liberty from the Algerines with immense sums, and now made a most gallant defense against the Turks. The city was attacked with the utmost fury by sea and land, so that several breaches were made in the walls. The Turkish standards were several times planted on the walls, and as often dislodged; but the place must have in the end submitted, had not Hassan been obliged to raise the siege in haste, on the news that the famed Genoese admiral Doria was approaching with considerable succours from Italy. The fleet accordingly arrived soon after; but missing the Algerine galleys, bore away for Pennon de Velez, where they were shamefully repulsed by a handful of Turks who garrisoned that place; which, however, was taken the following year.\n\nIn 1567, Hassan was again recalled to Constantinople, where he died three years after. He was succeeded by Mahomet, who gained the love of the Algerines by several public-spirited actions. He incorporated the janizaries and Levantine Turks together, and by that means put an end to their dissensions, which\nlaid the foundation of the Algerine independency on the Porte. He likewise added some considerable fortifications to the city and castle, which he designed to render impregnable. But while he was thus studying the interest of Algiers, one John Galcon, a bold Spanish adventurer, formed a design of surprising the whole piratical navy in the bay, and setting them on fire in the night-time, when they lay defenseless, and in their first sleep. For this he had not only the permission of King Philip II., but was furnished by him with proper vessels, mariners, and fireworks, for the execution of his plot. With these he fell foul for Algiers in the most proper season, viz. the beginning of October, when most, if not all the ships lay at anchor there; and easily sailed near enough, unsuspected, to view their manner of riding, in order to catch them unawares, at a time when the greater part of their crews were dispersed in their quarters. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole-gate, and dispersed his men with their fire-works; but to their great surprize, they found them so ill mixed, that they could not with all their art make them take fire. In the mean time, Galcon took it into his head, by way of bravado, to go to the mole-gate, and give three loud knocks at it with the pommel of his dagger, and to leave it fixed in the gate by its point, that the Algerines might have cause to remember him. This he had the good fortune to do without meeting with any disturbance or opposition: but it was not so with his men; for no sooner did they find their endeavours unsuccessful, than they made such a battle as quickly alarmed the guard posted on the adjacent bastion, from which the uproar quickly spread itself through the whole garrison. Galcon now finding himself in the utmost danger, fell away with all possible haste; but he was pursued, overtaken, and brought back a prisoner to Mahomet; who no sooner got him into his power, than he immediately caused a gibbet of considerable height to be erected on the spot where Galcon had landed, ordering him to be hoisted up, and hung by the feet to a hook, that he might die in exquisite torture; and to show his resentment and contempt of the king his master, he ordered his commission to be tied to his toes. He had not, however, hung long in that state, when the captain who took him, accompanied by a number of other corsairs, interceded so strongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of some Christian surgeons; but two days after, some Moors reporting that it was the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines durst not hurt a hair of Galcon's head, &c., the unfortunate Spaniard was hoisted up by a pulley to the top of the execution-wall, and let down again upon the hook, which in his fall caught him by the belly, and gave him such a wound, that he expired without a groan.\n\nThus ended the expedition of John Galcon, which has procured him a place among the Spanish martyrs; while, on the other hand, the Algerines look upon his disappointment to have been miraculous, and owing to the efficacious protection of the powerful saint Sidi Oulededdha, whose prayers had before raised such a terrible storm against the Spanish fleet.\n\nMahomet, being soon after recalled, was succeeded by the famous renegade Ochali, who reduced the kingdom of Tunis; which, however, remained subject to the viceroy of Algiers only till the year 1586, when a bailiwick of Tunis was appointed by the Porte.\n\nThe kingdom of Algiers continued to be governed, till the beginning of the seventeenth century, by viceroys or bailiwicks appointed by the Porte; concerning whom we find nothing very remarkable, further than that their avarice and tyranny were intolerable both to the Algerines and the Turks themselves. At last the Turkish janizaries and militia becoming powerful enough to suppress the tyrannic sway of these bailiwicks, and the people being almost exhausted by the heavy taxes laid upon them, the former resolved to depose these petty tyrants, and set up some officers of their own at the head of the realm. The better to succeed in this attempt, the militia sent a deputation of some of their chief members to the Porte, to complain of the avarice and oppression of these bailiwicks, who funk both the revenue of the state, and the money remitted to it from Constantinople, into their own coffers, which should have been employed in keeping up and paying the soldiery; by which means they were in continual danger of being overpowered by the Arabians and Moors, who, if ever so little assisted by any Christian power, would hardly fail of driving all the Turks out of the kingdom. They represented to the Grand Vizier how much more honourable, as well as easier and cheaper, it would be for the Grand Signior to permit them to choose their own dey, or governor, from among themselves, whose interest it would then be to see that the revenue of the kingdom was rightly applied in keeping up its forces complete, and in supplying all other exigencies of the state, without any farther charge or trouble to the Porte than that of allowing them its protection. On their part, they engaged always to acknowledge the Grand Signiors as their sovereigns, and to pay them their usual allegiance and tribute, to respect their bailiwicks, and even to lodge and maintain them and their retinue, in a manner suitable to their dignity, at their own charge. The bailiwicks, however, were, for the future, to be excluded from afflicting at any but general douwans, unless invited to it; and from having the liberty of voting in them, unless when their advice was asked, or the interest of the Porte was likely to suffer by their silence. All other concerns, which related to the government of Algiers, were to be wholly left under the direction of the dey and his douwan.\n\nThese proposals having been accepted by the Porte, Algerines the deputies returned highly satisfied; and having notified their new privileges, the great douwan immediately proceeded to the election of a dey from among themselves. They compiled a new set of laws, and made several regulations for the better support and maintenance of this new form of government, to the observation of which they obliged all their subjects to swear; and the militia, navy, commerce, &c., were all settled pretty nearly on the footing upon which they now are, and which shall be afterwards described; though the subsequent alterations that frequently happen between the bailiwicks and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, caused such frequent complaints and discontentants at the Ottoman court, as made them frequently repent their compliance.\nIn the year 1603, the Spaniards, under the command of Doria the Genoese admiral, made another attempt upon Algiers, in which they were more fortunate than usual, their fleet being only driven back by contrary winds, so that they came off without loss. In 1629, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocking in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able sailors, they undoubtedly contributed to make the Algerine fleet so formidable as it became soon after; though it is probable the frequent attempts made on their city would also induce them to increase their fleet. In 1616, their fleet consisted of 40 sail of ships between 200 and 400 tons, their admiral 500 tons. It was divided into two squadrons, one of 18 sail, before the port of Malaga; and the other at the cape of Santa Maria, between Lisbon and Seville; both of which attacked all Christian ships, both English and French, with whom they pretended to be in friendship, as well as Spaniards and Portuguese, with whom they were at war.\n\nThe Algerines were now become very formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were most in danger, and least able to cope with them, solicited the affluence of England, the pope, and other states. The French, however, were the first who dared to show their resentment of the perfidious behaviour of these miscreants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was sent against them with a fleet of 50 men of war, who defeated their fleet, took two of their vessels, while their admiral sunk his own ship and crew, rather than fall into his enemies hands.\n\nIn 1620, a squadron of Englishmen of war was sent against Algiers, under the conduct of Sir Robert Manfle; but of this expedition we have no other account, than that it returned without doing anything; and the Algerines, becoming more and more insolent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted; to whom, in 1625, they sent a proposal directed to the prince of Orange, that in case they would fit out 20 sail of ships the following year, upon any good service against the Spaniards, they would join them with 60 sail of their own.\n\nThe next year, the Couloiers, or Calaglies (the children of such Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers), who were enrolled in the militia, having feigned on the citadel, had well nigh made themselves masters of the city; but were attacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible slaughter. Many of them were put to death; and their heads thrown in heaps upon the city-walls, without the eastern gate. Part of the citadel was blown up; and the remaining Couloiers were dismissed from the militia, to which they were not again admitted till long after.\n\nIn 1623, the Algerines and other states of Barbary threw off their dependence on the Porte altogether, and let up for themselves. What gave occasion to this was the 25 years truce which Sultan Amurath IV. was obliged to make with the emperor Ferdinand II. to prevent his being overmatched by carrying on a war against him and the sophi of Persia at the same time. As this put a stop to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and resolved, that whoever desired to be at peace with them, must distinctly and separately, apply to their government.\n\nNo sooner was this resolution taken, than the Algerines began to make prizes of several merchant ships belonging to powers at peace with the Porte. Nay, having seized a Dutch ship and palaacre at Scanderoon, they ventured on shore; and finding the town abandoned by the Turkish aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and warehouses, and set them on fire.\u2014About this time Louis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coasts, instead of one formerly built by the Marilians, and which they had demolished. This, after some difficulty, he accomplished; and it was called the Bastion of France: but the situation being afterwards found inconvenient, the French purchased the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was so much embarrased with the Persian war, that there was no leisure to check the Algerine piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizier and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a share of their prizes, which were very considerable. However, for form's sake, a severe reprimand, accompanied with threats, was sent them; to which they replied, that \"these depredations deserved to be indulged to them, seeing they were the only bulwark against the Christian powers, especially against the Spaniards, the sworn enemies of the Mollem name;\" adding, that \"if they should pay a punctilious regard to all that could purchase peace, or liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but set fire to all their shipping, and turn camel-drivers for a livelihood.\"\n\nIn the year 1635, four younger brothers of a good Desperate family in France entered into an undertaking to defend Algiers, that perhaps the annals of knight-errantry can scarce furnish its equal.\u2014This was no less than to re-brothers tort the piracies of the Algerines upon themselves; and as they indiscriminately took the ships of all nations, so were these heroes indiscriminately to take the ships belonging to Algiers; and this with a small frigate of ten guns!\u2014In this ridiculous undertaking, 100 volunteers embarked; a Maltese commission was procured, together with an able master, and 36 mariners.\u2014They had the good fortune, on their first setting out, to take a ship laden with wine, on the Spanish coast: with which they were so much elated, that three days after they madly encountered two large Algerine corsairs, one of 20 and the other of 24 guns, both well manned, and commanded by able officers. These two large vessels having got the small frigate between them, plied her furiously with great shot, which soon took off her main-mast: notwithstanding which, the French made so desperate a resistance, that the pirates were not able to take them, till the noise of their fire brought up five more Algerines; when the French vessel, being almost torn to pieces, was boarded and taken. The young knights-errant were punished for their temerity by a dreadful captivity, from which they redeemed themselves in 1642 at the price of 6000 dollars.\n\nThe Algerines prosecuted their piracies with im-A French punity, to the terror and disgrace of the Europeans, admiral till the year 1652; when a French fleet being accidently driven to Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a release of all the captives of his nation, without exception. This being refused, the Frenchman without ceremony carried off the Turkish vice-roy,\nAlgiers, 107, and his cadet or judge, who had just arrived from the Porte, with all their equipage and retinue. The Algerines, by way of reprisal, surprized the Bastion of France already mentioned, and carried off the inhabitants to the number of 600, with all their effects; which so provoked the admiral, that he sent them word that he would pay them another visit the next year with his whole fleet.\n\nThe Algerines, undismayed by the threats of the French admiral, fitted out a fleet of 16 galleys and galliots, excellently manned and equipped, under the command of Admiral Hali Pinchinin.\u2014The chief design of this armament was against the treasure of Loretto; which, however, they were prevented by contrary winds from obtaining. Upon this they made a descent on Puglia in the kingdom of Naples; where they ravaged the whole territory of Nocera, carrying off a vast number of captives, and among them some nuns. From thence steering towards Dalmatia, they scoured the Adriatic; and loading themselves with immense plunder, left those coasts in the utmost consternation and resentment.\n\nAt last the Venetians, alarmed at such terrible depredations, equipped a fleet of 28 sail, under the command of Admiral Capello, with express orders to burn, sink, or take, all the Barbary corsairs he met with, either on the open seas, or even in the Grand Signior's harbours, pursuant to a late treaty of peace with the Porte. On the other hand, the captain bashaw, who had been sent out with the Turkish fleet to chase the Florentine and Maltese cruisers out of the Archipelago, understanding that the Algerine squadron was so near, sent express orders to the admiral to come to his assistance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but having first resolved on a descent upon the island of Lissa, or Lissina, belonging to the Venetians, he was overtaken by Capello, from whom he retired to Valona, a sea port belonging to the Grand Signior, whither the Venetian admiral pursued him; but the Turkish governor refusing to eject the pirates according to the articles of the peace between the Ottoman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content himself with watching them for some time. Pinchinin was soon weary of restraint, and ventured out; when an engagement immediately ensued, in which the Algerines were defeated, and five of their vessels disabled, with the loss of 1500 men, Turks, and Christian slaves; besides 1600 galley slaves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello; but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage before he received a letter from the senate, desiring him to make no farther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the Porte. This was followed by a letter from the governor of Valona, desiring him to take care lest he incurred the sultan's displeasure by such insults. The brave Venetian was forced to comply; but resolving to take such a leave of the Algerines as he thought they deserved, observed how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equipage along the shore. He then kept firing among their tents, while some well manned galliots and brigantines were ordered among their shipping, who attacked them with such bravery, that, without any great loss, they towed out their 16 galleys, with all their cannon, stores, &c.\u2014In this last engagement a ball from one of the Venetian galleys happening to strike a Turkish mosque, the whole action was considered as an insult upon the Grand Signior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to sink all the Algerine ships he had taken, except the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello came off with a severe reprimand; but the Venetians were obliged to buy, with 500,000 ducats, a peace from the Porte. The Grand Signior offered to repair the loss of the Algerines by building ten galleys for them, upon condition that they should continue in his service till the end of the ensuing summer; but Pinchinin, who knew how little the Algerines chose to lie under obligations to him, civilly declined the offer.\n\nIn the mean time, the news of this defeat and loss Algiers filled Algiers with the utmost grief and confusion. The utmost whole city was on the point of a general insurrection, at when the bashaw and douwan issued a proclamation, news, forbidding not only complaints and utterances, under the severest penalties; but all persons whatever to take their thumbs from within their girdles, while they were deliberating on this important point. In the mean time they applied to the Porte for an order, that the Venetians settled in the Levant should make up their losses. But with this the Grand Signior refused to comply, and left them to repair their losses, as well as build new ships in the best manner they could. It was not long, however, before they had the satisfaction to see one of their corsairs land, with a fresh supply of 600 slaves, whom he had brought from the coast of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a different native taken on board a Danish ship.\n\nOur pirates did not long continue in their weak and defenceless state; being able, at the end of two years, out a new to appear at sea with a fleet of 6x sail. The admiral fleet. Pinchinin equipped four galliots at his own expense; with which, in conjunction with the Chiayah, or secretary of the bashaw of Tripoli, he made a second excursion. This small squadron, consisting of five galleys and two brigantines, fell in with an English ship of 40 guns; which, however, Pinchinin's captains refused to engage; but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they swore to attack the next Christian ship which came in their way. This happened Five of to be a Dutch merchantman, of 28 guns, which was their gal- deeply laden, and unable to use her sails by reason of heavy defeat a calm. Pinchinin immediately summoned her to surrender; but receiving an ironical answer, drew up his chantman squadron in form of a half moon, that they might pour their shot all at once into their adversary. This, however, the Dutchman avoided, by means of a breeze of wind which fortunately sprung up and enabled him to turn his ship; upon which the galleys ran foul of each other. Upon this, Pinchinin ran his own galley alongside of the merchantman, the upper deck of which 70 Algerines immediately took possession of, some of them cutting the rigging, and others plying the hatches with hand grenades; but the Dutchmen having secured themselves in their close quarters, began to fire at the Algerines on board, from two pieces of cannon loaded with small shot; by which they were all soon killed, or forced to submit. Pinchinin, in the mean time, made several unsuccessful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to surround the Dutchman with his other galleys; but that ship lay so deep in the water,\nwater, that every shot did terrible execution among the pirates; so that they were obliged to remove farther off. At last the Dutch captain, having ordered his guns to be loaded with cartouches, gave them such a parting volley as killed 200 of them, and sent the rest back to Algiers in a most dismal plight.\n\nBut though Pinheinian thus returned in disgrace, the rest of the fleet quickly came back with vast numbers of slaves, and an immense quantity of rich spoils; insomuch that the English, French, and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the mighty Algerines, who some time wished to be at peace with them, but swore eternal war against Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greatest enemies to the Mahometan name. At last Louis XIV. provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coasts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a considerable fleet to be fitted out against them, under the marquis du Quefne, vice-admiral of France. His first expedition was against a number of Tripolitan corsairs; who had the good fortune to outwit him, and shelter themselves in the island of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not, however, prevent him from pursuing them thither, and making such terrible fire upon them as quickly destroyed 14 of their vessels, besides battering the walls of the castle.\n\nThis severity seemed only to be designed as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, finding they still continued their outrages on the French coast, he sailed to Algiers in August 1682, cannonading and bombarding it so furiously, that the whole town was in flames in a very little time. The great mosque was battered down, and most of the houses laid in ruins, insomuch that the inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a sudden the wind turned about, and obliged Du Quefne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made reprisals, by sending a number of galleys and galliots to the coast of Provence, where they committed the most dreadful ravages, and brought away a vast number of captives: upon which a new armament was ordered to be got ready at Toulon and Marfelles against the next year; and the Algerines, having received timely notice, put themselves into as good a state of defence as the time would allow.\n\nIn May 1683, Du Quefne with his squadron cast anchor before Algiers; where being joined by the Marquis d\u2019Affranville at the head of five stout vessels, it was resolved to bombard the town next day. Accordingly 100 bombs were thrown into it the first day, which did terrible execution; while the besieged made some hundred discharges of their cannon against them without doing any considerable damage. The following nights the bombs were again thrown into the city in such numbers, that the dey\u2019s palace and other great edifices were almost destroyed; some of their batteries were dismantled, and several vessels sunk in the port. The dey and Turkish bashaw, as well as the whole garrison, alarmed at this dreadful havoc, immediately sued for peace. As a preliminary, the immediate surrender was inflicted on all Christian captives who had been taken fighting under the French flag; which being granted, 142 of them were immediately delivered up, with a promise of sending him the remainder as soon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accordingly Du Quefne sent his commissary-general and one of his engineers into the town; but with express orders to insist upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the effects they had taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hall Rais one of their captains should be given as hostages.\n\nThis last demand having embarrassed the dey, he assembled the council, and acquainted them with it; upon which Mezomorto fell into a violent passion, and told the assembly, that the cowardice of those who sat at the helm had occasioned the ruin of Algiers: but that, for his part, he would never consent to deliver up anything that had been taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the soldiery with what had passed; which so exasperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow chose Mezomorto in his place. This was no sooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of peace which had been made, and hostilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.\n\nThe French admiral now kept pouring in such volumes of bombs, that in less than three days the greatest and almost part of the city was reduced to ashes; and the fire destroyed, burnt with such vehemence, that the sea was enlightened with it for more than two leagues round. Mezomorto, unmoved at all these disasters, and the vast number of the slain, whose blood ran in rivulets along the streets; or rather, growing furious and desperate, fought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy; and, not content with causing all the French in the city to be cruelly murdered, ordered their confidants to be tied hand and foot, and fastened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from whence he was shot away against their navy.\u2014By this piece of inhumanity Du Quefne was so exasperated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly destroyed all their fortifications, shipping, almost all the lower part, and above two-thirds of the upper part of the city, by which means it became little else than a heap of ruins.\n\nThe haughty Algerines were now thoroughly convinced that they were not invincible; and therefore for immediately sent an embassy into France, begging in peace, the most abject terms for peace; which Louis immediately granted, to their inexplicable joy. They now began to pay some regard to other nations, and to be a little cautious how they wantonly incurred their displeasure. The first bombardment by the French had so far humbled the Algerines, that they condescended to enter into a treaty with England; which was renewed upon terms very advantageous to the latter in 1686. It is not to be supposed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would disappear on a sudden; notwithstanding this treaty, therefore, they lost no opportunity of making prizes of the English ships when they could conveniently come at them. Upon some infringements of this kind, Captain Beach drove ashore their ships and burnt seven of their frigates in 1695; which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after; but it was not till the taking of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, that Britain could have a sufficient check upon them to enforce the observance of treaties; and these have since proved such restraints upon Algiers, that they still continue to pay a greater deference to the English than to any other European power.\nThe present century furnishes no very remarkable events with regard to Algiers, except the taking of the famed city of Oran from the Spaniards in 1768 (which however they regained in 1737), and the expulsion of the Turkish bashaw, and uniting his office to that of dey in 1710. This introduced the form of government which still continues in Algiers.\n\nThe dey is now absolute monarch; and pays no other revenue to the Porte than that of a certain number of fine boys or youths, and some other presents which are sent thither yearly. His own income probably rises and falls according to the opportunities he has of fleecing both natives and foreigners; whence it is variously computed by different authors. Dr Shaw computes the taxes of the whole kingdom to bring into the treasury no more than 300,000 dollars; but supposes that the eighth part of the prizes, the effects of those persons who die without children, joined to the yearly contributions raised by the government, presents from foreigners, fines and oppressions, may bring in about as much more. Both the dey and officers under him enrich themselves by the same laudable methods of rapine and fraud; which it is no wonder to find the common people practising upon one another, and especially upon strangers, seeing they themselves are impoverished by heavy taxes and the injustice of those who are in authority.\n\nWe have already hinted, that the first deys were elected by the militia, who were then called the douwan or common council. This elective body was at first composed of 800 militia officers, without whose consent the dey could do nothing; and upon some urgent occasions all the officers residing in Algiers, amounting to above 1500, were summoned to assist. But since the deys, who may be compared to the Dutch stadtholders, have become more powerful, the douwan is principally composed of 50 chiah bashaws or colonels, with now and then the mufti and cadi upon some emergencies; and on the election of a dey, the whole body are allowed to come and give their votes. All the regulations of state ought to be determined by that assembly, before they pass into a law, or the dey hath power to put them in execution; but, for many years back, the douwan has been of so little account, that it is only convened out of formality, and to give assent to what the dey and his chief favourites have concerted beforehand. The method of gathering the votes in this august assembly is perfectly agreeable to the character of those who compose it. The aga, or general of the janizaries, or the president pro tempore, first proposes the question; which is immediately repeated with a loud voice by the chiah bashaws, and from them echoed again by officers called baj/baladars; from these the question is repeated from one member of the douwan to another, with strange contortions, and the most hideous growlings, if it is not to their liking. From the loudness of this growling noise, the aga is left to guess as well as he can whether the majority of the assembly are pleased or displeased with the question; and from such a preposterous method, it is not surprising that these assemblies should seldom end without some tumult or disorder. As the whole body of the militia is concerned in the election of a new dey, it is seldom carried on without blows and bloodshed; but when once the choice is made, the person elected is saluted with the words Alla Barick, \"God bless you, and prosper you;\" and the new dey usually causes all the officers of the douwan who had opposed his election to be strangled, filling up their places with those who had been most zealous in promoting it. From this account of the election of the dey, it cannot be expected that their government should be at all secure; and as they arrive at the throne by tumult, disorder, and bloodshed, they are generally deprived of it by the same means, scarcely one in ten of them having the good fortune to die a natural death.\n\nIn this country it is not to be expected that justice will be administered with any degree of impartiality. The Mahometan soldiery, in particular, are so much punished, that they are seldom put to death for any crime except rebellion; in which case they are either strangled with a bow string or hanged to an iron hook. In lesser offences, they are fined, or their pay stopped; and if officers, they are reduced to the station of common soldiers, from whence they may gradually rise themselves to their former dignity. Women guilty of adultery, have a halter tied about their necks, with the other end fastened to a pole, by which they are held under water till they are suffocated. The battaado is likewise inflicted for small offences; and is given either upon the belly, back, or soles of the feet, according to the pleasure of the cadi; who also appoints the number of strokes. These sometimes amount to 200 or 300, according to the indulgence the offender can obtain either by bribery or friends; and hence he often dies under this punishment for want of powerful enough advocates. But the most terrible punishments are those inflicted upon the Jews or Christians who speak against Mahomet or his religion; in which case, they must either turn Mahometans or be impaled alive. If they afterwards apostatize, they are burned or roasted alive, or else thrown down from the top of the city walls, upon iron hooks, where they are caught by different parts of their body according to how they happen to fall, and sometimes expire in the greatest torments; though by accident they may be put out of pain at once, as we have already related of the Spanish adventurer John Gafcon. This terrible punishment, however, begins now to be diffused.\n\nThe officer next in power to the dey is the aga of Aga of the janizaries, who is one of the oldest officers in the army, and holds his post only for two months. He is military of then succeeded by the chiah, or next senior officer.\u2014ficers. During the two months in which the aga enjoys his dignity, the keys of the metropolis are in his hands; all military orders are issued out in his name; and the sentence of the dey upon any offending soldier, whether capital or not, can only be executed in the court of his palace.\u2014As soon as he has gone through this short office, he is considered as masoul, or superannuated; receives his pay regularly, like the rest of the militia, every two moons; is exempt from all further duties, except when called by the dey to assist at the grand council, to which he hath, however, a right to come at all times, but hath no longer a vote in it. Next to the aga in dignity is the secretary of state, who registers all the public acts; and after him are the 30 chiahs or colonels, who sit next to the aga in the douwan, and in the same gallery with him. Out of this class are generally chosen those who go ambassadors to foreign\nAlgiers, reign courts, or who disperse the dey's orders throughout the realm. Next to them are 800 bullack bahaws or old captains, who are promoted to that of chiah bahaws according to their seniority. The old bahaws or lieutenants are next; who amount to 400, and are regularly raised to the rank of captains in their turn, and to other employments in the state, according to their abilities. These, by way of distinction, wear a leather strap, hanging down to the middle of their back. One rule is strictly observed in the rotation of these troops from one deputy to a higher, viz., the right of seniority; one single infringement of which would cause an insurrection, and probably cost the dey his life. Other military officers of note are the veke-lards or purveyors of the army; the peys, who are the four oldest soldiers, and consequently the nearest to pre-ferment; the foulacks, who are the next in seniority to them, and are part of the dey's body-guard, always marching before him when he takes the field, and distinguished by their carbines and gilt scimitars, with a brass gun on their caps; the kayts or Turkish soldiers, each band of whom has the government of one or more adowans or itinerant villages, and collect their taxes for the dey; and the sagiardi or Turkish lance-men, 100 of whom always attend the army, and watch over the water appointed for it. To these we may add the beys, or governors of the three great provinces of the realm. All the above-mentioned officers ought to compose the great douwan or council above mentioned; but only the 30 chiah bahaws have a right to sit in the gallery next after the dey; the rest are obliged to stand on the floor of the hall or council chamber, with their arms across, and as much as possible without motion; neither are they permitted to enter with their swords on, for fear of a tumult. As those who have any matters to transact with the douwan, they must stand without, let the weather be ever so bad; and there they are commonly presented with coffee by some of the inferior officers, till they are dismissed.\n\nAccount of commerce. It does not appear that the Algerines avail themselves of the benefit of their internal resources to commerce, the extent they might do; for their genius leads them too much to the piratical trade to mind any real advantage that might be derived from their own country. The corsairs or pirates form each a small republic, of which the rais or captain is the supreme bahaw; who, with the officers under him, form a kind of douwan, in which every matter relating to the vessel is decided in an arbitrary way. These corsairs are chiefly instrumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by way of merchandise or prizes. These consist chiefly of gold and silver stuffs, damasks, cloths, spices, tin, iron, plated bras, lead, quicksilver, cordage, sail-cloth, bullets, cochinchin, linen, tartar, alum, rice, sugar, soap, cotton raw and spun, coppers, aloes, brazil and logwood, vermillion, &c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world: the oil, wax, hides, pulse, and corn produced, being but barely sufficient to supply the country; though before the laws of Oran the merchants have been known to ship off from one or other of the ports of Barbary several thousand tons of corn. The consumption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewise so considerable in this kingdom, that it is seldom permitted to be shipped off for Europe. The other exports consist chiefly in ostriches' feathers, copper, rugs, silk fathoms, embroidered handkerchiefs, dates, and Christian slaves. Some manufactures in silk, cotton, wool, leather, &c., are carried on in this country, but mostly by the Spaniards settled here, especially about the metropolis. Carpets are also a manufacture of the country; which, though much inferior to those of Turkey both in beauty and fineness, are preferred by the people to lie upon account of their being both cheaper and softer. There are also at Algiers looms for velvets, taffetas, and other wrought silks; and a coarse sort of linen is likewise made in most parts of the kingdom. The country furnishes no materials for ship-building. They have neither ropes, tar, sails, anchors, nor even iron. When they can procure enough of new wood to form the main timbers of a ship, they supply the rest from the materials of prizes which they have made; and thus find the secret of producing new and swift-sailing vessels from the ruins of the old. Of all the states on the coast of Barbary, the Algerines are the strongest at sea.\n\nThe religion of the Algerines is chiefly distinguished from that of the Turks by a greater variety of superstitious rites. The Koran is their acknowledged rule of faith and practice; but they are not very scrupulous in the observance of it. The mufti, or high-priest; the cadi, or chief judge; and the grand marabout, are the three principal officers who preside in matters of religion. The cadi attends in the court of justice once or twice every day, to hear and determine causes; but those of superior importance are submitted to the dey himself, or, in his absence, to one of the principal officers of the regency, who sits in the gate of the palace for that express purpose. Of this custom some traces are found in sacred history, Deut. xx. 11. 15. xxvi. 7.\n\nAlgiers, a city, the capital of the above kingdom, is probably the ancient Icosium: by the Arabians called Algezair, or rather Al-Jezir, or Al-Jezarah, i.e., the island, because there was an island before the city, to which it has since been joined by a mole. It is built on the declivity of a hill by the sea side, in the form of an amphitheatre: at sea, it looks like the top-sail of a ship. The tops of the houses are quite flat and white, and have all the appearance of a bleach-field. One house rises above another in such a manner that they do not hinder each other's prospect. The streets are so narrow, that they will scarcely admit two persons to walk abreast, and the middle part is lower than the sides. When any loaded boats, such as camels, horses, mules, or asses, pass along, you are forced to stand up close to the wall to let them pass by. There is but one broad street, which runs through the city from east to west, in which are the shops of the principal merchants, and the market for corn and other commodities. The lower part of the walls of the city is of hewn stone, and the upper part of brick; they are 30 feet high on the land side, and 40 towards the sea; the fosses or ditches are 20 feet broad and 7 deep. There is no sweet water in the city; and though there is a tank or cistern in every house, yet they often want water, because it rains but seldom: the chief supply is from a spring on a hill, the water of which is conveyed...\nAlgiers, conveyed by pipes to above a hundred fountains, at which a bowl is fastened for the use of passengers. The common reservoir is at the end of the mole, where the ships take in their water. Every one takes his turn at these places, except the Turks, who are first, and the Jews last. There are five gates, which are open from sunrise till sun-setting; and seven forts or castles without the walls, the greatest of which is on the mole without the gate, all of which are well supplied with great guns. There are 10 large mosques and 50 small ones; three great colleges or public schools, and a great number of petty ones for children. The houses are square, and built of stone and brick, with a square court in the middle, and galleries all around. There are said to be about 100,000 inhabitants in the city, comprehending 5000 Jewish families, besides Christians. There are four fundics or public inns, such as are in Turkey; and six causeries, or barracks, for the unmarried Turkish soldiers, which will hold 600 each. There are no inns for Christians to lodge at; but only a few tippling huts kept by slaves, for the accommodation of Greeks and the poorer sort of travellers, where anything may be had for money. Here are bagnios or public baths, in the same manner as in Turkey, at a very moderate rate. The women have baths of their own, where the men dare not come. Without the city there is a great number of sepulchres, as also cells or chapels, dedicated to marabouts or reputed saints, which the women visit every Friday. The Turkish soldiers are great tyrants; for they not only turn others out of the way in the streets, but will go to the farmhouses in the country for 20 days together, living at free quarters, and making use of every thing, not excepting the women. The Algerines eat, as in Turkey, sitting cross-legged round a table about four inches high, and use neither knives nor forks. Before they begin, every one says Be yme Allah, \"In the name of God.\" When they have done, a slave pours water on all their hands as they sit, and then they wash their mouths. Their drink is water, sherbet, and coffee. Wine is not allowed, though drank immoderately by some. The prospect of the country and sea from Algiers is very beautiful, it being built on the declivity of a mountain; but the city, though for several ages it has braved some of the greatest powers in Christendom, it is said, could make but a faint defence against a regular siege; and that three English fifty-gun ships might batter it about the ears of its inhabitants from the harbour. If so, the Spaniards must have been very deficient either in courage or conduct. They attacked it in the year 1775, by land and by sea, but were repulsed with great loss; though they had near 20,000 foot and 2000 horse, and 47 king's ships of different rates and 346 transports. In the years 1783 and 1784, they also renewed their attacks by sea to destroy the city and galleys; but after spending a quantity of ammunition, bombs, &c., were forced to retire without either its capture or extinction. The mole of the harbour is 500 paces in length, extending from the continent to a small island where there is a castle and large battery.\n\nE. Long. 2. 12. N.

Mr Barrow, who visited this place, found, in an adjoining valley, a species of antelope, called the rietjok, or red-goat, previously unknown to naturalists. He also mentions that great advantages might accrue to the East India Company from the erection of an establishment at this place, for the purpose of preparing salted beef and fish, in consequence of the salt-pans, and the abundance of large bullocks in the vicinity; together with great numbers of excellent fish with which the coast abounds.","sp":297,"ep":310},{"h":"ALGOL","t":"a fixed star of the third magnitude, called Medusa's Head, in the constellation Perseus.

For a long time they had no rivals as hunters and warriors, and were long in alliance with the Iroquois; whom they agreed to protect from all invaders, and to let them have a share of their venison. The Iroquois, on the other hand, were to pay a tribute to their allies, out of the culture of the earth; and to perform for them all the menial duties, such as flaying the game, curing the flesh, and dressing the skins. By degrees, however, the Iroquois associated in the hunting matches and warlike expeditions of the Algonquins; so that they soon began to fancy themselves as well qualified, either for war or hunting, as their neighbours. One winter a large detachment of both nations having gone out a hunting, and secured, as they thought, a vast quantity of game, fix young Algonquins and as many Iroquois were sent out to begin the slaughter. The Algonquins, probably becoming a little jealous of their associates, upon seeing a few elks, desired the Iroquois to return on pretence that they would have sufficient employment in flaying the game they should kill; but after three days hunting, having killed none, the Iroquois exulted, and in a day or two privately set out to hunt for themselves. The Algonquins were fo exasperated at seeing their rivals return laden with game, that they murdered all the hunters in the night time. The Iroquois dissembled their resentment; but in order to be revenged, applied themselves to study the art of war as practised among those savage nations. Being afraid of engaging with the Algonquins, at first they tried their prowess on other inferior nations, and, when they thought themselves sufficiently expert, attacked the Algonquins with such diabolical fury, as showed they could be satisfied with nothing less than the extermination of the whole race; which, had it not been for the interposition of the French they would have accomplished.\u2014The few Algonquin nations, that are now to be seen, seem entirely ignorant of agriculture, and subsist by fishing and hunting. They allow themselves a plurality of wives; notwithstanding which, they daily decrease in population, few or none of their nations containing above 6000 souls, and many of them not 2000.

It derives its name from the red colour of the materials which it was originally built with, Alhambra signifying a red house. It appears to a traveller a huge heap of ugly buildings as can well be seen, all huddled together, seemingly without the least intention of forming one habitation out of them. The walls are entirely unornamented, all gravel and pebbles, daubed over with plaster by a very coarse hand; yet this is the palace of the Moorish kings of Granada, indubitably the most curious place within that exiles in Spain, perhaps in the world. In many countries may be seen excellent modern as well as ancient architecture, both entire and in ruins; but nothing to be met with anywhere else can convey an idea of this edifice, except the decorations of an opera, or the tales of the genii.\n\nPaffing round the corner of the emperor's palace, one is admitted at a plain unornamented door in a corner. On my first visit, says Mr Swinburne, I confess I was struck with amazement, as I swept over the threshold, to find myself on a sudden transported into a species of fairy land. The first place you come to is the court called the communa or del melicar, that is the common bath; an oblong square, with a deep basin of clear water in the middle; two flights of marble steps leading down to the bottom; on each side a parterre of flowers, and a row of orange trees. Round the court runs a peristyle paved with marble; the arches bear upon very slight pillars, in proportions and style different from all the regular orders of architecture. The ceilings and walls are incrusted with fretwork in stucco, so minute and intricate, that the most patient draughtsman would find it difficult to follow it, unless he made himself master of the general plan. This would facilitate the operation exceedingly; for all this work is frequently and regularly repeated at certain distances, and has been executed by means of square moulds applied successively, and the parts joined together with the utmost nicety. In every division are Arabic sentences of different lengths, most of them expressive of the following meanings: \"There is no conqueror but God;\" or, \"Obedience and honour to our lord Abouabdoulah.\" The ceilings are gilt or painted; and time has caused no diminution in the freshness of their colours, though constantly exposed to the air. The lower part of the walls is mosaic, disposed in fantastic knots and festoons. A work so novel, so exquisitely finished, and so different from all that he had ever seen, must afford a stranger the most agreeable sensations while he treads this magic ground, Alhambra.\n\nThe porches at the ends are more like grotto-work than any thing else to which they can be compared. That on the right hand opens into an octagon vault, under the emperor's palace, and forms a perfect whispering gallery, meant to be a communication between the offices of both houses.\n\nOpposite to the door of the communa through which you enter, is another leading into the quarto de los leones, or apartment of the lions; which is an oblong court, 100 feet in length and 50 in breadth, environed with a colonnade 7 feet broad on the sides and 10 at the end. Two porticoes or cabinets about 15 feet square, project into the court at the two extremities. The square is paved with coloured tiles; the colonnade with white marble. The walls are covered five feet up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, disposed chequerwise. Above and below is a border of small escutcheons, enamelled blue and gold, with an Arabic motto on a bend; signifying, \"No conqueror but God.\" The columns that support the roof and gallery are of white marble, very slender, and fantastically adorned. They are 9 feet high, including base and capital, and 8\u00bd inches diameter. They are very irregularly placed; sometimes singly, at others in groups of three, but more frequently two together. The width of the horse-shoe arches above them is four feet two inches for the large ones, and three for the smaller. The ceiling of the portico is finished in a much finer and more complicated manner than that of the communa, and the stucco laid on the walls with inimitable delicacy; in the ceiling it is so artfully frosted and handled as to exceed belief. The capitals are of various designs, though each design is repeated several times in the circumference of the court, but not the least attention has been paid to placing them regularly or opposite to each other. Not the smallest representation of animal life can be discovered amidst the varieties of foliage, grotesques, and strange ornaments. About each arch is a large square of arabesques, surrounded with a rim of characters, that are generally quotations from the Koran. Over the pillars is another square of delightful filigree work. Higher up is a wooden rim, or kind of cornice, as much enriched with carving as the stucco that covers the part underneath. Over this projects a roof of red tiles, the only thing that disfigures this beautiful square. This ugly covering is a modern addition made by a late prime minister, who a few years ago gave the Alhambra a thorough repair. In Moorish times, the building was covered with large painted and glazed tiles, of which some few are still to be seen. In the centre of the court are twelve ill-made lions muzzled, their fore parts smooth, their hind parts rough, which bear upon their backs an enormous bafon, out of which a lesser rises. While the pipes were kept in good order, a great volume of water was thrown up, that, falling down into the bafons, palled through the beasts, and issued out of their mouths into a large reservoir, where it communicated by channels with the jet d'eau in the apartments. This fountain is of white marble, embellished with many festoons and Arabic ditiches, thus translated:\n\n\"Seest thou not how the water flows copiously like the Nile?\"\nThis resembles a sea washing over its shores, threatening shipwreck to the mariner.\n\nThis water runs abundantly, to give drink to the lions.\n\nTerrible as the lion is our king in the day of battle.\n\nThe Nile gives glory to the king, and the lofty mountains proclaim it.\n\nThis garden is fertile in delights: God takes care that no noxious animal shall approach it.\n\nThe fair princess that walks in this garden, covered with pearls, augment its beauty so much, that thou mayst doubt whether it be a fountain that flows, or the tears of her admirers.\n\nPalling along the colonnade, and keeping on the south side, you come to a circular room occupied by the men as a place for drinking coffee, &c. A fountain in the middle refreshed the apartment in summer. The form of this hall, the elegance of its cupola, the cheerful distribution of light from above, and the exquisite manner in which the stucco is designed, painted, and finished, exceed all powers of description. Every thing in it inspires the most pleasing voluptuous ideas: yet in this sweet retreat they pretend that Abouabdoulah assembled the Abencerrages, and caused their heads to be struck off into the fountain. Continuing your walk round, you are next brought to a couple of rooms at the head of the court, which are supposed to have been tribunals or audience chambers.\n\nOpposite to the Sala de los Abencerrajes is the entrance into the Torre de las dos hermanas, or the tower of the two sisters; so named from two very beautiful pieces of marble laid as flags in the pavement. This gate exceeds all the rest in profusion of ornaments, and in beauty of prospect which it affords through a range of apartments, where a multitude of arches terminate in a large window open to the country. In a gleam of sunshine, the variety of tints and lights thrown upon this enfilade are uncommonly rich. The first hall is the concert-room, where the women sit; the musicians played above in four balconies. In the middle is a jet d'eau. The marble pavement is equal to the finest existing, for the size of the flags and evenness of the colour. The two sisters which give name to the room, are slabs that measure 15 feet by 7\u00bd, without flaw or stain. The walls, up to a certain height, are mosaic, and above are divided into very neat compartments of stucco, all of one design, which is also followed in many of the adjacent halls and galleries. The ceiling is a fretted cove. To preserve this vaulted roof, as well as some of the other principal cupolas, the outward walls of the towers are raised 10 feet above the top of the dome, and support another roof over all, by which means no damage can ever be caused by wet weather or excessive heat and cold. From this hall you pass round the little myrtle garden of Lindaraza, into an additional building made to the east end by Charles V. The rooms are small and low. His dear motto, Plus oultre, appears on every beam. This leads to a little tower, projecting from the line of the north wall, called el recador, or the dressing-room of the sultana. It is a small square cabinet, in the middle of an open gallery, from which it receives light by a door and three windows. The look-out is charming. In one corner is a large marble flag, drilled full of holes, through which the smoke of perfumes ascended from furnaces below; and here, it is presumed, the Moorish queen was wont to sit to fumigate and sweeten her person. The emperor caused this pretty room to be painted with representations of his wars, and a great variety of grotesques, which appear to be copies, or at least imitations, of those in the loggie of the Vatican. From hence you go through a long passage to the hall of ambassadors, which is magnificently decorated with innumerable varieties of mosaics, and the mottos of all the kings of Granada. This long narrow antechamber opens into the commun on the left hand, and on the right into the great audience-hall in the tower of Comares; a noble apartment, 36 feet square, 36 high up to the cornice, and 18 from thence to the centre of the cupola. The walls on three sides are 15 feet thick, on the other 9; the lower range of windows 13 feet high. The whole wall is inlaid with mosaic of many colours, disposed in intricate knots, stars, and other figures. In every part various Arabic sentences are repeated.\n\nHaving thus completed the tour of the upper apartments, which are upon a level with the offices of the new palace, you descend to the lower floor, which consisted of bedchambers and summer-rooms; the back stairs and passages, that facilitated the intercourse between them, are without number. The most remarkable room below is the king's bedchamber, which communicated by means of a gallery with the upper story. The beds were placed in two alcoves, upon a raised pavement of blue and white tiles; but as it was repaired by Philip V, who passed some time here, it cannot be said how it may have been in former times. A fountain played in the middle, to refresh the apartment in hot weather. Behind the alcoves are small doors, that conduct you to the royal baths. These consist of one small closet with marble cisterns for washing children, two rooms for grown-up persons, and vaults for boilers and furnaces that supplied the baths with water and the stoves with vapours. The troughs are formed of large slabs of white marble; the walls are beautified with party-coloured earthen ware; light is admitted by holes in the coved ceiling.\n\nHard by is a whispering gallery, and a kind of labyrinth, said to have been made for the diversion of the women and children. One of the passages of communication is fenced off with a strong iron grate, and called the prison of the Sultana; but it seems more probable that it was put up to prevent any body from climbing up into the women's quarter.\n\nUnder the council-room is a long flue, called the king's study; and adjoining to it are several vaults, said to be the place of burial of the royal family. In the year 1574, four sepulchres were opened; but as they contained nothing but bones and ashes, were immediately closed again.\n\nThis description of the Alhambra may be finished by observing how admirably every thing was planned and calculated for rendering this palace the most voluptuous of all retirements; what plentiful supplies of water were brought to refresh it in the hot months of summer; what a free circulation of air was contrived, by the judicious disposition of doors and windows; what shady gardens of aromatic trees; what noble views over the beautiful hills and fertile plains! No wonder\nAli wondered the Moors regretted Granada; no wonder that they still offer up prayers to God every Friday for the recovery of this city, which they regard as a terrestrial paradise!\n\nAli, the son of Abu Taleb, is one of the most celebrated characters in Mahometan history. He was cousin to Mahomet; and at the age of fourteen engaged with youthful ardour in his cause. When Mahomet first revealed his prophetic character to his friends, and inquired who among them would undertake to be his companion, Ali exclaimed, \"O Prophet, I will be thy attendant; the man who dares to rise against thee I will break his legs, pluck out his eyes, dash out his teeth, and even rip up his belly.\" Mahomet accepted his services, and honoured him with the titles of brother, vicegerent, and Aaron to a new Moses. He was remarkable both for eloquence and valour; and the latter obtained him the surname of \"the Lion of God, always victorious.\" He succeeded to the chief dignity of the renowned house of Hashem, and was also hereditary guardian of the temple and city of Mecca. Mahomet gave him his daughter Fatimah in marriage, and the grandfather lived to embrace the children of his daughter. These advantages induced Ali to cast a wilful eye towards the regal succession; however, Abubeker, Omar, and Othman reigned before him. But after the death of the latter he was saluted caliph by the chiefs of the tribes, and the companions of the Prophet, when he was repairing to the mosque of Medina at the hour of prayer, A.D. 655. Hegir. 35.\n\nAyetha, the widow of the Prophet, strenuously opposed his succession; and under her influence two powerful chiefs soon raised the standard of rebellion. Ali greatly increased his difficulties by the imprudent removal of all the governors of provinces from their station. Telha and Zobeir, two chiefs of great influence, collected a numerous army, and induced Ayetha to attend them to the field of battle; but Ali gained a complete victory and took Ayetha prisoner. Telha fell in the field, and Zobeir was affiliated after surrendering upon promise of quarter. This dastardly action was severely reprehended by Ali. He likewise kindly treated the captive widow, and sent her back to the tomb of the Prophet.\n\nAli next attacked Moawiyah, who had been proclaimed caliph, and strongly supported by a powerful and numerous party. When the two armies approached each other, Ali proposed to decide the matter by single combat, but to this his opponent would not agree. Several skirmishes were fought with considerable loss on both sides; but at length a pious fraud produced a division of sentiment in the army of Ali. They fixed to the points of lances a number of copies of the Koran, carried them before the troops, and exclaimed, saying, \"This is the book which forbids Muslims to shed each other's blood, and ought therefore to decide our disputes.\" Ali was constrained to yield, and umpires were mutually chosen; on the side of Ali, Abu Moulla; Amru, the conqueror of Egypt, on the part of Moawiyah. The day of final decision arrived. Abu Moulla ascended the pulpit, and cried, \"As I draw this ring from my finger, so I depose both Ali and Moawiyah from the caliphate.\" When Amru ascended, he cried, \"As I put on this ring, so I invest Moawiyah with the caliphate, and also depose Ali.\" He also added, that Othman the former caliph had declared Moawiyah both his successor and avenger. Thus began that memorable contest among the Mahometans which was long agitated with considerable violence by both parties.\n\nAli was highly enraged at this injustice; but, constrained for the present to yield, he retired to Kufa. A sect of enthusiasts called the Kharejites revolted against Ali; but he quickly reduced them to subjection, and again obtained possession of Arabia. But Syria, Persia, and Egypt fell to the share of his rival.\n\nAn unexpected event terminated the existing disputes. Three Kharejites one day converging together concerning the blood which had been shed, and the impending calamities, resolved to assassinate Ali, Moawiyah, and Amru, the three authors of the present disasters. They provided themselves with poisoned swords, and hastened to accomplish their purpose. Moawiyah was wounded, but the wound did not prove fatal. A friend of Amru fell in his stead. Ali was fatally wounded at the door of the mosque, and in the sixty-third year of his age, he expired on the fifth day after his wound, A.D. 660. A.Hegir. 40.\n\nAli had eight wives besides Fatimah, and left a numerous family who were very remarkable for their valour. He also rose to high eminence for learning and wisdom; and of his works there are still extant a hundred maxims, a collection of verses, and a prophecy of all the great events which are to happen to the end of time. One of his sayings may be quoted as an example. \"He who would be rich without wealth, powerful without subjects, and a subject without a master, has only to forsake sin, and serve God.\"\n\nThe Mussulmans term Ali the heir of Mahomet, and the accepted of God, and his particular followers have possessed various states in Africa and Asia, and the Persian part of the Ufhe Tartars; and some love-reigns of India are at present of the feet of Ali. A monument is raised upon his tomb near Kufa, which the kings of Persia have successively decorated and religiously revered. Near the ruins of Kufa a city named Meftied Ali has been built to his memory. Some of his deluded followers imagine that he is still alive, and that he will revisit the earth and fill the same with justice. A green turban still continues to distinguish the descendants of Ali. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAli Bey, an eastern adventurer, is said to have been a native of Mount Caucasus, and about the age of twelve or fourteen he was sold for a slave in Cairo. The two Jews who became his masters presented him to Ibrahim, then one of the most respectable men in the kingdom. In the family of this powerful man he received the rudiments of literature, and was also instructed in the military art. Both in letters and military skill he made a rapid improvement. He gradually gained the affection of his patron to such a degree, that he gave him his freedom, permitted him to marry, promoted him to the rank of governor of a district; and afterwards by election he was raised to the elevated station of one of the governors of provinces. Deprived of his protector by death, and engaging in the dangerous intrigues that pave the way to power in that unstable government, he procured his own banishment to Upper-Egypt. Here he spent two years in maturing...\nhis schemes for future greatness, and in 1766, returning to Cairo, he either flew or expelled the beys, and seized the reins of government.\n\nEmboldened by success, he refused himself from the power of the Porte, coined money in his own name, and boldly assumed the rank of sultan of Egypt. Occupied in more important concerns, the Porte made no vigorous opposition to his measures, and Ali Bey seized this favourable opportunity to recover a part of the S\u00fbd or Upper Egypt, which had been taken by an Arab sheik. Next he sent out a fleet from Suez, which seized upon Djedda, entered the port of Mecca; while a body of cavalry, commanded by Mohammed Bey his favourite, took and plundered Mecca itself. A young Venetian merchant laid before him a plan of reviving the ancient trade to the East Indies through the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Having formed an alliance, in 1772, with one Sheik Daher, a rebel against the Porte in Syria, he aimed at the conquest of all Syria and Palestine. He first endeavoured to secure Gaza; then his army forming a junction with that of Daher at a place called Acre, advanced to Damascus. On the 6th of June 1771, a battle was fought at this place with the Turkish pachas, and Mohammed and Daher the commanders of Ali Bey routed them with great slaughter. They instantly took possession of Damascus, and the castle itself had also capitulated, when all on a sudden Mohammed hastened back to Egypt with all his Mamelukes. Some ascribe this strange conduct to an impression made upon Mohammed by the Turkish agents, and others to a report of the death of Ali Bey.\n\nAlthough unsuccessful, Ali Bey never lost sight of his favourite object, and Mohammed losing his confidence was forced to save his life by exile. Mohammed, however, quickly returned with an army and drove Ali Bey from Cairo. In this unfortunate state of affairs Ali Bey fled to Daher, and combining their forces, they attacked the Turkish commander at Sidon, and came off victorious, although the Turkish army was three times their number. After a siege of eight months they next took the town of Jaffa. Deceived by letters from Cairo which were only intended to enflame him, and stimulated with recent victories, he returned to Cairo. Entering the deserts which divide Gaza from Egypt, he was furiously attacked by a thousand chosen Mamelukes led on by Murad Bey, who was enamoured with the beauty of Ali Bey's wife, and had obtained the promise of her, provided that he could take Ali Bey captive. Murad wounded and made Ali Bey prisoner, and carried him to Mohammed, who received him with affected respect; but in three days, either in consequence of poison or the effects of his wounds, Ali breathed his last.\n\nAli Bey was certainly a singular production in the school of ignorance and barbarity, and displayed a very great degree of original vigour of character and active penetration of mind. He is blamed for engaging in enterprises beyond his power to accomplish; but he is acknowledged to have been very favourable to the Franks, and to have governed Egypt with no small degree of steady moderation. He is also charged with devolving too much upon his lieutenants, and not being sufficiently attentive to the exactions made by his officers. Among his failings may also be ranked that of an unbounded confidence in his favourite. Generosity Aljameia and a sense of justice were not wanting in his character, although his morals, under the sanction of his clads and country, were strongly tainted with perfidy and murder in the pursuit of his ambitious plans. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALJAMEIA is a name which the Moriscos in Spain give to the language of the Spaniards. Among other articles agreed on by the junto, which was appointed by the emperor Charles V. in 1526, in favour of the Moriscos, this was one, that the Moriscos should no longer speak Algavareia, i.e. Moorish, or Arabic; but should all speak Aljameia, i.e. Spanish, as it was called by the Moors, and all their writings and contracts should be in that language.","sp":311,"ep":314},{"h":"ALIAS","t":"in Law, a second or farther writ issued from the courts of Westminster, after a copias, &c. sued out without effect.","sp":314,"ep":314},{"h":"ALIBI","t":"in Law, denotes the absence of the accused from the place where he is charged with having committed a crime; or his being elsewhere, as the word imports, at the time specified.","sp":314,"ep":314},{"h":"ALICANT","t":"a large sea-port town in the province of Valencia, and territory of Segura.

The word is formed from the Latin alius, \"another;\" q.d., one born in another country. An alien is incapable of inheriting lands in Britain till naturalized by an act of parliament. No alien is entitled to vote at the election of members of parliament; nor can he enjoy any office, or be returned on any jury, unless where an alien is party in a cause, when the inquest is composed of an equal number of denizens and aliens. The reasons for establishing these laws were, that every man is professed to bear faith and love to that prince and country where he received protection during his infancy.\nALIEN; and that one prince might not settle spies in another's country; but chiefly that the rents and revenues of the country might not be drawn to the subjects of another. Some have thought that the laws against aliens were introduced in the time of Henry II. when a law was made at the parliament of Wallingford, for the expulsion of strangers, in order to drive away the Flemings and Picards introduced into the kingdom by the wars of King Stephen. Others have thought that the origin of this law was more ancient; and that it is an original branch of the feudal law: for by that law no man can purchase any lands but he must be obliged to do fealty to the lords of whom the lands are holden; so that an alien who owed a previous faith to another prince, could not take an oath of fidelity in another sovereign's dominions. Among the Romans only the Cives Romani were effectually freedmen; but when their territories increased, all the Italians were made free under the name of Latins, though they had not the privilege of wearing gold rings till the time of Justinian.

All persons who have a right to lands may generally alien them to others; but some alienations are prohibited; such as alienations by tenants for life, &c., whereby they incur a forfeiture of their estate. By the statute of Edward I., a bar was put to alienations by what we call entails, which is an expedient for procuring perpetuities in families; but counter-expedients were devised to defeat this intent, and a practice was introduced of cutting off entails by fines, and of barring remainders and reversions by recoveries. The statute for alienations in Henry VII.'s time had a great effect on the constitution of this kingdom; as, among other regulations of that reign, it tended to throw the balance of power more into the hands of the people. By the stat. 12 Car. II. cap. 24, fines for alienations are taken away. Crown lands are only alienable under a faculty of perpetual redemption. The council of Lateran, held in 1123, forbids any clerk to alienate his benefice, prebend, or the like. By the laws of the ancient Jews, lands could only be alienated for the space of 50 years. At each return of the jubilee all returned again to the primitive owners, or their descendants, to whom the lands were originally allotted at the first distribution of Canaan.\n\nALIENATION Office, is an office to which all writs of covenants and entry, upon which fines are levied, and recoveries suffered, are carried, to have fines for alienation set and paid thereon.\n\nALIMENT (from alio to nourish), implies food both solid and liquid: from which, by the process of digestion, is prepared a very mild, sweet, and whitish liquor, resembling milk, and distinguished by the name of chyle; which being absorbed by the lacteal veins, by them conveyed into the circulation, and there assimilated into the nature of blood, affords that supply of nutrition which the continual waste of the body is found to require.\u2014Next to air, food is the most necessary thing for the preservation of our bodies; and as on the choice thereof our health greatly depends, it is of great importance to understand, in general, what is the proper diet for our nourishment; and, in particular deviations from health, what is the best adapted to restore us. The blood and fluids naturally incline to waste and diminish: fresh chyle, duly received, prevents this waste and diminution, and preserves in them that mild state which alone consorts with health. An animal diet affords the most of this bland nutritious mucilage; watery fluids dilute the too gross parts, and carry off what is become unfit for use. It is only the small portion of jelly which is separated from the farnaceous parts of vegetables, that, after being much elaborated, is converted into the animal nature; yet the use of vegetables prevents both repletion and a too great tendency to a putrefactive acrimony of the blood. In hot climates, as well as against the constitutional heat of particular persons, vegetables are demanded in the largest proportion. Animal substances afford the highest relish while our appetite continues; but will satiate the appetite before the stomach is duly filled. Vegetables may be eaten after either flesh or fish: few herbs or fruits satiate so much as that the stomach may not be filled with them, when it is already satisfied with flesh or fish; whence it may be observed, that no diet which is very nourishing can be eaten to fulness, because its nutritious parts are oily and satiating. Health depends almost wholly on a proper draft of the blood; and to preserve this a mixture of vegetables in some degree is always required, for a loathing is soon the consequence of animal food alone: hot acid habits, too, receive from milk and vegetables the needful for correcting their excesses; but in cold, pituitous, and nervous habits, who want most nourishment from least digestion, and from the smallest quantity of food, animal diet is to be used more freely.\n\nThus much being offered as general principles with respect to the matter and quality of our aliment, the valetudinarian may easily regulate his diet with some advantage to himself by an attention to the few ensuing particulars. In winter, eat freely, but drink sparingly: roast meat is to be preferred, and what is drunk should be stronger than at other seasons. In summer, let thirst determine the quantity to be drunk; cold stomachs never require much: boiled meats and vegetables, if not otherwise contraindicated, may now be more freely used. Lax habits require the winter's diet to be continued all the year, and rigid ones should be confined to that of summer. Fat people should fast\nALI\n\nAliquot at times, but the lean should never do so. Those who are troubled with eruptions occasioned by their food should drink but little, and use some unaccustomed exercise. The thirsty should drink freely, but eat sparingly. In general, let moderation be observed; and though no dinner hath been had, a light supper is at all times to be preferred. After very high seasoned meats, a glass of water acidulated with the acid elixir of vitriol, or in very weak stomachs the sweet elixir of vitriol, is far more afflignant to the work of digestion than the common method of taking brandy.

Antoninus Pius did the same for a number of maids, at the solicitation of Faustina; and hence, in some medals of that empress, we read PVEILLAE FAVSTINIANAE.\u2014Alexander Severus did like at the request of Mamaea; and the maids thus educated were called Mammeae.\n\nAlimentary Duct or Canal, is a name given by Dr Tylor and some others to that part of the body through which the food passes from its reception into the mouth to its exit at the anus; including the gula, stomach, and intestines. See Anatomy.\n\nThis duct has been said to be the true characteristic of an animal, or (in the jargon of the schools) in proprium quarto modo; no animal being without it. Plants receive their nourishment by the numerous fibres of their roots; but have no common receptacle for digesting the food received, or for carrying off the recrements. But in all, even the lowest degree of animal life, we may observe a stomach and intestines, even where we cannot perceive the least formation of any organ of the senses, unless that common one of feeling, as in oysters.

The fleet of Allectus was stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them; but under the cover of a thick fog, the invaders escaped their notice, and landed in safety on the western coast, and, according to Gibbon, convinced the Britons \"that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion.\" No sooner had the intrepid commander disembarked his forces, than he set fire to his ships, and marched forward to meet the enemy. In expectation of an attack from Constantius, who commanded the fleet off Boulogne, the usurper had taken his station in the vicinity of London; but informed of the defeat of Asclepiodotus, he made forced marches to oppose his progress. Allectus attacked the imperial troops, and his army being reduced to a small number of fatigued and dispirited men, he fell in the field, and his forces received a total defeat. Thus, in one day, and by a single battle, the fate of this great island was decided; and Britain, after a separation of 10 years, was restored to the Roman empire, A.D. 297. Constantius landing on the shores of Kent, was saluted with the loud applause and unanimous acclamations of obedient subjects, and welcomed to the British soil.","sp":318,"ep":318},{"h":"ALLEGAS","t":"or ALLEGAS, a fluff manufactured in the East Indies.

Cumberland is its chief town.\n\nAlleghany County, in Pennsylvania, extends from the junction of the river of that name with the Ohio, where its chief town, Pittsburgh, is situated, to the New-York line. It contains 10,309 inhabitants, including 159 slaves.\n\nAlleghany Mountains, between the Atlantic ocean, the Mississippi river, and the lakes, are a long and broad range of mountains, made up of a great number of ridges, extending north-easterly and south-Alleghany, westerly, nearly parallel to the sea coast, about 900 Alleghany miles in length, and from 60 to 150 and 250 miles in breadth. Mr. Evans observes, with respect to that part of these mountains which he travelled over, viz., in the back parts of Pennsylvania, that scarcely one acre in ten is capable of culture. This, however, is far from being the case in all parts of this range. Numerous tracts of fine arable and grazing land intervene between the ridges. The different ridges which compose this immense range of mountains, have different names in the different states, viz., the Blue Ridge, the North Mountain, or North Ridge, or Devil's Back-Bone, Laurel Ridge, Jackson's Mountains, and Kittatinny Mountains. All these different and immense ridges, except the Alleghany, are broken through by rivers, which appear to have forced their way through solid rocks. This principal ridge is more immediately called Alleghany, and is descriptively named the Backbone of the United States. From these several ridges proceed innumerable branches, or spurs.\n\nThe general name of the whole range, taken collectively, seems not yet to have been determined. Mr. Evans calls them the Endless Mountains; others have called them the Appalachian Mountains, from a tribe of Indians who live on a river which proceeds from this mountain, called the Appalachiola; but the most common name is the Alleghany Mountains, so called, probably, from the principal ridge of the range. These mountains are not confusedly scattered, rising here and there into high peaks, towering each other; but run along in uniform ridges, scarcely half a mile high. They spread as you proceed south, and some of them terminate in high perpendicular bluffs; others gradually subside into a level country, giving rise to the rivers which run southerly into the gulf of Mexico.\n\nAlleghany River, in Pennsylvania, rises on the western side of the Alleghany mountains, and after running about 200 miles in a south-west direction, meets the Monongahela at Pittsburg, and both united form the Ohio. The lands on each side of this river, for 150 miles above Pittsburg, consist of white oak and chestnut ridges, and in many places of poor pitch pines, interspersed with tracts of good land, and low meadows. This river, and the Ohio likewise, from its head waters until it enters the Mississippi, are known and called by the name of Alleghany River, by the Seneca, and other tribes of the Six Nations, who once inhabited it.","sp":318,"ep":318},{"h":"ALLEGIANCE","t":"in Law, is the tie, or ligamen, which binds the subject to the king, in return for that protection which the king affords the subject. The thing itself, or substantial part of it, is founded in reason and the nature of government; the name and the form are derived to us from our Gothic ancestors. Under the feudal system, every owner of lands held them in subjection to some superior or lord, from whom or from whose ancestors the tenant or vassal had received them; and there was a mutual trust or confidence subsisting between the lord and vassal, that the lord should protect the vassal in the enjoyment of the territory he had granted him; and, on the other hand, that the vassal should be faithful to the lord, and defend him against all his enemies. This obligation on the part of the vassal was called his fidelitas.\nAllegiance, fidelitas or fealty; and an oath of fealty was required by the feudal law to be taken by all tenants to their landlord, which is couched in almost the same terms as our ancient oath of allegiance; except that, in the usual oath of fealty, there was frequently a favoring or exception of the faith due to a superior lord by name, under whom the landlord himself was perhaps only a tenant or vassal. But when the acknowledgment was made to the absolute superior himself, who was vassal to no man, it was no longer called the oath of fealty, but the oath of allegiance; and therein the tenant swore to bear faith to his sovereign lord, in opposition to all men, without any favoring or exception. Land held by this exalted species of fealty, was called feudum ligium, a liege fee; the vassals homines ligii, or liege men; and the sovereign, their dominus ligius, or liege lord. And when sovereign princes did homage to each other for lands held under their respective sovereignties, a distinction was always made between simple homage, which was only an acknowledgment of tenure; and liege homage, which included the fealty before mentioned, and the services consequent upon it. In Britain, it becoming a fettered principle of tenure, that all lands in the kingdom are holden of the king as their sovereign and lord paramount, no oath but that of fealty could ever be taken to inferior lords; and the oath of allegiance was necessarily confined to the person of the king alone. By an easy analogy, the term of allegiance was soon brought to signify all other engagements which are due from subjects to their prince, as well as those duties which were simply and merely territorial. And the oath of allegiance, as administered in England for upwards of 600 years, contained a promise \"to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour, and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him, without defending him therefrom.\" But, at the Revolution, the terms of this oath being thought perhaps to favour too much the notion of non-resistance, the present form was introduced by the convention parliament, which is more general and indeterminate than the former; the subject only promising \"that he will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the king,\" without mentioning \"his heirs,\" or specifying in the least wherein that allegiance confits. The oath of supremacy is principally calculated as a renunciation of the pope's pretended authority; and the oath of abjuration, introduced in the reign of King William, very amply supplies the loose and general texture of the oath of allegiance; recognizing the right of his majesty, derived under the act of settlement; engaging to support him to the utmost of the juror's power; promising to disclose all traitorous conspiracies against him; and expressly renouncing any claim of the defendants of the late pretender, in as clear and explicit terms as the English language can furnish. This oath must be taken by all persons in any office, trust, or employment; and may be tendered by two justices of the peace to any person whom they shall suspect of disaffection. And the oath of allegiance may be tendered to all persons above the age of twelve years, whether natives, denizens, or aliens.\n\nBut, besides these express engagements, the law also holds that there is an implied, original, and virtual allegiance, owing from every subject to his sovereign, antecedently to any express promise, and although the subject never swore any faith or allegiance in form. Thus Sir Edward Coke very justly observes, that \"all subjects are equally bounden to their allegiance as if they had taken the oath; because it is written by the finger of the law in their hearts, and the taking of the corporal oath is but an outward declaration of the same.\"\n\nAllegiance, both express and implied, is however distinguished by the law into two sorts or species, the one natural, the other local; the former being also perpetual, the latter temporary.\n\nNatural allegiance is such as is due from all men born within the king's dominions immediately upon their birth. For, immediately upon their birth, they are under the king's protection; at a time too, when (during their infancy) they are incapable of protecting themselves. Natural allegiance is, therefore, a debt of gratitude; which cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or altered, by any change of time, place, or circumstance, nor by anything but the united concurrence of the legislature. A Briton who removes to France, or to China, owes the same allegiance to the king of Britain there as at home, and 20 years hence as well as now. For it is a principle of universal law, That the natural born subject of one prince cannot by any act of his own, no, not by swearing allegiance to another, put off or discharge his natural allegiance to the former; for this natural allegiance was intrinsic and primitive, and antecedent to the other; and cannot be divested without the concurrent act of that prince to whom it was first due.\n\nLocal allegiance is such as is due from an alien, or stranger born, for so long time as he continues within, the king's dominion and protection; and it ceases the instant such stranger transfers himself from this kingdom to another. Natural allegiance is therefore perpetual, and local temporary only; and that for this reason, evidently founded upon the nature of government. That allegiance is a debt due from the subject, upon an implied contract with the prince; that so long as the one affords protection, so long the other will demean himself faithfully.\n\nThe oath of allegiance, or rather the allegiance itself, is held to be applicable, not only to the political capacity of the king, or regal office, but to his natural person and blood royal; and for the misapplication of their allegiance, viz. to the regal capacity or crown, exclusive of the person of the king, were the Spencers banished in the reign of Edward II. And from hence arose that principle of personal attachment and affectionate loyalty, which induced our forefathers (and, if occasion required, would doubtless induce their sons) to hazard all that was dear to them, life, fortune, and family, in defence and support of their liege lord and sovereign.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, in explanation of this allegiance, That it does not preclude resistance to the regal and regal king, when his misconduct or weakness is such as to make resistance beneficial to the community. It seems fairly presumable, that the convention parliament, which introduced the oath of allegiance in its present form, did not intend to exclude all resistance: since the\nAllegory. very authority by which the members sat together, was itself the effect of a successful opposition to an acknowledged sovereign.\n\nAgain: The allegiance above described can only be understood to signify obedience to lawful commands. If, therefore, the king should issue a proclamation, levying money or imposing any service or restraint upon the subject, beyond what the law authorized, there would exist no sort of obligation to obey such a proclamation, in consequence of having taken the oath of allegiance.\n\nNeither can allegiance be supposed to extend to the king after he is actually and absolutely deposed, driven into exile, or otherwise rendered incapable of exercising the regal office. The promise of allegiance implies, that the person to whom the promise is made continues king; that is, continues to exercise the power, and afford the protection, which belong to the office of king; for it is the possession of these which makes such a particular person the object of the oath.","sp":318,"ep":320},{"h":"ALLEGORY","t":"in Composition, consists in choosing a secondary subject, having all its properties and circumstances resembling those of the principal subject, and describing the former in such a manner as to represent the latter. The principal subject is thus kept out of view, and we are left to discover it by reflection. In other words, an allegory is, in every respect, similar to a hieroglyphical painting, excepting only that words are used instead of colours. Their effects are precisely the same: A hieroglyphic raises two images in the mind; one seen, that represents one that is not seen: An allegory does the same; the representative subject is described, and the resemblance leads us to apply the description to the subject represented.\n\nThere cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is made to represent God's own people the Jews:\n\n\"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with its shadow, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all that pass do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast doth devour it. Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted, and the branch thou madest strong for thyself.\" Psa. lxxx.\n\nNothing gives greater pleasure than an allegory, when the representative subject bears a strong analogy, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented. But most writers are unlucky in their choice, the analogy being generally so faint and obscure, as rather to puzzle than to please. Allegories, as well as metaphors and similes, are unnatural in expressing any fervent passion which totally occupies the mind. For this reason, the following speech of Macbeth is justly condemned by the learned author of the Elements of Criticism:\n\nMethought I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more! Macbeth doth murder Sleep; the innocent sleep; Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of Care, The birth of each day's life, fore Labour's bath,\n\nBalm of hurt minds, great Nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast.\n\nAct ii.

Being descended of poor parents, and educated in an obscure village, he enjoyed none of those advantages which contributed to form the other great painters of that illustrious age. He saw none of the statues of ancient Greece or Rome; nor any of the works of the established schools of Rome and Venice. But Nature was his guide; and Correggio was one of her favourite pupils. To express the facility with which he painted, he used to say that he always had his thoughts ready at the end of his pencil.\n\nThe agreeable smile, and the profusion of graces, which he gave to his madonas, saints, and children, have been taxed with being sometimes unnatural; but still they are amiable and seducing: An easy and flowing pencil, an union and harmony of colours, and a perfect intelligence of light and shade, give an astonishing relief to all his pictures, and have been the admiration both of his contemporaries and his successors. Annibal Caracci, who flourished 50 years after him, studied and adopted his manner in preference to that of any other master. In a letter to his cousin Louis, he expressed with great warmth the impression which was made on him by the first sight of Correggio's paintings: \"Every thing which I see here (says he) astonishes me; particularly the colouring and the beauty of the children. They live\u2014they breathe\u2014They smile with so much grace and so much reality, that it is impossible to refrain from smiling and partaking of their enjoyment. My heart is ready to break with grief when I think on the unhappy fate of poor Correggio\u2014that so wonderful a man (if he ought not rather to be called an angel) should finish his days so miserably, in a country where his talents were never known!\"\n\nFrom want of curiosity or of resolution, or from want of patronage, Correggio never visited Rome, but remained his whole life at Parma, where the art of painting was little esteemed, and of consequence poorly rewarded. This concurrence of unfavourable circumstances occasioned at last his premature death at the age of 40. He was employed to paint the cupola of the cathedral at Parma, the subject of which is an assumption of the Virgin: and having executed it in a manner that has long been the admiration of every person of good taste, for the grandeur of design, and especially for the boldness of the fore-shortenings (an art which he first and at once brought to the utmost perfection), he went to receive his payment. The canons of the church, either through ignorance or bafeness, found fault with his work; and although the price originally agreed upon had been very moderate, they alleged that it was far above the merit of the artist, and forced him to accept of the paltry sum of 200 livres; which, to add to the indignity, they paid him in copper money. To carry home this unworthy load to his indigent wife and children, poor Correggio had to travel five or eight miles from Parma. The weight of\nof his burden, the heat of the weather, and his chagrin at this villainous treatment, immediately threw him into a pleurisy, which in three days put an end to his life and his misfortunes.\n\nFor the preservation of this magnificent work the world is indebted to Titian. As he passed through Parma, in the suite of Charles V., he ran instantly to see the chef d'\u0153uvre of Corregio. While he was attentively viewing it, one of the principal canons of the church told him that such a grotesque performance did not merit his notice, and that they intended soon to have the whole defaced. \"Have a care of what you do,\" replied the other, \"If I were not Titian, I would certainly wish to be Corregio.\"\n\nCorregio's exclamation upon viewing a picture by Raphael is well known. Having long been accustomed to hear the most unbounded applause bestowed on the works of that divine painter, he by degrees became less desirous than afraid of seeing any of them. One, however, he at last had occasion to see. He examined it attentively for some minutes in profound silence; and then with an air of satisfaction exclaimed, \"I am still a painter.\" Julio Romano, on seeing some of Corregio's pictures at Parma, declared they were superior to anything in painting he had yet beheld. One of these no doubt would be the famous Virgin and Child, with Mary Magdalen and St. Jerome; but whether our readers are to depend upon his opinion, or upon that of Lady Millar, who in her Letters from Italy gives a very unfavourable account of it, we shall not presume to determine. This lady, however, speaks in a very different style of the less famous Notti, or Night of Corregio, of which she saw only a copy in the Duke's palace at Modena, the original having been sold for a great sum of money to the king of Poland. \"It surprises me very much (says she), to see how different the characters are in this picture from that which I already have described to you. The subject is a Nativity; and the extraordinary beauty of this picture proceeds from the clair obscur\u00e9; there are two different lights introduced, by means of which the personages are visible; namely, the light proceeding from the body of the child, and the moonlight. These two are preserved distinct, and produce a most wonderful effect. The child's body is so luminous, that the superficies is nearly transparent, and the rays of light emitted by it are verified in the effect they produce upon the surrounding objects. They are not rays distinct and separate, like those round the face of a sun that indicates an insurance office; nor linear, like those proceeding from the man in the almanack; but of a dazzling brightness: by their light you see clearly the face, neck, and hands, of the Virgin (the rest of the person being in strong shadow), the faces of the pallori who crowd round the child, and particularly one woman, who holds her hand before her face, lest her eyes should be so dazzled as to prevent her from beholding the infant. This is a beautiful natural action, and is most ingeniously introduced. The straw on which the child is laid appears gilt, from the light of his body shining on it. The moon lights up the background of the picture, which represents a landscape. Every object is distinct, as in a bright moonlight night; and there cannot be two lights in nature more different than those which appear in the same picture. The virgin and the child are of the most perfect beauty. There is a great variety of character in the different persons present, yet that uniformity common to all herdsmen and peasants. In short, this copy is so admirable, that I was quite sorry to be obliged to lose sight of it so soon; but I never shall forget it. The duke of Modena, for whom Corregio did the original picture, gave him only 600 livres of France for it; a great sum in those days: but at present, what ought it to cost?\" This great painter's death happened in 1534.","sp":320,"ep":321},{"h":"ALLEGRI","t":"Gregorio, an ecclesiastic by profession, and a celebrated composer of music of the 17th century, was a native of Rome. He was the disciple of Nanni, the intimate friend and contemporary of Palestrina. His abilities as a singer were not remarkable, but he was deemed an excellent master of harmony; and so much respected by all the musical professors of his time, that the pope, in the year 1629, appointed him to be one of the singers of his chapel. To his uncommon merit as a composer of church music, he united an excellent moral character, exhibiting in his actions the devotion and benevolence of his heart. The poor crowded daily to his door, whom he relieved to the utmost of his ability; and not content with these beneficent actions, he daily visited the prisons of Rome, in order to relieve the most deserving and afflicted objects which were immured in these dreary mansions. With such divine simplicity and purity of harmony, did he compose many parts of the church service, that his lofs was feverishly felt and sincerely lamented by the whole college of singers in the papal service. He died Feb. 18, 1652, and was interred in the Chiesa Nuova, in a vault destined for the reception of deceased singers in the pope's chapel, before the chapel of S. Filippo Neri, near the altar of annunciation.\n\nAmong his other musical works preserved in the pontifical chapel, is the celebrated mi\u00e9rere, which, for 170 years, has been annually performed at that chapel on Wednesday and Good Friday, in Passion-week, by the choral band, and the best singers in Italy. It is, however, generally believed, that it owes its reputation more to the manner in which it is performed, than to the composition itself. The beauty and effect of the music is not discernible upon paper, but the fingers have, by tradition, certain customs, expressions, and graces of convention, which produce wonderful effects. Some of the effects produced may be justly attributed to the time, the place, and the solemnity of the ceremonials observed during the performance. \"The pope and conclave are all prostrated on the ground, the candles of the chapel and the torches of the balustrade are extinguished one by one, and the last verse of this psalm is terminated by two choirs; the maglia di capello beating time slower and slower, and the fingers diminishing, or rather extinguishing the harmony by little and little, to a perfect point.\" Padre Martini says, that there were never more than three copies made by authority, \"one of which was for the emperor Leopold, one for the late king of Portugal, and the other for himself; but a very complete one was presented by the pope himself to King George III., as an inestimable curiosity.\" (Gen.

In 1655, he became afflant to Mr Newton, in Taunton Magdalen, in Somersetshire; but was deprived for nonconformity. He died in 1668, aged 35. He was a man of great learning, and greater charity; preserving, though a nonconformist, and a severe sufferer on that account, great respect for the church, and loyalty to his sovereign. He wrote several books of piety, which are highly esteemed; but his Alarm to unconverted sinners is more famous than the rest. There have been many editions of this little pious work, the sale of which has been very great; of the edition 1672, there were 20,000 sold; of that of 1675, with this title, A sure guide to heaven, 50,000.

There he soon obtained the degree of master of arts, and after he entered into holy orders, first as an afflant to his father, and afterwards as rector of Batcomb, in Somersetshire, he discharged the duties of a clergyman with great industry and singular fidelity. From his education, he conceived an early predilection for the sentiments of the Puritans, and consequently, in the contest between Charles I. and the parliament, he firmly adhered to the latter. Having adopted these sentiments, he sometimes received a little disturbance from the king's forces, but he never carried his opposition to any undue length. He, along with several others, signed a paper, entitled \"The Testimony of the Ministers of Somersetshire to the truth of Christ,\" in which their declared principles and becoming candour were amply displayed. Along with his father, he was employed by the commissioners appointed by parliament for ejecting scandalous ministers; a commission which was executed with rigour, and originated in intolerance.\n\nUpon the Restoration he manifested a disposition to loyalty, but unable with a good conscience to unite in the act of conformity, he resigned his living after enjoying it for 20 years, and ranked with the meritorious band of sufferers, to the number of 2000, commonly denominated the ejected ministers. In the house of Mr More who had been a member of the parliament, he exercised the duties of his ministerial office under the penalties of that act, and was consequently reprimanded by the magistrates and imprisoned; but his piety and exemplary conduct, procured him a mitigation of punishment. But no dangers could deter him from duty; for although constrained to remove from that place in consequence of the \"five-mile act,\" he continued in the discharge of his ministerial office at Frome Selwood. Here he remained until he terminated his labours by death, in 1681.\n\nPiety, boldness, activity, and candour, shone in the character of Richard Allein. He was admired as a pathetic and practical preacher, and justly respected for the diligence with which he discharged the public and private duties of his profession. Mr Jenkins, the vicar of the parish where he resided, preached his funeral sermon, and bore an honourable testimony to his activity, moderation, and piety. Richard Allein, similar to his nonconformist brethren, closely confined his studies and publications to subjects of religion. His works are strongly marked with the peculiar features of the religious character then prevalent among the nonconformists. They have been frequently reprinted, and very much perused. His most celebrated work is \"Vindicatio Pietatis, or a Vindication of Godliness in its greatest Strictness and Spirituality, with directions for a godly life;\" this book was published in 1665, without a printer's name; and being unlicensed, the copies of it were seized and sent to the king's kitchen for wafer paper.

In 1570 he quitted his college and fellowship, and retired to Gloucesterhall; where he studied very closely, and became famous for his knowledge in antiquity, philosophy, and mathematics. Having received an invitation from Henry earl of Northumberland, a great friend and patron of the mathematicians, he spent some time at the earl's house, where he became acquainted with those celebrated mathematicians Thomas Harriot, John Dee, Walter Warner, and Nathaniel Torporley. Robert earl of Leicester had a particular esteem for Mr Allen, and would have conferred a bishopric upon him, but his love of solitude and retirement made him decline the offer. His great skill in the mathematics made the ignorant and vulgar look upon him as a magician or conjuror; the author of a book entitled Leicester's Common-wealth, has accordingly accused him with using the art of figuring, to procure the earl of Leicester's unlawful designs, and endeavouring by the black art to bring about a match betwixt him and Queen Elizabeth. But without pretending to point out the absurdity of the charge, it is certain that the earl placed such confidence in Allen, that nothing material in the state was transacted without his knowledge; and the earl had constant information, by letter from Mr Allen, of what passed in the university. Mr Allen was very curious and indefatigable in collecting scattered manuscripts relating to history, antiquity, astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics; these collections have been quoted by several learned authors, &c. and mentioned to have been in the Bibliotheca Allemanna. He published in Latin the second and third books of Claudius Ptolemy of Peleusium, Concerning the Judgment of the Stars, or, as it is commonly called, of the Quadrupartite Construction, with an exposition. He wrote also notes on many of Lilly's books, and some on John Bale's work De Scriptoribus M. Britanniae.

His natural talents, which were uncommonly vigorous, he carefully improved by an unrestrained application to study. Accordingly, his promotion was rapid. First he obtained the degree of bachelor of arts; next he was chosen moderator in philosophy; then made a canon of Christ-church, created doctor of divinity, appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, and afterwards regius professor of divinity.\n\nBut in the early part of life his studies were interrupted.\nrupted, and he was called to military service by hostile occurrences of the times. In the year 1641, he, along with many other students of Oxford, entered the royal service, and gave eminent proofs of their courage and loyal attachment. A short interval of hostilities permitted them to return to their literary pursuits; but a republican party soon after disturbed their repose, and entering Oxford, attempted to plunder the colleges. Having entered the treasury, and finding nothing but fourpence and a halter, they hastened to the deanery, and seizing many valuable articles, they locked them in an apartment, intending next day to carry them along with them. During the night, however, Allestry having a key to that apartment, found means to remove the whole of the articles. Informed that he was the cause of their disappointment, they seized him; and had they not been unexpectedly called off by an order of the earl of Essex, they would have severely wrecked their indignation upon him. In October following he again took up arms, was present at the battle of Kenilworth, and on his way to Oxford to prepare for the reception of the king he was taken prisoner, but soon afterwards released by the king's forces.\n\nA violent disease which then prevailed in the garrison of Oxford, brought Allestry to the brink of the grave; but recovering, he again joined a regiment of volunteers, chiefly consisting of Oxford students. Here he served as a common soldier, and was often seen with the musket in one hand and the book in the other. When the republican party prevailed, he returned at the termination of the war to his favourite studies, but still continued true to that side of politics which he had adopted. This conduct occasioned his expulsion from the college; but he was provided with a comfortable retreat, in the families of the honourable Francis Newport, and Sir Anthony Cope.\n\nSuch was the confidence reposed in him, that, when the friends of Charles II. were secretly preparing the way for his restoration, they entrusted him with personal messages to the king. In returning from one of these interviews, he was seized at Dover, and upon examination committed a prisoner to Lambeth-house. The earl of Shaftesbury obtained his release in a few weeks. Returning to visit his friends, and among others the learned Dr Hammond, he met his corpse at the gate of his house, carrying to the grave. This deeply afflicted his mind, and added much to his present distresses. The Doctor left him his valuable library, affixing as a reason that \"he well knew that his books in his hands would be useful weapons, for the defence of that cause he had so vigorously supported.\" This valuable library along with his own, Allestry bequeathed at his death to the university.\n\nDuring his life he erected at his own private expense the west side of the outward court of Eton college, the grammar school in Christ-church college, and settled several liberal pensions upon individual persons and families. His original biographer gives him the following character. \"Memory, fancy, judgment, elocution, great modesty, and no less assurance, a comprehension of things, and a fluency of words; an aptness for the pleasant, and sufficiency for the rugged parts of knowledge; a courage to encounter and an industry to master all things, make up the character of his happy genius. There was not in the world a man of clearer honesty and courage; no temptation could bribe him to do a base thing, or terror affright him from the doing a good one. This made his friendship as lasting and inviolable as his life, without the mean considerations of profit, or flattery of craft; without the pageantry of ceremonious addresses, the cold civility of form, and the servile fawning and obsequious flattery of others.\" He left a volume of sermons printed at Oxford in 1684, from the perusal of which posterity may judge of his literary abilities.

Dr Fuller says, that he was bred a stage-player; and that his father would have given him a liberal education, but that he was not turned for a ferious course of life. He was, however, a youth of an excellent capacity, a cheerful temper, a tenacious memory, a sweet elocution, and in his person of a stately port and aspect: all which advantages might well induce a young man to take to the theatrical profession. By several authorities we find he must have been on the stage some time before 1592; for at this time he was in high favour with the town, and greatly applauded by the best judges, particularly by Ben Jonson.\n\nHaywood, in his prologue to Marlowe's Jew of Malta, calls him Proteus for shapes, and Roscius for a tongue. He usually played the capital parts, and was one of the original actors in Shakespear's plays; in some of Ben Jonson's he was also a principal performer: but what characters he personated in either of these poets, it is difficult now to determine. This is owing to the inaccuracy of their editors, who did not print the names of the players opposite to the characters they performed, as the modern custom is; but gave one general list of actors to the whole set of plays, as in the old folio edition of Shakespear; or divided one from the other, setting the dramatic personae before the plays, and the catalogue of performers after them, as in Jonson's.\n\nIt may appear surprising how one of Mr Alleyn's profession should be enabled to erect such an edifice as Dulwich college, and liberally endow it for the maintenance of so many persons. But it must be observed that he had some paternal fortune, which, though small, might lay a foundation for his future affluence; and it is to be presumed, that the profits he received from acting, to one of his provident and managing disposition, and one who by his excellence in playing drew after him such crowds of spectators, must have considerably improved his fortune: besides he was not only an actor, but master of a playhouse built at his own expense, by which he is said to have amassed considerable wealth. He was also keeper of the king's wild beasts, or master of the royal bear-garden, which was frequented by vast crowds of spectators; and the profits arising from these sports are said to have amounted to \u00a3500 per annum. He was thrice married; and the portions of his two first wives, they leaving him no issue to inherit, might probably contribute to this benefaction. Such kind of donations have been frequently thought to proceed more from vanity and ostentation than real piety; but this of Mr Alleyn has been ascribed to a very singular cause, for the devil has been said to be the first promoter of it. Mr Aubrey mentions a tradition, \"that Mr Alleyn playing a demon, with six others, in one of Shakespear's plays, was, in the midst of the play, surprised by an apparition of the devil; which so worked on his fancy, that he made a vow, which he performed by building Dulwich college.\" He began the foundation of this college, under the direction of Inigo Jones, in 1614; and the buildings, gardens, &c. were finished in 1617, in which he is said to have expended about \u00a310,000.\n\nAfter the college was built, he met with some difficulty in obtaining a charter for settling his lands in mortmain: for he proposed to endow it with \u00a3800 per annum, for the maintenance of one master, one warden, and four fellows, three whereof were to be clergymen and the fourth a skillful organist; also five poor men and as many women, besides twelve poor boys to be educated till the age of fourteen or fifteen, and then put out to some trade or calling. The obstruction he met with arose from the lord chancellor Bacon, who wished King James to settle part of those lands for the support of two academical lectures; and he wrote a letter to the marquis of Buckingham, dated August 18, 1618, entreating him to use his interest with his majesty for that purpose. Mr Alleyn's solicitation was however at last complied with, and he obtained the royal license, giving him full power to lay his foundation, by his majesty's letter patent, bearing date the 21st of June 1619; by virtue whereof he did, in the chapel of the said new hospital at Dulwich, called The College of God's Gift, on the 13th of September following, publicly read and publish a quattuorpartite writing in parchment, whereby he created and established the said college; he then subscribed it with his name, and fixed his seal to several parts thereof, in presence of several honourable persons, and ordered copies of the writings to four different parishes. He was himself the first master of his college; so that to make use of the words of Mr Haywood, one of his contemporaries, \"He was so mingled with humility and charity, that he became his own penitent, humbly submitting himself to that proportion of diet and clothes which he had bestowed on others.\" We have no reason to think he ever repented of this distribution of his substance; but on the contrary, that he was entirely satisfied, as appears from the following memorial in his own writing, found amongst his papers: \"May 26, 1620.\u2014My wife and I acknowledged the fine at the common pleas bar, of all our lands to the college: blest be God that he has given us life to do it.\" His wife died in the year 1623; and about two years afterwards he married Constance Kinchtoe, who survived him, and received remarkable...\nremarkable proofs of his affection, if at least we may judge of it by his will, wherein he left her considerably. He died Nov. 25, 1626, in the 61st year of his age, and was buried in the chapel of his new college, where there is a tombstone over his grave, with an inscription. His original Diary is also there preserved.\n\nThe subjoined anecdote is entertaining in itself, and shows the high esteem in which Mr Alleyn was held as an actor: \"Edward Alleyn, the Garrick of Shakespeare's time, had been on the most friendly footing with our poet, as well as Ben Jonson. They used frequently to spend their evenings together at the sign of the Globe, somewhere near Black Friars, where the playhouse then was. The world need not be told, that the convivial hours of such a triumvirate must be pleasing as well as profitable, and may truly be said to be such pleasures as might bear the reflections of the morning. In consequence of one of these meetings, the following letter was written by G. Peele, a fellow of Christ-church college, Oxford, and a dramatic poet, who belonged to the Club, to one Marle, an intimate of his:\n\n'Friend Marle,\n\n'I must desire that my sister may watch, and the cookery book you promised, may be sent by the man.\u2014I never longed for thy company more than last night: we were all very merry at the Globe, when Ned Alleyn did not scruple to affirm pleasantly to thy Friend Will, that he had stolen his speech about the Qualities of an actor's excellency in Hamlet his Tragedy, from conversations many-fold which had passed between them, and opinions given by Alleyn touching the subject.\u2014Shakespeare did not take this talk in good part; but Jonson put an end to the strife with witty remarks: This affair needeth no Contention; you stole it from Ned, no doubt; do not marvel: Have you not seen him at times out of number?\u2014Believe me most sincerely, yours, G. Peele.'","sp":325,"ep":326},{"h":"ALLIANCE","t":"in the Civil and Canon Law, the relation contracted between two persons or two families by marriage.\n\nAlliance is also used for a treaty entered into by sovereign princes and states, for their mutual safety and defence.\u2014In this sense, alliances may be distinguished into such as are offensive, whereby the contracting parties oblige themselves jointly to attack some other power; and into defensive ones, whereby they bind themselves to stand by and defend each other in case they are attacked by others. Alliance with the ancient Romans, though a sort of servitude, was much coveted. Ariarathes, we are told by Polybius, offered a sacrifice to the gods by way of thanksgiving for having obtained this alliance. The reason was, that thenceforward people were sure not to receive any injuries except from them. There were different sorts of allies: some only united to them by a participation of the privileges of Romans, as the Latins and Hernici; others by their very foundation, as the colonies; others by the benefactions they received from them, as Massilia, Lutetiae, and Attalia, who owed their kingdoms to Rome; others by free treaties, which last by a long alliance became subjects, as the kings of Bithynia, Cappadocia, Egypt, and most of the cities of Greece: Lastly, Others by compulsive treaties, and the law of subjection, as Philip and Antiochus. For they never granted peace to an enemy, without making an alliance with him; that is, they never subdued any people without using it as a means of subduing others.\n\nThe forms or ceremonies of alliances have been various in different ages and countries. Among us, signing and swearing, sometimes at the altar, are the chief; anciently eating and drinking together, chiefly offering sacrifices together, were the customary rite of ratifying an alliance. Among the Jews and Chaldeans, heifers or calves; among the Greeks, bulls or goats; and among the Romans, hogs were sacrificed on this occasion. Among the ancient Arabs, alliances were confirmed by drawing blood out of the palms of the hands of the two contracting princes with a sharp stone, dipping therein a piece of their garments, and therewith smearing seven stones, at the same time invoking the gods Vrotalt and Alilat, i.e., according to Herodotus, Bacchus and Urania. Among the people of Colchis, the confirmation of alliances is said to be effected by one of the princes offering his wife's breasts to the other to suck, which he was obliged to do till there issued blood.","sp":326,"ep":326},{"h":"ALLIANCE","t":"in a figurative sense, is applied to any kind of union or connexion; thus we say, there is an alliance between the church and state.\n\nALLIARIA.

Though writers on arithmetic generally make alligation a branch of that science; yet, as it is plainly nothing more than an application of the common properties of numbers, in order to solve a few questions\nAlligation questions that occur in particular branches of business, we choose rather to keep it distinct from the science of arithmetic.\n\nAlligation is generally divided into medial and alternate.\n\n**Alligation Medial**, from the rates and quantities of the simples given, discovers the rate of the mixture.\n\n**Rule.** As the total quantity of the simples,\nTo their price or value;\nSo any quantity of the mixture,\nTo the rate.\n\n**Examp.** A grocer mixeth 3cbl. of currants, at 4d. per lb. with 10lb. of other currants, at 6d. per lb.: What is the value of 1lb. of the mixture? **Ans.** 4\u00bdd.\n\n| lb. | d. |\n|-----|----|\n| 30  | 4  |\n| 10  | 6  |\n\nNote 1. When the quantity of each simple is the same, the rate of the mixture is readily found by adding the rates of the simples, and dividing their sum by the number of simples. Thus,\n\nSuppose a grocer mixes several sorts of sugar, and of each an equal quantity; viz. at 5gs. at 54s. and at 60s. per cwt. the rate of the mixture will be 54s. 8d. per cwt.; for\n\n\\[ \\frac{50 + 54 + 60}{3} = 54.8 \\]\n\nNote 2. If it be required to increase or diminish the quantity of the mixture, say, As the sum of the given quantities of the simples, to the several quantities given; so the quantity of the mixture proposed, to the quantities of the simples sought.\n\nNote 3. If it be required to know how much of each simple is an assigned portion of the mixture, say, As the quantity of the mixture, to the several quantities of the simples given; so the quantity of the assigned portion, to the quantities of the simples sought.\n\nThus,\n\nSuppose a grocer mixes 10lb. of raisins with 30lb. of almonds and 40lb. of currants, and it be demanded how many ounces of each sort are found in every pound or in every 16 ounces of the mixture, say,\n\n| oz. | 80 : 10 :: 16 : 2 raisins. |\n|-----|--------------------------|\n|     | 80 : 30 :: 16 : 6 almonds. |\n|     | 80 : 40 :: 16 : 8 currants. |\n\nProof 16\n\nNote 4. If the rates of two simples, with the total value and total quantity of the mixture, be given, the quantity of each simple may be found as follows: viz. Multiply the lesser rate into the total quantity, subtract the product from the total value, and the remainder will be equal to the product of the excess of the higher rate above the lower, multiplied into the quantity of the higher-priced simple; and consequently the said remainder, divided by the difference of the rates, Alligation, will quote the said quantity. Thus,\n\nSuppose a grocer has a mixture of 400lb. weight, that cost him 7l. 10s. confiting of raisins at 4d. per lb. and almonds at 6d. how many pounds of almonds were in the mixture?\n\n| lb. | Rates. |\n|-----|-------|\n| 400 | 6d.   |\n| 7  | 10 = 1800 |\n| 1600 | 1600d. |\n\n2)200(100lb. of almonds at 6d. is 2 10\nAnd 300lb. of raisins at 4d. is 5 0\n\nTotal 400 Proof 7 10\n\n**Alligation Alternate**, being the converse of alligation medial, from the rates of the simples, and rate of the mixture given, finds the quantities of the simples.\n\n**Rules.** I. Place the rate of the mixture on the left side of a brace, as the root; and on the right side of the brace set the rates of the several simples, under one another, as the branches. II. Link or alligate the branches, so as one greater and another less than the root may be linked or yoked together. III. Set the difference betwixt the root and the several branches right against their respective yoke-fellows. These alternate differences are the quantities required. Note 1. If any branch happen to have two or more yoke-fellows, the difference betwixt the root and these yoke-fellows must be placed right against the said branch, one after another, and added into one sum. 2. In some questions, the branches may be alligated more ways than one: and a question will always admit of so many answers as there are different ways of linking the branches.\n\nAlligation alternate admits of three varieties, viz. 1. The question may be unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the simples and that of the mixture. 2. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the simples. 3. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of the mixture.\n\n**Variety I.** When the question is unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the simples, and that of the mixture, this is called **Alligation Simple**.\n\n**Examp.** A grocer would mix sugars at 5d. 7d. and 10d. per lb. so as to sell the mixture or compound at 8d. per lb.: What quantity of each must he take?\n\n| Ib. |\n|-----|\n| 8  |\n| 7  |\n| 10 |\n\nHere the rate of the mixture 8 is placed on the left side of the brace, as the root; and on the right side of the same brace are set the rates of the several simples, viz. 5, 7, 10, under one another, as the branches; according to Rule I.\n\nThe branch 10 being greater than the root, is alligated or linked with 7 and 5, both these being less than the root; as directed in Rule II.\n\nThe difference between the root 8 and the branch 5, viz. 3, is set right against this branch's yoke-fellow 10.\n\nThe difference between 8 and 7 is likewise set right against\nAlligation against the yoke-fellow 10. And the difference betwixt 8 and 10 viz. 2, is set right against the two yoke-fellows 7 and 5; as prescribed by Rule III.\n\nAs the branch 10 has two differences on the right, viz. 3 and 1, they are added; and the answer to the question is, that 2lb. at 5d., 2lb. at 7d. and 4lb. at 10d. will make the mixture required.\n\nThe truth and reason of the rules will appear by considering, that whatever is lost upon any one branch is gained upon its yoke-fellow. Thus in the above example by selling 4lb. of 10d. sugar at 8d. per lb. there is 8d. lost; but the like sum is gained upon its two yoke-fellows; for by selling 2lb. of 3d. sugar at 8d. per lb. there is 6d. gained; and by selling 2lb. of 7d. sugar at 8d. there is 2d. gained; and 6d. and 2d. make 8d.\n\nHence it follows, that the rate of the mixture must always be mean or middle with respect to the rates of the simples; that is, it must be less than the greatest, and greater than the least; otherwise a solution would be impossible. And the price of the total quantity mixed, computed at the rate of the mixture, will always be equal to the sum of the prices of the several quantities cast up at the respective rates of the simple.\n\nVariety II. When the question is limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the simples, this is called Alligation Partial.\n\nIf the quantity of one the simples only be limited, alligate the branches, and take their differences, as if there had been no such limitation; and then work by the following proportion:\n\nAs the difference right against the rate of the simple, whose quantity is given,\nTo the other differences respectively;\nSo the quantity given,\nTo the several quantities sought.\n\nExample. A distiller would, with 40 gallons of brandy at 12s. per gallon, mix rum at 7s. per gallon, and gin at 4s. per gallon: How much of the rum and gin must he take, to sell the mixture at 8s. per gallon?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Gal.} & \\\\\n8 & \\quad 12 & \\quad 14 & \\quad 5 & \\quad 40 \\text{ of brandy.} \\\\\n7 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 32 \\text{ of rum.} \\\\\n4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 32 \\text{ of gin.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe operation gives for answer, 5 gallons of brandy, 4 of rum, and 4 of gin. But the question limits the quantity of brandy to 40 gallons; therefore say,\n\nIf \\(5 : 4 :: 40 : 32\\)\n\nThe quantity of gin, by the operation, being also 4, the proportion needs not be repeated.\n\nVariety III. When the question is limited to a certain quantity of the mixture, this is called Alligation Total.\n\nAfter linking the branches, and taking the differences, work by the proportion following:\n\nAs the sum of the differences,\nTo each particular difference;\nSo the given total of the mixture,\nTo the respective quantities required.\n\nExample. A vintner hath wine at 3s. per gallon, and would mix it with water, so as to make a composition of 144 gallons, worth 2s. 6d. per gallon: How much wine, and how much water, must he take?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Gal.} & \\\\\n30 & \\quad 36 & \\quad 30 & \\quad 120 \\text{ of wine.} \\\\\n& \\quad 6 & \\quad 24 \\text{ of water.} \\\\\n36 & \\quad 144 \\text{ total.} \\\\\n120 \\times 36 = 4320 \\\\\n24 \\times 6 = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nProof \\(144)4320(30\\)\n\nAs \\(36 : 30 :: 144 : 120\\)\nAs \\(36 : 6 :: 144 : 24\\).\n\nThere being here only two simples, and the total of the mixture limited, the question admits but of one answer.","sp":326,"ep":328},{"h":"ALLIGATOR","t":"in Zoology, a synonyme of the lacerta crocodilus.

We do not remember to have ever seen any satisfactory account of alliteration in the writings of the critics. They seem to have passed it over in contemptuous silence; either as a false refinement or as a mere trifle. It perhaps deserves a better fate. Many chapters have been composed on quantity, on the expression resulting from different arrangements of long and short syllables, and on the powers of pauses as they are variously placed, without a word of alliteration. This is the more extraordinary, as one should think it impossible for any man to examine minutely, and, as it were, dissect a number of verses, without perceiving the vast abundance of this ornament. It is as if an anatomist should publish a complete table of the arteries in the human body, and affect never to have seen a vein or a nerve: for it may be affirmed, with small danger of mistake, that if you examine any number of verses, remarkable either for sweetness or for energy, they will be found in some degree alliterative. We do not pretend to say, that the sweetness and energy of versification depends chiefly on this circumstance, yet we cannot help believing that it may claim some share: for it is a constant appearance, as far as we have ever observed, that the poets whose fame is highest for versification, have been attentive to alliteration.\n\nThe very trifling appearance of the ornament itself, upon a superficial view, and the frequent abuse of it, are circumstances indeed which give no encouragement to a serious inquiry into its nature and operation. How common is it for writers, who affect to be comic, when in want of other means for raising a smile, to use affected alliteration with success? But, in the fine arts, no beauty or grace is beyond the power of ridicule. The noblest attitudes in painting have been rendered laughable by caricature. St Paul preaching at Athens, in the design of Raphael, appears elegant, noble, and in some degree awful. The same apostle, represented by Hogarth, in nearly the same attitude, pleading before\nfore the governor Felix, seems altogether ridiculous.\n\nSo the language and versification of Milton in the Paradise Lost appear only proper for the most elevated subjects. In the Splendid Shilling of Philips, they appear equally proper for the lowest. So fares it also with alliteration. Nor ought we to be mortified at the discovery, that much of the delight afforded by versification arises from a cause so pitiful as the repetition of the same letter twice, or oftener, on the accented parts of a verse; for there are many other causes of pleasure, which, when thus detected and taken to pieces, seem equally contemptible.\n\nWe apprehend the principal operation of this ornament to be quite mechanical. It is easier for the organs of speech to resume, at short intervals, one certain conformation, than to throw themselves into a number of different ones, unconnected and discordant. For example, a succession of labials, interperated at regular distances with dentals and gutturals, will be more easily pronounced than the succession of all the three at random. Sounds of which the articulation is easiest, are most completely in the power of the speaker. He can pronounce them slowly or rapidly, softly or with force, at pleasure. In this we imagine the power and advantage of alliteration are founded; for we would not lay any stress on the pleasure which can result to the ear from the repetition of the same letter. It has been compared to the frequent returns of the key-note in a musical strain; but that analogy is extremely faint. The ear, we presume, can be pleased with alliteration only in so far as it contributes to the superior easiness of recitation; for what is recited with ease must be heard with pleasure.\n\nThese remarks might be confirmed and illustrated by numberless passages from the best poets. Some few lines will suffice, taken from Gray, who seems to have paid particular attention to this grace. He professed to have learned his versification from Dryden, as Dryden did from Spenner; and these three abound in alliteration above all the English poets. We choose Gray for another reason, in proof of what we mentioned before, that alliteration contributes not only to the sweetness, but also to the energy, of versification; for he uses it chiefly when he aims at strength and boldness. In the Silver Odes (as Dr Johnson styles them), almost every strophe commences and concludes with an alliterative line. The poet, we suppose, wished to begin with force, and end with dignity.\n\n\"Ruin seize thee, ruthless king.\"\n\"To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewelyn's lay.\"\n\"Weave the warp, and weave the woof.\"\n\"Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.\"\n\"Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway.\"\n\"That hush'd in grim repose, expects his ev'ning prey.\"\n\nIt must be observed here, that we hold a verse alliterative which has a letter repeated on its accented parts, although those parts do not begin words; the repeated letter bearing a strong analogy to the bars in a musical phrase. Gray seems to have had a particular liking to these sort of balanced verses, which divide equally, and of which the opposite sides have an alliterative resemblance.\n\n\"Eyes that glow, and fangs that grin.\"\n\"Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.\"\n\"Hauberk crash, and helmet ring.\"\n\nAll these lines appear to us to have a force and energy, arising from alliteration, which renders them easy to be recited; or, if the reader pleases, mumbled. For the same reason the following passage appears sad and solemn, by the repetition of the labial liquid.\n\n\"Mountains, ye mourn in vain,\"\n\"Mordred, whose magic song,\"\u2014&c.\n\nIf alliteration thus contributes to enforce the expression of a poetical sentiment, its advantages in poetry must be considerable. It is not, therefore, unworthy a poet's regard in the act of composition. If two words offer of equal propriety, the one alliterative, the other not, we think the first ought to be chosen. We would compare this to the practice of fuguing in music. A composer who aims at expression will not hunt after fugues; but if they offer, if they seem to arise spontaneously from the subject, he will not reject them. So a good poet ought not to select an epithet merely for beginning with a certain letter, unless it suit his purpose well in every other respect; for the beauty of alliteration, when happy, is not greater than its deformity when affected. A couplet from Pope will exemplify both; the first line being bad, and the second good:\n\n\"Eternal beauties grace the shining scene,\nFields ever fresh, and groves for ever green.\"\n\nALLIUM (from \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, \"to avoid or shun,\" because many shun the smell of it), GARLIC.

He became a learned divine of the English church, and a strenuous defender of the Protestant faith. At the time when the edict of Nantes tolerated and protected the Protestants of France, he entered upon his clerical profession, and remained minister of Rouen until the thirty-fifth year of his age. In this period he wrote several pieces upon the controversy between the Papists and the Protestants, which obtained him great fame among his own party. He removed to Charenton in the vicinity of Paris, which was the principal church among the reformed, and frequented by persons of the first rank in France, who professed the Protestant faith. Here Allix preached a course of excellent sermons in defence of the Protestant religion, some of which were afterwards printed in Holland, and added to his increasing fame. The chief object of these sermons was to repel the attack of the bishop of Meaux, the most ingenious and able opponent of the Reformation at that time. The unwise revocation of the edict of Nantes drove Allix and many others to seek refuge in England. Three years after his arrival in England, he had made himself so perfectly master of the English language as to be able to write very correctly a \"Defence of the Christian Religion.\" This work he dedicated to James II., in testimony of gratitude for his kind reception of the distressed refugees of France. In justice to the memory of James,\nand as a specimen of the talents of Allix, it may be proper to give an extract from this curious dedication.\n\n\"As your majesty continues still to give such illustrious instances of your clemency and royal protection to those of your nation; so I confess, Sir, I thought myself under an obligation to lay hold upon this opportunity of publishing what all those who find so sure a protection in your majesty's dominions feel and think as much as myself upon these new testimonies of your royal bounty. When your majesty had taken us into your particular care, and had granted us several privileges, and so made us sharers in all the advantages which those who live under your government enjoy; your majesty did yet something more, and inspired all your subjects with the same compassion towards us, with which your royal breast was already touched. You saw our miseries, and resolved to give us ease; and this generous design was executed, and your royal clemency diffused in the hearts of all your subjects. The whole world, Sir, which has received upon all its coasts some remainders of our shipwreck, is filled with admiration of the unexampled effects of your majesty's clemency. I could wish, Sir, that this work which I now present to your majesty might be so happy as to pass to posterity with this character of our acknowledgment, and that it might stand as a faithful record for ever to perpetuate the memory of that lively sense of your bounty which is imprinted on all our hearts.\"\n\nNot long after his arrival in England, he was honoured with the title of doctor of divinity, and also received the more substantial honour of being appointed treasurer of the church of Salisbury. Allix still maintained the station of a champion for the Protestant cause, and in opposition to the bishop of Meaux, proved that the charge of heresy justly belonged to the Papists, and not to their opponents, because they had introduced new doctrines into the church.\n\nAfter having with much industry and learning exercised his talents in defence of Protestantism, he employed his pen to support the doctrine of the Trinity against the Unitarians, who contended that the idea of Christ's divinity could be traced up no higher than the time of Justin Martyr. With a great display of erudition, he attempted to prove that the Trinitarian doctrine was believed by the Jewish church. But the reputation which he had acquired for learning and ability was somewhat diminished by the ridicule which he brought upon himself in attempting to fix the precise time of Christ's second coming to the year 1720, or at the very latest, to the year 1736. He died at London in the year 1717, after his studious life had been protracted to the length of 76 years. He left behind him numerous proofs of his great talents, extensive learning, uncommon industry, and zealous attachment to the doctrines of the church of England. (Gen.

It is a populous place; has two market days in the week; and is remarkable for its fine castle, the seat of Mr Erskine of Mar, and for the coal mines near it. The harbour is extremely commodious, with great depth of water; and vessels are expeditiously loaded with coals from the pits by an uncommon waggon-way, on which one horse draws with ease three waggons at once, each waggon containing a ton and a half. An excellent dry dock has also lately been erected here, capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden. There is likewise a large glas-house for blowing bottles, of which vessels are supplied with any quantity upon the shortest notice.\n\nThe tower and lands of Alloa were exchanged by David II, king of Scots, anno 1365, with Thomas Lord Erskine, for the lands and estate of Strathgarnet in Perthshire; and since that time the castle of Alloa has been the favourite residence of the family of Mar. The situation is uncommonly beautiful. The gardens here were the first that were laid out on a great scale in Scotland; and, with the advice of Le Naute, were indebted to the taste of John the late earl of Mar, who began to plant them in the year 1706. They contain about forty acres, in which there is some very fine timber, near a century old.\n\nThe tower of Alloa is 89 feet in height, with walls of 11 feet in thickness; and was built in the end of the 13th century. In this residence of the family of Erskine many of the Scottish princes received their education, having been for more than two centuries, the wards of the Lords Erskine and Earls of Mar; who held generally the castle of Stirling, and frequently the three principal fortresses of the kingdom, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dumbarton. The last heir of the Scottish monarchy who was nurtured there was Henry prince of Wales; whose cradle, golf-clubs, and other infantine and youthful remains, are preserved by the heir of the earls of Mar, in remembrance of that spirited and promising prince; of whom Dr Birch has preserved several anecdotes, connected with the Erskines and his residence at Alloa. Among other remains of antiquity preserved at Alloa, in remembrance of the confidence and affection which subsisted always betwixt the Stuarts and the Erskines, is the private signet of the unfortunate Mary, which she gave to the regent Mar, after she was obliged by the treaty of Edinburgh to desist from wearing the arms of England in the first quarter; the child's chair of James VI, her son; and the effigy chair of Thomas Lord Erskine the second earl of Mar of the name, with the fashionable grace carved on it, Soli Deo Honor et Gloria.\n\nALLOBROGES (Inscriptions, Livy, Velleius, Florus); from Allobroges (Horace): a people of Gallia Narbonensis, situated between the rivers Ilara and Rhodanus, and the Lacus Lemanus; commanded by Cicerro for their fidelity; but reproached by Horace on account of their fondness for novelty.\n\nNovisque rebus infidelis Allobroges.

It was built by the archbishop Roderic of Toledo, who finished it in 1214, and put a considerable garrison into it to restrain the incursions of the Moors. This was hardly done, when the fortress was besieged by an army of 5000 horse and foot, under the command of a Moorish officer of great reputation; but the prelate, its founder, took care to supply those within with such plenty of necessaries, that at length the enemy found themselves obliged to raise the siege and retire with great loss.\n\nAlmagro, Diego De, a Spanish commander, was...\nof such obscure birth and mean parentage, that he derived his name from the village where he was born, in 1463. Deprived of the means of early instruction, he could neither read nor write, but nevertheless, in consequence of his improvements in the military art, he formed an afflication with Pizarro and de Luque, for the purpose of discoveries and conquest upon the Peruvian coast. The governor of Panama having sanctioned their enterprise, they devoted their united exertions to that undertaking. Pizarro directed the conquest, and Almagro was appointed to conduct the supplies, provisions, and reinforcements. In the two first unsuccessful attempts, he performed this office with persevering fidelity and uncommon activity. His perseverance was followed with complete success; for they at last discovered the coast of Peru, and landed at Tumbez, distinguished by its temple and palace of the incas or sovereigns, and situated about three degrees south of the line. Pizarro was sent over to Spain to solicit farther powers, after the three adventurers had previously adjusted their future preferences, and agreed that Pizarro should be governor, Almagro lieutenant-governor, and Luque bishop. In this negociation, Pizarro obtained the clerical dignity for Luque; but chiefly concerned about his own interest, he neglected the preference of Almagro. On his return, Almagro was so enraged, that he refused to act with such a perfidious companion, and resolved to form a new association. Pizarro, for the present artfully endeavoured to avert the indignation of Almagro, and gradually soothed the rage and disappointment of the folder. The union was renewed upon the former terms; and it was solemnly stipulated that a common expense and a common advantage should take place.\n\nIn February 1531, leaving Almagro at Panama, to supply provisions and reinforcements, Pizarro set sail for Peru. He attacked a principal settlement of the natives, in the province of Coaque, obtained immense spoil, and made such ample remittances to Almagro, as enabled him to complete his reinforcement, and in the close of the year 1532, he arrived at St Michael with a body of men, which nearly doubled the number of those which Pizarro had along with him. The Spaniards about this time took captive the unfortunate Inca Atahualpa; and after they had received an immense sum for his ransom, they barbarously put him to death. Pizarro sailed for Spain with the news of their success, and with remittances to a great amount; and consequently Almagro gained that elevated station he so long and eagerly desired. But no sooner had Almagro received the intelligence of his promotion by the royal grant, than he attempted to seize Cuzco, the imperial residence of the incas, under pretence that it lay within his defined territory. This produced a new quarrel; but peace was restored upon the determination of Almagro to attempt the conquest of Chili, and likewise to have part of the territory of Peru.\n\nIn 1535, he accordingly set out at the head of 570 Europeans, and in crossing the mountains, he suffered great hardships and losses by mistaking the route, but at length he descended into the plains of that devoted region. Here he met with a more vigorous resistance from the natives than the Spaniards had ever experienced in other countries. He had, however, made some progress, when he was recalled to Peru by the news of the natives having risen in great numbers, and attacked Lima and Cuzco. He purified a new route, and marching through the sandy plains on the coast, he suffered by heat and drought calamities not inferior to those which he had endured from cold and famine on the summit of the Andes. Arriving at a favourable moment, he resolved to hold the place both against the Indians and his Spanish rivals. He attacked the Peruvian army with great vigour, and making a great slaughter, he proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without any farther interruption. The open, affable, and generous temper of Almagro, gained over to his side many of the adherents of the Pizzaros, who were disgusted with their harsh and opprobrious conduct. With their aid, he advanced towards the city by night, surprized the sentinels, and surrounded the house where the two brothers resided, who were compelled, after an obstinate defence, to surrender at discretion. A form of government was settled in the name of Almagro, and his jurisdiction over Cuzco was universally acknowledged. This was the origin of a civil war; the beginning of which was very advantageous to Almagro, who by skilful manoeuvres entirely routed a body of Spanish troops advancing to the relief of Cuzco, and made Alvarado their commander prisoner. But instead of improving these advantages, he unwisely marched back to Cuzco, and there awaited the arrival of Pizarro. Pizarro, convinced of his own feeble resources, proposed an accommodation, and with his usual art protracted the negociation until he found himself in a condition to meet his antagonist in the field of battle. Meanwhile Alvarado and one of the Pizzaros, by bribing their keepers, found means to escape, and persuaded 60 of the men who guarded them to attend them in their flight; and the governor released the other Pizarro. When Pizarro thought himself sufficiently prepared to settle the dominion of Peru, he marched with an army of 500 men to Cuzco. Almagro, previous to this, worn out with age and infirmity, resigned the command to Orgognez. A fierce and bloody battle ensued, in which Almagro was made prisoner, his army defeated, and the commander wounded. About 140 soldiers fell in the field, and Orgognez, along with several others, was massacred in cold blood. During that fatal day, Almagro, placed in a litter, which was stationed on an eminence, beheld from thence the total defeat of his troops, and felt all the indignation of a folder who had seldom experienced defeat. He was taken prisoner, remained several months in confinement, and afterwards was tried, and condemned to death. In the view of an ignominious death, the courage of the veteran forsook him, and he unsuccessfully supplicated for life, in a manner unworthy of his former character. All the arguments he could employ were ineffectual. The Pizzaros remained unmoved by all his entreaties. As soon, however, as Almagro saw that his fate was inevitable, he refused his courage, and exhibited all his usual dignity and fortitude. In the year 1538, and in the 7th year of his age, he was strangled in prison, and afterwards beheaded. He left one son by an Indian woman of Panama; and in consequence of a power which the emperor had granted, he declared his son his successor in\nAlmagro, in the government, although he was then a prisoner in Lima.\n\nWith the qualities of intrepid valour, indefatigable activity, and infurmountable constancy, he blended the more amiable dispositions of frankness, generosity, and candour. These qualities rendered him beloved by his followers; and his misfortunes excited their sympathy and pity, so that his death was universally regretted, and particularly by the poor Indians, who deemed him their guardian and protector against the cruel and unfeeling Pizarro. Upon the whole review of his character, it appears just to conclude, that he was, although of inferior abilities, a more amiable man than his rival. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlmagro the Younger, by his courage, generosity, and other accomplishments, was placed at the head of the party after the death of his father. The father, conscious of his own inferiority from the total want of education, used every possible mean to improve the mind and embellish the manners of his son; so that he soon acquired those accomplishments which rendered him respected by illiterate adventurers, who cheerfully ranged around his standard; and, by his dexterity and skill, fought deliverance from the oppressions of Pizarro. Juan de Herrera, an officer of great abilities, continued still to direct his counsels and to regulate his enterprises; and, while Pizarro confined in his own security, a conspiracy was formed against him, which terminated in his death. The afflains, exulting in their success, and waving their bloody swords, halted to the street, proclaimed the death of the tyrant, and compelled the magistrates and principal citizens of Lima to acknowledge Almagro as lawful successor to his father. But his reign was of short duration; for, in 1541, Vaca de Castro, arriving at Quito, produced the royal commission, appointing him governor of Peru, together with all the privileges and authority of Pizarro. The talents and influence of the new governor soon overpowered the interest of Almagro, who, perceiving the rapid decline of his influence, hastened with his troops to Cuzco, where his opponents had erected the royal standard under the command of Pedro \u00c1lvarez Falg\u00e9n. Herrera the guide of his counsels died during his march; and from that time his measures were conspicuous for their violence, concerted with little ingenuity, and executed with little address. On September 16, 1542, at length the forces of Almagro and Vaca de Castro met, and victory long remained doubtful; till at last it declared for the new governor. The followers of Almagro displayed uncommon valour, and Almagro conducted the military operations of that fatal day with a gallant spirit, worthy of a better cause and deserving of a better fate. In proportion to the number of combatants the carnage was very great. Of 1500 men 500 fell in the field, and many more were wounded. Almagro escaped, but being betrayed by some of his own officers, he was publicly beheaded at Cuzco, and in him the name and spirit of the party of Almagro became extinct. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlmamon, or Mamon, also named Abdallah, caliph of Bagdad, was born A.D. 785. His elder brother Al Amin succeeded to the caliphate on the death of his father, and Almamon at that time was governor of Chorasan. As by the will of the father it Almamon provided, that his three sons should succeed to the caliphate in order, Almamon ordered his elder brother to be proclaimed caliph throughout his government. But his brother repaid his friendship and attachment to his interest with open expressions of hatred, and unjust attempts to exclude him from the defined succession. Almamon was thus forced to consult measures for his own safety and promotion, by causing himself to be proclaimed caliph. After various struggles, his general, Thalier, in the year 813 took possession of Bagdad, pursued Al Amin to his retreat, and caused him to be assassinated, so that Almamon remained without a competitor. Various rebellions disturbed the tranquillity of the first years of his reign; but by his prudent administration and vigorous exertions, these were at length extinguished. Incited by the advice of his vizier, he soon after raised greater commotions, and exposed his dignity to greater dangers, by countenancing the sect of Ali. He invited to court Imam Rizza, gave him his daughter in marriage, and even declared him his successor in the empire. He assumed the green turban, the colour of the house of Ali, and obliged his courtiers and soldiers to imitate his example. Alarmed at these proceedings, the orthodox Mussulmans, and the house of Abbas, excited a great revolt in Bagdad, and proclaimed Ibrahim, Almamon's uncle, caliph. A civil war was just about to commence when Fadel the vizier was assassinated and Rizza died. The people of Bagdad then depoed Ibrahim, and returned to their former allegiance. Taking the advantage of Almamon's absence, Thalier his general seized upon the government of Chorasan, where he founded a dynasty which existed during a period of 16 years.\n\nAlmamon employed the period of tranquillity that followed in the introduction and improvement of literature into his dominions, which constitutes the greatest glory of his reign. During the days of his father he discovered an ardent thirst after knowledge, by forming a college in Chorasan, adorned with the most eminent men of various countries; and appointed Mefue, a famous Christian physician of Damascus, for their president. When his father remonstrated against conferring such an honour upon a Christian, he reminded him, that the most learned men and the most skilful artists in his dominions were Jews and Christians; and added, that he had chosen Mefue as a preceptor in science and useful arts, and not as a teacher of religion. Under his auspices Bagdad became the seat of literature, of private and academical instruction, and the habitation of men of eminence from all quarters. Many valuable books in the Greek, Persian, Chaldean, and Coptic languages, among which were the works of Aristotle and Galen, were translated into the Arabic at his own expense. The caliph himself deemed it an honour to set an example to others of the becoming respect due to mental cultivation, by visiting the schools, and treating the professors with great regard. In mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy, he made a rapid and extensive progress. He was the author of astronomical tables, which on account of their accuracy have been much admired. By these various exertions the character of the Saracens was suddenly changed from...\nAlmamon, a rude and ferocious to a polite and civilized people, while the most powerful and extensive of the European states were involved in ignorance and barbarism. Literature has sustained some irreparable losses from his too great partiality to the Arabic writers, which induced him to destroy the originals of the translated manuscripts. He is represented by the Sonnites or orthodox Mahometans as little better than an Infidel, because of his attention to philosophy and letters. His conduct, however, shows that he was not sufficiently careful to preserve a philosophical mean between the different religious parties during the time of his administration, as he openly manifested a predilection to the doctrines of the Motaellis, who asserted the free will of man, and denied the eternity of the Koran. Some allege, that on account of the murmurs which arose against him, he was induced to exhibit too great a zeal by establishing a kind of inquisition, to compel all his subjects to profess Islam. The experiment, however, soon terminated in the better and juster expedient of universal toleration; and it is abundantly evident, that the Christians in his dominions never felt the power of his inquisition.\n\nThe public transactions of his reign are in themselves important. In the year 822 he sent a body of his troops to the assistance of Thomas, a Greek, who made war on Michael the Stammerer, the emperor of Constantinople, and besieged his capital. This expedition, which on the part of the caliph seems to have been founded in injustice, proved unsuccessful; Thomas was taken prisoner, and suffered death. In the years 829 and 830 he commenced open hostilities upon the Greeks, rendered himself master of many places, and carried devastation into their territories. He was successful in suppressing a revolt in Egypt in the year 831. In this country he was led to discover a treasure buried under two columns by Merwan, the last caliph of the house of Ommiiah. In repairing a decayed masonry or measuring pillar, and erecting a new one for determining the gradation of the increase of the Nile, Almamon displayed his love of science. In the year 833 he again visited Egypt; on his return he penetrated into the territories of the Greek emperor, even into Cilicia. Returning home he encamped on the banks of a river, and, excited by thirst, drank too freely of the water; and at the same time indulged himself immoderately in eating a particular kind of dates, which brought on a complaint in his stomach, and reduced him to the most imminent danger. Sensible of his approaching dissolution, he wrote letters into all the provinces, announcing his brother Motafem his successor; and then patiently awaited the event. After a tedious struggle under the prelure of his disease, and while uttering this ejaculation; \"O thou who never died, have mercy on me, a dying man!\" he expired at the age of forty-eight or forty-nine years. He reigned 20 years and some months, and was buried at Tarbus, which some religious zealots interpreted as a mark of reprobation.\n\nThe history of this caliph affords an illustrious instance of the meliorating effect of science and literature upon the conduct and temper of rude and uncultivated men. Under the milder features of a liberal, virtuous, and benevolent sovereign, the usual cruelty of a Saracen and a despot seemed entirely lost. He displayed Almamon, an uncommon greatness of mind and an unusual example of clemency in his conduct towards his rival and uncle Ibrahim. After his deposition, that prince concealed himself in some sequestered corner of Bagdad. The place of his concealment being at length discovered, he was instantly brought before the caliph, and informed that the council had unanimously condemned him to death. \"Your counsellors (said Ibrahim) have judged, according to the customary rules of political government; if you pardon me, you will not, indeed, judge according to precedent, but you will have no equal among sovereigns.\" The caliph rose up and embracing him tenderly, with great emotion, said, \"Uncle be of good cheer; I will not do you the least injury;\" and he added to forgive us a fortune suitable to his birth and former elevated station. When Almamon's courtiers complimented him on this generous action, he exclaimed, \"O! did men but know the pleasure I feel in pardoning, all who have offended me would come and confess their faults.\" To the same generosity of disposition may be ascribed his strong predilection to the oppressed house of Ali, which filled the beginning of his reign with political troubles. By his frequent intercourse with men of enlightened minds, and of different religious sentiments, he acquired a liberality very unusual in a Mussulman; and his preference to some particular opinions seems to have originated from his own vigour of mind, and his knowledge of these opinions.

Biog.)","sp":331,"ep":334},{"h":"ALMANACK","t":"a book or table, containing a calendar of days and months, the rising and setting of the sun, the age of the moon, the eclipses of both luminaries, &c.\u2014Authors are divided with regard to the etymology of the word; some deriving it from the Arabic particle al and manach, to count; some from almanach, new-year's gifts, because the Arabian astrologers used at the beginning of the year to make presents of their ephemerides; and others, from the Teutonic almanen achte, observations on all the months. Dr Johnson derives it from the Arabic particle al, and the Greek \u03bc\u03ae\u03bd, a month. But the most simple etymology appears from the common spelling; the word being composed of two Arabic ones, Al Manack, which signify the Diary. All the classes of Arabs are commonly much given to the study of astronomy and astrology; to both which a pastoral life, and a sort of husbandry, not only incline them, but afford time and opportunity to cultivate them. They neither sow, reap, plant, travel, buy or sell, or undertake any expedition or business, without previously consulting the stars, or, in other words, their almanacks, or some of the makers of them. From these people, by their vicinity to Europe, this art, no less useful in one sense than trifling and ridiculous in another, hath passed over hither; and those astronomical compositions have still everywhere not only retained their old Arabic name; but were, like theirs, for a long while, and still are among many European nations, intermixed with a great number of astrological rules for planting, sowing, bleeding, purging, &c. down to the cutting of the hair and paring of the nails.\u2014Regiomontanus appears to have been the first in Europe, however, who reduced almanacks into their present form and method, gave the characters of each\nAlmanack each year and month, foretold the eclipses and other phases, calculated the motions of the planets, &c. His first almanack was published in 1474.\n\nThe essential part of an almanack is the calendar of months and days, with the risings and settings of the sun, age of the moon, &c. To these are added various parerga, astronomical, meteorological, chronological, political, rural, &c., as calculations and accounts of eclipses, solar ingresses, prognostics of the weather, tables of the tides, terms, &c., lists of posts, offices, dignities, public institutions, with many other articles political as well as local, and differing in different countries. A great variety are annually published in Britain; some for binding, which may be denominated book almanacks; others in loose papers, called sheet almanacks.\n\nThe modern almanack answers to the Fasti of the ancient Romans. See FASTI.\n\nConstruction of Almanacks. The first thing to be done is, to compute the sun's and moon's place for each day of the year, or it may be taken from some ephemerides and entered into the almanack; next, find the dominical letter, and, by means thereof, distribute the calendar into weeks; then, having computed the time of Easter, by it fix the other moveable feasts; adding the immovable ones, with the names of the martyrs, the rising and setting of each luminary, the length of day and night, the aspects of the planets, the phases of the moon, and the sun's entrance into the cardinal points of the ecliptic, i.e. the two equinoxes and solstices. (See ASTRONOMY, paffim.) By the help of good astronomical tables or ephemerides, the construction of almanacks is extremely easy.\n\nFor every almanack or calendar for one year or less, a stamp duty of 8d. must be paid. And for every almanack serving more than a year, the same duty is paid for each year. Perpetual almanacks pay for three years only. All books and pamphlets serving chiefly the purpose of almanacks, are charged as such. If any almanack contains more than one sheet, one sheet only need be stamped; and every almanack required by law to be so printed, that some part of the print shall be upon the stamp. Selling unstamped almanacks incurs the same penalty as for selling unstamped newspapers. Almanacks in bibles and common prayer books are exempted.\n\nAlmanack, among Antiquaries, is also the name given to a kind of instrument, usually of wood, inscribed with various figures and Runic characters, and representing the order of the feasts, dominical letters, days of the week, and golden number, with other matters necessary to be known throughout the year used by the ancient northern nations, in their computations of time, both civil and ecclesiastical. Almanacks of this kind are known by various names, among the different nations wherein they have been used; as rimlocks, primasters, runflocks, runstaffs, Scipiones Ravici, Baculi Annales, clogs, &c. They appear to have been used only by the Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians. From the second of these people, their use was introduced into England, whence divers remains of them in the counties. Dr Plot has given the description and figure of one of these clogs, found in Staffordshire, under the title of The Perpetual Staffordshire Almanack. The external figure and matter of these calendars appear to have been various. Sometimes they were cut on one or more wooden leaves, Almanor bound together after the manner of books; sometimes on the scabbards of swords, or even on daggers; sometimes on tools and implements, as portable steelyards, hammers, the halves of hatchets, flails, &c. Sometimes they were made of braids or horn; sometimes of the skins of eels, which being drawn over a stick properly inscribed, retained the impressions of it. But the most usual form was that of walking staves, or sticks, which they carried about with them to church, market, &c. Each of these staves is divided into three regions; whereof the first indicates the signs, the second the days of the week and year, and the third the golden number. The characters engraved on them are, in some, the ancient Runic; in others the later Gothic characters of Ulphilus. The saints' days are expressed in hieroglyphics, significant either of some endowment of the saint, the manner of his martyrdom, or the like. Thus, against the notch for the first of March, or St David's day, is represented a harp; against the 23rd of October, or Crispin's day, a pair of shoes; against the 12th of August, or St Lawrence's day, a gridiron; and lastly, against New-year's day, a horn, the symbol of liberal potations, which our ancestors indulged in at that season.\n\nALMANSOR the Victorious, the second caliph of the house of Al Abbas, succeeded his brother Abul Abbas Al Safah, in the year 753, of the Hegira 136, and in the following year was inaugurated at Al Hashemiyah. Although Al Safah had declared him presumptive heir of the crown, and he had been proclaimed caliph in the imperial city of Anbar, yet immediately upon his inauguration, his uncle Abdallah ibn Ali had sufficient interest to cause himself to be proclaimed caliph at Damascus. In Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia, he collected a numerous army, and arrived at the banks of the Euphrates, near Nisibis, where he encamped, ready to dispute his royal acclamation by arms. Almanor collected an immense army in Persia, Khorasan, and Irak, and gave the command of it to Abu Moflem, who harassed his uncle's troops for five months, and at last totally defeated him, A.D. 754. Notwithstanding the services which Abu Moflem had rendered to the family of Al Abbas, after this victory he became an object of jealousy, and was affianced in the presence of Almanor himself, by his express order. After the death of Abu Moflem, the standard of rebellion was raised by Sinon a Magian, who seized on the treasures of the deceased governor of Khorasan, and excited the people of that country to a general revolt; but this insurrection was suddenly quelled by the general of Almanor, Jamhur ibn Morad. The caliph avengingly seized the spoils of this victory, which so incensed Jamhur that he immediately turned his arms against his royal master; but he was soon defeated by the caliph's forces. The patriarch of Antioch was about this time detected in an illicit correspondence with the Grecian emperor, and consequently was banished into an obscure part of Palestine; and in the mean time the Christians in the dominions of the caliph were prohibited from building or repairing any churches, and also were laid under several other severe restraints.\n\nAlmanor sent a large army into Cappadocia in the year 757, fortified the city of Malatia or Melitene,\nAlmanfor, litene, and deposited in it a great part of his treasures. But in this year he was attacked by a sect of believers in the metempsychosis, called the Rawandians. This sect assembled at Al Hashimiyyah the residence of the caliph, and by the ceremony of going in procession round his palace, intimated their purpose of invoking him as a deity, and paying him divine homage. Incensed by their impiety, the caliph ordered several of these sectaries to be imprisoned, which roused their resentment, and led them to form the design of his assassination. The generous interposition of Maan ibn Zaidet an Ommiyan chief, who had been under the necessity of concealing himself from the caliph's resentment, however defeated their intention. This insult received in his capital, induced him to build the city of Bagdad, and to fix his residence there, A.D. 762. In the preceding year a plan was formed to dethrone him; but it being discovered, he severely punished all who were either directly or indirectly concerned in it. Abdallah his uncle shared the fate of other rebels: for being allured to court under the promise of pardon and protection, he was placed in a building which was so constructed that it immediately fell and crushed him in its ruins. Not long after his residence at Bagdad, he was seized with a disorder of which he was cured by the advice of a famous Christian physician, whose name was George ibn Baktifluwa Al Jondaburi. The caliph, previously informed that he was married to a wife old and infirm, as a compensation presented him with three beautiful Greek girls, and a considerable sum of money; the girls, to the caliph's surprise, were sent back, with a declaration on the part of George, that it was not lawful for a Christian to have more wives than one at a time. The conduct of the physician, on this occasion, raised him in the esteem of the caliph, and procured him a greater profusion of favours. In his succeeding military transactions, Almanfor was generally victorious. His conduct to his Christian subjects was rigorous and severe. He set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the year 774, and being seized on the road with a dangerous disease, he sent for his son and intended successor Al Mohdi, and gave him some salutary advice. \"I command you,\" said he, \"to treat publicly your relations with the greatest marks of distinction, since this conduct will reflect no small degree of honour and glory upon yourself. Increase the number of your freedmen, and treat them with all kindness, as they will be of great service to you in your adversity; but neither this, nor the other injunction will you fulfil. Enlarge not that part of your capital erected on the eastern bank of the Tigris, as you will never be able to finish it; but this work I know you will attempt. Never permit any of your women to intermeddle in affairs of state, or to have any influence over your counsels; but this advice I know you will not take. These are my last commands; or, if you please, my dying advice; and to God I now recommend you.\" In parting they both gave vent to their feelings in a flood of tears. He pursued his journey to Bir-Maimun, i.e., the well of Maimun, where he died in the 63rd year of his age and the 20th of his reign, and his remains were interred at Mecca.\n\nThe character of Almanfor was formed of very different and even contradictory qualities. His temper conciliated affection and attachment in private life, but in his public character his aspect and demeanour inspired terror. He was well acquainted with the arts of government; he was prudent and brave, but perfidious, covetous, cruel, and implacable; and amid such a variety of character, it is singular that he should have displayed a love of study and literature, and particularly of astronomy.

It is remarkable for the defeat of the allies in 1707, under the marquis de las Minas and the earl of Galway. In the beginning of this action the English troops penetrated through the centre of the Spanish army; but the Portuguese cavalry being broken by the Spanish, and the French infantry making a dreadful fire on their flanks, the allied army was at last broken, and began their retreat when it was almost dark. Colonel Hill carried off the remains of thirteen battalions towards the river Xucar, which, if they could have paused, they might have been safe; but being very much fatigued, they were obliged to halt; by which means they were surrounded, and forced to surrender prisoners of war. In this battle, the allies lost 120 standards, together with all their artillery and baggage; a great number were killed, and several thousands taken prisoners. The Marquis de las Minas was dangerously wounded; and his mistress, in the garb of an amazon, killed by his side.

They form a celebrated society in that country. To be received into it, according to M. Savary, it is necessary to have a good voice, to understand the language well, to know the rules of poetry, and be able to compose and sing couplets on the spot, adapted to the circumstances. The Alm\u00e9 know by heart all the new songs. Their memory is furnished with the most beautiful tales. There is no festival without them; no entertainment of which they do not constitute the ornament. They are placed in a rostrum, from whence they sing during the repast. They then descend into the falcon, and form dances which have no resemblance to ours. They are pantomime ballets, in which they represent the usual occurrences of life. The mysteries of love, too, generally\ngenerally furnish them with scenes. The suppleness of their bodies is inconceivable. One is astonished at the mobility of their features, to which they give at pleasure the impression suited to the characters they play. The indecency of their attitudes is often carried to excess. Their looks, their gestures, every thing speaks, but in so expressive a manner, that it is impossible to mistake them. At the beginning of the dance, they lay aside with their veils the modesty of their sex. A long robe of very thin silk goes down to their heels, which is slightly fastened with a rich girdle. Long black hair, plaited and perfumed, is flowing on their shoulders. A shift, transparent as gauze, scarcely hides their bosom. As they put themselves in motion, the shapes, the contours of their bodies, seem to develop themselves successively. Their steps are regulated by the sound of the flute, of cattanets, the tambour de basque, and cymbals, which accelerates or retards the measure. They are still further animated by words adapted to such scenes. They appear in a state of intoxication. They are the Bacchants in a delirium. It is when they are at this point, that throwing off all reserve, they abandon themselves totally to the disorder of their senses; it is then that a people far from delicate, and who like nothing hidden, redouble their applause. These Alm\u00e9 are sent for into all the harems. They teach the women the new airs; they amuse them with amorous tales, and recite in their presence poems, which are so much the more interesting, as they furnish a lively picture of their manners. They initiate them into the mysteries of their art, and teach them to contrive lascivious dances. These girls, who have cultivated understanding, are very agreeable in conversation. They speak their language with purity. The habit of dedicating themselves to poetry renders the softest and most sonorous expressions familiar to them. They repeat with a great deal of grace. In singing, nature is their only guide. Sometimes two of them sing together, but always with the same voice. It is the same with an orchestra, where all the instruments playing in unison execute the same part.\n\nThe Alm\u00e9 assist at the marriage-ceremonies, and march before the bride, playing on instruments. They make a figure likewise at funerals, and accompany the procession, singing sorrowful airs. They break forth into groans and lamentations, and give every sign of grief and despair. These women are paid very high, and seldom appear but amongst the grandees and rich men.\n\nThe common people have also their Alm\u00e9. They are girls of the second class, who try to imitate the former; but they have neither their elegance, their graces, nor their knowledge. They are everywhere to be met with. The public places and the walks about Grand Cairo are full of them. As the populace require allusions still more strongly marked, decency will not permit the relation to what a pitch they carry the licentiousness of their gestures and attitudes.","sp":336,"ep":337},{"h":"ALMEDIA","t":"a frontier town of Portugal, in the province of Tralos Montes, on the confines of Leon, where there was a very brisk action between the French and Portuguese in 1663; 17 miles north-west of Ciudad Rodrigo.

It was taken from the Moors in 1147, by the emperor Conrad III., in conjunction with the French, Geneoese, and Pisans. It was at that time the strongest place in Spain held by the Infidels; from which their privateers, which were exceedingly numerous, not only troubled the sea-coasts inhabited by the Christians, but gave equal disturbance to the maritime provinces of France, Italy, and the adjacent islands. The city being well fortified, having a strong castle, a numerous garrison, and being excellently provided with everything necessary, made a vigorous resistance; but was at last taken by storm, when the victor put to the sword all the inhabitants who were found in arms, distributing the best part of the plunder among his allies, whom he sent away thoroughly satisfied. The Geneoese, particularly, acquired here that emerald vessel which still remains in their treasury, and is deemed invaluable.\n\nUpon its reduction by the Christians, Almeria became a bishopric; but is at present very little better than a village, indifferently inhabited, and has nothing to tellify so much as the probability of its former greatness, except certain circumstances which cannot be effaced even by the indolence of the Spaniards themselves.

Without any solicitation on his part he was nominated the first governor general and viceroy of the newly conquered countries in the East Indies; and set sail from Lisbon in March 1505-6 with a powerful fleet. To give dignity and influence to his elevated station, a body of guards was appointed to attend his person, several chaplains were assigned him, together with every other appendage of grandeur. He touched at the Cape Verde islands, doubled the Cape at a considerable distance to the south, and arrived at Gulloa. From thence he proceeded to Mombaza, a well fortified city in an island, which he reduced, and proceeded to the Angediva islands not far from Goa, where he built a fort; he likewise erected and garrisoned another fort at Cannanor, and arriving at Cochin, he secured it to the Portuguese interest. The island of Madagascar was discovered during his government, and his son Don Lorenzo first surveyed the Maldives islands; and about the same time discovered the fine island of Ceylon, the principal sovereign of which he brought under submission to the crown of Portugal. Returning from this expedition, while employed in the fleet destined against Calicut, he lost his life in a sea-fight against the Zamorin. His father sustained his loss with a heroic firmness, saying, \"that Lorenzo could not die better than in the service of his country.\" On the arrival of Alphonso d'Albuquerque, who was destined to be his successor, Almeida yielded to the impressions of jealousy; and under the pretence of misconduct he confined him in the citadel of Cannanor. He engaged in 1508, the whole force of the Mahommedans in the port of Diu; and, gaining a complete victory, facilitated the enterprises of Albuquerque his successor, by contributing to break that formidable league by which the Zamorin was in hopes of being able to compel the Portuguese to abandon their Indian conquests. Returning home with the great riches which he had acquired, he unfortunately touched at Saldanha Point on the coast of Africa, where some of the sailors, in quest of water, quarrelled with the natives, who attacked and drove them to their ships. With a view to revenge this pretended affront, they persuaded Almeida himself to go ashore, with a body of 150 men, armed only with swords and lances. While stepping into the boat, Almeida exclaimed, \"whither do you carry my 60 years?\" The Portuguese furiously rushed on to attack the natives, whose numbers were greatly augmented, and Almeida with 57 of his men were killed in this rash and unprovoked attempt.

This person was a Bereber, and was a famous preacher of the tribe of Muzamada, which was settled along Mount Atlas. His scheme was the exertion of ingenuity, and it was executed with unremitting activity. In order to obtain attention and success, he assumed the title of Mohdi or Mohedi, and claimed the honour of leader of the orthodox, or unitarians, and, by his preaching they became so numerous, that he even dared to let the royal power at defiance. Confident of security, and immersed in pleasure, Brahem looked with a contemptuous eye upon the infraction of a party composed of such persons. They increased in number and strength, so that the king was at last roused from his indolence, and prepared for his own security and their subjection. In the first engagement he was defeated, being overpowered with superior numbers. The artful Abdallah took possession of the capital, so that Brahem, pursued as a fugitive by Abdolmumen, one of the party, sought refuge in the city of Fez. The gates were shut against him; but they were opened to admit his pursuers.

Concealed by the darkness of the night, he escaped with his favourite wife on horseback behind him; but being closely pursued by the enemy, rather than fall into their hands, he rushed over a precipice, and, along with his wife, he was dashed to pieces. Such was the death of this prince, which put a final period to the empire of the Almoravides. When the death of Brahem was known, Abdolmumen was chosen by the chiefs of that party his successor, and proclaimed king of the Almohedes, under the title of Al Emir Al Mumin Abdallah Mohammed Abdal Mumin Ebn Abdallah Ibbi Ali, i.e. Chief or Emperor of the true Believers of the house of Mohammed Abdal Mumin, the son of Abdal Mumin, the son of Abdallah, of the lineage of Ali. Abdallah, during his reign, enacted prudential laws for the establishment of his new kingdom, and the regulation of the conduct of his followers. He appointed a council of forty of his disciples, all of whom were preachers. Some of these were commissioned to regulate all public affairs; and at proper seasons they went forth as itinerant preachers for the purpose of strengthening their party, and spreading their doctrines, and fifteen of their number acted as secretaries. As both the regal and pontifical dignities were united in the same person, the king was chosen from both of these two classes. The disciples of this sect were denominated Mohammedin, or Ali Mohaddin; but the Arabian writers only style them preachers, and the Spanish Al Mohedes. The descendants and successors of that tribe continued to retain the appellation of Emir Al Muminin, or chiefs of the faithful believers, as long as their dynasty lasted; and they became very powerful both in Africa and Spain. By their invectives against the\nAlmohades, the tyranny of the Almoravides, and their loud clamours for liberty, they induced the greater part of the kingdom to revolt, and to embrace their religious doctrines. The chief thing in them was their specious pretence to orthodoxy, and strict adherence to the unity of the Godhead, which they inculcated with the greatest zeal and diligence.\n\nOn his accession to power, the new sovereign extinguished all the unhappy remains and steady adherents of this race, by strangling Ifaac the son of Brahem. The Almoravides governor taking advantage of the general tumult and distraction that prevailed, constituted their governments into independent principalities and petty kingdoms; and they who inhabited the mountainous parts, established under their own chevys a variety of lordships. The Libyans and Nubians took the lead, and the states of Barbary, Tripoli, Kairwan, Tunis, Algiers, Tremecen, and Bujeyah, followed their example. Abdolmumun, however, successfully pursued his conquests; and in a few years he reduced to his subjection the Numidians and Galatians in the west, and the kingdoms of Tunis, Tremecen, and the greatest part of Mauritania and Tingitana. He expelled the Christians of Mohedia, the chief city of Africa, and some others on the same coast; and likewise made conquests both in Spain and Portugal. He died in the seventh year of his reign, and was succeeded, A.D. 1156, by his son Yulef or Joseph. Yulef proved a valiant and martial prince, and in his military court he first established the kings of Tunis and Bujeyah in their respective dominions, as his tributaries and vassals; and then by earnest solicitation he embarked for Spain to assist the Moorish princes. Yakub or Jacob, or the conqueror, succeeding him after providing for his own safety against the revolted and plundering Arabs, pursued his conquests with such success, that he soon became master of the whole country lying between Numidia and the entire length of the Barbary coasts, from Tripoli to the boundaries of the kingdom of Morocco. Thus he was acknowledged as sovereign by most of the Arabian Moorish princes in his Spanish dominions; but also extended his territory above 1200 leagues in length, and 480 in breadth.\n\nThe remaining part of the history of this prince is involved in obscurity. About the year 1206, he quelled a revolt in Morocco, but violated his faith with the governor of the capital, which he reduced, and in a cruel and perfidious manner he extirpated all his adherents. Touched, it is said, with remorse, he disappeared, and, according to report, wandered about obscure and unknown, until he died in the humble condition of a baker at Alexandria. His son Mohammed, named Al Naker, succeeded his father; and, on his accession to the crown, he passed over into Spain with an immense army of 120,000 horse and 300,000 foot, and engaging the whole force of the Christians on the plains of Tholofa, received a total defeat, with the loss of above 150,000 foot, 30,000 horse, and 50,000 prisoners. According to Spanish and other historians, this famous battle was fought in 617, A.D. 1220; but according to the Arabian writers, it was in the year of the Hegira 629, A.D. 1212. Returning home to Africa, he was received with coldness and disgust by his subjects, on account of his defeat; and soon after died of vexation, having appointed his grand-\n\nfon Zeyed Arrax his successor. A descendant of the Abdolwates, ancient monarchs of the kingdom, named Gamarazan Ebn Zezen, of the tribe of the Zeneti, caused him to be assassinated. With him terminated the dynasty or government of the Almohades, having possessed it for about 170 years, which gave place to that of the Benimerini, another branch of the Zeneti. These having enlarged their conquests, and enriched themselves by frequent inroads, not only into the neighbouring kingdoms, but even Nubia, Libya, and Numidia, were at length lost in the general prevalence of Mohamedism, after having existed 117 years.\n\n(Mod.

Hence they assumed the name of Morabites, which was changed by the\nAlmoravi- the Spaniards into that of Almoravides. Abubeker ben Omar, called by the Spanish authors Abu Texe- fien, was the first chief of this tribe. Supported by a powerful army of malecontents from the provinces of Numidia and Libya, which was assembled by the influence of the Morabites, or Marabouts, he founded the dynasty of the Almoravides in Barbary, in the year 1051. Texeifen was succeeded by his son Yufc or Joseph, who, after having reduced to a state of vassalage the kingdoms of Tremecen, Fez, and Tunis, passed over into Spain during the time of the civil wars, vigorously repulsed the Christians, and soon saw the greatest part of the kingdoms of Murcia, Granada, Cordova, Leon, and some parts of Valencia, subjected to his power. He then returned into Africa, and left his newly acquired dominions, with a considerable army, under the government of his nephew Moham- med. On his arrival in Africa, with a view to prosecute and extend his conquests in Spain, he announced, in a public declaration, a general gazie, or religious war; assembled a numerous army, with which he embarked at Ceuta; and rejoining his nephew in Andalusia, soon laid waste that province with fire and sword.\n\nIn the year 1107, five years afterwards, he undertook another invasion, penetrated into the kingdom of Portugal, and reduced the city of Lisbon, with a considerable part of the kingdom. At this time he lost the cities of Alguazir and Gibraltar, which he had formerly taken. On his return to Barbary, he was defeated at sea. This induced him to propose a truce, which was agreed to only on condition of his submitting to become the tributary of the Spanish king. Indignant at these humiliating terms, Yufc made a vow that he would never desist in his attempts, till he had utterly rooted out the Christian religion in Spain. He made preparations accordingly for a fresh invasion, embarked his army, and landing at Malaga, marched into the enemy's country. His progress was rapid; but his measures were inconsiderately planned and rashly executed. In the famous battle of the Seven Counts, he was indeed victorious, but after a terrible slaughter, and the loss of great part of his army. This disastrous victory obliged him to return to Africa; and he died soon after at his capital of Morocco. Ali his son, succeeded to the sovereignty in 1110. This prince who seems to have been of a less warlike disposition than his father, neglecting his Spanish conquests, turned his attention to the arts of peace, and erected many sumptuous buildings, and in particular the great mosque of Morocco. Alphonso, then king of Aragon, retook from him some considerable cities; which obliged him to undertake an expedition to Spain in support of the Moorish princes. But all his attempts proved unfortunate; and in his last enterprise, though powerfully assisted by the Moorish chiefs, with the loss of 30,000 men he was defeated and slain by Alphonso, in the sixth year of his reign.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Al Abraham, who devoted himself entirely to pleasure. His subjects were harassed and oppressed with heavy taxes, which excited discontent and open rebellion. A revolution was soon effected, and in the 25th year of his reign, the government transferred from the tribe of the Almoravides to the Almohades. (Mod. Univ.

The Alcoran represents alms as a necessary means to make prayer be heard. Hence that saying of one of their caliphs: \"Prayer carries us half way to God, fasting brings us to the door of his palace, and alms introduces us into the presence chamber.\" Hence many illustrious examples of this virtue among the Mahometans. Hafan, the son of Ali, and grandson of Mohammed, in particular, is related to have thrice in his life divided his substance equally between himself and the poor, and twice to have given away all he had.

The town is populous, and in general well built; it has a large town-house, where the quarter-sessions and county-courts are held, and members of parliament elected. It has a spacious square, in which a market is held every Saturday. Alnwick appears to have been formerly fortified, by the vestiges of a wall still visible in many parts, and three gates which remain almost entire. It is governed by four chamberlains, who are chosen once in two years out of a common council, consisting of 24 members. It is ornamented by a stately old Gothic castle, which has been the seat of the noble family of Percy, earls of Northumberland. As the audits for receipt of rents have ever been in this castle, it has always been kept in tolerable repair; and not many years ago, it was repaired and beautified by the duke of Northumberland, who made very considerable alterations, upon a most elegant plan, with a view to reside in it some part of the summer season. The manner of making freemen is peculiar to this place, and indeed is as ridiculous as singular. The persons who are to be made free, or, as the phrase is, leap the well, assemble in the market-place, very early in the morning, on the 25th of April, being St Mark's day. They appear on horseback, with every man his sword by his side, dressed in white, and with white nightcaps, attended by the four chamberlains and the castle bailiff, mounted and armed in the same manner; from hence they proceed, with music playing before them, to a large dirty pool, called Freeman's-well, where they dismount, and draw up in a body, at some distance from the water; and then rush into it all at once, and scramble through the mud as fast as they can. As the water is generally very foul, they come out in a dirty condition; but taking a dram, they put on dry clothes, remount their horses, and ride full gallop round the confines of the district; then re-enter the town, sword in hand, and are met by women dressed in ribbons with bells and garlands, dancing and singing. These are called *timber-wrights*. The houses of the new freemen are on this day distinguished by a great holly bush, as a signal for their friends to assemble and make merry with them after their return. This ceremony is owing to King John, who was mired in this well, and who, as a punishment for not mending the road, made this a part of their charter.

He Alp Arslan, was born in the year 1039, of the Hegira 421. In place of Ibrah\u00eem, which was his original name, he assumed that of Mohammed, when he embraced the Muslim faith, and he obtained the surname, Alp Arslan, which in the Turkish language signifies a valiant lion, on account of his military prowess. Having held the chief command in Khorasan for ten years as lieutenant of his uncle Toghrul Beg, he succeeded him in the year 1063, and at the commencement of his reign saw himself sole monarch of Persia, from the river Amu to the Tigris. When he assumed the reins of government, faction and open rebellion prevailed in his dominions, in subduing of which he was ably assisted by Nadham al Molk his vizir, one of the most distinguished characters of his time, whose prudence and integrity in the administration of the affairs of the kingdom proved of most essential service to this prince and to his successor. Peace and security being established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states; and having declared his son Malek Shaw his heir and successor, seated him on a throne of gold, and exacted an oath of fidelity to him from the principal officers of the empire. With the hope of acquiring immense booty in the rich temple of St Basil in Caesarea, the capital of Cappadocia, he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the Euphrates, and entered and plundered that city. He then marched into Armenia and Georgia, which in the year 1065 he finally conquered. In the former country, the very name of a kingdom and the spirit of a nation were totally extinguished. But the native Georgians who had retired to the woods and valleys of Mount Caucasus made a more vigorous resistance. They too, however, overpowered by the arms of the sultan and his son Malek, were forced to submission, and reduced to slavery. To punish them for the brave defence which they had made, and as a badge of their humiliating condition, Alp Arslan obliged them to wear at their ears huge thorns of iron. Some, to escape this mark of cruelty and ignominy, professed to embrace the religion of Mahomet.\n\nIn the year 1068 Alp Arslan invaded the Roman empire, the seat of which was then at Constantinople. Eudocia, the reigning empress, saw and dreaded the progress of his arms. To avert the threatened danger, she married Romanus Diogenes, a brave soldier, who was accordingly associated with her in the government, and raised to the imperial dignity. The new emperor, during the exhausted state of their resources, sustained the Roman power with surprising valour and invincible courage. His spirit and success animated his soldiers in the field to act with fortitude and firmness, inspired his subjects with hope, and struck terror in his enemies. In three severe campaigns his arms were victorious; and the Turks were forced to retreat beyond the Euphrates. In the fourth he advanced with an army of 100,000 men into the Armenian territory for the relief of that country. Here he was met by Alp Arslan with 40,000 cavalry, or, according to some authors, a much smaller number; and the sultan having proposed terms of peace which were insultingly rejected by the emperor, a bloody and decisive engagement took place. Alp Arslan, it is said, when he saw that a battle was inevitable, wept at the thought that so many of his faithful followers must fall in\nAlp Arlan, in the struggle; and after offering up a devout prayer, granted free permission to all who chose it to retire from the field. Then with his own hand he tied up his horse's tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and scimitar, and robed himself in a white garment perfumed with musk, resolved to perish on the spot unless he came off victorious. The skilful movements of the Turkish cavalry soon made an impression on the superior numbers of the Greeks, who were thrown into great disorder, and after a terrible slaughter, were totally routed. Romanus, deserted by the main body of his army, with unshaken courage kept his station, till he was recognized by a slave, taken prisoner, and conducted into the presence of Alp Arlan. In the Turkish divan, the captive emperor was commanded to kiss the ground as a degrading mark of submission to the power and authority of the sultan, who, it is said, leapt from his throne and set his foot on his neck. But this is scarcely probable or consistent with the generous and respectful treatment which he otherwise experienced. For the sultan instantly raised him from the ground, embraced him tenderly, and assured him that his life and dignity should remain inviolate under the protection of a prince who had not forgotten the respect due to the majesty of his equals, and the vicissitudes of fortune. When the terms of his ransom were about to be settled, Romanus was asked by Alp Arlan what treatment he expected to receive. To this question the emperor, with seeming indifference, replied, \"If you are cruel, you will take my life; if you follow the dictates of pride, you will drag me at your chariot wheels; if you consult your interest, you will accept a ransom, and restore me to my country.\" \"But what?\" says the sultan, \"would you have done in such circumstances?\" \"Had I been victorious,\" said the insolent Romanus, \"I would have inflicted on thy body many a stripe.\" The conqueror smiled at the fierce and unsubdued spirit of his captive; observed that the Christian precepts strongly inculcated the love of enemies and the forgiveness of injuries; and, with a noble greatness of mind, declared that he would never imitate an example which he disapproved. A ransom of a million, an annual tribute of 3000 pieces of gold, an intermarriage between the families, and the deliverance of all the captive Muslims in the power of the Greeks, were at last agreed to as the terms of peace and the liberty of the emperor. Romanus was now dismissed loaded with presents, and respectfully attended by a military guard. But the distracted state of his dominions, the consequence of a revolt of his subjects, precluded him from fulfilling the terms of the treaty, and remitting the stipulated price of his ransom. The sultan seemed disposed to favour and support the declining fortunes of his ally; but the defeat, imprisonment, and death of Romanus interrupted the accomplishment of his generous, or rather ambitious, design.\n\nAt this time the dominion of Alp Arlan extended over the fairest part of Asia; 1200 princes, sons of princes, surrounded his throne; and 200,000 soldiers were ready to execute his commands. He now meditated a greater enterprise, and declared his purpose of attempting the conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of his ancestors. After great preparations for the expedition, he marched with a powerful army, and arrived at the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, it was necessary to gain possession of some fortresses in its vicinity; one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, Joseph Cothul, a Circassian. He was, however, obliged to surrender, and was carried a prisoner before the sultan, who, being enraged at his obstinacy and presumption, addressed him in very reproachful terms. Joseph replied with so much spirit, that he roused the resentment of Alp Arlan, and was commanded instantly to be fastened by the hands and feet to four stakes, to suffer a painful and cruel death. Joseph, on hearing this sentence, became furious and desperate; and drawing a dagger which he had concealed in his boots, rushed towards the throne to stab the sultan; the guards raised their battle-axes, and moved forward to defend their sovereign; but Alp Arlan, the most expert archer of his age, checking their zeal, forbade them to advance, and drew his bow; his foot slipped, and the arrow missed Joseph, who rushed forward, and plunging his dagger in the breast of the sultan, was himself instantly cut in pieces. The wound proved mortal, and the sultan expired in a few hours after he received it, in the year 1072. When he found his end approaching, he addressed himself in these words to his attendants: \"In my youth,\" said he, \"I was advised by a wise man to humble myself before God, never to confide in my own strength, or to despise the most contemptible enemy. These lessons I have neglected, for which I have now met deserved punishment. Yesterday, when I beheld from an eminence the number and discipline of my troops, I said in the confidence of my heart, 'What power on earth can oppose me? what man dares to attack me?' To-day, vainly trusting to my own strength and dexterity, I foolishly checked the prompt zeal and alacrity of my guards for my safety, and now I have fallen by the hand of an afflatus! But I perceive that no force or address can resist fate.\" He died in the 10th year of his reign, at the age of 44. He was buried at Maru, one of the four cities of Khorasan, in the tomb of the Seljukian dynasty. On his tomb was inscribed the following epitaph: \"All you who have beheld the grandeur of Alp Arlan exalted to the heavens, come to Maru, and you will see it buried in the dust.\"\n\nThis prince was distinguished for his valour, liberality, and piety. He was patient, just, and sincere. His stature, aspect, and voice, commanded the respect of all who approached him. He had long whiskers, and usually wore a high turban in the form of a crown. He was succeeded by his son Malek Shaw, who had been proclaimed and acknowledged sultan of the Turks during his life. (Mod. Univ. Hist.

The word is formed from alpha and beta, the first and second letters of the Greek alphabet. The number of letters is different in the alphabets of different languages. The English alphabet contains 24 letters; to which if we add j and v consonant, the sum will be 26; the French contains 23; the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Samaritan 22 each; the Arabic 28; the Persian 31; the Turkish 33; the Georgian 36; the Coptic 32; the Mufcorite 43; the Greek 24; the Latin 22; the Sclavonic 27; the Dutch 26; the Spanish 27; the Italian 20; the Ethiopic and Tartarian, each 20; the Indians of Bengal 21; the Baramele 19. The Chinese have, properly speaking, no alphabet, except we call their whole language by that name; their letters are words, or rather hieroglyphics, amounting to about 80,000.\n\nIt has been a matter of considerable dispute whether the method of expressing our ideas by visible symbols called letters be really a human invention; or whether we ought to attribute an art so exceedingly useful to an immediate revelation from the Deity.\u2014In favour of the latter opinion it has been urged,\n\n1. The five books of Moses are universally acknowledged to be the most ancient compositions as well as the most early specimens of alphabetical writing we have. If, therefore, we suppose writing to be the result of human ingenuity, it must be different from all other arts, having been brought to perfection at once; as it seems impossible to make any real improvement on the Hebrew alphabet. It may indeed be replied, that alphabetical characters perhaps have existed many ages before the writings of Moses, though the more ancient specimens have perished. This, however, being a mere unsupported assertion, without any historical testimony to corroborate it, cannot be admitted as a proof. Again, Setting aside the evidence to be derived from Scripture on this subject, the simplicity of manners predominant in the early ages, the small extent of the intellectual powers of mankind, and the little intercourse which nations had with one another, which would seem more particularly to render writing necessary, can scarcely allow us to suppose that such a complex and curious contrivance as alphabetical writing could be invented by a race of men whose wants were so few, their advantages so circumscribed, and their ideas so limited.\n\n2. If alphabetical writing were a mere human invention, it might be expected that different nations would have fallen upon the same expedient independent of each other during the compass of so many ages. But no such thing has taken place; and the writing of every people on earth may be referred to one common original. If this can be proved, the argument from Alphabet, successive derivation, without a single instance of independent discovery, must be allowed to amount to the very highest degree of probability in favour of our hypothesis, which will now rest on the evidence for or against this fact; and which may be summed up in the following manner.\n\nAmong the European nations we find none who can pretend any right to the discovery of letters. All of them derived the art from the Romans, excepting only the Turks, who had it from the Arabians. The Romans never laid claim to the discovery; but confessed that they derived their knowledge from the Greeks, and the latter owned that they had it from the Phoenicians; who, as well as their colonists the Carthaginians, spoke a dialect of the Hebrew scarcely varying from the original. The Coptic, or Egyptian, resembles the Greek in most of its characters, and is therefore to be referred to the same original. The Chaldee, Syriac, and latter Samaritan, are dialects of the Hebrew, without any considerable deviation, or many additional words. The Ethiopic differs more from the Hebrew, but less than the Arabic; yet these languages have all issued from the same stock, as the similarity of their formation, and the numberless words common to them, all sufficiently evince; and the Peric is very nearly allied to the Arabic. Alterations indeed would naturally be produced, in proportion to the civilization of the several nations, and their intercourse with others; which will account for the superior copiousness of some above the rest. It appears then, that all the languages in use amongst men that have been conveyed in alphabetical characters, have been the languages of people connected ultimately or immediately with the Hebrews, who have handed down the earliest specimens of writing to posterity; and we have therefore the greatest reason to believe, that their method of writing, as well as their language, was derived from the same source.\n\nThis proposition will be farther confirmed from considering the famelics of the artificial denominations of the letters in the Oriental, Greek, and Latin languages, accompanied also by a similar arrangement, as alpha, beta, &c. It may still be objected, however, that the characters employed by the ancients to discriminate their letters are entirely dissimilar. Why should not one nation, it may be urged, adopt from the other the mode of expressing the art as well as the art itself? To what purpose did they take the trouble of inventing other characters? To this objection it may be replied, 1. From the influence of our own language we know what diversities may be introduced in this respect merely by length of time and an intercourse with neighbouring nations. And such an effect would be more likely to take place before the art of printing had contributed to establish an uniformity of character: For when every work was transcribed by the hand, we may easily imagine how many variations would arise from the fancy of the scribe, and the mode of writing so constantly different in individuals. 2. This diversity might sometimes arise from vanity. When an individual of another community had become acquainted with this wonderful art, he might endeavour to recommend himself as the inventor; and, to avoid detection, might invent other characters. 3. The char-\nracters of the alphabet might sometimes be accommodated as much as possible to the symbolical marks already in use amongst a particular people. These having acquired a high degree of sanctity by the use of many generations, would not easily be superseded without the aid of some such contrivance. 4. This is supported by the testimony of Herodotus; who informs us, \"that those Phoenicians who came with Cadmus introduced many improvements among the Greeks, and alphabetical writing too, not known among them before that period. At first they used the Phoenician character; but in process of time, as the pronunciation altered, the standard of the letters was also changed. The Ionian Greeks inhabited at the time the parts adjacent to Phoenicia: who having received the art of alphabetical writing from the Phoenicians, used it, with an alteration of some few characters, and confessed ingenuously, that it was called Phoenician from the introducers of it.\" He tells us that he had himself seen the characters of Cadmus in the temple of Iphigenia Apollo at Thebes in Boeotia, engraven upon tripods, and very much resembling the Ionian characters.\n\n5. The old Samaritan is precisely the same as the Hebrew language: and the Samaritan Pentateuch does not vary by a single letter in twenty words from the Hebrew: but the characters are widely different: for the Jews adopted the Chaldaic letters during their captivity at Babylon instead of the characters of their forefathers.\n\n3. What we know of those nations who have continued for many centuries unconnected with the rest of the world, strongly militates against the hypothesis of the human invention of alphabetical writing. The experiment has been fairly made upon the ingenuity of mankind for a longer period than that which is supposed to have produced alphabetical writing by regular gradations; and this experiment determines peremptorily in their favour. The Chinese, a people famous for their discoveries and mechanical turn of genius, have made some advances towards the delineation of their ideas by arbitrary signs, but have nevertheless been unable to accomplish this exquisite device; and after so long a trial to no purpose, we may reasonably infer, that their mode of writing, which is growing more intricate and voluminous every day, would never terminate in so clear, so comparatively simple, an expedient as that of alphabetical characters. The Mexicans, too, had made some rude attempts of the same kind; but with less success than the Chinese. We know also, that hieroglyphics were in use among the Egyptians posterior to the practice of alphabetical writing by the Jews; but whether the epigraphy, as it is called, of the former people, which was in vogue during the continuance of the hieroglyphics, might not possibly be another name for alphabetical writing, cannot be decided.\n\n4. We shall consider the argument on which the commonly received supposition entirely depends: that is, the natural gradation, through the several species of symbols acknowledged to have been in use with various people, terminating at last, by an easy transition, in the detection of alphabetical characters. The strength of this argument will be best understood from the following representation.\n\n1. The first method of embodying ideas would be by drawing a representation of the objects themselves. The imperfection of this method is very obvious, both on account of its tediousness and its inability of going beyond external appearances to the abstract ideas of the mind.\n\n2. The next method would be somewhat more general, and would substitute two or three principal circumstances for the whole transaction. So two kings, for example, engaging each other with military weapons, might serve to convey the idea of a war between the two nations. This abbreviated method would be more expeditious than the former; but what it gained in conciseness would be lost in perspicuity. It is a description more compendious indeed, but still a description of outward objects alone, by drawing their resemblance. To this head may be referred the picture-writing of the Mexicans.\n\n3. The next advance would be to the use of symbols; the incorporation, as it were, of abstract and complex ideas in figures more or less generalized, in proportion to the improvement of it. Thus, in the earlier stages of this device, a circle might serve to express the sun, a semicircle the moon; which is only a contraction of the foregoing method. This symbol writing in its advanced state would become more refined, but enigmatical and mysterious in proportion to its refinement. Hence it would become less fit for common use, and therefore more particularly appropriated to the mysteries of philosophy and religion. Thus, two feet standing upon water served to express an impossibility; a serpent denoted the oblique trajectories of the heavenly bodies; and the beetle, on account of some supposed properties of that insect, served to represent the sun. The Egyptian hieroglyphics were of this kind.\n\n4. This method being still too subtle and complicated for common use, the only plan to be pursued was a reduction of the first stage of the preceding method. Thus a dot, instead of a circle, might stand for the sun; and a similar abbreviation might be extended to all the symbols. On this scheme every object and idea would have its appropriated mark: these marks, therefore, would have a multiplicity proportionable to the works of nature and the operations of the mind. This method was likewise practised by the Egyptians; but has been carried to greater perfection by the Chinese. The vocabulary of the latter is therefore infinite, or at least capable of being extended to any imaginable length. But if we compare this tedious and awkward contrivance with the astonishing brevity and perspicuity of alphabetical writing, we must be persuaded that no two things can be more dissimilar; and that the transition from a scheme constantly enlarging itself, and growing daily more intricate, to the expression of every possible idea by the modified arrangement of four-and-twenty marks, is not so very easy and perceptible as some have imagined. Indeed this seems still to be rather an expression of things in a manner similar to the second stage of symbol writing than the notification of ideas by arbitrary signs.\"\n\nTo all this we shall subjoin the following remarks, which seem to give additional force to the foregoing reasoning.\n\n1. Pliny asserts the use of letters to have been eternal;\nwhich shows the antiquity of the practice to extend beyond the era of authentic history.\n\n2. The cabalistical doctors of the Jews maintain, that alphabetical writing was one of the ten things which God created on the evening of the Sabbath.\n\n3. Most of the profane authors of antiquity ascribe the first use of alphabetical characters to the Egyptians, who, according to some, received them from Mercury; and, according to others, from their god Teuth.\n\n4. There is very little reason to suppose that even language itself is the effect of human ingenuity and invention.\"\n\nThus we have stated the arguments in favour of the revelation of alphabetical writing; which are answered, by those who take the contrary side, in the following manner.\n\n1. Moses nowhere says that the alphabet was a new thing in his time; nor does he give the least hint of his being the inventor of it. The first mention we find of writing is in the 17th chapter of Exodus; where Moses is commanded to write in a book; and which took place before the arrival of the Israelites at Sinai. This shows that writing did not commence with the delivery of the two tables of the law, as some have supposed. Neither are we to conclude that the invention had taken place only a short time before; for the writing in a book is commanded as a thing commonly understood, and with which Moses was well acquainted. It is plain, from the command to engrave the names of the twelve tribes of Israel upon stones like the engravings of a signet, that writing had been known and practised among them, as well as other nations, long before. We must also remember, that the people were commanded to write the law on their door posts, &c. so that the art seems not only to have been known, but universally practised among them. But had writing been a new discovery in the time of Moses, he would probably have commemorated it as well as the other inventions of music, &c. Nor is there any reason to suppose that God was the immediate revealer of the art; for Moses would never have omitted to record a circumstance of such importance, as the memory of it would have been one of the strongest barriers against idolatry.\n\nAgain, though several profane writers attribute the origin of letters to the gods, or to some divine person, yet this is no proof of its being actually revealed; but only that the original inventor was unknown. The learned bishop of Gloucester observes, that the ancients gave nothing to the gods of whose original they had any records; but where the memory of the invention was lost, as of seed-corn, wine, writing, civil society, &c. the gods seized the property, by that kind of right which gives stays to the lord of the manor.\n\nAs neither the sacred nor profane historians, therefore, have determined anything concerning the invention of letters, we are at liberty to form what conjectures we think most plausible concerning the origin of them; and this, it is thought, might have taken place in the following manner.\n\n1. Men, in their rude uncultivated state, would have neither leisure, inclination, nor inducement, to cultivate the powers of the mind to a degree sufficient for the formation of an alphabet; but when a people arrived at such a pitch of civilization as required them to represent the conceptions of the mind which have no corporeal forms, necessity would occasion further exertions, and urge them to find out a more expeditious manner of transacting their business than by picture-writing.\n\n2. These exertions would take place whenever a nation began to improve in arts, manufactures, and commerce; and the greater genius such a nation had, the more improvements would be made in the notation of their language; whilst those people who had made less progress in civilization and science, would have a less perfect system of elementary characters; and perhaps advance no farther for many ages than the marks or characters of the Chinese. Hence we may see, that the business of princes, as well as the manufactures and commerce of each country, would produce the necessity of devising some expeditious manner of communicating information to one another.\n\nThe art of writing, however, is of so great antiquity, and the early history of most nations so full of fable, that it must be extremely difficult to determine what nation or people may justly claim the honour of the invention. But as it is probable that letters were the produce of a certain degree of civilization among mankind, we must therefore have recourse to the history of those nations who seem to have been first civilized.\n\nThe Egyptians have an undoubted title to a very Claim of early civilization; and many learned men have attributed the invention of letters to them. The late bishop of Gloucester contends, that Egypt was the parent of all the learning of Greece, and was referred to by all the Grecian legislators, naturalists, and philosophers; and endeavours to prove that it was one of the first civilized countries on the globe. Their writing was of four kinds: 1. Hieroglyphic; 2. Symbolic; 3. Epitaphic; and, 4. Hierogrammatic. In the most early ages they wrote, like all other infant nations, by pictures; of which some traces yet remain amongst the hieroglyphics of Horapollo, who informs us, that they represented a fuller by a man's two feet in water; fire, by smoke ascending, &c. But to render this rude invention less inconvenient, they soon devised the method of putting one thing of similar qualities for another.\n\nThe former was called the curiologic, the latter the tropical hieroglyphic; which last was a gradual improvement on the former. These alterations in the manner of delineating hieroglyphic figures produced and perfected another character, called the running-hand of the hieroglyphics, resembling the Chinese writing; which having been first formed by the outlines of each figure, became at length a kind of marks; the natural effects of which were, that the constant use of them would take off the attention from the symbol and fix it on the thing signified. Thus the study of symbolic writing would be much abbreviated; because the writer or decipherer would have then little to do but to remember the power of the symbolic mark; whereas before, the properties of the thing or animal delineated were to be learned. This, together with the other marks by institution, to denote mental conceptions, would reduce the characters to a similar state with the present Chinese; and these were properly what the ancients called hieroglyphical. We are informed by Dr Robert Huntingdon, in his account of the Porphyry pillars,\nThe sacred book or ritual of the Egyptians, according to Apuleius, was written partly in symbolic and partly in these hieroglyphic characters, in the following manner: \"He (the hierophant) drew out certain books from the secret repositories of the sanctuary, written in unknown characters, which contained the words of the sacred formula compendiously expressed, partly by figures of animals, and partly by certain marks or notes intricately knotted, revolving in the manner of a wheel, crowded together, and curled inward like the tendrils of a vine, so as to hide the meaning from the curiosity of the profane.\"\n\nBut though letters were of great antiquity in Egypt, there is reason to believe that they were not first invented in that country. Mr Jackson, in his Chronological Antiquities, has endeavoured to prove, that they were not invented or carried into Egypt by Taaut or Thoth, the first Hermes, and son of Misfram, who lived about 300 years after the deluge; but that they were introduced into that country by the second Hermes, who lived about 400 years after the former. This second Hermes, according to Diodorus, was the inventor of grammar and music, and added many words to the Egyptian language. According to the same author also, he invented letters, rhythm, and the harmony of sounds. This was the Hermes so much celebrated by the Greeks, who knew no other than himself. On the other hand, Mr Wile affirms that Moses and Cadmus could not learn the alphabet in Egypt; and that the Egyptians had no alphabet in their time. He adduces several reasons to prove that they had none till they received what was called the Coptic, which was introduced either in the time of the Ptolemies or under Plammitichus or Amasis; and the oldest alphabetic letters which can be produced as Egyptian, appear plainly to have been derived from the Greek. Herodotus confesses, that all he relates before the reign of Plammitichus is uncertain; and that he reports the early transactions of that nation on the credit of the Egyptian priests, on which he did not greatly depend; and Diodorus Siculus is said to have been greatly imposed upon by them. Manetho, the oldest Egyptian historian, translated the sacred registers out of Egyptian into Greek, which are said by Synecus to have been written in the sacred letters, and to have been laid up by the second Mercury in the Egyptian temples. He allows the Egyptian gods to have been mortal men; but his history was very much corrupted by the Greeks, and hath been called in question by several writers from the account which he himself gave of it. After Cambyses had carried away the Egyptian records, the priests, to supply their loss, and to keep up their pretensions to antiquity, began to write new records; wherein they not only unavoidably made great mistakes, but added much of their own invention, especially as to distant times.\n\nThe Phoenicians have likewise been supposed the inventors of letters; and we have the strongest proofs of the early civilization of this people. Their most ancient historian, Sanchoniatho, lived in the time of Abibalus, father of Hiram king of Tyre. He informs us, that letters were invented by Taaut, who lived in Phoenicia in the 12th and 13th generations after the creation. \"Milon (says he) was the son of Hamyn; the son of Misfr was Taaut, who invented the first letters for writing.\" The Egyptians call him Thoth; the Alexandrians Thoyth; and the Greeks Hermes, or Mercury. In the time of this Taaut or Mercury, (the grandson of Ham the son of Noah,) Phoenicia and the adjacent country was governed by Uranus, and after him by his son Saturn or Cronus. He invented letters either in the reign of Uranus or Cronus; and itaid in Phoenicia with Cronus till the 32d year of his reign. Cronus, after the death of his father Uranus, made several settlements of his family, and travelled into other parts; and when he came to the south country, he gave all Egypt to the god Taautus, that it should be his kingdom. Sanchoniatho began his history with the creation, and ended it with placing Taautus on the throne of Egypt. He does not mention the deluge, but makes two more generations in Cain's line from Protagonus to Agrovenus (or from Adam to Noah than Moses. As Sanchoniatho has not told us whether Taaut invented letters either in the reign of Uranus or Cronus, \"we cannot err much (says Mr Jackson) if we place his invention of them 550 years after the flood, or 20 years after the dispersion, and 2619 years before the Christian era, and fix, or perhaps ten years, before he went into Egypt.\" This prince and his posterity reigned at Thebes in Upper Egypt for 15 generations.\n\nSeveral Roman authors attribute the invention of letters to the Phoenicians. Pliny says (A), the Phoenicians were famed for the invention of letters, as well as for astronomical observations and novel and martial arts. Curtius informs us, that the Tyrian nation are related to be the first who either taught or learned letters; and Lucan says, that they were the first who attempted to express sounds or words by letters. Eusebius also tells us from Porphyry, that \"Sanchoniatho studied with great application the writings of Taaut, knowing that he was the first who invented letters.\"\n\nThe Greeks, as we have already observed, knew no older Hermes than the second, who lived about 400 years after the Mezrite Taaut or Hermes. This second Hermes is called by Plato Thoeuth, and counsellor or sacred scribe to King Thanus; but it is not said that he ever reigned in Egypt: but the former Taaut, or Athothes, as Manetho calls him, was the immediate successor of Menes the first king of Egypt. This second Mercury, if we may believe Manetho, composed several books of the Egyptian history, and having improved both the language and letters of that nation, the Egyptians attributed the arts and inventions of the former to the latter. The Phoenician language is generally allowed to have been a dialect of the Hebrew; and though their alphabet does not entirely agree with the\n\n(4) He says in another place, that the knowledge of letters is eternal. What dependence can we put in the opinion of a writer who thus contradicts himself?\nthe Samaritan, yet there is a great similarity between them. Astronomy and arithmetic were much cultivated among them in the most early ages; their fine linen, purple, and glass, were much superior to those of other nations; and their extraordinary skill in architecture and other arts was such, that whatever was great, elegant, or pleasing, whether in buildings, apparel, or toys, was distinguished by the epithet of Tyrian or Sidonian; these being the chief cities of Phoenicia. Their great proficiency in learning and arts of all kinds, together with their engrossing all the commerce of the western world, are likewise thought to give them a just claim to the invention of letters.\n\nThe Chaldeans also have laid claim to the invention of letters; and with regard to this, there is a tradition among the Jews, Indians, and Arabians, that the Egyptians derived their knowledge from Abraham, who was a Chaldean. This tradition is in some degree confirmed by most of the western writers, who ascribe the inventions of arithmetic and astronomy to the Chaldeans. Josephus positively affirms, that the Egyptians were ignorant of the sciences of arithmetic and astronomy before they were instructed by Abraham; and Sir Isaac Newton admits, that letters were known in the line of that patriarch for many centuries before Moses. The Chaldaic letters appear to have been derived from the Hebrew or Samaritan; which are the same, or nearly so, with the old Phoenician. Ezra is supposed to have exchanged the old Hebrew characters for the more beautiful and commodious Chaldee, which are still in use. Berossus, the most ancient Chaldean historian, who was born in the minority of Alexander the Great, does not say that he believed his countrymen to have been the inventors of letters.\n\nThe Syrians have also laid claim to the invention of letters. It is certain indeed, that they yielded to no nation in knowledge and skill in the fine arts. Their language is said to have been the vernacular of all the oriental tongues, and was divided into three dialects. 1. The Aramean, used in Mesopotamia, and by the inhabitants of Roha and Edefa of Harram, and the Outer Syria. 2. The dialect of Palestine; spoken by the inhabitants of Damascus, Mount Lebanon, and the Inner Syria. 3. The Chaldee or Nabatean dialect, the most polished of the three; and spoken in the mountainous parts of Assyria, and the villages of Irac or Babylonia. It has been generally believed, that no nation of equal antiquity had a more considerable trade than the Syrians; they are supposed to have first brought the commodities of Persia and India into the west of Asia; and they seem to have carried on an inland trade by engrossing the navigation of the Euphrates, whilst the Phoenicians traded to the most distant countries. Notwithstanding these circumstances, however, which might seem to favour the claim of the Syrians, the oldest characters they have are but about three centuries before Christ. Their letters are of two sorts. 1. The Estrangelo, which is the more ancient; and, 2. The Fhito, the simple or common character, which is the more expeditious and beautiful.\n\nWe must next examine the claims of the Indians, whose pretensions to antiquity yield to no other nation on earth. Mr Halhed, who has written a grammar of the Sanskrit language, informs us, that it is not only the grand source of Indian literature, but the parent of almost every dialect from the Persian gulf to the Chinese seas, and which is said to be a language of the most venerable antiquity. At present it is appropriated to religious records of the Brahmans, and therefore shut up in their libraries; but formerly it appears to have been current over the greatest part of the eastern world, as traces of its extent may be found in almost every district of Asia.\n\nMr Halhed informs us, that \"there is a great similarity between the Sanskrit words and those of the Persian and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek; and these not in technical or metaphorical terms, but in the main groundwork of language; in monosyllables, the names of numbers, and the appellations of such things as would be first discriminated on the immediate dawn of civilization. The resemblance which may be seen of the characters on the medals and signs of different parts of Asia, the light they reciprocally throw upon one another, and the general analogy which they all bear to the grand prototype, affords another ample field for curiosity. The coins of Assam, Nipal, Cashmiria, and many other kingdoms, are all stamped with Sanskrit letters, and mostly contain allusions to the old Sanskrit mythology. The same conformity may be observed in the impressions of seals from Bootan and Thibet.\"\n\nThe country between the Indus and Ganges still preserves the Sanskrit language in its original purity, and offers a great number of books to the perusal of the curious; many of which have been handed down from the earliest periods of human civilization.\n\nThere are seven different sorts of Indian hand-writings, all comprised under the general term of Naagoree, which may be interpreted writing. The Brahmans say that letters were of divine origin; and the elegant Sanskrit is styled Dael-naagoree, or the writings of the Immortals, which might not improbably be a refinement from the more simple Naagoree of former ages. The Bengal letters are another branch of the same stock. The Brahmans of Bengal have all their Sanskrit books copied in their national alphabet, and they transcribe into them all the Dael-naagoree manuscripts for their own perusal. The Moorish dialect is that species of Hindustanic which we owe to the conquests of the Mahometans.\n\nThe Sanskrit language contains about 700 radical words; the fundamental part being divided into three classes, viz. 1. Dhata, or roots of verbs; 2. Shubd, or original nouns; 3. Etya, or particles. Their alphabet contains 50 letters; viz. 34 consonants and 16 vowels. They assert that they were in possession of letters before any other nation in the world; and Mr Halhed conjectures, that the long boasted original civilization of the Egyptians may still be a matter of dispute. The rajah of Kishinagar affirms, that he has in his possession Sanskrit books, where the Egyptians are constantly described as disciples, not as instructors; and as seeking in Hindostan that liberal education, and those sciences, which none of their own countrymen had sufficient knowledge to impart. Mr Halhed hints also, that the learning of Hindostan might have been transplanted into Egypt, and thus have become familiar to Moses. Several authors, however, are of opinion, that the ancient Egyptians possessed themselves of the trade of the East by the Red sea, and that they carried\ncarried on a considerable traffic with the Indian nations before the time of Sesostris; whom they suppose to have been contemporary with Abraham, though Sir Isaac Newton conjectures him to have been the Shihak who took Jerusalem in the time of Rehoboam.\n\nIn the year 1769, one of the sacred books of the Gentoos called Bagavadam, translated by Meridas Poule, a learned man of Indian origin, and chief interpreter to the supreme council of Pondicherry, was sent by him to M. Bertin in France. In his preface he says, that it was composed by Vialfar the son of Brahma, and is of sacred authority among the worshippers of Vishnu. This book claims an antiquity of 5000 years; but M. de Guines has shown, that its pretensions to such extravagant antiquity are entirely inconclusive and unsatisfactory: whence we may conclude, says Mr. Ayle, that though a farther inquiry into the literature of the Indian nations may be laudable, yet we must by no means give too easy credit to their relations concerning the high antiquity of their manuscripts and early civilization.\n\nIt is not pretended that the Persians had any great learning among them till the time of Hyrcanus the father of Darius. The former, we are told, travelled into India, and was instructed by the Brahmins in the sciences for which they were famed at that time. The ancient Persians despised riches and commerce, nor had they any money among them till after the conquest of Lydia. It appears by several inscriptions taken from the ruins of the palace of Persepolis, which was built near 700 years before the Christian era, that the Persians sometimes wrote in perpendicular columns like the Chinese. This mode of writing was first made use of on the items of trees, pillars, or obelisks. As for those simple characters found on the west side of the staircase of Persepolis, some have supposed them to be alphabetic, some hieroglyphic, and others antediluvian. Dr. Hyde pronounces them to have been mere whimsical ornaments, though the author of Conjectural Observations on Alphabetic Writing supposes them to be fragments of Egyptian antiquity brought by Cambyses from the spoils of Thebes. The learned are generally agreed, that the Persians were later in civilization than many of their neighbours; and they are not supposed to have any pretensions to the invention of letters.\n\nAs the Arabians have been in possession of the country they now inhabit for upwards of 3700 years, without being intermixed with foreign nations, or subjugated by any other power, their language must be very ancient. The two principal dialects of it were that spoken by the Hamyarites and other genuine Arabs; and that of the Koreish, in which Mahomet wrote the Alcoran. The former is named by oriental writers, the Arabic of Hamyar; the latter, the pure or defected Arabic. Mr. Richardson observes, as a proof of the richness of this language, that it consists of 2000 radical words.\n\nThe old Arabic characters are said to have been of very high antiquity; for Ebn Hafhem relates, that an inscription in it was found in Yemen as old as the days of Joseph. Hence some have supposed, that the Arabians were the inventors of letters; and Sir Isaac Newton is of opinion, that Moses learned the alphabet from the Midianites, who were Arabians.\n\nThe alphabet of the Arabs consists of 28 letters similar to the ancient Cufic, in which the first copies of the Alcoran were written. The present Arabic characters were formed by Ebn Mokiah, a learned Arabian who lived about 300 years after Mahomet. The Arabian writers themselves inform us, that their alphabet is not very ancient, and that they received it only a short time before the introduction of Islamism.\n\nOn this account of the pretensions of different nations to the invention of letters, Mr. Ayle makes the following reflections: \"The vanity of each nation induces them to pretend to the most early civilization: but such is the uncertainty of ancient history, that it is difficult to determine to whom the honour is due. It should seem, however, that the contest may be confined to the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chaldeans. The Greek writers, and most of those who have copied them, decide in favour of Egypt, because their information is derived from the Egyptians themselves. The positive claim of the Phoenicians does not depend entirely upon the testimony of Sanchoniatho; the credibility of his history is so well supported by Philo of Byblus, Phoenicia's translator, Porphyry, Pliny, Curtius, Lucan, and other ancient writers, who might have seen his works entire, and whose relations deserve at least as much credit as those of the Egyptian and Greek writers. It must be allowed, that Sanchoniatho's history contains many fabulous accounts; but does not the ancient history of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and most other nations, abound with them to a much greater degree? The fragments which we have of this most ancient historian are chiefly furnished by Eusebius, who took all possible advantages to represent the Pagan writers in the worst light, and to render their theology absurd and ridiculous.\n\n\"The Phoenician and Egyptian languages are very similar; but the latter is said to be more large and full, which is an indication of its being of a later date. The opinion of Mr. Wile, however, that the ancient Egyptians had not the knowledge of letters, seems to be erroneous; as they had commercial intercourse with their neighbours the Phoenicians, they probably had the knowledge of letters, if their policy, like that of the Chinese at this day, did not prohibit the use of them.\n\n\"The Chaldeans, who cultivated astronomy in the most remote ages, used symbols or arbitrary marks in their calculations; and we have shewn that these were the parents of letters. This circumstance greatly favours their claim to the invention: because Chaldea, and the countries adjacent, are allowed by all authors, both sacred and profane, to have been peopled before Egypt; and it is certain, that many nations said to be descended from Shem and Japheth, had their letters from the Phoenicians, who were descended from Ham.\n\n\"It is observable that the Chaldeans, the Syrians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians, all bordered upon each other; and as the Phoenicians were the greatest as well as the most ancient commercial nation, it is very probable that they communicated letters to the Egyptians, the ports of Tyre and Sidon being not far distant from each other.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson is evidently mistaken when he says that letters were invented 2619 years before the birth of Christ. The deluge recorded by Moses was 2349 years...\"\nyears before that event; and if letters were not invented till 550 years after, as he affirms, we must date their discovery only 1799 years before the Christian era, which is 410 years after the reign of Menes, the first king of Egypt, who, according to Syncellus and others, is said to have been the same person with the Mitor of Sanchoniatho, the Mizraim of the Scriptures, and the Osiris of the Egyptians; but whether this be true or not, Egypt is frequently called in Scripture the land of Mizraim.\n\nThis Mizraim, the second son of Amyn or Ham, seated himself near the entrance of Egypt at Zoan, in the year before Christ 2188, and 160 years after the flood. He afterwards built Thebes, and some say Memphis. Before the time that he went into Egypt, his son Taaut had invented letters in Phoenicia; and if this invention took place ten years before the migration of his father into Egypt, as Mr. Jackson supposes, we may trace letters as far back as the year 2178 before Christ, or 150 years after the deluge recorded by Moses; and beyond this period, the written annals of mankind, which have been hitherto transmitted to us, will not enable us to trace the knowledge of them; though this want of materials is no proof that letters were not known until a century and a half after the deluge. As for the pretensions of the Indian nations, we must be better acquainted with their records before we can admit of their claim to the first use of letters; especially as none of their manuscripts of any great antiquity have as yet appeared in Europe. That the Arabians were not the inventors of letters, has appeared by their own confession. Plato somewhere mentions Hyperborean letters very different from the Greek; these might have been the characters used by the Tartars, or ancient Scythians.\n\nIt may be expected that something should be said concerning those books mentioned by some authors to have been written before the deluge. Amongst others, Dr. Parsons, in his Remains of Japheth, p. 346, 359, supposes letters to have been known to Adam; and the Sabaeans produce a book, which they pretend was written by Adam. But concerning these we have no guide to direct us any more than concerning the supposed books of Enoch; some of which, Origen tells us, were found in Arabia Felix, in the dominions of the queen of Saba. Tertullian affirms, that he saw and read several pages of them; and, in his treatise De Habitui Mulierum, he places those books among the canonical; but St Jerome and St Austin look upon them to be apocryphal. William Pottellius pretended to compile his book, De Originibus, from the book of Enoch; and Thomas Bangius published at Copenhagen, in 1657, a work which contains many singular relations concerning the manner of writing among the Antediluvians, which contains several pleasant stories concerning the books of Enoch.\n\nWith regard to this patriarch, indeed, St Jude informs us that he prophesied, but he does not say that he wrote. The writings, therefore, attributed to the Antediluvians, must appear quite uncertain; though it might be improper to assert that letters were unknown before the deluge recorded by Moses.\n\nOur author proceeds to show, that all the alphabets in the world cannot be derived from one original; because there is a variety of alphabets used in different parts of Asia, which vary in name, number, figure, order, and power, from the Phoenician, ancient Hebrew, or Samaritan. In several of these alphabets also, there are marks for sounds peculiar to the language of each, which are not necessary to be employed in the notation of the languages of Europe.\n\nNone of the alphabets to the east of Persia have any connexion with the Phoenician or its derivatives, except where the Arabic letters have been introduced by the conquests of the Mahometans. The foundation of all the Indian characters are those called Shanfcrir or Sungferir. This signifies something brought to perfection, in contradistinction to Prakrit, which signifies vulgar or unpolished. Hence the refined and religious language and characters of India are called Sungferir, and the more vulgar mode of writing and expression Prakrit. From this Shanfcrir are derived the sacred characters of Thibet, the Cashmirian, Bengalese, Malabarese, and Tamoul; the Singalese, Siamese, Maharattn, Concaneese, &c. From the same source we may derive the Tartaric or Tartar characters, which are similar in their great outlines to the Shanfcrir; though it is not easily determined which is derived from the other. The common Tartar is generally read, like the Chinese, from top to bottom.\n\nThere are, however, several alphabets used in different parts of Asia, entirely different not only from the Shanfcrir and all those derived from it, but also from the Phoenician and those which proceed from it. Some of these are the alphabet of Pegu, the Batna characters used in the island of Sumatra, and the Barman or Roman characters used in some parts of Pegu. The names and powers of the letters of which these alphabets are composed, differ entirely from the Phoenician, or those derived from them. It is impossible to assimilate their forms; and indeed it is by no means easy to conceive how the 50 letters of the Shanfcrir language could be derived from the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted originally only of 13; though it is certain, that by far the greater number of alphabets now in use are derived from the ancient Hebrew, Phoenician, or Samaritan.\n\nMr. Ashle next proceeds to consider what alphabets are derived from the Phoenician. These he supposes to have been immediately the ancient Hebrew or Samaritan; the Chaldaic; the Bafulian (a) or Spanish Phoenician; the Punic; Carthaginian, or Sicilian; and the Pelagian. From the ancient Hebrew proceeded the Chaldaic or square Hebrew; the round Hebrew; and what is called the running hand of the Rabbins. The Pelagian gave birth to the Etrurcan, Eugubian or Umbrian, Ofcan, Samnie, and Ionic Greek, written from the left. From the Chaldaic or square Hebrew are derived the Syriac, and the ancient and modern Arabic. The Syriac is divided into the Estrangelo and\n\n(a) The Bafuli are said to have been a Canaanitish or Phoenician people who fled from Joshua, and settled afterwards in Spain.\nAlphabet, and Mendelean, and the modern Arabic has given rise to the Persian and Turkish. From the ancient Arabic are derived the Cufic or Oriental, the Mauritanian or Occidental, the African or Saracen, and the Moorish. The Ionic Greek gave rise to the Arcadian, Latin, ancient Gaulish, ancient Spanish, ancient Gothic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Runic, Illyrian or Slavonic, Bulgarian, and Armenian. From the Roman are derived the Lombardic, Visigothic, Saxon, Gallican, Franco-Gallic or Merovingian, German, Caroline, Capetian, and modern Gothic.\n\nThe Punic letters are also called Tyrian, and were much the same with the Carthaginian or Sicilian. The Punic language was at first the same with the Phoenician; it is nearly allied to the Hebrew, and has an affinity with the Chaldee and Syriac. Some remains of it are to be met with in the Maltese. To make a complete Punic, Carthaginian, or Sicilian alphabet, we must admit several pure Phoenician letters.\n\nThe Pelagii were likewise of Phoenician origin; and, according to Sanchoniatho, the Dioecuri and Cabiri wrote the first annals of the Phoenician history, by order of Taaut, the inventor of letters. They made ships of burthen; and being cast upon the coast near Mount C\u00e6nus, about 40 miles from Pelusium, where they built a temple in the second generation after the deluge related by Moses, they were called Pelagii, from their passing by sea, and wandering from one country to another. Herodotus informs us, that the Pelagii were descendants of the Phoenician Cabiri, and that the Samothracians received and practised the Cabiric mysteries from them. The Pelagian alphabet prevailed in Greece till the time of Deucalion, when the Pelagii were driven out of Thessaly or Oenotria by the Hellenes; after which some of them settled at the mouth of the Po, and others at Croton, now Cortona in Tuscany. Their alphabet consisted of 16 letters, and the Tyrrhenian alphabet, brought into Italy before the reign of that prince consisted of no more than 13. Deucalion is said to have reigned about 820 years after the deluge, and 1529 before the Christian era.\n\nThat the Tyrrheni, Tyrfeni or Hetrufi, settled in Italy long before this period, appears from the testimony of Herodotus, who informs us, that a colony went by sea from Lydia into Italy under Tyrrhenus; and Dionysius of Halicarnassus proves that many authors called them Pelagii. He then cites Hellanicus Leficus, an author somewhat more ancient than Herodotus, to prove, that they were first called Pelagii Tyrrheni; and when they passed into Italy, they settled in that part of it called Etruria. Their emigration took place about the year of the world 2011, or 1993 years before the Christian era, which is 350 years before the Pelagii left Greece. Bishop Cumberland adduces many proofs to show that the Tyrrhenians originally came out of Lydia into Italy. Several Roman authors also speak of this Lydian colony; and Horace compliments his patron Maecenas upon his Lydian descent:\n\nLydomum quicquid Etruscum\nIncoluit fines, nemo generosior est.\n\nThe Etruscan letters are Pelagian, and several of the Etruscan inscriptions are written in the Pelagian language. The Roman letters are Ionic. The Oscan Vol. I. Part II.\n\nLanguage was a dialect of the Etruscan; their characters are nearer the Ionic or Roman than the Etruscan. There is also very little difference between the Pelagian, Etruscan, and most ancient Greek letters, which are placed from right to left. The Arcadians were ancient Greeks, and used the Ionic letters; but at what time they began to write from left to right is not known, as their chronology is very uncertain. The Etruscan, Oscan, and Samnite alphabets, are derived from the Pelagian; they differ from each other more in name than in form; but a far greater number are derived from the Ionic Greek, namely, the Arcadian, the Latin or Roman, and the others already enumerated.\u2014The Runic is immediately derived from the Gothic.\n\nAccording to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the first Greek colony which came into Italy consisted of Arcadians, under the conduct of Oenotrus, the son of Lycaon, and fifth in descent from Phoroneus, the first king of Argos, who reigned about 566 years before the taking of Troy, and 1750 years before the Christian era. These Oenotrians were called Aborigines; and after they had been engaged for many years in a war with the Siculi, entered into an alliance with a colony of the Pelagii, who came out of Thessaly into Italy, after having been driven from the former country. About 1476 B.C., another colony of the Pelagii, who had been driven out of Thessaly by the Curetes and Leleges, arrived in Italy, where they assisted the Aborigines to drive out the Siculi, possessing themselves of the greatest part of the country between the Tiber and the Liris, and building several cities. Sozomenus and Pliny tell us, that the Pelagii first carried letters into Italy; and the latter distinguishes between the Pelagian and the Arcadian; so the letters first carried into Italy were not the Ionic Greek, but those more ancient Pelagian characters which the Pelagii carried with them before Deucalion and Cadmus are said to have come into Boeotia and Thessaly. The story of Cadmus is much involved in fable; but it is agreed by most of the ancients, that the children of Agenor, viz., Cadmus, Europa, Phoenix, and Cilix, carried with them a colony, composed of Phoenicians and Syrians, into Asia Minor, Crete, Greece, and Libya, where they introduced letters, music, poetry, and other arts, sciences, and customs, of the Phoenicians.\n\nDionysius enumerates the following Greek colonies which came into Italy: 1. The Aborigines under Oenotrus, from Arcadia. 2. The Pelagian colony, which came from Eremonia or Thessaly. 3. Another Arcadian colony, which came with Evander from Palantium. 4. Those who came from Peloponnesus with Hercules; and 5. Those who came with \u00c6neas from Troy. It is not easy to discover when the Ionic way of writing from left to right was introduced into Italy; but it is certain, that it did not universally prevail even in Greece till several ages after it was found out. The Athenians did not comply with it till the year of Rome 350; nor was it practised by the Samnites even in the 6th century of that city, or 230 years before Christ: for M. Gaebelein, Vol. VI. Pl. 2. gives us the Samnite alphabet of that century, wherein the letters are placed from right to left; although the Ionic way of writing prevailed in some parts of Italy in the third century of Rome. \"In time (says Pliny) the tacit consent of all nations...\"\nnations agreed to use the Ionic letters. The Romans consented to this mode about the time of Tarquinius Priscus, their fifth king. The letters brought by Demaratus the Corinthian, the father of Tarquin, Mr Wife thinks, must have been the new or Ionic alphabet, and not the same with that brought by Evander 500 years before. After the Romans had established the use of the Ionic letters, they seem not to have acknowledged the Pelasgian and Etruscan to have been Greek alphabets: the most learned of them knew none older than the Ionic, as appears from the Greek Farnese inscriptions of Herodes Atticus. This learned man, out of a regard to antiquity, caused the oldest orthography to be observed in the writing, and the letters to be delineated after the most antique forms that could be found; and they are plainly no other than the Ionic or right-handed characters.\n\nThe ancient Gaulish letters are derived from the Greek, and their writing approaches more nearly to the Gothic than that of the Romans: this appears by the monumental inscription of Gordian, messenger of the Gauls, who suffered martyrdom in the third century, with all his family. These ancient Gaulish characters were generally used by that people before the conquest of Gaul by Caesar; but after that time the Roman letters were gradually introduced. The ancient Spaniards used letters nearly Greek before their intercourse with the Romans. The ancient Gothic alphabet was very similar to the Greek, and is attributed to Ulpilas, bishop of the Goths, who lived in Moesia about 370 years after Christ. He translated the Bible into the Gothic tongue. This circumstance might have occasioned the tradition of his having invented these letters; but it is probable that these characters were in use long before this time. The Runic alphabet is derived from the ancient Gothic.\n\nThe Coptic letters are derived immediately from the Greek. Some have confounded them with the ancient Egyptian; but there is a very material difference between them. The Ethiopic alphabet is derived from the Coptic.\n\nThe alphabet proceeding from that of the Scythians established in Europe, is the same with what St Cyril calls the Servien. The Ruthenian, Illyrian, or Slavonic, and the Bulgarian, are all derived from the Greek. The Armenian letters differ very much from the Greek, from which they are derived, as well as from the Latin.\n\nWith regard to the alphabets derived from the Latin, the Lombardic relates to the manuscripts of Italy; the Visigothic to those of Spain; the Saxon to those of England; the Gallican and Franco-Gallic or Merovingian to the manuscripts of France; the German to those of that country; and the Caroline, Capetian, and Modern Gothic, to all the countries of Europe who read Latin. The first six of these alphabets are before the age of Charlemagne, the last three posterior to it. They are more distinguished by their names than the forms of their characters; and the former indicate all of them to have been of Roman extraction. Each nation, in adopting the letters of the Romans, added a taste and manner peculiar to itself; which obviously distinguished it from the writings of all other people; whence arose the differences between the writings of the Lombards, Spaniards, French, Saxons, Germans and Goths, and all the strange terms observable in the writings of the Francie Gauls or Merovingians; and those of the Carlovingians, their successors, may be traced from the same source. From these distinctions the name of national writing was derived.\n\nThe writing of Italy was uniform till the irruption of the Goths, who disfigured it by their barbarous taste. In 569, the Lombards, having possessed themselves of all Italy, excepting Rome and Ravenna, introduced that form of writing which goes under their name; and as the popes used the Lombardic manner in their bulls, the name of Roman was sometimes given to it in the 11th century; and though the dominion of the Lombards continued no longer than 206 years, the name of their writing continued in Italy from the 7th to the 13th century, and then ceased; when learning, having declined in that as well as in other countries, the manner of writing degenerated into the modern Gothic.\n\nThe Visigoths introduced their form of writing into Spain, after having overrun that country; but it was abolished in a provincial synod, held at Leon in 1091, when the Latin characters were established for all public instruments, though the Visigothic were used in private writings for three centuries afterwards.\n\nThe Gauls, on being subjected by the Romans, adopted their manner of writing; but by subsequent additions of their own, their characters were changed into what is called the Gallican or Roman Gallic mode. This was changed by the Franks into the Franco-Gallie or Merovingian mode of writing, being practised under the kings of the Merovingian race. It took place towards the close of the fifth century, and continued till the beginning of the ninth.\n\nThe German mode of writing was improved by Charlemagne; and this improvement occasioned another distinction in writing, by introducing the alphabet named Caroline, which declined in the 12th century, and was succeeded in the 13th by the modern Gothic. In France it had degenerated by the middle of the 10th century, but was restored in 897 by Hugh Capet, whence it obtained the name of Capetian. It was used in England, as well as Germany and France.\n\nThe modern Gothic, which spread itself all over Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, is improperly named, as not deriving its origin from the writing anciently used by the Goths. It is, however, the worst and most barbarous way of writing, and originated among the schoolmen in the decline of the arts; being indeed nothing else than Latin writing degenerated. It began in the 12th century, and was in general use, especially among monks and schoolmen, in all parts of Europe, till the restoration of arts in the 15th century, and continued longer in Germany and the northern nations. Our statute books are still printed in Gothic letters. The most barbarous writing of the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, was preferable to the modern Gothic. It is diversified in such a manner as can scarce admit of description; and the abbreviations used by the writers were so numerous, that it became very difficult to read it; which was one of the great causes of the ignorance of those times. Along with this, however,\nAlphabet, however, the Lombardic, Gothic, Roman, Caroline, and Capetian modes of writing, were occasionally used by individuals.\n\nThe idea that all the alphabets above mentioned are derived from the Roman, tends to prove the distinction of national writing, and is of great use in discovering the age of manuscripts: for though we may not be able exactly to determine the time when a manuscript was written, we may be able nearly to ascertain its age. For example, if a writing is Merovingian, it may be declared not to be posterior to the 6th, nor prior to the 5th century. If another be Lombardic, it may be affirmed to be posterior to the middle of the 6th, and prior to the 13th. Should it be Saxon, it cannot be of an earlier date than the 7th, nor later than about the middle of the 12th.\n\nHaving considered whence the alphabets now in use throughout the various nations of the world are derived, it remains to say something concerning them as the elements of words, or how far they are capable of expressing those sounds which, by proper combination and arrangement, constitute articulate language. The number of simple sounds in any language cannot be very numerous; and it is plainly these simple sounds alone that we have occasion to represent by alphabetical characters. Hence the person who first invented letters must have been capable of analyzing language in a manner which seems by no means easy to do, and concerning which even the learned among ourselves are not yet agreed. It is this difficulty which has produced the great diversity in the number of alphabetical characters used by different nations; and where we see a vast number of them used, we may account the writing not the better, but much the worse for it; and whoever the pretended inventor was, it is more reasonable to suppose that he disfigured an alphabet already invented, by unnecessary additions, than that he was the author of one himself.\n\nWhen we consider alphabetical characters as thus resulting from an analysis of language, it will by no means appear probable that it was derived from a gradual and progressive operation of the human mind through many ages. There is not the least affinity between representing any object by a picture and finding out the sounds which compose the word by which it is expressed: nor, though a nation had been in use to represent things either in this method, or by any kind of arbitrary marks, for thousands of years, could the one ever have led to the other. Arbitrary marks must always be the same with pictures in this respect, that they must always be fixed to particular objects, and thus be increased ad infinitum. Letters, on the other hand, are indifferent to all objects; and therefore, by their combinations, which are more numerous than as many arbitrary marks as we could remember, may express all the objects in nature. This might furnish an argument of some strength for the divine revelation of writing, were it not that other arts, seemingly as useful, and as difficult to be invented, had not been expressly ascribed to particular persons whom we cannot suppose to have been divinely inspired. Thus metallurgy, music, the keeping of cattle, and use of tents, are all ascribed to a single family; and though writing be not expressly mentioned as an invention in Scripture, there is no reason to have recourse to a revelation for it as long as the human faculties are known to have been sufficient for the invention of it. Nevertheless, if we take a review of the different arts which mankind have invented, we shall find, that few of them resulted from any gradual progress or evolution of the powers of the human mind, but rather by some sudden and almost unaccountable turn of thought in an individual. Thus, the art of printing, little inferior in its utility to that of writing, lay hid for ages, and was at last invented we scarcely know how; so that if one inclined to suppose this a divine revelation, he could be at little loss for arguments to support his hypothesis. This was what all the inventions and evolutions of human powers since the creation had never been able to accomplish; yet nobody believes that it required supernatural abilities to be the author of this art, because we see plainly that it might have occurred to the human mind from various sources, and are surprised that it did not occur long before. In like manner, the method of accounting for the celestial motions by the united forces of projection and gravitation, was no result of the progress that mankind had made in science, but luckily occurred to Mr Horrox, without any thing that we know to direct him, or perhaps from causes almost unknown to himself. Thus, also, the steam engine, aerostation, &c., were suddenly invented only by a slight review of principles well known before, and which had been a thousand times overlooked by those who might have invented both. Alphabetical writing, therefore, might have been no deduction from hieroglyphic or picture writing, from which it is essentially different; and it seems to be some confirmation of this, that all nations who ever pretended to the invention of letters, have ascribed it to the labours of one particular person, without taking notice of the progress made towards it in preceding ages.\n\nThe learned author of Hermes informs us, that to Of the about 20 plain elementary sounds we owe that variety of articulate voices which have been sufficient to explain the sentiments of such an innumerable multitude as all the past and present generations of men. Mr Sheridan says, that the number of simple sounds in our tongue is 28; while Dr Kenrick says, that we have only 11 distinct species of articulate sounds, which even by contraction, prolongation, and composition, are increased only to the number of 16; every syllable or articulate sound in our language being one of the number. Bishop Wilkins and Dr William Holder speak of 33 distinct sounds.\n\nAfter the analysis or decomposition of language into the elementary sounds, the next towards the notation of it by alphabetical characters, would be the delineation of a separate mark or letter to represent each sound; which marks, though few in number, would admit of such a variety of arrangements and combinations, as might be capable of producing that infinity of articulate sounds which compose language. The ingenious Wachter, in his Nature et Scripture Concordia, p. 64, endeavours to show, that ten marks or characters are sufficient for this purpose. His scheme is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{A Z 2}\n\\]\n\nGenus.\nIf this is the case, then the most simple alphabet, which consists only of 13 letters, must have been abundantly sufficient to answer all the purposes of mankind, and much of our twenty-four letter alphabet may appear superfluous. That able mathematician Tacquet has calculated the various combinations of the 24 letters, even without any repetition, to amount to no fewer than $629,448,401,733,239,439,360,000$; while Clavius makes them only $5,852,616,738,497,664,000$. Either of these numbers, however, is infinite to the human conceptions, and much more than sufficient to express all the sounds that ever were articulated by man.\n\nAs there are more sounds in some languages than in others, it follows of course, that the number of elementary characters or letters must vary in the alphabets of different languages. The Hebrew, Samaritan, and Syriac alphabets, have 22 letters; the Arabic 28; the Persian, and Egyptian or Coptic, 32; the present Russian 41; the Shanshiri 50; while the Cashmirian and Malabar are still more numerous. The following is the scheme of the English alphabet, as given by Mr Sheridan in his Rhetorical Grammar, p. 9.\n\nNumber of simple sounds in our tongue 28.\n\n| Genus | Figura | Poteftas |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| Vocal | O      | a. e. i. o. u. |\n| Guttural | O     | k. c. ch. q. g. h. |\n| Lingual | L     | l. |\n| Lingual | Z     | d. t. |\n| Lingual | R     | r. |\n| Dental | N     | f. |\n| Labial | 3     | b. p. |\n| Labial | N     | m. |\n| Labial | R     | s. ph. v. w. |\n| Nasal | A     | n. |\n\nNumber of letters in different alphabets.\n\n| Number of letters |\n|------------------|\n| Hebrew           |\n| Samaritan        |\n| Syriac           |\n| Arabic           |\n| Persian          |\n| Egyptian         |\n| Coptic           |\n| Russian          |\n| Shanshiri        |\n| Cashmirian       |\n| Malabar          |\n\nConsonants divided into Mutes and Semivowels.\n\n6 Mutes, eb ed eg ek ep et.\n3 Pure Mutes, ck ep et.\n3 Impure, eb ed eg.\n\n13 Semivowels or liquids, ef el em en er es ev ez eth ing.\n\n9 Vocal, el em en er ez eth ing.\n4 Aspirated, ef els eth efh.\n\nDivided again into\n\n4 Labial, eb ep ev ef.\n8 Dental, ed et eth eth ez els ezh efh.\n4 Palatine, eg ek el er.\n3 Nasal, em en ing.\n\nMr Sheridan observes, that our alphabet is ill calculated for the notation of the English tongue, as there are many sounds for which we have no letters or marks; and there ought to be nine more characters or letters to make a complete alphabet, in which every simple sound ought to have a mark peculiar to itself. The reason of the deficiency is, that the Roman alphabet was formerly adopted for the notation of the English language, though by no means suited to the purpose.\n\nIt now remains only to take some notice of the forms of the different letters; some knowledge of which is absolutely necessary for ascertaining the age and authenticity of inscriptions, manuscripts, charters, and ancient records. Many authors are of opinion, that letters derive their forms from the positions of the organs of speech in their pronunciation. Van Helmont has taken great pains to prove, that the Chaldaic characters are the genuine alphabet of nature; because, according to him, no letter can be rightly founded without disposing the organs of speech into a uniform position with the figure of each letter; and in support of this system, he has anatomized the organs of articulation.\n\nMr Nelme has endeavoured to show, that all elementary characters or letters derive their forms from the line and the circle. His alphabet consists of 13 radical letters, four diminished and four augmented.\u2014The radicals are L, O, S, A, B, C, D, N, U, I, E, M, R.\u2014H, according to him, is derived from A; P from B; T from D; and F from U: they are called diminished letters. The augmented ones are, Z from S; G from C; W from U; and Y from I. He proves that his characters are very similar to those of the ancient Etruscans; but all characters are composed either of lines and circles of the former, or of parts of the latter.\u2014Mr Gebelin deduces them from hieroglyphic representations; and has given several delineations of human figures, trees, &c., in confirmation of his hypothesis.\n\nOne of the most simple alphabets has been formed by making two perpendicular and two horizontal lines:\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nThus, \\( \\begin{array}{ccc}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i \\\\\n\\end{array} \\)\n\nFrom which may be deduced nine different characters or letters: Thus,\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{cccccc}\na & b & c & d & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i & j & k & l \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n| Phoenicum | Hbr. ex Mediat. | Bastulam | Etruscam | Graecum | Graecum | Latinum | Runicum | Gothicum | Copticum | Teutonicum

When that country was distracted by intestine commotions, in the latter end of the 16th century, and the royal house particularly was so feverishly persecuted by impostors, this gentleman and his two brothers were sent over to England, and recommended to the care of Mr Joseph Bidell a Russia merchant. Mr Bidell, when they were of age fit for the university, sent them to Oxford, where the smallpox unhappily prevailing, two of them died of it. We know not whether this surviving brother took any degrees or not, but it is very probable he did, since he entered into holy orders; and in the year 1618, was presented to the rectory of Wooley in Huntingdonshire, a living of no very considerable value, being rated under 10l. in the king's books. Here he did his duty with great cheerfulness and alacrity; and although he was twice invited back to his native country by some who would have ventured their utmost to have fet him on the throne of his ancestors, he chose rather to remain with his flock, and to serve God in the humble station of a parish priest. Yet in 1643, he underwent the severest trials from the rage of the fanatics; who, not satisfied with depriving him of his living, insulted him in the most barbarous manner; for, having procured a file of musqueteers to pull him out of his pulpit, as he was preaching on a Sunday, they turned his wife and small children into the street, into which also they threw his goods. The poor man in this distress raised a tent under some trees in the churchyard, over against his house, where he and his family lived for a week. One day having gotten a few eggs, he picked up some rotten wood and dry sticks, and with these made a fire in the church porch, in order to boil them; but some of his adversaries, to show how far they could carry their rage against the church (for this poor man was so harmless they could have none against him), came and kicked about his fire, threw down his billet, and broke his eggs.\n\nAfter this, having still a little money, he made a small Alpheus purchase in that neighbourhood, built a house, and lived there some years. He was encouraged to this by the Presbyterian minister, who came in his room, who honestly paid him the fifth part of the annual income of the living, which was the allowance made by parliament to ejected ministers, treated him with great humanity, and did him all the favours in his power. It is a great misfortune that this gentleman's name is not preserved, his conduct in this respect being the more laudable, because it was not a little singular. Afterwards, probably on the death or removal of this gentleman, Mr Alpher left Huntingdonshire, and came and resided at Hammersmith till the Restoration put him in possession of his living again. He returned on this occasion to Huntingdonshire, where he did not stay long; for being upwards of 80, and withal very infirm, he could not perform the duties of his function. Having, therefore, settled a curate, he retired to his eldest son's house at Hammersmith, where soon after he died, much honoured and respected, and affording a remarkable instance of the vicissitudes of the world.","sp":359,"ep":359},{"h":"ALPHEUS","t":"(Strabo); ALPEUS, (Ptolemy); a noted and large river of the Peloponnesus; which, rising in, and after several windings running through Arcadia, and by Olympia in Elis, with a south-west course, falls into the Sinus Cheloniotes, about ten miles to the south of Olympia.

One Egas Munitz had the charge of his education from his father, the duties of which he executed with fidelity and success. In the year 1112 his father died, leaving him a boy only three years of age, when the reins of government and the care of the infant son fell to his mother Theresa. At the age of 18 he assumed the sovereign authority by the advice of the nobles of Portugal, who were highly offended at the growing partiality of his mother for Don Ferdinand Perez, count of Trastamara; for it was suspected that she intended to marry him. But Theresa was little disposed to resign the reins of government. Her party raised an army which took the field to oppose the nobility who supported Alphonso; but her adherents were defeated, herself taken prisoner, and kept in confinement during the remainder of her life. Not long after his accession to the throne, his abilities both to govern and to conquer received a severe trial, in several arduous enterprises, as well against the king of Leon and Castile as against the Moorish princes, who then possessed great part of Spain and Portugal. The Moorish emperor in Barbary having sent a strong reinforcement to the princes, they were enabled to take the field with an army far superior to that of Alphonso's; yet he valiantly met them in the plains of Ourique, and totally defeated their forces. Thus Providence conferred such a signal favour on the Christian arms as procured a residence for Christianity in those parts. The ambitious king of Leon and Castile assumed the title of emperor of the Spaniards, and entered Portugal to waste and destroy; but after the emperor had received a temporary check, the matter was accommodated, and he withdrew his army. In consequence of the victory obtained on the plains of Ourique, Alphonso was instantly proclaimed king; but the form and constitution of the monarchy was not settled until the nobility, prelates, and commons had assembled at Lamego for that purpose in the year 1145. The conquest of Santarem preceded this event, and was sanctioned by the unanimous concurrence of the states. The honour of crowning the king was conferred upon the archbishop of Braga; and it was legally provided, that the royal succession should descend with an uninterrupted succession to the heirs male of Alphonso. The prelates and nobility, with the concurrence of the people, instituted a code of laws consisting of 18 statutes, for the government of the kingdom. It being proposed whether it was their pleasure that the king should go to Leon and do homage to that prince or to any other, every man drawing his sword, exclaimed, \"We are free, and our king is free, and we owe our liberty to our courage; and if he shall at any time submit to such an act, he deserves death, and shall not either reign over us or among us.\" The year after his coronation he was married to Matilda, daughter of Amadeus, count of Maurienne and Savoy; and he recovered Lisbon from the hands of the Moors, in the year 1147. A multitude of adventurers being assembled at the mouth of the Tagus in their progress to the Holy Land, greatly assisted him in this conquest. After having added six other provinces to his dominions, he wisely began with industrious activity to regulate the affairs of his kingdom. In all his great and benevolent designs he was vigorously seconded by Matilda, a princess equally celebrated for her great beauty, mental vigour, and singular piety. With the prudence of the statesman, and the benevolence of the man, he laboured as much for the population of his acquired territories as for their increase. The conjugal felicity of this prince and princess was greatly enhanced by a numerous offspring, which enabled him, by great alliances, to strengthen his interests. His second daughter was married to Don Ferdinand, king of Leon, who, notwithstanding this alliance, generously made war on his father-in-law, and took him prisoner in the field of battle; but released him, on the humiliating condition of coming in person to do homage for his dominions at Leon. In the latter part of his reign, his son Don Sancho, who inherited all his father's military talents, took the lead on several occasions; and in the year 1180, Joseph, king of Morocco, and emperor of the Almohades, advanced with an army as far as Santarem, and there gained a glorious victory over him. Such was the contumacy of the infidels, in consequence of this defeat, that they left the Portuguese at liberty to improve the interior part of the country, and to fortify their frontiers during the whole of the next year. Worn out with care and intense application, Alphonso needed repose, and had retired to Coimbra, where, after a reign of 37 years, and in the 76th year of his age, he died. In the church of the holy cross at Coimbra his remains were deposited with great funeral solemnity. He was no less than seven feet high; and his gigantic size and his martial ardour have given occasion to many absurd and incredible stories concerning his military achievements, so that, in the annals of chivalry, as well as in the records of martial exertions, he attains a very high rank. Two orders of knighthood, that of the Wings, and that of the Avis, were instituted by him; and they still continue to flourish in that kingdom. At the age of 31, when all the faculties of the human mind are in full vigour, Don Sancho, his son, succeeded him. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nALPHONSO II. distinguished by the surname of the Fat, was the third king of Portugal, and succeeded his father at the age of 27 years, in 1212. His accomplished education and his military and political talents were tarnished by his great neglect and hatred of his brothers and sisters, which involved him in many troubles. He, however, commenced his reign with two very popular actions. The one was, sending a body of infantry to the assistance of the king of Castile, who fought with uncommon bravery in the renowned battle of Navas de Tolosa. The other was, his donation of the Castle of Avis to the knights of that order, when the grand-master removed from Evora, and took up his habitation in that castle. During the life of his father, he discovered his aversion to the rest of the family, which induced him to secure the right of his children from the effects of his resentment.\nAlphonso, as much as in his power, by conferring upon them large sums of money and jewels, and some of the best parts of the kingdom. After the death of his father, however, Alphonso strenuously laboured to convince them that it was not in the power of his father to separate or give away any part of his dominions; but all his urgent eloquence proving unsuccessful, he had recourse to arms. The two princesses, his sisters, who had received by the grant of their father very extensive and valuable property, upon being attacked by their brother, implored the interference of the pope, and also applied to the king of Leon, to grant his protection, so that they made a very vigorous defence. The pope granted the request of the young princesses, and threatened to excommunicate Alphonso; and from Galicia, Don Ferdinand entered the dominions of Portugal to ravage and destroy; but the king prepared to defend himself against the arms of the king of Leon, and by specious pretences to evade the excommunication of the pope.\n\nAuthors are not agreed with respect to the success of this war, but it is generally supposed that, by the interference of these two powerful persons, the domestic affairs of that house were restored to a certain degree of tranquillity; however, the departure of the infant Don Ferdinand to the court of Castile, and of Don Pedro to another place, strongly indicate that the reconciliation was far from being perfect. The conduct of the king, however, produced much diversity of opinion among the common people of Portugal. Some were induced, by the arguments of the king, to conclude that it was not in the power of Don Sancho, the late king, to dismember his kingdom; and others very properly suspected the kindness of a prince to his people who displayed such uncommon and such unfathomable hatred to his own relations; at the same time, those nobles whom the father had solemnly sworn to carry his will into execution, regarded the sacred nature of their oaths to such a degree as induced them to operate against the reigning prince.\n\nThe displeasure of the pope, however, was not to be endured. The mind of Alphonso seemed indeed to be of that quality which little regarded the displeasure or thunders of his holiness; but the effects of his threatenings were very different upon the public mind, consequently the king was constrained to seek the favour of the pope, to retain the obedience of his subjects. The king therefore sent deputies to Rome, who argued, that the crown his father wore was the purchase of the blood and valour of the Portuguese nation, and therefore not in his power to alienate; that it was a dangerous precedent, and obviously tended to subvert the sovereignty of a state; that the diminution of the kingdom would tend to promote the cause of the infidels; and, in fine, that his disputes with his sisters had no connexion with ecclesiastical matters. The pope, however, was as well qualified to discern the nature of these specious arguments as the prince was qualified to urge them, consequently he remained unmoved; and Alphonso, in order to have the sentence of excommunication removed which had been pronounced upon him, was reluctantly induced to be reconciled to his sisters. His holiness informed of the reconciliation, with great ceremony revoked his curse and excommunication from the king and his subjects.\n\nBut the reign of this prince was destined to troubles; for no sooner was this domestic broil terminated, than the Moors rushed into the plain country in such prodigious numbers, that the king found it very difficult to repel them, or to drive them back to their own country. A favourable occurrence, however, enabled him to complete his object, by the taking of a fortress seated on a rock which was deemed impregnable, in the following manner. The Germans and Flemings had equipped an immense fleet destined for the Holy Land, consisting of 300 sail, with a numerous army on board. In consequence of tempestuous weather, their fleet was so disabled that they were forced to put into the harbour of Lisbon to refit, just at the time when Alphonso was preparing an army to attack the Moors. The king instantly sent some of the most respectable men of his court to solicit their aid against the Moors, alleging that it was perfectly consistent with their vows to fight against the Moors in Portugal, as well as in the Holy Land. William earl of Holland, and many other generals, were convinced by this argument, and cheerfully engaged to join him against the infidels; but about a third part of the fleet refused to join, and proceeded on their voyage. It happened, however, that they were driven by a violent storm into Italy, where they wintered. The greater part of the nobility and gentry landed under the conduct of William earl of Holland; and it was resolved that they should proceed by sea, and block up Alcacer-do-Sal, the fortress already mentioned, while the army of Alphonso, reinforced by a considerable number, should march by land; and thus attack the place both by land and sea at once. The Moors, convinced of the importance of this place, brought an army into the field consisting of 50,000 men; but the Christians raised the siege, gave them battle, and routed them with great slaughter; and some of the chiefs of the Moors fell in the field. The fortresses surrendered on the 21st of October 1217, and was conferred upon the order of St James; but notwithstanding of very urgent entreaties, the pope would not permit the army to winter in Portugal. He was furious of having these troops and their generals removed to a greater distance. The writers of that nation affirm that the soldiers experienced supernatural aid in this battle, and that the banner of the cross was actually displayed by angels.\n\nBut civil animosity succeeded to infidel war. The archbishop of Braga was highly offended that the clergy were forced to pay money and furnish troops to carry on the war against the infidels; and the people severely complained of the strictness of the laws. To chastise the rebellious clergy, the king seized upon the revenues of the bishop, and forced him to fly from his dominions. Enraged at this impious conduct, the pope excommunicated the king, and laid his kingdom under an interdict. The natural consequence was, that all things were thrown into confusion and consternation, and perplexity universally prevailed; so that Alphonso was obliged to consult measures to quell the rising discontent. It happened, however, that in the midst of these negotiations he was removed by death, and not only died under the papal malediction, but left his kingdom under the same curse. He was interred without royal honours in the conventual church.\nAlphonso church of Alcoba\u00e7a. His person was above the common size; he was brave and strong, but not devoid of many qualities worthy of blame. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAlphonso III. Don, king of Portugal, succeeded his brother Don Sancho II, in the year 1248. In the course of a war with the Moors, which he engaged in at the beginning of his reign, he considerably extended the Portuguese dominions. He took possession of the city of Fara, the capital of the Moorish kingdom, in the province of Algarve. Loula, another Moorish town, which was carried by storm, also fell into his hands. His power was thus extended abroad by the success of his arms, and the administration of his affairs at home became prosperous and popular by his wisdom and prudence. But the tranquillity and prosperity of the kingdom were somewhat disturbed by an interdict which it was put under by Pope Alexander IV, whose displeasure he had incurred by marrying Donna Beatrix, the natural daughter of Don Alfonso the Wise, king of Castile, while his first wife was living. In 1262, when his first queen died, the interdict was removed by Pope Urban, a dispensation was granted, and the children of Donna Beatrix were legitimated. Hitherto frequent disputes had occurred between the kings of Portugal and Castile relating to the boundaries of the two kingdoms. To terminate all differences on this subject, and to prevent them in future, commissioners were appointed to define and settle the limits of their respective dominions; and these were agreed to and acknowledged by a solemn deed.\n\nEncouraged by the prosperity of his kingdom, and by the success which had attended his enterprises, Alphonso made an attempt to extend the influence of the crown, by obliging the clergy to contribute to the welfare of the state. But this measure, as might have been expected, was not quietly submitted to. It occasioned the revival of old disputes, the pope interfered, and in 1268 the kingdom was again laid under an interdict. He succeeded, by the wisdom of his negotiations, in obtaining from Castile an exemption of all claims upon the crown of Portugal, and in procuring an acknowledgment that its monarchs were entirely relieved from the performance of every kind of homage. He died in the year 1279, in the 60th year of his age, and in the 31st of his reign. Before his death, he was reconciled to the pope and clergy, having made a full and ample submission. This prince was tall in stature, of a prepossessing aspect, and of engaging manners. Alike removed from a disposition to extravagant expense or fond avarice, in times of peace and prosperity, he could indulge in magnificence; but when his affairs required it, he failed not to regulate them by frugality and economy. To the poor he was a sincere friend. In a time of scarcity, he pawned his crown to provide them with bread. His steady and vigorous administration secured to him the respect of the nobles and the obedience of the clergy. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAlphonso IV. king of Portugal, surnamed the Brave, was the son of King Denis. Inflamed, it is said, by the queen dowager of Castile, and moved with jealousy against his natural brother Alphonso Sanchez, he revolted against his father, and commenced a civil war. In this unnatural and baleful war, he was justly unsuccessful; but although he was reduced to subjection, yet his haughty and ungovernable temper broke out in many occurrences, until he succeeded his father in 1324. Hunting was his favourite amusement at the time when he ascended the throne; and one day entertaining his counsellors with a narrative of his sporting adventures during a month, one of them ventured to remonstrate against his conduct, and even proceeded to threaten, that if the grievances of his subjects were not speedily redressed, they would be forced to look out for a better king. Alphonso was greatly enraged; but suddenly recollecting himself, he said, \"I perceive the truth of your remark; he cannot long have subjects who will not be a king. Remember that from this day, you have nothing to do with Alphonso the sportman, but with Alphonso the king of Portugal.\" To this resolution he strictly adhered, and exercising the power of a despot, he overawed his subjects, without conciliating their favour or procuring their esteem. He displayed a conduct very singular in a young man, regarding those who had so vigorously opposed him when at war with his father, as friends to the crown, although enemies to the young ambitious prince. He commenced his reign with devising plans for the security of his family in the government, and the good of the kingdom; he likewise manifested a strong benevolence of heart, in his affection for his consort queen Beatrix, and his dutiful conduct towards his mother. Notwithstanding all these amiable qualities, he persecuted his brother Alonzo Sanchez, and wished to inflict the punishment due to him as a profligate traitor; which drove the desperate Alonso to open rebellion. But, however, the natural good qualities of the heart of the king rose superior; so that his persecuted brother was again received into favour. Not long after he engaged in war with Alonso XI, king of Castile, and which, after several severe struggles with varying success on both sides, terminated in an alliance, and in effectual assistance against the Moors. The artful and cruel part which he acted towards Donna Agnes de Castro, the mistress and concealed wife of his son, reflected the greatest disgrace upon his character. It is proper, however, to remark, that he was implicated to the murder of this princess by his courtiers. It was not therefore to be wondered at if his son was induced by this act to rise up in open rebellion against him, but the arms of his father were too formidable; and after his submission, his father treated him with particular marks of attention. Instructed by the growing infirmities of years, he saw the termination of his reign and his life approaching. He began to compensate for his past errors and faults, by establishing acts of piety and benevolence, by redressing grievances, by restraining immorality through the establishment of pious laws, by dictating salutary maxims for the government of the state, by removing those from the seats of power, who were the most likely to become the objects of resentment after his death; he thus laboured to efface from the remembrance of his son the insult which he had received. While concerting these conciliating measures, he died in May 1357, in the 32d year of his reign, and the 67th of his age, \"with the character of an undutiful son, an unnatural brother, and a cruel father.\" But in many respects he deserves the character \"of a great man and a great king, brave and fortunate in war, but artful and indirect in his political measures, attached to his subjects,\"\nAlphonso subjects, strict in the administration of justice, attentive to the public welfare, and affilious in encouraging industry, and enriching his people.\" But after all, it must be acknowledged, that although he was feared and even esteemed, he was not much honoured nor beloved, but was rather reverenced for a proper use of power, than relied upon as a public parent. His character is perhaps expressed in his device, which was an eagle on the wing, with the following motto, *aliae peto*, \"I aim at higher things.\"\n\n**Alphonso V. Don**, king of Portugal, was born in 1432, and on account of his heroic deeds, obtained the surname of the African. At the age of six years, he succeeded his father King Edward. The administration of the affairs of the kingdom during his minority, was entrusted to his uncle Don Pedro, who, although his public conduct met with general approbation, was persecuted as a traitor at the expiration of his regency, and with several persons who were attached to his interest, and involved in his misfortunes, was put to death. The young king had married the daughter of the regent; but even his influence, which was overpowered by the regent's enemies, could not save him from persecution. Afterwards indeed he did justice to his memory, and discovered an unusual mark of respect and attachment to his queen, by abstaining from all connexion with the sex after her death, which happened in 1455, and it has been supposed, was occasioned by poison, administered by the enemies of her father.\n\nAlphonso aspired to the acquisition of military glory. In the year 1458, he made great preparations to attack the Moors in Barbary. He assembled an army of 20,000 men, and equipped a fleet of 200 sail. He first directed his arms against Alcazar, which soon fell into his hands; and to maintain the footing which he had gained, he furnished this place with a strong garrison. For 12 years he prosecuted the war in Barbary with various success, in that time reduced Arzila and Tangier, and in 1740, returned to Portugal loaded with honours. It was then he obtained the surname of African, and to the titles which he derived from his ancestors, added that of lord of the coasts on both seas. And with a view to perpetuate the memory of these exploits and conquests, he caused a representation of them to be wrought in tapestry, a monument purely constructed of very frail materials, but not less durable than many which have been erected by ambition and vanity. During the war in Africa, a military order denominated the knights of the sword was founded.\n\nAlphonso was less successful in supporting the claim of his niece Donna Joanna to the crown of Castile against Ferdinand and Isabella. Finding his own resources unequal to the contest in which he was engaged, he took a journey to France to solicit the aid of Lewis XI. But his solicitations proved fruitless; and the mortification which he experienced from this faithless monarch, filled him with melancholy, and induced him to resign his crown for the purpose of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The administration of affairs during his absence, was committed to the hands of his son Don Juan, who governed the kingdom with great ability. When the king returned, he was joyfully received by the prince, and reinstated in his authority. But the mind of Alphonso had lost its wonted vigour, and was unfit to resume the arduous duties of government. Oppressed still with a deep melancholy, he determined at length to withdraw from the cares of a kingdom, and to end his days in the repose and quiet of a monastery. But on his journey to the place of his retirement, he was seized with the plague at Cintra, where he died in the year 1481, in the 43rd year of his reign, and the 49th of his age. The moderation, the wisdom and prudence which this prince exhibited in his public conduct, were not more powerful in conciliating the love and veneration of his subjects, and of all good men, than were the amiable virtues of his private character. He was distinguished for his affability and condescension, his benevolence and bounty, and especially for his unbounded charity. In the exercise of this latter virtue, he was honoured with the title of redeemer of the captives, in consequence of his having procured the freedom of many prisoners, whose ransom he cheerfully paid. Nor was he less eminent for his chastity and temperance, his attachment to letters, and his love and encouragement of learning. The first library in the palace of the kings of Portugal was founded in his time. He established and vindicated against the pretensions and hostile attempts of the Spaniards, a very profitable trade on the coast of Guinea, which country was discovered during his reign, under the auspices of his uncle Don Henry, a celebrated character of that age. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\n**Alphonso VI. Don Enriques**, king of Portugal, ascended the throne when only a child of thirteen years of age. It is not easy to conceive a kingdom in a more perilous situation than this at the death of Don John. The young king was remarkable for weakness of body, and imbecility of mind; the regency in the hands of a woman, and that woman a Castilian; the nation involved in war, and this reflecting the title to the crown; many of the nobility engaged in feuds and contentions with each other, and some of them secretly disaffected to the reigning family; so that the queen scarcely knew to whom she could trust, or by whom she was to be obeyed. A very indecent joy was manifested by the people on the king's death, as if his death was the dissolution of government: but the great abilities of the queen, and the vigorous measures which she adopted, soon changed the face of affairs. For her own safety, and the prosperity of the kingdom, she appointed Don Francisco de Faro, count of Odemira, of the house of Braganza, governor to the king, and one of her principal ministers of state; and she made choice of Don Antonio de Meneses, count de Caltenheda, to be his coadjutor. The former was a person in high repute among the nobility, in great favour with the people, entirely devoted to the interests of the queen, possessed of a large estate, and far advanced in years; the latter was also an aged man of great talents, and equally capable to preside in the cabinet, and to command in the field. As might naturally be expected, these men sometimes differed in opinion; but this difference never hurt the cause of the queen. Seconded, protected, and counselled by such able men, the nation began to feel the effects of the queen's firmness and superior talents.\n\nThe first important exertion of the queen was, to\nAlphonso send express orders to the count de San Lorenzo, who commanded on the frontiers, to act offensively; but the measure, though prudent in itself, was not attended with the desired success. About this time, however, the duke de St Germain, an Italian officer in the service of Spain, entered Portugal, besieged and took Olivenza and the castle of Moran. In consequence of this, the general was dismissed, and his place was filled by Juan Mendez Valencelles, a man in great favour with the troops, and universally popular. He engaged to act also upon the offensive, but being unsuccessful, he was only saved from punishment by his simple and candid defence; in which he says, \"that he had undertaken the siege in obedience to the order of the queen, and for the honour of the nation; and that he had raised it without orders, for the preservation of the army: that he knew the hazard he ran when he did it, but that it gave him pleasure to think, that at the hazard, or even the loss, of his reputation and life, the troops of Portugal had been saved.\" He was declared innocent and worthy of the queen's favour, by the council of war who presided. Don Sancho Manuel, who commanded in Elvas, and defended it with equal bravery and conduct, shewed himself to be an officer of considerable degree of judgment, by his hazarding nothing more when he had performed his service, upon which the very being of the state depended; but it was the count de Caftanheira who raised that siege, and forced the army of Spain in their lines. After some other political measures, some of them more, and some of them less important; the queen regent finished in a manner, her administration, with the marriage of her only daughter, the princess Catharine, once intended for Lewis XIV. with Charles II. king of Great Britain, one of the most fortunate events that ever happened for Portugal; since it immediately procured them the protection of the English fleets, reinforcements of some thousands of horse and foot; besides adding much reputation to their affairs throughout Europe; which was the reason that the Spanish court opposed it with so much heat, or rather, passion. By the vigorous exertions and fortunate victories of Montefelos, the war was soon terminated to the honour of Portugal. The fifth and last victory in the course of 28 years, was obtained by the Marquis de Marialva, which was chiefly owing to unforeseen accidents, and the determined courage of foreign troops, and to the great abilities of Schomberg. This victory determined the fate of the kingdom, though not of the sovereign; and it was easy to be seen by the more intelligent sort of people in Portugal, that the king would sooner or later be depoed.\n\nAlphonso being struck with the palsy while a child, rendered it necessary to treat him with indulgence, on account of his weak state of health; consequently, as he rose to maturity, his want of parts, and the defects in his education, were very perceptible. It is alleged that a greater affection was thrown by the queen his mother, to the infant Don Pedro, and that she endeavoured at the time of their father's decease, to infuse into the nobles an idea of preferring him; but they universally declined to make a breach in the succession, declaring it was difficult to make an estimate of the powers of a king who was then only a child. The queen yielded, and endeavoured by every proper means to make him worthy of a crown, which, by birth, he was entitled to wear. The count de Odenira, who was charged with his education, found it a very difficult task to manage the young prince, who, forgetful of his birth and destination, was prone only to those amusements which the youth of his age were accustomed to. His guardian and preceptor struggled with this disposition, and even ventured to take some pretty severe measures; but to his great mortification, it proved entirely abortive. Education can only improve, but can never confer mental abilities. Yet he was quick enough to perceive he was a king, which proved very fatal to him. Those who approached his person complied with his follies, and, even commended the most absurd actions; and those who were independent of the court inveighed against him in the strongest terms, and, because guilty of some childish actions, they ascribed to him all the cruel and foolish accidents which happened in Lisbon. Unfortunately, however, for his adversaries, many of these actions, such as fighting of dogs, scouring the streets, encountering three men alone, running at a bull, and such like, indicate no want of strength or courage. A variety of facts that might be mentioned, are sufficient evidence that his natural dispositions were weak, wild, refractory, and unteachable; and that although he was born to reign, yet he was destitute of the qualities absolutely necessary in a prince. The direful consequences of this having been for some time experienced by the nation, the nobles at last were driven to the revolution of deposing the king, and exalting Don Pedro to the regency. In the morning of the next day after the determination, the marquis de Calcaes, at the head of the council, went to the palace to propose the resignation to the king. The king was in bed and fast asleep; the marquis ordered him to be awakened, and knocked violently at the door for that purpose; and when he had obtained admission, he is said to have upbraided him in very coarse terms for his laziness and inattention to public affairs at so critical a conjuncture; adding, that since he must be sensible of his want of abilities to govern a kingdom, the wisest method he could adopt was, to resign it in favour of his brother. The king absolutely refused to consent, but not long after, Don Pedro coming to the palace, ordered him to be confined in his apartment, where one of his favourites persuaded him, in the hope of being set at liberty, to make a short renunciation of the crown in favour of his brother Don Pedro, and his lawful issue, referring the house of Braganza and its dependencies, together with 100,000 crowns out of the revenue of the crown. Nor was this deemed sufficient: for a paper was presented to him, making him avow, that for want of consummation, his marriage was null. This he at first declined; but, by the advice of some divines, he was prevailed on to subscribe the deed. When evening drew on, the unhappy king then perceived he was a prisoner; upon which he sent to request his brother to let him have John, who managed his dog-kennel, to keep him company. When Don Pedro heard it, losing his usual calmness, he burst into a violent fit of passion, and instantly gave orders, that those who were the most agreeable to him, should remain in his apartment. Such was the situation of affairs until the meeting of the States. But\nin the mean time, the unfortunate Don Alonzo died, after he had been a prisoner near fifteen years, suddenly in the castle of Cintra, on the 12th of September, when he had borne the title of king almost twenty-seven, and had lived about forty years. It is reported, that he said in his last agonies, \"I am now going; but it will not be long before the queen shall follow me, to give an account, at the most awful tribunal, of the wrongs she has done me.\" (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAlphonso III. the Great, king of Asturias, was born in 847, and succeeded his father Ordo\u00f1o in 865. In consequence of the rebellion of Don Froila, not long after his accession to the throne, he was forced to leave his kingdom; but that usurper being affianced, with universal applause he returned to his throne. In many successful enterprises against the Moors, in which he greatly enlarged his territories, he soon displayed the talents of a warlike and able prince. He formed a powerful alliance against the Moors, by marrying Ximene or Chimene, descended from the house of Navarre, which paved the way for a long series of victories. The great attention which he paid to the comfort and welfare of the common people, greatly disgusted his haughty nobles; which excited them to revolt against him in the advanced part of his life. Enjoying a small interval of tranquility from the distraction and tumults of war, he called a general council of the clergy and nobility, enacted some useful regulations, and directed their attention to several other subjects, which contributed to the honour and happiness of his kingdom. Whilst he was busily occupied in repairing some of those towns which he had taken from the Moors, he was suddenly interrupted by them, and was under the necessity of defending himself with a considerable army, which he did with such success, that they were defeated with great loss. The unnatural rebellion of his son Don Garcias, at this time, greatly disturbed his government; but by the diligence of the father, this unnatural rebellion was soon quelled. The confinement of Garcias, and the new imposition of taxes, produced general murmurs among the people; which induced Alphonso, now worn out with years and incessant contentions, to assemble the states, and resign the reins of government into the hands of his son Don Garcias. He gave to his other son Don Ordo\u00f1o the province of Galicia. The ambitious and military spirit which Don Garcias discovered in his father's reign, soon displayed itself in an attack on the Moors. By the advice of his father, to which he prudently listened, he was taught that these new conquests tended more to enrich the soldiers, than to the advantage of the crown. Alphonso, although far advanced in years, took upon himself the command of the army raised for new operations, and returned to Zamora loaded with spoils, and with increased reputation and fame, in the year 912. He died December 20th, 912, two years after his abdication, 49 years from the time of his being associated with his father in the government, and when he was about 63 or 65 years of age. His great learning, and the patronage he gave to literature, his distinguished piety and virtue, and other princely qualities, raised this king high in the estimation of mankind. Some writers affirm that he composed a chronicle of the Spanish affairs, from the death of Receifuintho, to that of his own father Don Ordo\u00f1o, which has been incorrectly published by Sandovel, Alphonso, and the later editions has sustained considerable injury. The bishop of Orenfa, at whose request it was originally composed, published it in his own name to the world. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlphonso X the Wise, king of Leon and Castile, succeeded his father Ferdinand in the year 1252. He obtained the appellation of wise, not for his political knowledge as a king, but his erudition as a philosopher. In consequence of the general opinion of his princely qualities, and his uncommon generosity, he ascended the throne with universal approbation. The ill-concerted projects of his ambition, however, disturbed the prosperity of his reign. Pretending a better right than Henry III of England to that territory, he directed his first attempt against Gascony. The arms of England, however, proved too formidable; and he was compelled to renounce his claim, on condition that Henry's son, afterwards King Edward I, should marry his sister Eleonora. At an expense which drained his treasuries, and obliged him to debauch his coin, he prepared for an expedition against the Moors in Barbary; but his maternal right to the duchy of Swabia, which he was called to defend, diverted him from it. Thus he formed a connexion with the German princes; and became a competitor, with Richard earl of Cornwall, for the imperial crown, in quest of which they both expended immense sums of money. The claims of several of the princes of the blood, gave exercise to his military talents; and he was successful both in opposing and defeating them. He formed the romantic design of visiting Italy in the year 1268; but the states firmly remonstrating, he was obliged to relinquish it. But, although he abandoned the design, yet it produced such discontentments both among the common people and conspiracy among the nobles, that it required considerable exertion before the king could allay the ferment. Alphonso, still anxious of ascending the imperial throne, attempted it after the death of Richard earl of Cornwall, and even after Rodolph of Hapsburg was actually elected emperor of Germany, and for that purpose took a journey to Beaucaire to obtain an interview with the pope, in order to prevent him from confirming the election. The Moors, ever ready to draw the sword against him, took this opportunity of entering his dominions for the purpose of ravaging them. This ambitious journey, undertaken at so vast an expense, and productive of so much confusion in his kingdom, proved unsuccessful; for the pope would not realize his claim, or alter the former election. But his excessive ambition was soon punished by domestic calamity; for his eldest son died in this interval, and his second son Don Sanchez, having obtained great reputation in opposing the infidels, to the prejudice of his brother's children, laid claim to the crown. This claim was admitted by the states of the kingdom; but Philip king of France, supporting the cause of the children, whose mother was his sister Blanche of France, involved Alphonso in a war; and it occasioned the retreat of his own queen Yolande or Violante to the court of her father, the king of Arragon. While thus harassed with dissensions, he proclaimed war against France, and by the authority of the pope he renewed the war with the Moors, which proved to unfortunate, that he reluctantly concluded a truce with them, and engaged in a contest\nAlphonso, with the king of Granada. These various measures exhausted his treasure, taxes were multiplied, and the affairs of the kingdom were in such confusion, that he was under the disagreeable necessity of calling an assembly of the states, which was held at Seville in the year 1281, where, on the king's proposal, the states consented to give a currency to copper money. In consequence of the intrigues of Don Sanchez his son, another assembly of the states was held at Valladolid A.D. 1282, which deprived Alphonso of the regal dignity, and appointed Sanchez regent. Reduced to almost insurmountable difficulties, Alphonso solemnly cursed and disinherited his son, and by his last will, in the year 1283, confirmed the act of exclusion, and appointed, for the succession, the infants de la Cerda, and upon the failure of their heirs the kings of France; and at the same time supplicated the affiance of the king of Morocco against the power of his son. At the commencement of the next year, when Alphonso received information, from Salamanca, that Sanchez was dangerously ill, his heart relented. He pardoned his son, revoked his curses, and then died on the 4th of April 1284 in the 81st year of his age. His remains were interred in the cathedral of Seville; and he left behind him the character of a learned man, but a weak king. Alphonso has been charged with irreligion and impiety, chiefly on account of a well-known saying of his, viz., \"if he had been of God's privy-council when he created the world he could have advised him better.\" The various contradictory accounts, given by different writers render the truth of this doubtful; but if ever such a horrible saying dropt from his lips, it must unquestionably be declared inconsistent with the character of an enlightened philosopher; and that reverence of the Creator, which an enlarged contemplation of his works naturally inspires.\n\n\"An indecent astronomer is mad,\" Young.\n\nHe was an eminent proficient in science, and a patron of literature. He concluded that book of laws, known by the title of Las Partidas, which his father had begun; and in that work displayed the abilities of a politician as well as those of a legislator. By obliging his subjects to use their own language, he redressed the confusion in law proceedings occasioned by intermixing Latin with the vulgar tongue. Under his patronage a general history of Spain was composed, which he took great pains in polishing; he also corrected many errors in the statutes of the university of Salamanca. Astronomy being his favourite study, he chiefly directed his attention to the improvement of that science; so that, even during the life of his father, he assembled at Toledo a number of the most celebrated astronomers of his time, Christians, Jews, and Arabs, from all parts of Europe, for the purpose of examining the astronomical tables of Ptolemy, and correcting their errors. The completion of these tables employed them about four years, and in 1252, the first year of Alphonso's reign, they were completed; and they were called Alphonso Tables from the name of this prince, who encouraged the construction of them by his unbounded liberality. It is reported that 400,000 ducats were expended on them, or, according to others, 40,000. Some have ascribed the principal management of this work to the Jewish Rabbi Isaac Aben-Said; others, pretending to derive information from the MSS. of Alphonso, refer it to Aben-Rag\u00e9e and Alcabitius. The other astronomers who were employed on this occasion were Aben-Mufa Mohammed, Joseph Ben-Ali, and Jacob Abuena, Arabians: if there were any Christians, their names are unknown. The 30th of May 1252, which was the day of his accession to the throne, was fixed as the epoch of these tables. A book, entitled \"The Treasure,\" is also ascribed to him, containing treatises of rational philosophy, physics, and ethics. He is likewise said to have been well acquainted with astrology and chemistry; in which last science, he is said to have compiled two volumes in cipher, which are extant, and to be found full in his Catholic Majesty's library. But this work must be more curious than useful, if we consider the state of this science at that period. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlphonso V. king of Arragon and Naples, succeeded his father in the year 1416. As the father had formerly been honoured with the appellation of Just, so the son was honoured with that of Magnanimous. The conspiracy of some of his own nobles against his life, together with the insolence of Pope Benedict XIII., greatly disturbed the tranquillity of his reign. Fortunately this conspiracy was discovered just when it was about to be carried into execution; and instead of proceeding with rigour against the conspirators, he generously tore a paper containing their names without reading it, and added, \"that he would at least force them to acknowledge, that he had a greater regard for their lives than they had for his.\" After quelling a disturbance in Sardinia, he was just making preparations to advance to Sicily, when Joan of Naples offered, if he would assist her against the pope, the duke of Anjou, and the comte Sforza, who had formed a confederacy to depose her, to adopt him as her son and heir. He readily accepted the proposal, and with a powerful army soon raised the siege of Naples, and was immediately declared heir apparent of her kingdom, and duke of Calabria. But as the queen was unfaithful, and did not fulfil her engagements, Alphonso took possession of Naples, and expelled her from it; but when the duke of Anjou again entered her territories, and made himself master of great part of them, she was obliged to renew her solicitations to Alphonso; who, in the year 1434, involved himself in a quarrel with the duke of Milan and the republic of Genoa, by besieging Gaeta in a second attempt to conquer Naples. The Genoese fleet engaged Alphonso; and all his ships were dispersed or destroyed, and himself taken prisoner. But such was the address of this prince, that when carried to Milan a prisoner, he there ingratiated himself to much into the duke's favour, that he became his friend and ally, and soon rose to greater power than formerly.\n\nHe got possession of Naples in 1443; and in an assembly of the states held at Beneventum, and then transferred to Naples, his sovereignty was recognized, and his son, Don Ferdinand, declared successor to the throne, and in consequence of this elevation he was deemed the sole arbiter of peace and war through all Italy. Naples became the residence of Alphonso during the remainder of his life; but his declining years were much disquieted by political dissensions and intrigues. The natural attendant of jealous old age at\nAlphonso last feigned him; and in conformation and dread, he was removed from one castle of Naples to another, until he breathed his last on the 22d of June 1468, bequeathing to his natural son Ferdinand the kingdom of Naples, and to his brother Don Juan, king of Navarre, the kingdoms of Arragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, Sicily, and the principality and dependencies of Catalonia. Alphonso was not only deemed the ablest statesman, and the most renowned military commander in that age, but also the greatest prince that ever occupied the throne of Arragon. He was a distinguished patron of learning, and opened an asylum for the Greek literati expelled from Constantinople. His device was an open book. He frequently uttered this expression, \"That an unlettered prince was but a crowned ass.\" He was brave and liberal; and in all his negotiations he disdained the mean arts of intrigue and dissimulation. It is reported that his personal Quintus Curtius cured him of a disorder with which he was attacked at Capua. Such was his familiar intercourse with his subjects, and his affection towards them, that he walked unarmed and unaccompanied in his capital; and was wont to say, \"that a father has nothing to fear in the midst of his children.\" While he was besieging Gaeta he dismissed the women and children that were turned out of the town without any injury, saying, \"That he had rather lose any city in his dominions than lose the reputation of humanity.\" He leaped into a shallop for the relief of one of his galleys, which with its whole crew and soldiers was just about to perish, exclaiming, \"I had rather share than witness their calamity.\" Such was his generosity, that upon hearing an officer who saw his treasure bringing him 10,000 ducats, exclaiming, \"I should only with that sum to make me happy.\" \"You shall be so,\" said Alphonso, and gave him the money in a present. He deemed dancing a certain degree of madness; but was strongly addicted to women, which involved him in many dishonourable intrigues, and justly entailed upon him the disgrace of an unfaithful husband to a kind and affectionate queen.

He flourished about the middle of the 15th century, and by his uncommon abilities rose to the highest offices both in the civil and ecclesiastical departments of the state. At the age of 22 years he finished his studies at the university of Salamanca, having made great progress in every branch of learning then in estimation. He was present at the council of Basil, and was afterwards promoted to the bishopric of Avila. He died at the age of 40 years, in 1454, and was buried in the church of Avila. The following epitaph, expressive of his great erudition, was inscribed on his tomb.\n\nHie stupor est mundi qui scibile discebit omne.\n\n\"This is the wonder of the world who treated of everything that could be known.\"\n\nThe numerous productions of Alphonsus are sufficient proofs of his laborious industry: during his life he wrote no less than 27 volumes in folio, of which 24 are commentaries on the Scriptures; the rest are on theological subjects. By the order of Cardinal Ximenes they were printed at Venice in 1530, and in 1596; and at Cologne in 1612. Several of his pieces on ecclesiastical history, science, and literature in general, were separately printed at Salamanca in 1560, and also his commentary upon the Chronicon of Eusebius. Although high encomiums have been bestowed upon his works, they have nevertheless in the current of time and human improvement fallen into oblivion. (Dupin.)","sp":367,"ep":367},{"h":"ALPINI","t":"PROSPERO, in Latin, Prosper Alpinus, a celebrated physician and botanist, was born at Marofica in the republic of Venice in November 1553. In his early years his inclination led him to the profession of arms, and he served some time in the Milanese. By the encouragement and persuasion of his father, who was a physician, he retired from the army, and devoted his attention to literature. To prosecute his studies with more advantage, he went to the university of Padua, where he was soon after elected deputy to the rector and syndic to the students. But in the discharge of his official duties which was distinguished by prudence and address, he was not prevented from pursuing the study of physic which he had chosen. He continued his medical studies with zeal and success; and after having acquired the necessary qualifications, he was admitted to the degree of doctor of medicine in 1578. Soon after he left the university, and settled as a physician in consequence of an invitation from the citizens in Campo San Pietro, a small town in the Paduan territory.\n\nIn the course of his studies he had paid particular attention to plants, and had become an enthusiast in botanical science. The sphere of his present practice was too limited to afford him much opportunity of prosecuting his favourite study. He wished particularly to extend his knowledge of exotic plants; and the only means to attain this, he thought, was to study their economy and habits in their native soil. And to gratify this laudable curiosity an opportunity soon presented itself. George Emo, the consul for the Venetian republic in Egypt, appointed Alpini his physician. They sailed from Venice in September 1580; and after having experienced a tedious and dangerous voyage, arrived at Grand Cairo in the beginning of July the following year. Alpini spent three years in Egypt, and by his industry and assiduity, greatly improved his botanical knowledge. With this view he travelled along the banks of the Nile, visited every place, and consulted every person from whom he expected any new information. From a practice in the management of date trees which he observed in this country, Alpini seems to have deduced the doctrine of the sexual difference of plants which was adopted as the foundation of the celebrated system of Linnaeus. He says, \"That the female date trees, or palms, do not bear fruit, unless the branches of the male and female plants are mixed together; or, as is generally done, unless the dust found in the male sheath, or male flowers, is sprinkled over the female flowers.\"\n\nWhen Alpini returned to Venice in 1586 he was appointed physician to Andrea Doria prince of Melfi, and during his residence at Genoa, acquired to great a name as to be esteemed the first physician of his age. The Venetians became jealous that the Genoese state should number among its citizens a person of such distinguished merit and reputation, whose services might be:\nAlpini be essentially beneficial, and whose fame might be highly honourable to his native country. In the year 1593, he was recalled to fill the botanical chair in the university of Padua, with a salary of 200 florins, which was afterwards augmented to 750. He discharged the duties of his professorship for many years with great reputation, till his declining health interrupted his labours. He died in the year 1617, in the 64th year of his age, and was succeeded as botanical professor by one of his sons. Alpini wrote the following works in Latin:\n\n1. *De Medicina \u00c6gyptiorum, libri iv.* \"Of the Physic of the Egyptians, in four books;\" printed at Venice, 1591, in 4to.\n\n2. *De Plantis \u00c6gypti liber:* \"A treatise concerning the plants of Egypt;\" printed at Venice, 1592, in 4to.\n\n3. *De Balsamo Dialogus:* \"A dialogue concerning the Balm of Gilead;\" printed at Venice, 1529, in 4to.\n\n4. *De Praefagienda vita et morte \u00e6grotantium libri vii:* \"Seven books concerning the method of forming a judgment of the life or death of patients;\" printed at Venice, 1601, in 4to.\n\n5. *De Medicina medica,* libri xiii: \"Thirteen books concerning methodical Physic.\" Padua, 1611, folio; Leyden, 1719, in 4to.\n\n6. *De Rhapontico Disputatione:* \"A disputation held in the school at Padua concerning the Rhaponticum;\" Padua, 1612, and 1629, in 4to.\n\n7. *De Plantis Exoticis, libri ii:* \"Of exotic plants, in two books;\" Venice, 1699, in 4to.\n\nHe left several other works, which have never been printed; particularly,\n\n8.

They take their rise from the Vada Sabatia, or Savona; and reach to the Sinus Flavianicus (now Golfo di Carnaro of the Adriatic), and the springs of the river Colapis (now the Kulpe); extending, according to Livy, 2000 stadia in length, or 250 miles: they are divided into several parts, and accordingly have different names. From Savona to the springs of the Varus, where the Alps lie against the sea of Genoa, they are called Maritima, now le Montagne di Tenda. These extend from south to north, between Gaul to the west, and Genoa to the east, beginning at Monaco on the Mediterranean; then running out through the east of the county of Nice, and between that and the marquisate of Saluzzo, terminate at length at Mount Vilo, between Dauphin\u00e9 and Piedmont. Hence to Susa run the Alpes Cottiae (Sueton.) Cotane (Tacitus); mountains extremely high, separating Dauphin\u00e9 from Piedmont, and extending from Mount Vilo to Mount Cenis, between the Alpes Maritimae to the south, and the Graiae to the north. The Alpes Graiae (Pliny), so called from the pass of Hercules, begin from Mount Cenis, where the Cottiae terminate; and run out between Savoy and the Tarentese to the west, and Piedmont and the Duch\u00e9 d'Aouife to the east, quite to the Great St Bernard, where the Alpes Pennine begin. They are also called by some Graiae Alpes, and Graiae Mons (Tacitus); which extend from west to east, between St Bernard and the Adula, or St Gothard; and thus they run out between the Valais to the north, and the Milanese to the south. With these are continued the Alpes Rhaetiae, to the head of the river Piave; a part of which are the Alpes Tridentinae, to the north of Trent. To these join the Alpes Noricae, reaching to Doblach in Tyrol, to the north of the river Tajamento: thence begin the Alpes Carnicae, or of Carniola, extending to the springs of the Save: and the last, called Alpes Pannonicae, and Julie, extend to the springs of the Kulpe. Some, however, extend the Alps to the north of Dalmatia; others, again, to Thrace and the Euxine. But their termination at the Kulpe, as above, is more generally received. They were formerly called Albia, and Alpionia (Strabo). Through these mountains Hannibal forced his passage into Italy, by pouring vinegar on the rocks, heated by burning large piles of wood on them, by which means they became crumbled, (Livy). They are covered with perpetual snow.\n\nThe Alps are the highest mountains in Europe; being, according to some geometricians, about two miles in perpendicular height. They begin at the Mediterranean; and stretching northward, separate Piedmont and Savoy from the adjacent countries; whence directing their course to the east, they form the boundary between Switzerland and Italy, and terminate near the extremity of the Adriatic sea, north-east of Venice. It was over the western part of those mountains, towards Piedmont, that Hannibal forced his passage into Italy.\n\nThe prospect from many parts of this enormous range of mountains is extremely romantic, especially towards the north-west. One of the most celebrated is the Grande Chartreuse, where is a monastery founded by St Bruno about the year 1084. From Echelles, a little village in the mountains of Savoy, to the top of the Chartreuse, the distance is six miles. Along this course, the road runs winding up, for the most part not five feet broad. On one hand is the rock, with woods of pine trees hanging over head; on the other a prodigious precipice almost perpendicular; at the bottom of which rolls a torrent, that sometimes tumbling among the fragments of stone which have fallen from on high, and sometimes precipitating itself down vast descents with a noise like thunder, rendered yet more tremendous by the echo from the mountains on each side, concurs to form one of the most solemn, the most romantic, and most astonishing scenes in nature. To this description may be added the strange views made by the crags and cliffs, and the numerous cascades which throw themselves from the very summit down into the vale. On the top of the mountain is the convent of St Bruno, which is the superior of the whole order. The inhabitants consist of 100 fathers, with 300 servants, who grind their corn, press their wine, and perform every domestic office, even to the making of their clothes. In the Album of the fathers is an admired alcaic ode, written by the late ingenious Mr Gray when he visited the Chartreuse, and which has since been published among his works.\n\nThe glaciers of Savoy are also justly reckoned among the\nthe most stupendous works of nature. These are immense masses of ice, lodged upon the gentler declivities amidst the Alps, and exhibiting representations beyond conception fantastic and picturesque. In the extraordinary narrative of M. Bourrit's journey hither, we meet with the following account of the Prieur\u00e9, in the valley of Chamouni. \"We had (says he) the magnificent prospect of a chain of mountains, equally inaccessible, and covered with ice; and above the rest that of Mount Blanc, whose top seemed to reach, and even pierce, the highest region of the clouds. The chain upon which this mountain looks down like a giant, is composed of masses of rocks, which terminate in pikes or spires, called the Needles, and which are ranged like tents in a camp. Their sides appear lighter and more airy, from the ornament of several hollow breaks and furrows fretted in the rock itself, as well as from the different streaks and panes of ice and snow, which, without changing the general character of their form, or the majesty of their appearance, give them a picturesque variety. Lower down, the eye surveys with ravishment the gills of ice, and the several glaciers, extending almost into the plain, whilst this appears like an artificial garden, embellished with the mixture of a variety of colours. We have a picturesque opposition to this chain, which is formed by innumerable mountains at the distance of near 50 leagues, between whose tops we have a glimpse of those several plains which they environ.\"\n\nM. de Saufure, who had visited those mountains about two months before M. Bourrit, felt himself naturally electrified in this place. This extraordinary phenomenon seems not to have been experienced by the latter or his company; but they heard a long-continued rumbling noise like that of thunder, which was rendered more awful by the silence of the place where they stood. This noise proceeded from the subsequent causes, viz. the avalanches of snow, which separated from the tops of the mountains, and rolled down to the bottom; considerable fragments of the rocks which followed them, overturning others in their fall; and muddy blocks of ice, which precipitated from the summits.\n\nThe valley of Montanvert appears to be peculiarly romantic. \"Here (says M. Bourrit) we behold a spacious icy plain entirely level. Upon this there rose a mountain all of ice, with steps ascending to the top, which seemed the throne of some divinity. It likewise took the form of a grand facade, whose figure was beyond conception beautiful; and the sun, which shone upon it, gave a sparkling brilliance to the whole. The valley on our right hand was ornamented with prodigious glaciers, that shooting up to an immeasurable height between the mountains, blend their colours with the skies, which they appear to reach.\"\n\nAlps, besides its proper signification, by which it denotes a certain chain of mountains which separate Italy from France and Germany, is frequently used as an appellative to denote any mountains of extraordinary height or extensive range. In this sense, Aulonius and others call the Pyrenean mountains Alps; and Gellius the Spanish Alps, Alpini Hispani.\n\nHence also we say, the British Alps, the Asiatic Alps, the Alps of America.\n\nThe Scottish Alps terminate in a most sublime and abrupt manner, at the great promontory, the Alta Ripa of Ptolemy, the Ord or Aird, i.e. the Height of Caithness. The upper part is covered with gloomy heath; the lower is a stupendous precipice, excavated into vast caverns, the haunt of seals and different sea fowl. On the eastern side of the kingdom, this is the striking termination of the vast mountains of Scotland which form its Highlands, the habitation of the original inhabitants, driven from their ancient seats by the ancestors of Lowland Scots, descendants of Saxons, French, and Normans; congeners with the English, yet absurdly and invincibly distinguished from them. Language, as well as striking natural boundaries, mark their place. Their mountains face on the west the Atlantic ocean; wind along the west of Caithness; among which Morven and Scaraben, Ben Hop, and Ben Lugal, arise pre-eminent. Sutherland is entirely alpine, as are Rossshire and Invernessshire. Their Summer Alps are, Meal-Fourvounich, the Corvarill, Benewich, and Benevich near Fort William; the last of which is reported to be 14,59 yards in height. Great part of Aberdeenshire lies in this tract. It boasts of another Morven, roaring far beyond the others. This is the centre of the Grampian hills, and perhaps the highest from the sea of any in Great Britain. They again comprehend the eastern part of Perthshire, and finish on the magnificent shores of Lochlomond; on the western side of which Benlomond rises, distinguished among its fellows. From hence the rest of North Britain forms a chain of humbler hills; but in Cumberland, part of Westmorland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Derbyshire, the Alps resume their former majesty. A long and tame interval succeeds. The long sublime tract of Wales arises, the ancient possession of the ancient British race. From the Ord, the great mountains recede inland, and leave a vast flat between their bales and the sea, frouting the waves with a series of lofty rocky precipices, as far as the little creek of Staxigo; the whole a bold, but most inhospitable shore for shipping. Wick and Staxigo have indeed their creeks, or rather chasms, which open between the cliffs, and may accidentally prove a retreat, unless in an eastern gale.\n\nThe Asiatic Alps are described under the articles Altai Chain and Wentarian Mountains.\n\nThe American Alps are, The Andes or Cordilleras, in South America; and the Appalachian or Alleghany mountains in North America.\n\nThe highest ground in North America is placed by Captain Carver in lat 47\u00b0 W. Long, from London 68\u00b0, between a lake from which the Oregon flows, and another called White-bear Lake, from which arises the Mississippi.\n\nThis exalted situation is part of the Shining Mountains, which are branches of the vast chain which pervades the whole continent of America. It may be fairly taken from the southern extremity, where Staten Land and Terra del Fuego rise out of the sea as insulated links to an immense height, black, rocky, and marked with rugged spiny tops, frequently covered with snow. New Georgia may be added as another horribly congenial, rising detached farther to the east. The mountains about the straits of Magellan soar to an amazing height, and infinitely superior to those of the northern hemisphere under the same degree of latitude. From the north side of the straits of Magellan,\nIan, they form a continued chain through the kingdoms of Chili and Peru, preserving a course not remote from the Pacific ocean. The summits, in many places, are the highest in the world. There are not less than 12, which are from 2400 toises high to above 3000. Pichincha, which impends over Quito, is about 35 leagues from the sea; and its summit is 2430 toises above the surface of the water. Cayambe, immediately under the equator, is above 3000; and Chimborazo higher than the last by 200. Most of them have been volcanic, and in different ages marked with eruptions far more horrible than have been known in other quarters of the globe. They extend from the equator through Chili; in which kingdom is a range of volcanoes, from lat. 26. south, to 45. 30. and possibly from thence into Terra del Fuego itself; which, forming the straits of Magellan, may have been rent from the continent by some great convulsion, occasioned by their labours, and New Georgia forced up from the same cause. An unparalleled extent of plain appears on their eastern side. The river of Amazon runs along a level clothed with forests, after it bursts from its confinement at the Pongo de Berjas, till it reaches its sea-like discharge into the Atlantic ocean.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the Andes pass through the narrow isthmus of Darien into the kingdom of Mexico, and preserve a majestic height and their volcanic disposition. The mountain Popocatepec made a violent eruption during the expedition of Cortez, which is most beautifully described by his historian Antonio de Solis. This is probably the same with the volcano observed by the Abb\u00e9 d'Auteroche, in his way from Vera Cruz to Mexico; which, from the nakedness of the lavas, he conjectured to have been but lately extinguished. From the kingdom of Mexico, this chain is continued northward, and to the east of California; then verges so greatly towards the west, as to leave a very inconsiderable space between it and the Pacific ocean; and frequently detached branches jut into the sea, and form promontories; which, with parts of the chain itself, were often seen by our navigators in the course of their voyage. Some branches, as we have before observed, extend towards the east, but not to any great distance. A plain, rich in woods and savannahs, swarming with bisons or buffaloes, flags, and Virginian deer, with bears, and a great variety of game, occupies an amazing tract, from the great lakes of Canada, as low as the gulf of Mexico; and eastward to the other great chain of mountains, the Appalachian, which are the Alps of that side of northern America. Its commencement is supposed to be about Lake Champlain and Lake George, with branches pointing obliquely to the river St Lawrence eastward, and rising on its opposite coasts; others extending as far as Nova Scotia, but in their progress eastward diminish in height. The main chain passes through the province of New York, where it is distinguished by the name of the Highlands, and lies within 40 miles of the Atlantic. From thence it recedes from the sea, in proportion as it advances southward; and near its extremity in South Carolina is 300 miles distant from the water. It consists of several parallel ridges divided by most enchanting valleys, and generally clothed with variety of woods. These ridges rise gradually from the east, one above the other, to the central; from which they gradually fall to the west, into the vast plains of the Mississippi. The middle ridge is of an enormous bulk and height. The whole extends in breadth about 70 miles; and in many places leaves great chasms for the discharge of the vast and numerous rivers which rise in the bottoms of the mountains, and empty themselves into the Atlantic ocean, after yielding a matchless navigation to the provinces they water.\n\nBeyond the branch of the Appalachian mountains called The Endless, is another of amazing extent, nearly as high as the mountains themselves. This plain (called the Upper Plains) is exceedingly rich land; begins at the Mohocks river; reaches to within a small distance of Lake Ontario; and to the westward forms part of the extensive plains of the Ohio, and reaches to an unknown distance beyond the Mississippi. Vast rivers take their rise, and fall to every point of the compass; into Lake Ontario, into Hudson's river, and into the Delaware and Susquehanna. The tide of Hudson's river flows through its deep-worn bed far up, even to within a small distance of the head of the Delaware; which, after a furious course down a long descent, interrupted with rapids, meets the tide not very remote from its discharge into the ocean.\n\nLower Alps, Department of, in France. This department is one of four into which the former Provence is divided. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Upper Alps; on the east by Piedmont, and the department of the Maritime Alps; on the south, by the department of the Var, and the northeast extremity of that of the Mouths of the Rhone; and on the west, by the departments of Vaucluse and the Drome; the chief town is Digne; its superficies is about 1,459,699 square acres; population 144,436 individuals. It is divided into five communal districts.\n\nUpper Alps, Department of. This department makes a part of Dauphin\u00e9, which contains three. It is bounded on the north by the departments of Mont Blanc and Isere; on the east by Piedmont; on the south, by the department of the Lower Alps; on the west, by that of the Drome, and part of that of Isere; Embrun is the principal town; its superficies is about 1,084,614 square acres; population 116,754 individuals. It is divided into three communal districts.\n\nMaritime Alps, Department of. This department is formed of the county of Nice. It is bounded on the north by the Apennines and the department of the Lower Alps; on the east, by the republic of Genoa; on the south, by the Mediterranean; and on the west, by the departments of the Var and Lower Alps: the principal town is Nice; its superficies is about 632,619 square acres; population 93,366 souls. It is divided into three communal districts.\n\nAlpujarras, or Alpaxares, mountains of Spain, in the province of Granada, on the coast of the Mediterranean sea. They are about 17 leagues in length and 11 in breadth, reaching from the city of Velez to Almeria. They are inhabited by Moors, who are the remains of the dispersion and ruin of their empire. They embraced the Christian religion; but preserve their own manner of living, and their language, though much corrupted. Here is a rivulet between Pitros\nPitros and Portugos, which dyes linen that is dipped in it black in an instant. Near this rivulet is a cavern, from which proceeds so malignant a steam, that it destroys such animals as come near it.

He wrote in the reign of Henry I. There are no circumstances of his life known with any degree of certainty. It is generally believed that he was educated at Cambridge, and that he afterwards became one of the canons and treasurer of St John's at Beverley. And we learn in a note of Bishop Tanner's, that, for the sake of improvement, he travelled through France and Italy; and at Rome became domestic chaplain to Cardinal Othoboni. He died in the year 1128 or 1129, leaving behind him the following works: 1. The Annals of Alured of Beverley; which was published at Oxford in 1716, by Mr Hearne, from a manuscript which belonged to Thomas Rawlinson, Esq.

It was formerly a part of Germany, but was given to France by the treaty of M\u00fcnster. It is one of the most fruitful and plentiful provinces of Europe, abounding in corn, wine, wood, flax, tobacco, pulse, fruits, &c. The mountains which divide it from Lorraine are very high; and generally covered with fir, beech, oak, and hornbeam.\n\nThose on the side of Switzerland are less high; and are furnished with all sorts of wood, as well for fuel as building. The country itself is diversified with rising hills and fertile vales, besides large forests; but that between the rivers Ill, Hart, and the Rhine, as far as Strasbourg, is inferior to the rest, on account of the frequent overflowing of the Rhine. In High Alsace there are mines of silver, copper, and lead. They however work none but those of Giromany, from which are annually drawn 1600 marks of silver, each mark being eight ounces; and 24,000 pounds of copper; but the expense of working them is almost equal to the profit. There are iron works in several parts of Alsace, and particularly at Betzendorf. There is a mineral spring at Sulzbach, near Munster, in High Alsace; which is in great reputation for the palsy, weakness of the nerves, and the gravel.\u2014The original inhabitants of Alsace are honest and good natured, but wedded to their own manners and customs. The fruitfulness of their country renders them indolent and inactive; for the Swiss make their hay and reap their corn, as well as manage the vintage of High Alsace, which sends a great deal of money out of the province. The common language is the German; but the better sort of people in the towns speak French; and, even in the country, they speak French well enough to be understood.\n\nThe number of inhabitants was formerly computed at about half a million, who are mostly Lutherans and Roman Catholics. By the late division of France this province forms two departments, viz. those of the Upper and Lower Rhine; the capital of the former being Colmar, and that of the latter Strasbourg; but formerly it was divided into Upper and Lower Alsace, the former contained 32 large and small towns, and the latter 39, and in both there are upwards of 1000 market towns and villages. The Rauraci, Sequani, and Mediomatrici, were the ancient inhabitants of this province. Under the Merovingian kings its name first occurs in the history of France, and it most probably is derived from the river Ill or Ill, the inhabitants on the borders of which were called Elsassen, from whom the country itself was afterwards denominated Elsass, in Latin Elsafia, Alsfatia, and Alsatia. The Romans wrested it from the Celts; from them it passed into the hands of the Germans; and after the famous battle of Tolbiac, gained by Clovis in 496, it passed into the possession of the Franks. It was incorporated at a future period with the kingdom of Austrasia; and, in 1752, it was subjected, like the rest of the monarchy, to the laws of Pepin and his successors. Lotharius, the eldest son of Lewis Debonnaire, at the decease of his father in 840, obtained it and united it to that part of the empire of the Franks which fell to him, and was generally known by the name of Lotharingia, or Lorraine. Afterwards it fell to his youngest son Lotharius by inheritance; and after him, in 869, it became a province of Germany, and was governed by dukes.\n\nAbout a century before the title of dukes was abolished, the provincial counts who governed under them in Alsace, assumed the title of Landgraver, and the countries over which they presided, obtained the name of Landgravate, the one superior and the other inferior. The best part of the inferior was conveyed to the bishops of Strasbourg in 1375, who assumed the title\ntitle of Landgrave of Alsace. In after times, the government was given by the emperors to several families, until at last Ferdinand I. bestowed it upon the German line of his own family, and consequently it remained in the house of Austria. The property of the town of Brisac, the landgrave of the Upper and Lower Alsace, Sundgau, and the districts of the ten united imperial cities in Alsace, with the whole sovereignty belonging to them, was for ever ceded by the emperor to the crown of France, at the peace of Munster in 1648. The perpetual sovereignty of the city of Strasbourg, together with all its dependencies on the left of the Rhine, were ceded to France by the peace of Ryswick in 1697.","sp":371,"ep":372},{"h":"ALSEN","t":"an island of Denmark, situated in the Lefter Belt, or entrance into the Baltic sea, between Sleiwick and Funen, 100 miles west of Copenhagen.

On his coming to the university, he was very soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich, and published Fabularum Aesopicarum Defectus, Oxon. 1698, 8vo, with a poetical dedication to Lord Wicount Scudamore, and a preface in which he took part against Dr Bentley in the famous dispute with Mr Boyle. He passed through the usual offices in his college to that of censor with considerable reputation; and for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care. In this employment he continued till his merit recommended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester, who appointed him his chaplain, and soon after gave him a prebend in his own cathedral, together with the rectory of Brightwell in the county of Berks, which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement, from which he could not be drawn by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station. In 1717 an action was brought against him by Mrs Elizabeth Astley of Oxford, for a breach of a marriage contract; and a verdict obtained against him for 200l., which probably occasioned him to leave the kingdom for some time. His death, which happened June 10. 1726, was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door. A quarto volume was published in 1752, under the title of Antonii Allop, Aedis Chrifli olim Alumni, Odorum libri duo. Four English poems of his are in Dodley's Collection, one in Peach's, several in the early volumes of the Gentleman's Magazine, and some in \"The Student.\" Mr Allop is respectfully mentioned by the facetious Dr King of the Commons (Vol. I. p. 236), as having enriched the commonwealth of learning, by \"Translations of Fables from Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic;\" and not least detractingly by Dr Bentley, under the name of \"Tony Allop, a late editor of the Aesopian Fables.\" (Biog. Dict.)\n\nAlsop, Vincent, an English nonconformist divine, was born in Northamptonshire, and educated at St John's college, Cambridge, where he took the degree of Master of Arts. When he received deacon's orders, he went to Rutlandshire, and settled at Oakham, where he was an assistant to the master of the free-school. As he was a man of a sprightly turn, he fell into indifferent company; but was reclaimed by the frequent admonitions of the Reverend Mr Benjamin King. He afterwards married that gentleman's daughter, and becoming a convert to his principles, received\ned ordination in the Presbyterian way, not being satisfied with that which he had from the bishop. He was settled at Wilbee in the county of Northampton, whence he was ejected in 1662, for nonconformity. After this he ventured to preach sometimes at Oakham, and at Wellingborough where he lived, and was once six months in prison for praying by a sick person. A book he wrote against Dr Sherlock in a humorous style, made him well known to the world, and induced Mr Cawton, an eminent nonconformist in Westminster, to recommend him to his congregation for his successor. On receiving this call he quitted Northamptonshire, and came to London, where he preached constantly, and wrote several pieces which were extremely well received by the public. His living in the neighbourhood of the court exposed him to many inconveniences; but these ended with the reign of Charles II, or at least in the beginning of the next reign, when Mr Allop's son engaging in treasonable practices was freely pardoned by King James. After this our divine went frequently to court, and is generally supposed to have been the person who drew the Presbyterians address to that prince for his general indulgence. After the Revolution, Mr Allop gave public testimonies of his attachment to government; yet upon all occasions he spoke very respectfully of King James and retained a very high sense of his clemency in sparing his only son.\n\nThe remainder of his life he spent in the exercise of his ministry, preaching once every Lord's day; besides which he had a Thursday lecture, and was one of the lecturers at Pinner's hall. He lived to a great age, and preserving his spirits to the last, died in May 1793. On grave subjects he wrote with a becoming seriousness; but where wit might properly be shown, he displayed it to great advantage. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr Slater, and his memory will be always preserved by his own learned and elegant writings. Of these the most remarkable, besides his sermons, are, 1. Antipozzo; in vindication of some great truths opposed by Dr William Sherlock, 8vo, 1675. 2. Melius Inquirendum; in answer to Dr Goodman's Compartmental Inquiry, 8vo, 1679. 3.

He began his studies at the university of Glasgow, and about this period he had the good fortune to be taken under the patronage of the duchess of Hamilton, which afforded him an opportunity of pursuing the bent of his inclination, by attaching himself to the study of physic. About the age of 33, along with his friend and companion the celebrated Alexander Monro, he went to Leyden, and studied three years under Boerhaave. On their return to their native country, they, in conjunction with Rutherford, Sinclair, and Plummer, undertook departments in the college of Edinburgh, and by their abilities and industry, laid the foundation of that school of physic. The branches of botany and materia medica, were long the favourite studies of his life, consequently he undertook that department, and continued to lecture on them with increasing reputation until his death, which happened in November 1760, at the age of 77 years. His talents appear to have been naturally strong, which he improved and strengthened with great affluency and industry, and employed them successfully in the service of science. In the year 1753, his dissertation on the sexes of plants, in which he combats the doctrine of Linnaeus, was published in the first volume of the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays. The general plan of the work is conducted with much ingenuity, supported by some strong experiments, and although in the opinion of the learned, it has failed in its principal design, yet it must be acknowledged to be one of the best argued pieces on that side of the question. An asperity of language is sometimes used, very unsuitable to a scientific topic; but, however, it is proper to remark, that Linnaeus had given some reasons for this conduct by the nature of some of his descriptions. In the fifth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Essays, we have a short paper by Dr Alston on the efficacy of the powder of tin, to destroy or expel worms from the bowels. He informs us, that he received the prescription from an empiric, who was renowned for his skill in curing persons afflicted with that disease. The patient received the first morning one ounce of tin reduced to powder, and half an ounce each of the two following mornings, and was then purged with the infusion of senna and manna. He speaks with great certainty upon the efficacy of this medicine, which certainly has considerable power in these cases, and may be given to the most delicate subjects with perfect safety. Dr Alston also engaged in a chemical controversy respecting quicklime with Dr Whytt. But the most valuable of all his works, are his lectures on the Materia Medica, which were published in the year 1770, in two volumes 4to. The number of curious and useful facts contained in this book, will tend to secure its reputation, although considerable additions and improvements have been made, since that period, in this branch of science.

The principal chain, rugged with sharp-pointed rocks, approaches and keeps near the shores of the sea of Ochotz, and passing by the sources of the rivers Outh, Aldan, and Maia, is distributed in small branches, which range between the eastern rivers which fall into the Icy Sea; besides two principal branches, one of which, turning south, runs through all Kamtschatka, and is broken, from the Cape Lopatka, into the numerous Kurile isles, and to the east forms another marine chain, in the Aleutian islands which range from Kamtschatka to America; most of them, as well as Kamtschatka itself, distinguished by volcanoes, or the traces of volcanic fires. The last chain forms chiefly the great Cape Tschutki, with its promontories and rocky broken shores.\n\nThe summits of the highest of the Altai mountains are covered with perpetual snow. The loftiest range of this extensive chain, is composed of granite. Another range of inferior height consists of thiftus, which lies on the sides of the granite mountains. Beside these rocks, there are strata of chalkstone, limestone, and marble. The Altai mountains abound in metallic ores. Gold, silver, and lead mines, have been discovered in them, with great abundance of copper and iron. The two latter have been wrought to a considerable extent, and have been found productive.","sp":374,"ep":374},{"h":"ALTAMONT","t":"a very handsome town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in Calabria Citerior, 15 miles north-west of Bagniano.

Some were round, others square, and others triangular. All of them were turned towards the east, and stood lower than the statues of the gods; and were generally adorned with sculpture, representing either the gods to whom they were erected, or their symbols. See the PAGAN ALTARS represented on Plate XVII. Upon the sides of fig. 1, a trident and two dolphins are exhibited, which denote it to have been dedicated to Neptune. Fig. 2, a four-square altar, was dedicated to the Nymphs, as the inscription imports. Fig. 3, exhibits a Bacchanal holding a thyrsus in his hand, a mark of the altar's being built to Bacchus: it had two other sides, which made it appear triangular. Of fig. 4, which was also triangular, each face or side exhibited a genius, one of whom (on the side represented) carries an ear upon his neck, which seems to denote it an altar of Neptune. Fig. 5, an altar of a round shape, is inscribed Ara Neptuni: the god himself is there represented, all naked, having the pallium upon his shoulder; and holding in his left hand a trident, and in his right a dolphin.\n\nThe height of altars also differed according to the different gods to whom they sacrificed. According to Servius, those altars set apart for the honour of the celestial gods, and gods of the higher clasps, were placed on some pretty tall pile of building; and for that reason were called altaria, from the words alia and ara, \"a high elevated altar.\" Those appointed for the terrestrial gods were laid on the surface of the earth, and called arae. And, on the contrary, they dug into the earth and opened a pit for those of the infernal gods, which they called \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2. But this distinction is not everywhere observed: the best authors frequently use ara as a general word, under which are included the altars of the celestial and infernal, as well as those of the terrestrial gods. Witness Virgil, Eccl. 5.\n\nEn quatuor aras,\n\nwhere arae plainly includes altaria; for whatever we make of Daphnis, Phoebus was certainly a celestial god. So Cicero, pro Quint. Aras delubraque Hecate in Graecia vidimus. The Greeks also distinguished two sorts of altars; that whereon they sacrificed to the gods was called \u03b2\u03c9\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, and was a real altar, different from the other whereon they sacrificed to the heroes, which was smaller, and called \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1. Pollux makes this distinction of altars in his Onomasticum; he adds, however, that some poets used the word \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 for the altar whereon sacrifice was offered to the gods. The Septuagint version does sometimes also use the word \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 for a sort of little low altar, which may be expressed in Latin by craticula; being a hearth rather than an altar.\n\nBefore temples were in use, altars were erected sometimes in groves, sometimes in the highways, and sometimes on the tops of mountains; and it was a custom to engrave upon them the name, ensign, or character of the deity to whom they were consecrated.\n\nIn the great temples of ancient Rome there were ordinarily three altars: The first was placed in the sanctuary, at the foot of the statue of the divinity, upon which incense was burnt and libations offered; the second was before the gate of the temple, and upon it they sacrificed the victims; and the third was a portable altar, upon which were placed the offering and the sacred vessels.\n\nBesides\nBesides these uses of altars, the ancients swore upon them, and swore by them, in making alliances, confirming treaties of peace, and other solemn occasions. Altars also served as places of refuge to all those who fled to them, whatever crime they had committed.\n\nAltars are doubtless as ancient as sacrifices themselves; consequently their origin is not much later than that of the world, Gen. ch. iv. Some attribute their origin to the Egyptians; others to the Jews; others to the patriarchs before the flood. Some carry them as far back as Adam, whose altar is much spoken of by Jewish, and even Christian writers. Others are contented to make the patriarch Enoch the first who consecrated a public altar. Be this as it will, the earliest altars we find any express testimony of are those erected by Abraham.\n\nAltars, in the patriarchal times, were very rude. The altar which Jacob set up at Bethel was nothing but a stone, which served him instead of a bolster; that of Gideon, a stone before his house; and the first which God commanded Moses to erect was probably of earth or unpolished stones, without any iron; for if any use was made of that metal, the altar was declared impure. The principal altars of the Jews were, The altar of incense; that of burnt-offering; and the altar, or table, for the shew-bread.\n\nThe altar of incense was a small table of shittim wood, covered with plates of gold, of one cubit in length, another in width, and two in height. At the four corners were four kinds of horns, and all round a little border or crown over it. This was the altar hidden by Jeremiah before the captivity; and upon it the officiating priest offered, every morning and evening, incense of a particular composition. See Plate XVII.\n\nThe altar of burnt-offerings was made of shittim wood, and carried upon the shoulders of the priests by slaves of the same wood overlaid with bras. In the time of Moses, this altar was five cubits square and three high; but in Solomon's temple it was much larger, being twenty cubits square and ten in height. It was covered with bras; and at each corner was a horn or spire, wrought out of the same wood with the altar, to which the sacrifices were tied. Within the hollow was a grate of bras, on which the fire was made; through it fell the ashes, which were received in a pan below. At the four corners of the grate were four rings and four chains, which kept it up at the horns. This altar was placed in the open air, that the smoke of the burnt-offerings might not fully the inside of the tabernacle. See Plate XVII.\n\nThe altar or table for the shew-bread was likewise of shittim wood, covered with plates of gold, having a little border round it, adorned with sculpture. It was two cubits long, one wide, and one and a half in height. Upon this table, which stood in the holy of holies, were put, every Sabbath day, twelve loaves, with salt and incense.\n\nThe Jewish altars, after their return from the captivity, and the building of the second temple, were in some respects different from those described above. That of burnt offerings was a large pile, built of unhewn stone, thirty cubits square at the bottom, and twenty-four square at the top. The ascent was by a gentle rising, thirty-two cubits in length, and sixteen in breadth.\n\nAltar, is also used among Christians for the communion-table.\n\nIn the primitive church, the altars were only of wood; as being frequently to be removed from place to place. But the council of Paris, in 509, decreed that no altar should be built but of stone. At first there was but one altar in each church; but the number soon increased; and from the writings of Gregory the Great, who lived in the fifth century, we learn, that there were sometimes in the same church twelve or thirteen. In the cathedral of Magdeburg there are no less than forty-nine altars.\n\nThe altar is sometimes sustained on a single column, as in the subterranean chapels of St Cecilia, at Rome, &c.; and sometimes by four columns, as the altar of St Sebastian of Crypta Arenaria; but the customary form is, to be a massive of stone work, sustaining the altar table. These altars bear a resemblance to tombs; to this purpose, we read in church-history, that the primitive Christians chiefly held their meetings at the tombs of the martyrs, and celebrated the mysteries of religion upon them: for which reason, it is a standing rule to this day in the church of Rome, never to build an altar, without including the relics of some saint in it.","sp":374,"ep":377},{"h":"ALTAR-THANE","t":"or ALTARIST, in old Law-books, an appellation given to the priest or parson of a parish, to whom the altarage belonged.

His father was minister of the church of Embden, and early destined his son to the same profession. In the year 1602, after a grammatical course he was sent to the university of Herborn: there he studied with so much assiduity and success, that he soon had the honour of being a preceptor. Qualified by the vigorous exertions of his talents, he was appointed tutor to the three young counts of Nassau, Solms, and Hessenberg, who studied with the elector prince palatine, first at Sedan, and afterwards at Heidelberg. A proper discharge of the duties of a lower station generally paves the way for a higher. For he was appointed preceptor to the prince in 1608: and in consequence of his assiduity and success, he was chosen to accompany the elector into England. Among the number of celebrated men to whose acquaintance he was introduced in England, was the famous Dr Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury. In 1613, Alting returning to Heidelberg after the marriage of the elector with the princess of England, received his degree of doctor of divinity, and was appointed director of the college of Wisdom. The increased knowledge and invigorated talents of Alting, were always receiving renewed opportunities of exertion; thus his eloquence\nquence and learning obtained full scope in the synod of Dort, to which he had been deputed by the Palatinate, along with two other divines.\n\nIt was but reasonable for Alting to expect high prettiment and high advantages from the avowed patronage of the elector; but in this he was greatly disappointed, and he had only to participate in his misfortunes. In 1622, Count Tilly took the city of Heidelberg, and devoted it to plunder. In order to escape the fury of the soldiers, Alting endeavoured to pass by a back door into the chancellor's house, which was put under a strong guard; but the officer who guarded the house, as he was entering said to him, \"With this battle-axe I have today killed ten men, and Alting, if I knew where to find him, should be the eleventh: who are you?\" Alting with a singular presence of mind returned an evasive answer, which saved his life. \"I am (said he) a teacher in the college of Wismar.\" The officer took him under his protection, but the Jesuits unfortunately taking possession of the house, the next day, left the generous officer no time at his departure to take care of the teacher of the college of Wismar. Alting evaded the hands of the Jesuits, by hiding himself in a garret, and a cook of the electoral court supplied him with food, who happened to be employed by Count Tilly in the kitchen occupied by him in the chancellor's house. In this perilous situation he remained until an opportunity offered of making his escape to Heilbronn, whither his family had been conducted before.\n\nBut ecclesiastical intolerance harassed Alting, as much as he was formerly endangered by military hostility. With the permission of the duke of Wirtemberg he retired for a few months to Schorndorf after the defection of the Palatinate by the victorious forces of Count Tilly. It was reasonable to expect that a welcome and hospitable reception might have been given, among Protestants, to one who had just escaped the flames of a Popish war. But the doctrine of mutual forbearance and candour seems to have been little attended to by the Protestants at this period, whatever was their progress in the knowledge of the other doctrines of Christianity. The palatinate being in the vicinity of the duchy of Wirtemberg, the professors of Tubingen and Heidelberg frequently attacked each other in polemic writings and theological disputations. The natural consequence was, that a settled jealousy and enmity existed between the two schools and their respective vicinities. The injuries which Alting had suffered from the common enemy were not sufficient to secure him a friendly reception among the Lutheran ministers of Schorndorf, who were involved in these feuds, and therefore murmured at the permission which the duke had given to a professor of Heidelberg to reside there. The mischievous effects of religious divisions have been universally felt.\n\nIn 1623, Alting retired with his family to Embrden, and afterwards followed to the Hague his late pupil, now king of Bohemia. Such was the unfeigned attachment of his master to him, that he still retained him as a preceptor to his eldest son; and prevented him from accepting the charge of the church at Embrden, and likewise of a professorship at the university of Franeker. In 1627 his importance prevailed upon his patron, and he obtained leave to remove to Groningen, and there ascended the divinity chair; and continued to lecture with increasing reputation until the day of his death. The ardent desire and repeated endeavours of several universities to appropriate to themselves the honour and benefit of his services, is the most unequivocal proof of the general esteem in which his character was held. The states of Groningen positively refused to give their consent to his removal, when the university of Leyden solicited him to come and labour among them. But some time after, the prospect of extensive usefulness in re-establishing the university of Heidelberg, and restoring the churches of the Palatinate, determined him to accept the office of professor of divinity and ecclesiastical senator, presented to him by Prince Lewis Philip. In the year 1634, amidst numerous hardships, to which the existing war exposed him, he set out for Heidelberg, and pursued his journey as far as Frankfort; when the battle of N\u00f6rdlingen, in which the imperialists were victorious, rendered his farther progress impracticable, and therefore with great difficulty he returned to Groningen.\n\nDomestic affection and personal sufferings embittered the remaining years of this excellent man's life. Deprived of his eldest daughter by death, such was his great affection for her that it brought on a settled melancholy, attended with a bodily disease which was with great difficulty removed; but after an interval of four years a settled and irrecoverable melancholy seized him, in consequence of the loss of an amiable and beloved wife, which, together with the return of his bodily disease, in a few months put a period to his useful life in the year 1644.\n\nAlting was a man of eminent talents and extensive learning, possessed of amiable dispositions, which induced him to be more solicitous to serve the public than to benefit himself. The amiable character and extensive learning of Alting, cannot fail deeply to interest every reader, in consequence of his misfortunes. He was adverse to quarrels and disputes about trifles, although no friend to the innovations introduced at this period by the Socinians. According to his own judgment, adhering to the plain doctrine of Scripture, he was equally desirous to avoid fanatical scrupulosity and sophistical subtlety. The productions of his pen are: *Notes in Decadum Problematum, Johannis Beom, Heidelbergae, 1618*; *Notes on a Decad of Jacob Behmen's Problems.* Loci Communes; *Common places.* Problema; *Problems.* Explicatio Catachese Palaatinat.; *Explanation of the Palatine Catechism.* Exegetis Augustana Confessionis, &c., Amst. 1647; *Commentary on the Augsburg Confession.* Methodus Theologiae Didactica et Catachetica, Amst. 1650; *A method of Didactic and Catechetical Theology.* The Medulla Historiae Prophezea, *Marrow of Profane History,* published under the name of Pareus, was written by Alting. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlting, James, son of Henry Alting, was born at Heidelberg in 1618. After the usual course of grammatical studies he became a student, and soon after professor of divinity in the university of Groningen. The Oriental languages were his favourite studies at an early period of his life; and in 1638 he put himself under the tuition of a Jewish rabbi at Embrden. Determining to take up his residence in England, he arrived there in 1640, and was admitted to clerical orders by Doctor Prideaux bishop of Worcester. By\nAltig, an offer of the Hebrew professorship in the university of Groningen, he was soon induced to alter his plan of life, and consequently again returned to Germany in 1643. His active affability in these languages, and his knowledge in other sciences, procured him universal esteem, and great reputation as a scholar. About this time he received many academic honours; he was admitted doctor of philosophy, academic preacher, and at last, in conjunction with a colleague, Samuel des Marets, was chosen professor of divinity. These professors followed different methods of teaching, and adopted different systems. Des Marets was an admirer and follower of the subtleties of the scholastics; and by the ingenuity with which he purified the scholastic plan of instruction had acquired great reputation and considerable influence. Altig spent his time in the study of the Scriptures, and in the pursuit of Rabbinical learning; and he delivered a course of lectures on divinity, which gained him great popularity. As it might naturally be expected, a mutual jealousy arose between the two professors; and their respective partisans in the university carried their animosity to an undue height. Established opinion, and the weight of authority, marshalled on the side of Des Marets. By the permission of the curators of the university he appeared as public accuser of Altig, and produced a long list of erroneous propositions to the divines of Leyden for their opinion. The judgment of the divines upon the dilute shows a great degree of moderation and good sense: they pronounced Altig innocent of heresy, but imprudently fond of innovation; and they declared Des Marets deficient in modesty and candour. If the superiors had not prohibited the farther discussion of these subjects in the confectories, classes, and synods, they would have occasioned as much mischief as they had excited general attention. Such was the protection given to Altig, that whenever any of the order of ecclesiastics proposed any further measures against him, they were immediately rejected by the civil power; nay, the penalty of deprivation was decreed against those clergy who should revive the Marso-Altigian controversy. Whatever might be the advantages resulting to Altig from this protection, the magistrates certainly did wrong in proceeding so far in prohibiting a free discussion from the prelfs, either for or against the judgments of the divines of Leyden. Although a kind of reconciliation was attempted by their common friends while Des Marets lay upon his death-bed, yet the breach between Des Marets and Altig was never perfectly healed. Dr Altig died of a fever in 1679. The fondness which he showed for Rabbinical learning gave birth to the general report, that he was inclined to become a Jew. His opinions which seem to have excited more general attention than they deserve, may be seen at large in his writings, which were collected a few years after his death, and published in five volumes folio by his cousin Menlo Altig, who wrote a good description of the Low Countries, under the title of Notitia Germaniae Inferioris. (Gen. Biog.)\n\n**Altitude**, accessible and inaccessible. See Geometry.\n\nThe method of taking considerable terrestrial altitudes, of which those of mountains are the greatest, by means of the barometer, is very easy and expeditious.

If it be taken from the rational or real horizon, the altitude is said to be true or real; if from the apparent or sensible horizon, the altitude is apparent. Or rather, the apparent altitude is such as it appears to our observation; and the true is that from which the refraction has been subtracted.\n\nThe true altitudes of the sun, fixed stars, and planets, differ but very little from their apparent altitudes; because of their great distance from the centre of the earth, and the smallness of the earth's semidiameter, when compared thereto. But the difference between the true and apparent altitude of the moon is about 52. This subject is further explained under Astronomy.\n\n**Altitude Instrument**, or Equal Altitude Instrument, is that used to observe a celestial object when it has the same altitude on the east and west sides of the meridian.

This native alum is mixed with heterogeneous matters, or effloresces in various forms upon the ores during calcination. It rarely occurs in a crystallized state, though thus it is said to be met with in Egypt, Sardinia, Spain, Bohemia, and other places. It is also found in waters impregnated with fixed air, but very seldom in fountains or hot medicated waters.\n\nThere are several kinds of alum to be met with; but these differ from one another only in being mixed with some salts which are not of the aluminous kinds. That called the Roman alum has been considered as preferable to any other. This is usually met with in small crystals, and has a reddish colour, most probably owing to a small quantity of calx of iron, which, however, does not in the least impair its qualities. The other kinds of alum contain a portion either of vitriolated tartar or sal ammoniac, according to the nature of the alkali used in its preparation. Mr Bergman informs us, that the vegetable alkali, if pure, does not hurt the alum, though it be added in the preparation; but that the volatile alkali, by adulterating it with a portion of vitriolic sal ammoniac, renders it unfit for some purposes. The alum, made by adding a portion of clay to the liquor at the beginning of the boiling, he considers as equal, if not superior, to Roman alum. He informs us also, that a kind of alum some time ago began to be manufactured at Brunswick, which was equal in quality to the Roman alum. On a chemical analysis of this alum he found it mixed with cobalt.\n\nThis salt is extremely useful in the art of dyeing; as by means of it a great number of colours are fixed and rendered permanent upon cloth, which otherwise would either not adhere in any degree, or only for a very short time. In what manner this is accomplished, we are very much ignorant; the conjectures and theories on this subject are related under the article Dying. It constitutes the basis of crayons, which generally consist of the earth of alum finely powdered and tinged for the purpose. In the preparation of Prussian blue, it prevents the basis of martial vitriol, which is soluble in acids, from being precipitated by the superfluous alkali employed in the preparation of that pigment; that is, the alkali which is not saturated by the colouring matter. As this basis adheres more strongly than the clay to the vitriolic acid, and would form a green by the mixture of its yellowness, the white earth of alum likewise according to its quantity, dilutes the darker colours, even black itself, and produces an infinite number of shades. It is also of use in the making of candles: for being mixed with the tallow, it gives it a hardness and consistence which it has not naturally. Wood sufficiently soaked in a solution of alum does not easily take fire; and the same is true of paper impregnated with it; which, for that reason, is very properly employed in preserving gunpowder, as it also excludes the moisture of the air. Paper impregnated with alum is useful in whitening silver, and silvering brass without heat. Alum is also of use in tanning, where it assists in restoring the cohesion of the skins almost entirely destroyed by the lime. Vintners fine down their wines, &c., with alum; fishers use it to dry cod fish with; and bakers have mixed it with the flour to make their bread compact and white: to this last use of it great objections have been made; but unjustly, for it is entirely innocent. It is now seldom used.\n\nIn medicine it is of considerable use as an astringent and tonic. It is reckoned particularly serviceable for restraining hemorrhages, and immoderate secretions from the blood; but less proper in intestinal fluxes. In violent hemorrhages, it may be given in doses of 15 or 20 grains, and repeated every hour or half hour till the bleeding abates: in other cases, smaller doses are more advisable; large ones being apt to nauseate the stomach, and occasion violent constrictions of the bowels. It is used also externally, in astringent and repellent lotions and collyria. Burnt alum taken internally has been highly extolled in cases of colic. In such instances, when taken to the extent of a scruple for a dose, it has been said gently to move the belly, and give very great relief from the severe pain. Its officinal preparations are, for internal use, pulvis stypticus, and aqua styptica; for external applications, the aqua aluminis, and coagulum aluminis et alumen stypticum; which last is no other than the alum dried by fire, or freed from the watery moisture, which, like other salts, it always retains in its crystalline form. By this loss of its water it becomes sharper, so as to act as a slight escharotic; and it is chiefly with this intention that it is employed in medicine, being very rarely taken internally. For these preparations, see Pharmacy.\n\nAlum Mines are said to have been first found in Italy in the year 1460; and in 1506 King Henry VII. made a monopolizing grant of this commodity to Augustine Chigi, a merchant of Sienna. In the year 1608, the manufacture of alum was first invented, and successively practised in England, meeting with great encouragement in Yorkshire, where it was first made, from Lord Sheffield, and the other gentlemen of that county. King James I. by advice of his ministry, assumed the monopoly of it to himself, and therefore prohibited the importation of foreign alum; and in 1625 the importation of it was further prohibited by the proclamation of Charles I.\n\nAlum Works, places where alum is prepared, and manufactured in quantities for sale. They differ from\nAlypius, one of the seven Greek writers on music, which Meibomius has industriously collected and published, with a commentary and explanatory notes. The time in which he flourished cannot be precisely determined. He is said to have wrote before Euclid and Ptolemy; and Caffiodorus arranges his work, entitled \"Introduction to Music,\" between that of Nicomachus and Gaudensius. In this work is to be found the most complete nomenclature of all the sounds of the different scales and modes of the ancient Greek music, which have escaped the wreck of time. So complex was the science of music in Greece at this period, that the characters used for sounds were 1620 in number. The twenty-four letters of the alphabet furnished these notes, sometimes in an entire, sometimes in a mutilated, and sometimes in an altered form; and numerous discriminations of these took place by means of the accents and varied positions of letters.\n\nFrom the MS. of Joseph Scaliger, Meursius first published this tract in 1616; but according to the testimony of Fabricius, it is by no means correct. Extracts have been published from Alypius, by Kircher, in his Musurgia, 1650, alleging that he translated the whole into Latin; but this table of ancient musical notation is so inaccurate, which he has inferred from him, that Meibomius, who consulted not only the Greek MS. of Scaliger, but that of Belejanus, Barocci, Barberitti, and Selden, affirms, that he found in it more than 200 errors. The learned Meibomius, with incredible industry, deciphered those characters, which previous to his time were so much confounded, disfigured, and corrupted, either through the ignorance or inattention of the transcribers of ancient MSS. This advantage resulted to the science of music, chiefly by his commentaries on Greek musicians, and particularly on the works of Alypius.\n\nAlypius of Tagaste, a Christian divine who flourished in the fourth century. In the year 388, he was baptized along with Augustine, and, in consequence of a similarity of dispositions and religious sentiments, they became strongly attached to each other. In quest of information and improvement, he took a journey into Palestine; and returning home, he soon acquired such general esteem, that he was appointed bishop of his native city. He had adopted in the early part of his life the opinions of the Maniches; but in consequence of farther information and matured experience, he became a powerful advocate for the Catholic faith. The Donatists flourished about this period, and arrogantly claimed the exclusive honour of being the true church; but he, along with his friend Augustine, united his exertions in opposing the tenets of that sect. In the council of Carthage in the year 403, the erudition and talents of Alypius, along with several other eminent divines, were unsuccessfully employed in endeavouring to reclaim them, and to bring them again into the bosom of the church. In 411 Alypius was one of the seven who held a friendly and theological conference with seven of the Donatist bishops. But all the eloquence and strength of argument made use of by these divines, although seconded by the penal decrees of the emperor Honorius, were unsuccessful in producing a recantation of their errors, or a peaceful union with their brethren. In support of the Catholic faith, Alypius appears to have vigorously ex-\nAlyssum ered his talents; and it is much to be regretted that the means he employed for that purpose were not at all times the most honourable; for in the violence of his zeal he went as deputy from the churches of Africa to the emperor Honorius, in order to obtain severe decrees against the sect of the Pelagians. Although Alypius failed in his attempt to reclaim the Donatists from error, yet he was successful with the emperor in obtaining penal decrees against the Pelagians; in consequence of which their ministers were banished, their churches demolished, and their assemblies discontinued. Alypius died about the year 432, and his dispositions appear to have participated more of the violence of zeal, than of the meekness of charity. (Gen.

His grandfather, Frederick de Toledo, was his preceptor in the military and political arts, and he displayed his valour at the battle of Pavia and at the siege of Tunis. The ambitious Charles V. selected Alva as a proper instrument for conducting his military enterprises, and he made him his general in 1538; and, after several operations, in which he both displayed his valour and military knowledge, in 1542 he successfully defended Perpignan against the dauphin of France.\n\nIn 1546, Alva was made general in chief of the army which marched against the German Protestants, who were marshalled under the banners of the elector of Saxony. Francis, the king of France, died at Rambouillet, and by his death a considerable change was made in the state of Europe. Instantly, therefore, Charles began his march from Egra on the borders of Bohemia, and entered the southern frontier of Saxony, and attacked Altorf upon the Elster. Incessantly pushing forward, he arrived the evening of the 23rd of April on the banks of the Elbe, opposite to M\u00fchlberg. The river, at that place, was three hundred paces in breadth, about four feet in depth; its current rapid; and the bank possessed by the Saxons was higher than that which he occupied. In opposition to the opinion of the duke of Alva and his other officers, Charles, with undaunted courage, and with inexplicable difficulties, led his army through the river, and engaged the Saxons. The elector displayed great personal courage and military knowledge, but having received a wound in the face, he at last surrendered himself prisoner. When he approached the emperor, he said, \"The fortune of war has made me your prisoner, most gracious emperor, and I hope to be treated.\"\n\nHere Charles hardly interrupted him, \"And am I then at last acknowledged to be emperor? Charles of Ghent was the only title you lately allowed me. You shall be treated as you deserve.\" The elector made no reply; but, with an unaltered countenance, which discovered neither astonishment nor dejection, accompanied the Spanish soldiers appointed to guard him. The emperor proceeded towards Wittemberg, whither the remains of the Saxon army had fled, carrying along with him the captive prince, as a spectacle of consternation and amazement to his own subjects. But when he approached the town, he found it defended by the vigorous efforts of the elector's wife, along with the inhabitants. He summoned Sibylla once and a second time to open the gates, informing her, that if she persisted in her obstinacy, the elector should answer for it with his head. Accordingly he brought his prisoner to an immediate trial. The proceedings against him were as irregular as the stratagem was barbarous. Instead of consulting the states of the empire, or remitting the cause to any court, which, according to the German constitution, might have legally taken cognizance of the elector's crime, he subjected the greatest prince in the empire to the jurisdiction of a court martial. The emperor selected the unrelenting duke of Alva as a proper instrument to carry into effect any measure of violence and oppression, and therefore made him president of that court, composed of Spanish and Italian officers. Moved more by the entreaties of his wife than by a sense of his own danger, the elector submitted to all the rigorous and unjust measures that were proposed in order to save his life; but when it was added, that he should also renounce the Protestant faith and become a Roman Catholic, he refused to act in opposition to his conscience, and bravely fell a sacrifice to the cause of truth.\n\nIn 1552, Alva was intrusted with the command of the army intended to invade France, and was constrained by the opinion and authority of the emperor to lay siege to Mentz, in opposition to his own military knowledge; but notwithstanding all his valour and abilities, the duke of Guise successfully defended the place. In consequence of the success of the French arms in Piedmont, he was made commander in chief of all the emperor's forces in Italy, and at the same time invested with unlimited power. Success did not, however, attend his first attempts, and after several unfortunate attacks, he was obliged to retire into winter quarters. The next year he was sent into the pope's territories, and, had he not been restrained by his master, he would have taken possession of all his fortified places, and deterred Henry from entering into any new connexion with him, and have thereby prevented the renewal of the war. Philip was strongly inclined to peace, but Alva was inclined to severe measures: he however yielded to the instructions of his master, until being deluded, and sometimes haughtily answered, he at length sent Pino de Loffredo with a letter to the college of cardinals, and another to Paul, in which, after enumerating the various injuries which his master had received, and renewing his former offers of peace and friendship, he concluded with protesting that, if his offers were again rejected, the pope should be chargeable with all the calamities that might follow. The pope threw Loffredo into prison; and, had not the college of cardinals interfered, he would have even put him to death; and on account of Philip's failing to pay tribute for Naples, he deprived him of the sovereignty of that kingdom. This violent conduct of Paul gave great offence throughout all Europe, and greatly lessened his influence in Italy; but Philip, though a young, ambitious, powerful monarch, and of a temper of mind impatient of injuries and affronts, moved\nmoved with a religious veneration, discovered an amazing reluctance against proceeding to extremities. After much time spent in negotiation, Philip was at last forced to give orders for Alva to take the field. He cheerfully obeyed, and began his march in the beginning of September 1556, with a well disciplined army, which reducing several towns in the Campagna di Roma, he pursued his conquests to the very gates of Rome. The circumstances, however, in which Alva found his army, induced him to make a truce of 40 days, and, after several negotiations, he yielded to peace. One of its terms was, that the duke of Alva should in person ask forgiveness of the haughty pontiff whom he had conquered. Proud as the duke was by nature, and accustomed to treat with persons of the highest dignity, yet such was the superstitious veneration then entertained for the papal character, that he confessed his voice failed him at the interview, and his presence of mind forbore him. Not long after this, he was sent at the head of a splendid embassy to Paris, to espouse, in the name of his master, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry king of France.\n\nPhilip II., his new master, being strongly devoted to the Roman see, and determined to reclaim rebels to his government, and dissenters from his faith, by the most unrelenting severity and unbounded cruelty, he pitched upon Alva as the fittest person to carry this system into practice; with this design, therefore, he was sent into the Low Countries in 1567. Having received his orders, armed with such power as left only the shadow of authority to the natural governor, and provided with 10,000 veterans, he marched towards that devoted country. When he arrived, he soon shewed how much he merited the confidence which his matter repose in him, and instantly erected a bloody tribunal, to try all persons who had been engaged in the late commotions which the civil and the religious tyranny of Philip had excited. The depraved enormities of the mind of Alva raged with unexampled violence. He imprisoned the counts Egmont and Horn, the two popular leaders of the Protestants, and soon brought them to an unjust trial, and condemned them to death. In a little time he totally annihilated every privilege of the people, and with uncontrolled fury and cruelty, put multitudes of them to death. Beholding herself deprived of all authority, and her subjects devoted to destruction, the duchess of Parma resigned her office, disdaining to hold the nominal, while the actual reins of power were in the hands of Alva. This event increased the general tide of wretchedness, and every place was filled with scenes of horror and dismay. Unable for the present to administer the least aid, the prince of Orange saved his life by flight. This noble prince suddenly collected an army in Germany, and returned to the relief of his countrymen; and at the same time Prince Lewis, his brother, marched with an army into Friesland. Although success at first attended Lewis, yet the activity and experience of Alva prevailed, and he was totally defeated. The prince of Orange proved a more formidable foe; and it gave exertion to the united talents of Alva, and his son Frederick of Toledo, to prevent the prince from making a descent upon the Netherlands. But notwithstanding all the address and military skill of the prince of Orange, this was effected; and the glory remained to Alva to baffle that great leader, and to compel him, after great loss of men, to disband the remainder of his army. Now the cruelty of Alva had unrestrained vent. Instantly the executioner was employed in removing all those friends of freedom whom the sword had spared. Uncontrolled, the base and unrelenting heart of Alva began to reduce all the provinces to utter slavery, and to extirpate Protestantism in that country. In most of the considerable towns, Alva built citadels. He erected a statue of himself, which was no less a monument of his vanity than his tyranny, in the city of Antwerp: he was figured trampling on the necks of two smaller statues, representing the two estates of the Low Countries. By his unusual and arbitrary requisition of new supplies from the states, he greatly aggravated this haughty insult. The human mind displays unusual vigour when rendered desperate by oppression. The exiles from the Low Countries, roused to action, fitted out a kind of piratical fleet, and, after strengthening themselves by successful depredations, ventured upon the bold exploit of seizing the town of Brielle. Thus, unattended by him, the cruelty of Alva was the instrument of the future independence of the seven Dutch provinces. The fleet of the exiles having met the Spanish fleet, totally defeated it, and reduced North Holland and Mons; and numbers of cities hastened to throw off the yoke; while the states-general assembling at Dordrecht, openly declared against Alva's government, and marshalled under the banners of the prince of Orange. This situation of affairs opened the eyes of Alva to behold the instability of a power founded on terror and oppression; he therefore began in vain to use more lenient measures. He prepared, however, with vigour to oppose the gathering storm, and afterwards recovered Mons, Mechlin, and Zutphen, under the conduct of his son Frederick, where his soldiers more than retaliated upon the prince of Orange. With the exception of Zealand and Holland, he regained all the provinces; and at last his son stormed Woerden, and, massacring its inhabitants with the most savage cruelty, he then proceeded to invest the city of Haarlem. Fully convinced of the miseries that waited their surrender, this city stood an obstinate siege; and nothing less than the inflexible and persevering spirit of Alva could have opposed difficulties almost insurmountable. Dispairing of success, Frederick was at one time disposed to raise the siege, but the stern reproaches of his father urged him on; and at length the inhabitants, overcome with fatigue and resistance, surrendered. The victorious Frederick gave tolerable conditions to the town; but his cruel father arriving on the third day after the surrender, sacrificed numerous victims, who had been led to expect mercy, and satiated his vengeance to the full. Their next attack was upon Alkmaar; but the spirit of desperate resistance was raised to such a height in the breasts of the Hollanders, that the Spanish veterans were repulsed with great loss, and Frederick constrained reluctantly to retire. Alva now resolved to try his fortune by sea, and with great labour and expense fitted out a powerful fleet, and proceeded to attack the Zeelanders, but was entirely defeated, and the commander taken prisoner. About the same period, the prince of Orange proceeded to attack the town of Gertruydenburg. Alva's feeble state\nstate of health and continued disasters induced him to solicit his recall from the government of the Low Countries; a measure which, in all probability, was not displeasing to Philip, who was now resolved to make trial of a milder administration. In December 1573, that devoted country was freed from the presence and oppressions of the duke of Alva, who, accompanied by his son, returning home, gave out the inglorious boast, that he had, during the course of six years, besides the multitudes destroyed in battle and massacred after victory, configned 18,000 persons to the executioner. Requiem, who succeeded him in the command, in his first act of administration, pulled down his insolent effigies at Antwerp, so that nothing might remain of him in that much injured country but the remembrance of his injustice and cruelty.\n\nReturning from this scene of oppression and blood, he was treated for some time with great distinction by his master. Justice, however, soon overtook the crimes of Alva: for his son having debauched one of the king's attendants, under promise of marriage, he was committed to prison; and being aided in his escape by his father, and married by him to a cousin of his own, this procured Alva's banishment from court, and confinement in the castle of Uzeda. He remained two years in this disgraceful situation, until the success of Don Antonio, in assuring the crown of Portugal, determined Philip to turn his eyes towards a person, in whose fidelity and abilities he could on this occasion most confide. A secretary was instantly despatched to Alva, to make inquiries concerning the state of his health, and whether or not it was sufficiently vigorous to undertake the command of an army. The aged chief returned an answer full of loyal zeal, and was immediately appointed to the supreme command in Portugal. It is a singular fact, however, that the enlargement and elevation of Alva was not followed by forgiveness. It is a characteristic mark of the unrelenting temper of Philip, and, at the same time, a noble testimony to the honour and loyalty of Alva, that although placed in this important trust, he did not procure his pardon. In 1581, Alva entered Portugal, defeated Antonio, drove him from the kingdom, and soon reduced the whole under the subjection of Philip. Entering Lisbon, he seized an immense treasure; and with their accumulated violence and rapacity, he suffered his soldiers to sack the suburbs and vicinity. It is reported, that Alva being requested to give an account of the money expended on that occasion, he sternly replied, \"If the king asks me for an account, I will make him a statement of kingdoms preferred or conquered, of signal victories, of successful sieges, and of sixty years service.\" Philip deemed it proper to make no farther inquiries. Alva, however, did not enjoy the honours and rewards of his last expedition, for in 1582, at the age of 74, he was removed by death to the impartial tribunal of heaven, to receive the just rewards of his iniquitous life.\n\nThe actions already enumerated give such an ample idea of his character, that little more is necessary to complete it. In him a variety of extremes concentrated. Some of the best qualities of a commander were blended with some of the worst that ever existed in a man or in a general. The Spanish severity, little tempered by the spirit of generosity, appeared in all its horrible deformity in Alva. A strict impartial discipline was his greatest military virtue, and vanity was his greatest weakness. In consequence of this strict discipline, he sometimes punished the unlicensed barbarities of his soldiers; and there is an instance recorded, that when his favourite son Frederick, thinking he could attack the prince of Orange with advantage, sent a request to his father for permission, he received a stern reprimand, for presuming to exercise his judgment on a point already determined by his superior, with a threatening in case of repetition.

He was a natural son of Don Alvaro de Luna, lord of Canete in Arragon, and of a woman of infamous character. He was born in 1388, and named Peter; but Pope Benedict XIII., who was charmed with his wit though yet a child, changed Peter to Alvares. He was introduced to court in 1408, and made a gentleman of the bedchamber to King John, with whom he grew into the highest favour. In 1427 he was obliged to retire: the courtiers exerted all their endeavours to ruin him: they complained, that a man of no military skill, of no virtues whatever, should by mere artifice and dissimulation, be advanced to the highest authority; and they could not bear, that by the affluence of a few upstart men, whom he had raised and fixed to his interest, he should reign as absolutely as if he were king.\n\nThey prevailed against him, and Alvares was banished from court a year and a half: but this was the greatest affliction imaginable to the king; who showed all marks of distress the moment he was removed from his presence, and now thought and spoke of nothing but Alvares. He was therefore recalled; and, being invested with his usual authority, revenged himself severely upon his enemies, by persuading the king to banish them. Of the 45 years he spent at court, he enjoyed for 30 of them to entire an ascendancy over the king, that nothing could be done without his express orders: nay, it is related by Mariana, that the king could not change an officer or servant, or even his clothes or diet, without the approbation of Alvares. In short he wanted nothing to complete his grandeur but the name of king: he had all the places in the kingdom at his disposal; he was master of the treasury, and by bounties had so gained the hearts of the subjects, that the king, though his eyes were now opened, and his affections sufficiently turned against him, durst not complain.\n\nBut the day of reckoning was approaching, and at length he was seized; yet not directly, openly, and violently, but with some of that management which upon a similar occasion was formerly employed by Tiberius against Sejanus. During his confinement, he made several\nAlvares, several attempts to speak to the king in person; but not being able to effect this, he sent the following letter, from which, as well as from the rest of Alvarez's history, all court favourites may draw abundant matter for edification and instruction. \"Sir, it is five and forty years since I was admitted into your service. I do not complain of the rewards I have received: they were greater than my merits or expectation, as I shall not deny. There was but one thing wanting to complete my happiness; and that was, to have fixed proper limits in time to this great fortune of mine. While, instead of choosing retirement, after the example of the greatest men, I still continued in the employment, which I thought not only my duty, but necessary for your interest, I fell into this misfortune. It is very hard that I should be deprived of liberty, when I have risked life and fortune more than once to restore it to you. Grief prevents me from laying more. I know that the Deity is provoked against me by my fins; but it will be sufficient for me, if his anger is appeased by the calamities I now suffer. I can no longer bear that prodigious mass of riches, which it was wrong in me to have heaped together. I should willingly resign them, but that every thing I have is in your power; and I am denied the opportunity of showing mankind, that you have raised a person to the height of greatness, who can contain wealth as well as procure it, and give it back to him from whom he received it. But I desire you in the strongest terms, that, as I was obliged, by the laws of the treasury, to raise 10,000 or 12,000 crowns by methods I ought not to have taken, you will restore them to the persons from whom they were extorted. If you will not grant this on account of the services I have done, yet I think it necessary to be done from the reason of the thing.\"\n\nThis letter, however, produced no effect in his favour: Alvares was tried, and condemned to lose his head. After condemnation, he was removed to Valladolid; and having confessed himself, and received the sacrament, he was carried upon a mule to the market-place, in the middle of which a large scaffold was erected. Mounting the scaffold, he paid reverence to the cross, and presently gave his hat and signet to his page, saying, \"These are the last gifts you will ever receive from me.\" He then submitted himself to the axe with the utmost intrepidity.","sp":383,"ep":384},{"h":"ALVAREZ","t":"Francis, a Portuguese priest, and almoner to Emanuel, king of Portugal, flourished about the beginning of the 16th century.

His talents were well calculated for the conduct of military affairs, and in an early part of his life, raised him to great reputation. In the year 1508, he gained such signal victories over the emperor Maximilian, that he was decreed triumphal honours by the republic. During the famous league of Venice, he was second in command along with Count Pritigliano. It was, however, unfavourable to the cause in which they had engaged, that the tempers of the two commanders were very different. The commander in chief was hesitating and cautious; the other was bold and intrepid. Alviano commanded the rear-guard at the famous battle of Aignadel, and after displaying the greatest exertions of valour, was wounded, overpowered, and at last taken prisoner. An increasing tribute was paid to the military talents of Alviano; for after the Venetians had become the allies of France, he was intrusted with the command of their army. When the emperor attacked Padua, he defended it against him, and displayed numerous acts of valour in repelling the imperial troops. But the current of human life runs unequally smooth on its attendance upon any character; for he lost the great battle of La Motte, in which, however, his exertions were so conspicuous, that the senate gave him the most honourable assurance of the continuance of their esteem. Fortune, however, soon became propitious to this great man, and he defeated the enemy in Friuli. In the desperate battle of Marignano, he afforded such timely aid to Francis I. that it greatly contributed to his success. But the most vigorous\ngorous constitution must one day yield to the force of constant exertions, and the most incessant fatigue; he had incurred such hardships in superintending the works at the siege of Brescia, that he was seized with a fever, of which he died at the advanced age of sixty. His character stands high in the annals of military fame. By strict observance of discipline, and a profuse liberality to his soldiers, he secured their esteem. As an unequivocal proof of this, they kept his body unburied twenty-five days, carrying it about with them during their marches, with all funeral pomp.

Amadabat was formerly called Guzerat; and by Shah Jehan nicknamed Gheraluddin, or \"the habitation of dust,\" because it was much incommode therewith. It was the seat of the Guzerat kings, as it is now of the Mogul governor. The city stands in a beautiful plain, and is watered by the little river Sabremetti, which, though not deep, in time of rains overflows the plains prodigiously. The walls are built with stone and brick, flanked at certain distances with great round towers and battlements. It has twelve gates; and, including the suburbs, is about four miles and a half long. The streets are wide. The Meydan Shah, or king's square, is 700 paces long, and 400 broad, planted round with trees. On the west side is the castle, well walled with free stone, and as spacious as a little city; but its inward appearance is not conformable to its external magnificence. The caravanserai is on the south of the square, and its chief ornament. Near the Meydan also is the king's palace, whose apartments are richly ornamented; and in the midst of the city is the English factory, where they purchase fine chintz, calicoes, and other Indian merchandise. The place is so full of gardens flooded with fruit trees, that from an eminence it looks like a wood.

The extent of the city is very large; but there are a great many waste spots within it, as well as cultivated land. The houses are built of brick hardened in the sun, and have but a very indifferent aspect. There is but one tolerable street; and that is where stuffs, garments, and the like, are exposed to sale: it is straight, long, and wide; and the shops are very well furnished. The adjacent parts are fruitful in corn and rice, insomuch that the neighbouring provinces are supplied from hence. It is said to enjoy a very salubrious air; but the cold in winter is intense. The Armenians have a church in this town; but it is a very ill contrived structure. The Jews have a synagogue near a tomb, where they pretend Esther and Mordecai lie interred. To this place they come in pilgrimage from several parts of the Levant. About a league from Amadan, there is a mountain called Nalliana, which abounds with all sorts of curious herbs. In the spring, people flock to this mountain from all parts to recover their health, by sucking in the salutary effluvia with their breath.\n\nAmadan is a very ancient city. It is said to have been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, and rebuilt by Darius, who brought hither all his riches. The kings of Persia frequently retired to this place on account of its delightful situation; for which reason it obtained the name of the Royal City. It was conquered by the caliph Othman, and narrowly escaped being destroyed by Jenghiz Khan in 1220. It had then strong walls and a good castle, which are now in ruins.

It was taken by the Moguls in 1508, after a siege of six months; being at that time defended by a strong castle, situated on an eminence, and surrounded with deep ditches, into which several springs discharged their waters.\n\nAMADEUS V., count of Savoy, arose to that dignity in the year 1285. In him it appeared, that mental excellence can rise superior to riches or extent of territory; for although his dominions were by no means extensive, nor his riches great, yet, in consequence of his wisdom and success, he obtained the surname of Great. The cautious prudence of Amadeus, however, enabled him greatly to increase his territory by means of marriage, purchase, and donations. In this situation, with extended dominion, and distinguished for wisdom and prudence, he rose to such eminence among the European powers, that he was constituted their umpire to settle their differences; and in that station acquitted himself with much reputation and general\nBut in his character valour and wisdom were combined; for when the Turks attempted to retake the isle of Rhodes from the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he boldly defended it, and acquired great renown. A Maltese cross with the letters F.E.R.T. in future became the arms of Amadeus and his successors, in memory of this signal victory. The explanation of this motto is said to be Fortitudo ejus Rhodium tenuit.\u2014\"His valour kept Rhodes.\" For this important service the grand master conferred on him the grant of a palace at Lyons. Andronicus the emperor of the east had married his daughter; and in order to promote the views of his son-in-law, Amadeus took a journey to Avignon to persuade Pope John XXII. to preach a crusade in favour of Andronicus. In the year 1323 the famous Amadeus died at that place. Deep penetration, keen discernment, consummate prudence, great valour, together with no small portion of the religious superstition of his time, appear to have been the reigning features in his character. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAmadeus VIII. count of Savoy, in 1391, succeeded his father Amadeus VII. With the large sum of 4,000 florins of gold he purchased the country of Genevois from its last earl. Anxious to extend his territories, he purchased the city of Rumilly, upon the lake of Geneva, from the widow of the count of Genevois, and thus the house of Savoy became so illustrious that the emperor Sigismund erected Savoy into a duchy in the year 1426. Historians relate, that he assisted John Paleologus against the duke of Milan, who endeavoured to wrest from him the duchy of Montferrat. Deeply sensible of the services which he had received, Paleologus not only resigned to the duke, Chivas, Brandis, and several other estates, but submitted to hold all the marquisate of Montferrat as a fief from the house of Savoy. These fortunate acquisitions of territory were not yet limited; for upon the marriage of his daughter with Philip Maria, duke of Milan, he received Vercelli, and about the same time the count of Crefcentino submitted to become his feudatory. In his ambitious pursuit, he laid claim to the sovereignty of the city of Geneva; but that claim, though enforced by the pope, was rejected by the citizens with disdain, and the emperor Sigismund taking it under his protection, declared it an imperial city. After such an extensive acquisition of dominion, and amassing such sums of money, he formed the singular scheme of abandoning his throne and family; and for that purpose retired to a religious house at a place called Ripaille. But although he resigned the dukedom of Savoy to his eldest son Lewis, and made his youngest son Philip, count of Genevois; yet their honours were merely nominal, for he constrained them to live on a very scanty allowance, while he in his retirement received all the revenues, and collected such sums of money that he is said to have purchased the papal honours. During the previous part of his life having adopted great sanctity of manners, the motives for his retirement were generally reckoned religious; but what was the astonishment of mankind to behold the seat of his hermitage become the habitation of every rare delicacy, and of the most refined luxury. The local situation of the place was truly delightful, and was enriched with every thing that could afford gratification to the senses; and his residence confirmed some of his most intimate friends, along with 20 faithful servants, who were the guardians of his voluptuous secrets. Neither did he assume a religious habit, but wore purple robes, and upon his mantle was embroidered a golden cross. His table groaned under the weight of luxurious dainties, and the most excellent music cheered the daily feast; in short, such was the voluptuousness of that place, that in the French language the phrase, faire ripaille, signifies to make exquisite good cheer.\n\nHe instituted a secular knighthood in that place under the appellation of St Maurice. The brethren assumed the name of hermits, wore beards, and excluded women from their community; and in other respects composed the character of decent epicures.\n\nWhen he obtained the papal dignity, and was crowned by the cardinal of Arles at Basil, all Europe was filled with astonishment in consequence of his elevation; for he had never entered into holy orders. But he had found means to remove every objection, the council confirmed his election, and with pretended reluctance he put on the pontifical ornaments, and was consecrated in the church of St Maurice. It seemed good to Amadeus to assume the title of Felix V. As might naturally be expected in such circumstances, the papal dignity was severely contested between him and Eugenius; and notwithstanding all the importunities of the council, the emperor refused to acknowledge his elevation. This religious dispute involved all Europe in contention. Historians relate that Germany remained neutral, and France, England, Italy, Spain, and Hungary, declared for Eugenius; but Arragon, Poland, and Bretagne recognized the council only; at the same time that Savoy, Switzerland, Basil, Strasbourg, Pomerania, and one of the duchies of Bavaria, recognized Felix. The emperor Frederick III. held a council at Frankfort, before which both the popes urged their respective rights by means of deputies. This attempt, however, to regain peace to Europe was unsuccessful; therefore the emperor repaired to the vicinity of Basil, and had a personal interview with Felix. The mind of Amadeus was now so confirmed in the enjoyment of pleasure, that he had again returned to his favourite retreat; and after the fathers of the council had frequently solicited him in vain to reside at Basil, he prevailed upon them to remove to Lyons, which was near the seat of his pleasures. During the contest, Eugenius had excommunicated Felix, the council, and several of the German princes, so that the whole church was then filled with confusion and disorder. The death of Eugenius, however, terminated the struggle; for upon his death the cardinals at Rome elected Thomas de Sarzan, who assumed the name of Nicholas V. In this situation of affairs, Amadeus deemed it prudent to enter into a negotiation for the resignation of his papal crown. In this transaction he displayed the profoundest policy and address, which induced Nicholas to annul all that Eugenius had done to his dishonour, or that of his associates; to confirm the determination of the council of Basil to appoint him perpetual apostolical legate in Savoy, Piedmont, and the other places of his own dominions, and even added to these the honour of being bishop of Basil, Lausanne, Strasbourg,\nAmadeus Strasburg, and Constance. Nor did his vanity forsake him even in this political transaction, for he provided that he should continue to wear the pontifical dress unless in very few particulars. In order to gratify the same haughty disposition, he stipulated that he should not be obliged to go to Rome, to attend any general council; and that when he had occasion to approach the pope, he should rise to receive him, and instead of kissing his toe, he should be permitted to kiss his cheek. Amadeus retired to Lausanne, and died there at the age of 60, in the year 1451.\n\nAs the time in which he lived is fertile in memorable events, so the character of Amadeus was one of the most distinguished of his time. The versatility of his genius has led writers to differ in the delineation of his character. Some have represented him as a person of singular sanctity of manners, and possessed of uncommon moderation and virtue; others have represented him as a confirmed bigot, and a violent enthusiast; and a third class of authors have magnified his talents far above the general standard, and extolled him as one of the most accomplished princes in Europe. His real character appears to be a compound of extravagancies, in which virtue, genius, caprice, and vanity were blended. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAMADEUS IX., count of Savoy, succeeded his father Lewis, in his dominion and honours. The prince who exerts his talents to promote the happiness of his subjects, is worthy of more fame than the prince who increases the number of his subjects by unjust and unnecessary wars. In this view Amadeus IX. deserves a place in the annals of his nation. His bodily constitution was weak, and he was afflicted with the falling-sickness, yet, in consequence of his piety, virtue, benevolence, and justice, he was named the Happy. The clemency of his temper was such that he readily pardoned those who offended him, and in few instances was he induced to punish. In his character, however, the virtue of benevolence shone with peculiar splendour among the other virtues of the Christian. A foreign minister one day used the freedom to inquire at Amadeus, if he kept any hounds. The duke replied, \"a great number, and you shall see them to-morrow at noon.\" The minister attended at that hour in expectation of seeing a numerous pack of hounds; but the duke led him to a window which looked into an extensive square, and directing his view to a multitude of poor people eating and drinking, he exclaimed, \"These are my hounds with whom I go in chase of heaven.\"\n\nIn all these pious and benevolent labours he was seconded by his wife Isolande of France. When one of his parsimonious courtiers reminded him that he would spend all his revenues, he generously replied, \"Here is the collar of my order, let them sell it and relieve my people.\" In the seventh year of his reign, and the thirty-seventh of his life, he died universally lamented by all his loyal subjects, in the year 1472. In high esteem for his virtuous qualities, his subjects conferred on him the appellation of The Blest. (Mod. Univ.

The sister of Clovis was her mother, and in 515, she married Eutharic, the only remaining heir of the legal race of the Amali. Her father having formed the design of making him his successor, he sent to bring him from Spain for that purpose. But he never arrived at the destined honour; for Eutharic died previous to his father-in-law, and his only son Athalaric, was also bereft of his grandfather at the age of eight years. The well-known abilities of Amalafontha induced Theodoric to place Athalaric, to whom he had left the kingdom of Italy, under the care of his mother. This princess inherited an ample share of her father's talents; and her father had been exceedingly careful to improve these natural endowments by means of a liberal education. She became a great proficient in the philosophy and morals of that age, and with equal elegance and grace she could converse in the Greek, Latin, and Gothic languages. Nor were her talents merely qualified to adorn private life; she displayed them in the administration of public justice, and political discussion. Her first efforts were in behalf of the injured children of Boethius and Symmachus, whom she reinstated in the possession of their inheritance. When the chiefs of the Goths were strongly inclined to treat the Romans as a conquered people, she mildly restrained their violent oppression and their ungovernable rapacity. Adorning the female character she relieved her subjects from some of the severer impositions of her father; but carefully retained all his laws, magistrates, and political institutions. Having herself tasted of the sweets of literature, and experienced its advantages, she patronized learning with an affluous care, by regularly paying the salaries of public teachers, and giving every encouragement to the improvement of genius. Her peaceable deportment towards the neighbouring princes forms an amiable feature in her character. Both with the imperial court, and with all the other powers, she lived upon agreeable terms, and thus universal prosperity and honour prevailed. Both in consequence of maternal affection and the high cultivation of her mind, she exerted all her ingenuity in the education of her orphan son. Unfortunately, however, both for the mother and the son, neither the general character of the Gothic nation, nor the wayward inclinations of the boy, seconded her laudable endeavours.\n\nThe Gothic nobles had just commenced their murmurs against the soft effeminate manner in which their prince was educating, when, upon a certain day, the youth having undergone some kind maternal chastisement, rushed into the room where some of the nobles were assembled, with the tears streaming from his eyes. Informed of the cause of his distress, the wrath of the nobles suddenly arose, and in a violent burst of passion they insisted upon the immediate release of their prince from the bondage of learning and from the restraints of a mother. The unfortunate youth was thus dragged from the habitation of learning, prudence, and virtue; and plunged into all the extravagancies of dissolute pleasure, and his mind inspired with contempt and aversion to his virtuous mother.\n\nIt was impossible for humanity to bear this insult and high injury without opposition; therefore, in the first effusions of her resentment she seized three of the principal persons concerned in this transaction, and confined them in one of the remotest parts of Italy. But the efforts of one, or of a few individuals, are never adequate to the task of counteracting the general efforts of a nation, for the party whose sentiments were opposed to her's, grew daily in magnitude and strength, to such a degree that Amalafontha formed serious resolutions of sheltering herself under the protection of Justinian. After a correspondence had been carried on to prepare for this event, and when she was about to sail for that place, she determined to make one bold effort to regain her absolute power. With this view, she caused the three persons who were in confinement to be secretly assassinated; and this action re-established her authority, although it augmented the public hatred. But another cause of disquiet soon arose. At the early age of fifteen, her son fell a victim to his debaucheries and follies, and she was left devoid of any legal claim to the crown. The accomplished and ambitious Amalafontha spurned the idea of retiring to a private station, and formed the bold design of sharing the throne with Theodorus her cousin. She had sufficient penetration to perceive that the dispositions of that youth were indolent and weak, and consequently she hoped still to remain at the helm of government. But the future fortune of that accomplished woman, demonstrates to posterity the danger of confiding in human weaknesses, where the principles of honour and justice and virtue are wanting. Theodorus issued an order for her confinement in an island in the lake Bolfena; and in the year 535 she was strangled in the bath. Some historians ascribe this action to the influence of the empress Theodora, who was seized with jealousy in consequence of the respect shown her by Justinian. (Gen. Biog.)","sp":390,"ep":390},{"h":"AMALARIC","t":"was the son of Alaric II., and king of the Visigoths. Deprived of his father when an infant, he would have been bereft of his crown, had not his grandfather Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths interposed in his behalf. In defence of the royal infant, he expelled from the throne his natural brother, who had usurped the government and ruled the kingdom during his life, and preserved the crown to the natural heir. In 526 the grandfather died, and Amalaric assumed the royal authority. In 517 he married Clotilda, the daughter of Clovis, an amiable lady, who inherited both the piety and orthodoxy of her mother, who was of the same name. The Catholic historians\nAmalaricians relate, that the king being violently attached to Amalafontha, embraced the Arian cause, used means to compel his queen to embrace the same opinions; which participated more of cruelty than piety. With all the firmness of a great mind, and the amiable patience of a Christian, she endured her wrongs for a considerable period; but at length, worn out with injurious treatment, she was forced to apply to her brothers for assistance, and sent them a handkerchief stained with her blood in proof of her cruel usage. In order to relieve their sister, one of them, Childebert king of Paris, entered the territories of Amalaric, who then resided with his court at Narbonne; and their different forces having joined battle, the troops of Amalaric were totally defeated, and the king himself forced to save his life by flying into Spain, A.D. 531. It is reported that, when endeavouring to regain Narbonne, he was slain either by an assassin employed by Theudis his successor, or that he fell in battle. Some historians again say, that he died in Barcelona. (Gen. Biog.)","sp":389,"ep":390},{"h":"AMALEK","t":"the son of Eliphaz, by Timna his concubine, and the grandson of Esau, Gen. xxxvi. 12, and 1 Chr. i. 36. Amalek succeeded Gatam in the government of Edom. He was the father of the Amalekites, a powerful people who dwelt in Arabia Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or between Hava and Shur (1 Sam. xv. 7); sometimes in one canton and sometimes in another. It does not appear that they\nthey had cities; for there is no mention of any but one in the Scriptures (id. ib. 5.) ; they living generally in hamlets, caves, or tents.\n\nThe Israelites had scarcely passed the Red sea on their way to the wilderness before the Amalekites came to attack them in the defects of Rephidim (Ex. xvii. 8 &c.) ; and put those cruelly to the sword who were obliged, either through fatigue or weakness, to remain behind. Moses, by divine command, directed Joshua to fall upon this people; to record the act of inhumanity which they had committed in a book, in order to have it always before his eyes; and to revenge it in the most remarkable manner. Joshua therefore fell upon the Amalekites and defeated them, while Moses was upon the mountain, with Aaron and Hur in company. Moses, during the time of the engagement, held up his hands, to which the success of the battle was owing; for as often as he let them down, Amalek prevailed. But Moses's hands being tired, Aaron and Hur supported his arms, and held them extended, while the battle lasted, which was from morning till the approach of night, when the Amalekites were cut in pieces. This happened in the year of the world 2513, before Christ 1491.\n\nThe ground of the enmity of the Amalekites against the Israelites is generally supposed to have been an innate hatred, from the remembrance of Jacob's depriving their progenitor both of his birthright and blessing. Their falling upon them, however, and that without any provocation, when they saw them reduced to so low a condition by the fatigue of their march, and the excessive drought they laboured under, was an inhuman action, and justly deserved the defeat which Joshua gave them. Under the Judges (v. 3.), we see the Amalekites united with the Midianites and Moabites, in a design to oppress Israel; but Ehud delivered the Israelites from Eglon king of the Moabites (Judges iii.), and Gideon (chap. viii.) delivered them from the Midianites and Amalekites. About the year of the world 2930, Saul marched against the Amalekites, advanced as far as their capital, and put all the people of the country to the sword; but spared the best of the cattle and moveables, contrary to a divine command; which act of disobedience was the cause of Saul's future misfortunes.\n\nAfter this war, the Amalekites scarcely appear any more in history. However, about the year of the world 2949, a troop of Amalekites came and pillaged Ziklag, which belonged to David (1 Sam. xxxi.), where he had left his two wives Ahinoam and Abigail; but he returning from an expedition which he had made in the company of Achish into the valley of Jezreel, pursued them, overtook and dispersed them, and recovered all the booty which they had carried off from Ziklag.\n\nThe Arabians maintain Amalek to have been the son of Ham, and grandson of Noah; that he was the father of Ad, and grandfather of Schedad. Calmet thinks that this opinion is by no means to be rejected, as it is not very probable that Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, and grandson of Esau, should be the father of a people so powerful and numerous as the Amalekites were when the Israelites departed out of Egypt. Moses in the book of Genesis (xiv. 7.) relates, that in Abraham's time, long before the birth of Amalek the son of Eliphaz, the five confederate kings carried the war into Amalek's country, about Kedesh; and into that of the Amorites, about Hazazon-tamar. The same Moses (Num. xxiv. 20.) relates, that the diviner Balaam, observing at a distance the land of Amalek, said, in his prophetic style, \"Amalek is the first, the head, the original of the nations; but his latter end shall be, that he perish for ever.\" Our commentator observes, that this epithet of the first of nations cannot certainly agree with the Amalekites descended from the son of Eliphaz, because the generation then living was but the third from Amalek. Besides, Moses never reproaches the Amalekites with attacking their brethren the Israelites; an aggravating circumstance, which he would not have omitted were the Amalekites descended from Esau; in which case they had been the brethren of the Israelites. Lastly, we see the Amalekites almost always joined in the Scripture with the Canaanites and Philistines, and never with the Edomites; and when Saul made war upon the Amalekites, and almost utterly destroyed them, we do not find that the Edomites made the least motion towards their affluence, nor to revenge them afterwards. Thence it is thought probable, that the Amalekites, who are so often mentioned in Scripture, were a free people descended from Canaan, and devoted to the curse as well as the other Amorites, and very different from the descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau.\n\nThe accounts which the Arabians give us of the Amalekites destroyed by Saul are as follow: Amalek was the father of an ancient tribe in Arabia, exterminated in the reign of Saul. This tribe contained only the Arabians who are called Pure; the remains whereof were mingled with the posterity of Joktan and Adnan, and so became Mofarabes or Moslaarabes; that is to say, Arabians blended with foreign nations. They further believe, that Goliath, who was overcome by David, was king of the Amalekites; and that the giants who inhabited Palestine in Joshua's time were of the same race. That at last part of the Amalekites retired into Africa while Joshua was yet living, and settled upon the coasts of Barbary, along the Mediterranean sea. The son of Amalek was Ad, a celebrated prince among the Arabians. Some make him the son of Uz, and grandson of Aram the son of Shem. Let this be as it will, the Mahometans say that Ad was the father of an Arabian tribe called Adites; who were exterminated, as they tell us, for not hearkening to the patriarch Eber, who preached the unity of God to them. Ad had two sons, Schedad and Schedid.","sp":390,"ep":391},{"h":"AMALFI","t":"an ancient city of Italy, situated in E. Long. 15\u00b0 20'. N. Lat. 40\u00b0 35'. It is said to have derived its origin from a number of Roman families, who, about the middle of the fourth century, either from private views of emolument, or in consequence of compulsory orders from the emperor, had left Rome, and embarked for Constantinople; but meeting with storms on their passage, were cast away on the shores of Salerno, and deprived of the means of pursuing their voyage. In this state of perplexity they long remained; but at last came to the resolution of settling on the present site of Amalfi, where they expected to enjoy security, and sufficient plenty of the necessaries of life. The earliest notice of them in this settlement dates no higher than the latter end of the fifth century. Im-\npervious mountains and inaccessible coasts preserved their infant state from the first fury of the Lombards, who seldom attempted the conquest of a maritime people.\n\nIn the year 825, when this little republic had, under the patronage of the eastern emperors, attained a degree of wealth and reputation sufficient to excite the ambition of its neighbours, Sico, prince of Salerno, marched a body of troops by night, surprized Amalfi; and, carrying off the greatest part of the inhabitants, compelled them to fix at Salerno, which had lately suffered a great loss of people by an epidemical disorder. But before the fourth year of their captivity was expired, the Amalitans took advantage of the absence of the Salernitan chiefs, who were then carrying on a war with the Beneventans; armed themselves; and, after burning and plundering Salerno, marched in triumph back to their own country.\n\nHere they framed a better system of government, and reformed many abuses in their former legislation; adopting various measures that were likely to promote internal concord, and defeat the evil intentions of foreign enemies. Their first plan was to vest the supreme authority in a temporary prefect; but the experience of a few years caused them to prefer lodging that power in the hands of a duke elected for the term of his natural life. Under these governors Amalfi attained the summit of her military and commercial glory. It extended its territory, which reached eastward from Vico Vecchio, and westward to the promontory of Minerva, including likewise the island of Caprea, and the two islands of the Galli. Towards the north, it comprehended the cities of Lettere, Gragnans, Pimontio, and Capule di Franchi; towards the south, those of Scala, Ravelli, Mioni, Majuri, Atrani, Tramonti, Aggerula, Citara, Praiano, and Rosflano.\n\nLeo IV. found the Amalitans an useful ally in his wars with the Infidels, and honoured the commonwealth with the title of Defender of the Faith. The Neapolitans, with whom, as Greek vassals, they were united in strict bonds of friendship, experienced many signal favours at their hands; and the Muslims themselves found it expedient to court their alliance, and to enter into treaty with them. Their situation had from the beginning given them a turn to commerce, and their attention to naval affairs so much consequence in the eyes of their protector, the emperor of Constantinople, that by his orders a court was established at Amalfi, for the decision of all controversies arising in maritime transactions. Its code and reports became the general rule in those cases throughout this part of Europe; its precedents and decrees were allowed to be good authority to found judgment upon even in foreign tribunals. To crown the mercantile and naval glory of the republic, it was referred to the lot of an Amalitan to make, or at least to perfect, the most important discovery ever made for the improvement of navigation. Paestano, a village which stands on the shore a few miles west of Amalfi, boasts of having given birth to Flavius Gioia, the inventor of the mariner's compass.\n\nThe merchants of this town engrossed the trade of the Levant, and transacted the commercial business of the world in a lucrative and exclusive manner. The Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, rose upon their ruin; and, after monopolizing the emoluments of trade for Amalfi for ages, made way for the more comprehensive and daring spirit of the present maritime powers.\n\nAt present Amalfi is subject to Naples, and is the see of an archbishop. It is but a shadow of what it was in its flourishing state, when it extended over the stupendous rocks that hang on each side, still crowned with battlemented walls and ruined towers. Its buildings, Mr Swinburne says, are not remarkable for elegance or size; and contain at most 4000 inhabitants, who seem to be in a poor line of life. The cathedral is an uncut building. Under the choir is the chapel and tomb of the apostle St Andrew; to whose honour the edifice was dedicated, when Cardinal Capuano, in 1268, brought his body from Constantinople.","sp":391,"ep":392},{"h":"AMALGAMATION","t":"the operation of making an amalgam, or mixing mercury with any metal.\n\nFor the combination of one metal with another, it is generally sufficient that one of them be in a state of fluidity. Mercury being always fluid, is therefore capable of amalgamation with other metals without heat; nevertheless, heat considerably facilitates the operation.\n\nTo amalgamate without heat requires nothing more than rubbing the two metals together in a mortar; but the metal to be united with the mercury should be previously divided into very thin plates or grains. When heat is used (which is always most effectual, and with some metals indispensably necessary), the mercury should be heated till it begins to smoke, and the grains of metal made red hot before they are thrown into it. If it be gold or silver, it is sufficient to stir the fluid with an iron rod for a little while, and then throw it into a vessel filled with water. This amalgam is used for gilding or silvering on copper, which is afterwards exposed to a degree of heat sufficient to evaporate the mercury.\n\nAmalgamation with lead or tin is effected by pouring an equal weight of mercury into either of these metals in a state of fusion, and stirring with an iron rod.

He mentions also that two brothers of his had been killed in an engagement against the Turks. His own life was spent in a continual succession of travels, which was of no advantage to his fortune. There are miscellaneous poems of this author, the greatest part of which are of the comic or burlesque, and the amorous kind. Though there are many blemishes in his poems, yet he had the talent of reading them in so agreeable a manner, that every one was charmed with them. In 1650, he published *Stances sur la gracieuse de la reine de Pologne et de Suede*. There are six stanzas of nine verses each. In 1653, he printed his *Moife sauv\u00e9, idylle heroique*. This poem had at first many admirers; M. Chapelein called it a *speaking picture*; but it has since fallen into contempt. Amand wrote also a very devout piece, entitled, *Stances \u00e0 M. Corneille, sur son invitation de J\u00e9sus Christ*, which was printed at Paris in 1656. M. Brossette says, that he wrote also a poem upon the moon, wherein he paid a compliment to Lewis XIV. upon his skill in swimming, in which he used often to exercise himself when he was young, in the river Seine; but the king could not bear this poem to be read to him, which is said to have affected the author to such a degree, that he did not survive it long. He died in 1661, being 67 years of age. He was admitted a member of the French academy, when it was first founded by Cardinal Richelieu, in the year 1633; and Mr Pelisson informs us, that in 1637, at his own desire, he was excused from the obligation of making a speech in his turn, on condition that he would compile the comic part of the dictionary which the Academy had undertaken, and collect the burlesque terms. This was a task well suited to him; for it appears by his writings, that he was extremely conversant in these terms, of which he seems to have made a complete collection from the markets, and other places where the lower people resort.","sp":393,"ep":393},{"h":"AMAND","t":"Saint, a city of France, in the department of Cher, formerly Bourbonois, on the confines of Berry, seated on the river Cher.

King Apries having sent an army to the assistance of the Libyans, which was totally routed, and great multitudes put to death, the common people conceived the idea, that the tyrannical prince had sent them to the field of battle, for no other purpose but to destroy great numbers of them, so he might reign over the remainder with uncontrolled oppression. The consequence was, that a general insurrection arose, and all the multitude were in an uproar. Informed of this tumult, Apries sent Amasis, whom he deemed one of his most faithful adherents; but instead of endeavouring to reconcile the disaffected people to their prince, he secured them to his own interest; and while he was pretending to reproach their disloyalty, and endeavouring to recall them to duty, a folder stepped in behind him, and placing a helmet upon his head, saluted him king of Egypt. Amasis instantly took the field against his royal master, and prepared to drive him from his throne. Apprised of the treachery of Amasis, he sent another in whom he confided, to bring Amasis before him, to give an account of his conduct. This messenger met him on horseback, and having delivered his message, Amasis after some insolent behaviour, replied, that he was preparing to visit the king, but thought it proper to bring a suitable equipage to attend him. When the messenger hastened back to inform his master, that he might consult for himself, his only reward was to have his ears and nose cut off, by the order of the tyrant, because he brought not Amasis along with him. In this, as in numerous other instances, tyranny procured its own destruction; for the rest of the nobles who still remained obedient to the king, seeing the barbarous manner in which he had treated the messenger, they all went over to the standard of the usurper. Now all the nation was in commotion. The usurper on the one hand, with the whole body of the natives marshalled under his banner, and the tyrant on the other hand, with a body of foreigners and mercenaries, which he had engaged in his service. The two armies met in a field in the vicinity of Memphis, and the tyrant was made captive and his forces defeated. The usurper treated the captive tyrant with great lenity and respect, and assigned him the palace of Sa\u00efs for his confinement. But the hatred of the people was too violent towards their old king, to permit him to live; Amasis was therefore forced to deliver him into their hands, and they instantly put him to death by strangling him.\n\nThe plebeian extraction of Amasis deprived him for some time of that respect, to which he was entitled as a prince; but observing this, he contrived a stratagem to induce them to pay him suitable honour. He ordered a golden cistern, in which his visitants were accustomed to wash their feet, to be melted and cast in the form of a god, and set it up in the most frequented part of the city, and all the inhabitants did it homage. He then called an assembly of the people, and reminded them, that the gold they now venerated in the form of a god, was once a cistern, and consequently that although he was formerly a person of low rank, yet now that he was their king, they ought to give him the respect and homage due to his station.\n\nHaving by this means provided for the gratification of his vanity, he began to exert himself to act for the general good of his people. It was his constant practice to attend to business in the mornings, and in the evenings he indulged in amusement and pleasure; but in these he sometimes tarnished the dignity of a king. Indeed Amasis loved his wine and his companion too much, previous to his elevation, that it is reported that he lived by theft, and when denying upon detection, he was carried to the oracle of the place, who sometimes condemned and sometimes acquitted him. Recollecting the conduct of the oracles after he ascended the throne, he conceived a disrespect for them, because they were not able at all times to detect his robberies.\n\nTo prevent the evil consequences of an indolent populace, he enacted a law, that every person, under the penalty of capital punishment, should appear before the governor of his respective province, and declare by what occupation he acquired his subsistence. Thus, under the prudent government of Amasis, Egypt enjoyed for many years, great fertility and extensive population. He also employed his industry in the erection of several public works; among which were a portico to the temple of Minerva at Sa\u00efs, and the removal of a house, all of one stone, to the temple.

In consequence of his wavering virtue, and his mingling foreign idolatry with the worship of the true God, he is said, according to Scripture, to have done that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but \"not with a perfect heart.\" His father had been ungenerously murdered by his own servants, therefore his son, on his elevation to the throne, put to death the murderers of his father. In this act of retributive justice, however, he showed a becoming respect to the law of Moses, which prohibited the punishing of the children for the crimes of their guilty fathers. He gave early proofs of his military talents, by making a general muster of all his subjects able to bear arms; and likewise hired a numerous army from the neighbouring kingdom of Israel; and with this increased multitude he hastened to attack Edom. The two kindred armies met together in the valley of Salt, and, after an obstinate engagement, the Edomites were put to flight; and Amaziah from thence proceeded to take the town of Selah. But the spirit of jealousy arose between the two armies, so that Amaziah thought it prudent not to make use of the arms of the Israelitish auxiliaries, consequently issued an order for their returning home; but this treatment roused the martial spirit and indignant temper of the Israelites to such a height, that, on their return, they turned their arms against the cities of Judah, and ravaged and destroyed them. The imperfection of the heart of Amaziah was fully displayed on this occasion; for he is related to have brought home the gods of the children of Seir, who were unable to protect their own votaries, and in the folly of his heart to have paid them divine honours. Flushed with the success of his arms in the valley of Salt, he sent a hostile challenge to Jehoahaz king of Israel, expressed in the phraseology of those times, that they should \"look one another in the face. Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.\" In vain the prudent and peaceful spirit of Jehoahaz endeavoured to persuade him from his bold attempt.

No men were suffered to live among them; though those of some neighbouring nations were suffered to visit them, at a certain season, for the sake of procreation. The females issuing from this commerce were bred up with care, and instructed in what relates to war and government; as to the males, they were sent away into the country of their fathers. But no such nation is at present to be found, any more than the giants and cannibals mentioned by the first adventurers thither.\n\nAmazonia is generally a flat region, abounding in woods, lakes, rivers, bogs, and marshes. The chief river, and one of the largest in the world, is that called the river of Amazonas, or the Orellana, which is formed by two large rivers, the one rising in the province of Quito, a little south of the equator, in 73 degrees of west longitude, and the other, named Xauxa, rising in the lake of Bourbon, near the Andes, in 10 degrees of south latitude. These two rivers uniting on the confines of Peru and Amazonia, in three degrees odd minutes of south latitude, assume the name of Amazon; whence running eastward upwards of 200 miles, and afterwards inclining to the north, they fall into the Atlantic ocean by 84 channels, which in the rainy season overflow the adjacent country. Besides the two streams mentioned, a multitude of others, both on the north and south side, contribute to the formation of this extraordinary river. As it runs almost across the broadest part of South America, it is computed to be between 4000 and 5000 miles in length, including all its windings. Its channel from Junta de los Reyes, about 60 degrees from its head, to the river Maranon, is from one to two leagues broad; it then widens from three to four, and becomes gradually broader as it approaches the ocean. Between the places last mentioned, its depth is from five to ten fathoms; but from Maranon to Rio Negro it increases to 20 fathoms; after which it is sometimes 30, and sometimes 50 fathoms, or more, till it comes near the end of its course. It has no sand banks, nor does the shore shelter so as to render it dangerous for vessels. The manetu and tortoise abound both upon the banks of this and the other rivers; and the fishermen must be upon their guard against the crocodiles, alligators, and water serpents, which also swarm here.\n\nThe air, as in the countries under the same parallel, is observed to be nearly as cool under the equator as about the tropics, on account of the rains continuing longer, and the sky in that season being clouded. Besides, an easterly wind sets from the Atlantic up the river so strong, that vessels are carried by it against the stream.\n\nThe produce of the country is Indian corn and the cassava root, of which they make flour and bread; tobacco, cotton, sugar, taraparilla, yams, potatoes, and other roots. They have also plenty of venison, fish, and fowl. Among the latter are vast flocks of parrots of all colours, the flesh of which serves for food and the feathers for ornament. All the trees here are evergreens; and fruits, flowers, and herbage, are in perfection all the year round. The principal fruits are cocoa nuts, ananas or pine apples, guavas, bananas, and such others as are usually found between the tropics. The forest and timber trees are cedar, Brazil wood, oak, ebony, logwood; ironwood, so called from its weight and hardness; and several sorts of dying wood.\n\nThe natives are of the common stature, with good features, a copper complexion, black eyes and hair. It is computed that there are of them about 150 different tribes or nations, and the villages are so numerous as to be within call of one another. Among the Homagues, a people near the head of the river, are famous for their cotton manufactures; the Jurines, who live between five and ten degrees of latitude, for their joiners work; and the Wroilares for their earthenware. The Topinambes, who inhabit a large island in the river, are remarkable for their strength. Some of these nations frequently make war upon each other. Their armour consists of darts, javelins, bows and arrows; and they wear targets of cane or fish-skin. They make slaves of their prisoners, whom they otherwise use very well. Every tribe is governed by its respective chief or king, the marks of whose dignity are a crown of parrots' feathers, a chain of lions' teeth or claws hung round his neck, or girt about his waist, and a wooden sword which he carries in his hand.\n\nMost of these nations, except the Homagues, go naked. The women thrust pieces of cane through their ears and under lips, as well as through the skin of the pudenda. At the gristle of their noses they also hang glass beads, which wag to and fro when they speak. They are such skilful marksmen, that they will shoot fish as they swim; and what they catch they eat without either bread or salt. They worship images, which they always carry with them on their expeditions; but they neither have temples nor any order of priests; and permit both polygamy and concubinage.\n\nThe country affords neither gold nor silver mines; only a small quantity of the former is found in the rivulets which fall into the Amazon near its sources in Peru. While the Spaniards imagined that it contained those metals, they made great efforts from Peru to reduce this territory to subjection; till being at length undeceived, they abandoned the design.","sp":396,"ep":396},{"h":"AMAZONS","t":"in Antiquity, a nation of female warriors, who founded an empire in Asia Minor, upon the river Thermopylae, along the coasts of the Black Sea.\nThey are said to have formed a state, out of which men were excluded. What commerce they had with that sex, was only with strangers; they killed all their male children; and they cut off the right breasts of their females, to make them more fit for the combat. From which last circumstance it is that they are supposed to take their name, viz. from the privative \u03bf, and \u03bc\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2, mamma, \"breast.\" But Dr Bryant, in his Analysis of Ancient Mythology, explodes this account as fabulous; and observes, that they were in general Cushite colonies from Egypt and Syria, who formed settlements in different countries, and that they derived their name from \u03b6\u03c9\u03bd, \"the sun,\" which was the national object of worship, vol. iii. p. 463. It has indeed been controverted even among ancient writers, whether ever there really was such a nation as that of the Amazons. Strabo, Palaephatus, and others, deny it. On the contrary, Herodotus, Paulianus, Diodorus Siculus, Trogus Pompeius, Justin, Pliny, Mela, Plutarch, &c. expressly assert it.\n\nM. Petit, a French physician, published a Latin dissertation in 1685, to prove that there was really a nation of Amazons. It contains abundance of curious inquiries relating to their habit, their arms, the cities built by them, &c. Others of the moderns also maintain, that their existence is sufficiently proved by the testimony of such of the historians of antiquity as are most worthy of credit; by the monuments which many of them have mentioned; and by medals, some of which are still remaining; and that there is not the least room to believe that what is said of them is fabulous.\n\nThe Amazons are mentioned by the most ancient of the Greek writers. In the third book of the Iliad, Homer represents Priam speaking of himself as having been present, in the earlier part of his life, in a battle with the Amazons; and some of them afterwards came to the assistance of that prince during the siege of Troy.\n\nThe Amazons are particularly mentioned by Herodotus. That historian informs us, that the Grecians fought a battle with the Amazons on the river Thermodoon, and defeated them. After their victory, they carried off all the Amazons they could take alive in three ships. But whilst they were out at sea, these Amazons conspired against the men, and killed them all. Having, however, no knowledge of navigation, nor any skill in the use of the rudder, sails, or oars, they were driven by wind and tide till they arrived at the precipices of the lake Maeotis, in the territories of the Scythians. Here the Amazons went ashore, and, marching into the country, seized and mounted the first horses they met with, and began to plunder the inhabitants. The Scythians at first conceived them to be men; but after they had had skirmishes with them, and taken some prisoners, they discovered them to be women. They were then unwilling to carry on hostilities against them; and by degrees a number of the young Scythians formed connexions with them, and were desirous that these gentle dames should live with them as wives, and be incorporated with the rest of the Scythians. The Amazons agreed to continue their connexion with their Scythian husbands, but refused to associate with the rest of the inhabitants of the country, and especially with the women of it. They afterwards prevailed upon their husbands to retire to Amazons, Sarmatia, where they settled. \"Hence,\" says Herodotus, \"the wives of the Sarmatians still continue their ancient way of living. They hunt on horseback in the company of their husbands, and sometimes alone. They march with their armies, and wear the same dress with the men. The Sarmatians use the Scythian language, but corrupted from the beginning, because the Amazons never learned to speak correctly. Their marriages are attended with this circumstance: no virgin is permitted to marry till she has killed an enemy in the field; so that some always grow old before they can qualify themselves as the law requires.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus says, \"There was formerly a nation which dwelt near the river Thermodoon, which was subjected to the government of women, and in which the women, like men, managed all the military affairs. Among these female warriors, it is said, was one who excelled the rest in strength and valour. She assembled together an army of women, whom she trained up in military discipline, and subdued some of the neighbouring nations. Afterwards, having by her valour increased her fame, she led her army against the rest; and being successful, she was so puffed up, that she styled herself the daughter of Mars, and ordered the men to spin wool, and do the work of the women within doors. She also made laws, by which the women were enjoined to go to the wars, and the men to be kept at home in a fertile state, and employed in the meanest offices. They also debilitated the arms and thighs of those male children who were born of them, that they might be thereby rendered unfit for war. They feared the right breasts of their girls, that they might be no interruption to them in fighting: whence they derived the name of Amazons. Their queen, having become extremely eminent for skill and knowledge in military affairs, at length built a large city at the mouth of the river Thermodoon, and adorned it with a magnificent palace. In her enterprises she adhered strictly to military discipline and good order; and she added to her empire all the adjoining nations, even to the river Tanais. Having performed these exploits, she at last ended her days like a hero, falling in a battle, in which she had fought courageously. She was succeeded in the kingdom by her daughter, who imitated the valour of her mother, and in some exploits excelled her. She caused the girls from their very infancy to be exercised in hunting, and to be daily trained up in military exercises. She instituted solemn festivals and sacrifices to Mars and Diana, which were named Tauropolis. She afterwards carried her arms beyond the river Tanais, and subdued all the people of those regions, even unto Thrace. Returning then with a great quantity of spoils into her own kingdom, she caused magnificent temples to be erected to the deities before mentioned; and she gained the love of her subjects by her mild and gentle government. She afterwards undertook an expedition against those who were on the other side of the river, and subjected to her dominion a great part of Asia, extending her arms as far as Syria.\"\n\nDiodorus also mentions another race of Amazons who dwelt in Africa; and whom he speaks of as being of greater antiquity than those who lived near the river Thermodoon. \"In the western parts of Libya,\"\nAmazon says he, \"upon the borders of those tracts that are habitable, there was anciently a nation under the government of women, and whose manners and mode of living were altogether different from ours. It was the custom of those women to manage all military affairs; and for a certain time, during which they preserved their virginity, they went out as soldiers into the field. After some years employed in this manner, when the time appointed for this purpose was expired, they associated themselves with men, in order to obtain children. But the magistracy, and all public offices, they kept entirely in their own hands. The men, as the women are with us, were employed in household affairs, submitting themselves wholly to the authority of their wives. They were not permitted to take any part in military affairs, or to have any command, or any public authority, which might have any tendency to encourage them to cast off the yoke of their wives. As soon as any child was born, it was delivered to the father, to be fed with milk, or such other food as was suitable to its age. If females were born, they feared their breasts, that they might not be burdensome to them when they grew up; for they considered them as great hindrances in fighting.\"\n\nJustin represents the Amazonian republic to have taken its rise in Scythia. The Scythians had a great part of Asia under their dominion upwards of 400 years, till they were conquered by Nimus, the founder of the Assyrian empire. After his death, which happened about 1150 years before the Christian era, and that of Semiramis and her son Ninias, Ilmus and Sco-lopites, princes of the royal blood of Scythia, were driven from their country by other princes, who like them aspired to the crown. They departed with their wives, children, and friends; and being followed by a great number of young people of both sexes, they passed into Asiatic Sarmatia, beyond Mount Canaflus, where they formed an establishment, supplying themselves with the riches they wanted, by making incursions into the countries bordering on the Euxine sea. The people of those countries, exasperated by the incursions of their new neighbours, united, surprized, and massacred the men.\n\nThe women then resolving to revenge their death, and at the same time to provide for their own security, resolved to form a new kind of government, to choose a queen, enact laws, and maintain themselves, without men, even against the men themselves. This design was not so very surprising as at first sight appears: for the greatest number of the girls among the Scythians had been inured to the same exercises as the boys; to draw the bow, to throw the javelin, to manage other arms; to riding, hunting, and even the painful labours that seem reserved for men; and many of them, as among the Sarmatians, accompanied the men in war. Hence they had no sooner formed their resolution, than they prepared to execute it, and exercised themselves in all military operations. They soon secured the peaceable possession of the country; and not content with showing their neighbours that all their efforts to drive them thence or subdue them were ineffectual, they made war upon them, and extended their own frontiers. They had hitherto made use of the instructions and assistance of a few men that remained in the country; but finding at length that they could stand their ground, and aggrandize themselves, without them, they killed Amazon, all those whom flight or chance had saved from the fury of the Sarmatians, and for ever renounced marriage, which they now considered as an unfavourable slavery. But as they could only secure the duration of their new kingdom by propagation, they made a law to go every year to the frontiers, to invite the men to come to them; to deliver themselves up to their embraces, without choice on their part, or the least attachment; and to leave them as soon as they were pregnant. All those whom age rendered fit for propagation, and were willing to serve the state by breeding girls, did not go at the same time in search of men; for in order to obtain a right to promote the multiplication of the species, they must first have contributed to its destruction; nor was any thought worthy of giving birth to children till she had killed three men.\n\nIf from this commerce they brought forth girls, they educated them; but with respect to the boys, if we may believe Justin, they strangled them at the moment of their birth; according to Diodorus Siculus, they twisted their legs and arms, so as to render them unfit for military exercises; but Quintus Curtius, Philola-tus, and Jordanus, say, that the less savage sent them to their fathers. It is probable, that at first, when their fury against the men was carried to the greatest height, they killed the boys; that when this fury abated, and most of the mothers were filled with horror at depriving the little creatures of the lives they had just received from them, they fulfilled the first duties of a mother; but, to prevent their causing a revolution in the state, maimed them in such a manner as to render them incapable of war, and employed them in the mean offices which these warlike women thought beneath them. In short, that, when their conquests had confirmed their power, their ferocity subsiding, they entered into political engagements with their neighbours; and the number of the males they had preferred becoming burdensome, they, at the desire of those who rendered them pregnant, sent them the boys, and continued still to keep the girls.\n\nAs soon as the age of the girls permitted, they took away the right breast, that they might draw the bow with the greater force. The common opinion is, that they burnt that breast, by applying to it, at eight years of age, a hot brazen instrument, which infensibly dried up the fibres and glands; some think that they did not make use of so much ceremony, but that when the part was formed they got rid of it by amputation; some again, with much greater probability, affirm, that they employed no violent measures; but, by a continual compression of that part from infancy, prevented its growth, at least so far as to hinder its ever being inconvenient in war.\n\nPlutarch, treating of the Amazons in his life of Theseus, considers the accounts which had been preserved concerning them as partly fabulous and partly true. He gives some account of a battle which had been fought between the Athenians and the Amazons at Athens; and he relates some particulars of this battle which had been recorded by an ancient writer named Clidemus. He says, \"That the left wing of the Amazons moved towards the place which is yet called Amazonium, and the right to a place called Pryx, near Chrysa; upon which the Athenians, issuing from behind\nAmazons, hind the temple of the Muses, fell upon them; and that this is true, the graves of those that were slain, to be seen in the streets that lead to the gate Piraeus, by the temple of the hero Chalcedon, are a sufficient proof. And here it was that the Athenians were routed, and shamefully turned their backs to women, as far as to the temple of the Furies. But fresh supplies coming in from Palladium, Ardettus, and Lyceum, charged their right wing, and beat them back into their very tents; in which action a great number of the Amazons were slain.\" In another place he says, \"It appears that the passage of the Amazons through Thessaly was not without opposition; for there are yet to be seen many of their sepulchres near Scutellaea and Cyanecephale.\" And in his life of Pompey, speaking of the Amazons, Plutarch says, \"They inhabit those parts of Mount Caucasus that look towards the Hyrcanian sea (not bordering upon the Albanians, for the territories of the Getae and the Lyciae lie betwixt): and with these people do they yearly, for two months only, accompany and cohabit, bed and board, near the river Thermoodoon. After that they retire to their own habitations, and live alone all the rest of the year.\"\n\nQuintus Curtius says, \"The nation of the Amazons is situated upon the borders of Hyrcania, inhabiting the plains of Thermiscyra, near the river Thermoodoon. Their queen was named Thalestris, and she had under her subjection all the country that lies between Mount Caucasus and the river Phasis. This queen came out of her dominions, in consequence of an ardent desire she had conceived to see Alexander; and being advanced near the place where he was, she previously sent messengers to acquaint him, that the queen was come to have the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with him. Having obtained permission to visit him, she advanced with 300 of her Amazons, leaving the rest of her troops behind. As soon as she came within sight of the king, she leaped from her horse, holding two javelins in her right hand. The apparel of the Amazons does not cover all the body, for their left side is naked down to the stomack; nor do the skirts of their garments, which they tie up in a knot, reach below their knees. They preserve their left breast entire, that they may be able to suckle their female offspring; and they cut off and fear their right, that they may draw their bows, and cast their darts, with the greater ease. Thalestris looked at the king with an undaunted countenance, and narrowly examined his person; which did not according to her ideas, come up to the fame of his great exploits: For the barbarians have a great veneration for a majestic person, esteeming those only to be capable of performing great actions on whom nature has conferred a dignified appearance. The king having asked her whether she had any thing to desire of him, she replied, without scruple or hesitation, that she was come with a view to have children by him, the being worthy to bring him heirs to his dominions. Their offspring, if of the female sex, she would retain herself; and if of the male sex, it should be delivered to Alexander. He then asked her, whether she would accompany him in his wars? But this she declined, alleging, That she had left nobody to take care of her kingdom. She continued to solicit Alexander, that he would not send her back without conforming to her wishes; but it was not till after a delay of 13 days that he complied. She then returned to her own kingdom.\"\n\nJustin also repeatedly mentions this visit of Thalestris to Alexander; and in one place he says, that the made a march of 25 days, in order to obtain this meeting with him. The interview between Alexander and Thalestris is likewise mentioned by Diodorus Siculus. The learned Goropius, as he is quoted by Dr Petit, laments, in very pathetic terms, the hard fate of Thalestris, who was obliged to travel so many miles, and to encounter many hardships, in order to procure this interview with the Macedonian prince; and, from the circumstances, is led to consider the whole account as incredible. But Dr Petit, with equal erudition, with equal eloquence, and with superior force of reasoning, at length determines, that her journey was not founded upon irrational principles, and that full credit is due to those grave and venerable historians by whom this transaction has been recorded.\n\nThe Amazons are represented as being armed with bows and arrows, with javelins, and also with an axe of a particular construction, which was denominated the axe of the Amazons. According to the elder Pliny, this axe was invented by Pentheilea, one of their queens. On many ancient medals are representations of the Amazons, armed with these axes. They are also said to have had bucklers in the shape of a half moon.\n\nThe Amazons are mentioned by many other ancient authors, besides those which have been enumerated; and if any credit be due to the accounts concerning them, they subsisted through several ages. They are represented as having rendered themselves extremely formidable; as having founded cities, enlarged the boundaries of their dominions, and conquered several other nations.\n\nThat at any period there should have been women, who, without the assistance of men, built cities and governed them, raised armies and commanded them, administered public affairs, and extended their dominion by arms, is undoubtedly so contrary to all that we have seen and known of human affairs, as to appear in a very great degree incredible; but that women may have existed sufficiently robust, and sufficiently courageous, to have engaged in warlike enterprises, and even to have been successful in them, is certainly not impossible, however contrary to the usual course of things. In support of this side of the question, it may be urged, that women who have been early trained to warlike exercises, to hunting, and to a hard and laborious mode of living, may be rendered more strong, and capable of more vigorous exertions, than men who have led indolent, delicate, and luxurious lives, and who have seldom been exposed even to the inclemencies of the weather. The limbs of women, as well as of men, are strengthened and rendered more robust by frequent and laborious exercise. A nation of women, therefore, brought up and disciplined as the ancient Amazons are represented to have been, would be superior to an equal number of effeminate men, though they might be much inferior to an equal number of hardy men, trained up and disciplined in the same manner.\n\nThat much of what is said of the Amazons is fabulous, there can be no reasonable doubt; but it does not\nAmazons therefore follow, that the whole is without foundation.\n\nThe ancient medals and monuments on which they are represented are very numerous, as are also the testimonies of ancient writers. It seems not rational to suppose that all this originated in fiction, though it may be much blended with it. The Abb\u00e9 Guyon speaks of the history of the Amazons as having been regarded by many persons as fabulous, \"rather from prejudice than from any real and solid examination,\" and it must be acknowledged, that the arguments in favour of their existence, from ancient history, and from ancient monuments, are extremely powerful. The fact seems to be, that truth and fiction have been blended in the narrations concerning these ancient heroines.\n\nInstances of heroism in women have occasionally occurred in modern times, somewhat resembling that of the ancient Amazons. The times and the manners of chivalry, in particular, by bringing great enterprises, bold adventurers, and extravagant heroism, into fashion, inspired the women with the same taste. The women, in consequence of the prevailing passion, were now seen in the middle of camps and of armies. They quitted the soft and tender inclinations, and the delicate offices of their own sex, for the toils and the toilsome occupations of ours. During the crusades, animated by the double enthusiasm of religion and of valour, they often performed the most romantic exploits; obtained indulgencies on the field of battle, and died with arms in their hands, by the side of their lovers or of their husbands.\n\nIn Europe, the women attacked and defended fortifications; princesses commanded their armies, and obtained victories. Such was the celebrated Joan de Montfort, disputing for her duchy of Bretagne, and fighting herself. Such was that still more celebrated Margaret of Anjou, that active and intrepid general and soldier, whose genius supported a long time a feeble husband; which taught him to conquer; which replaced him upon the throne; which twice relieved him from prison; and, opprested by fortune and by rebels, which did not bend till after she had decided in person twelve battles.\n\nThe warlike spirit among the women, consistent with ages of barbarism, when every thing is impetuous because nothing is fixed, and when all excess is the excess of force, continued in Europe upwards of 400 years, showing itself from time to time, and always in the middle of convulsions, or on the eve of great revolutions. But there were eras and countries in which that spirit appeared with particular lustre. Such were the displays it made in the 15th and 16th centuries in Hungary, and in the islands of the Archipelago and the Mediterranean, when they were invaded by the Turks.\n\nAmong the striking instances of Amazonian conduct in modern ladies, may be mentioned that of Jane of Belleville, widow of Monf. de Clisson, who was beheaded at Paris in the year 1343, on a suspicion of carrying on a correspondence with England and the count de Montfort. This lady, filled with grief for the death of her late husband, and exasperated at the ill treatment which she considered him as having received, sent off \"her son secretly to London;\" and when her apprehensions were removed with respect to him, she sold her jewels, fitted out three ships, and put to sea, to revenge the death of her husband upon all the French Amazons, with whom she should meet. This new corsair made several descents upon Normandy, where the stormed castles; and the inhabitants of that province were spectators more than once, whilst their villages were all in a blaze, of one of the finest women in Europe, with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other, urging the carnage, and crying with pleasure all the horrors of war.\"\n\nWe read in Mezeray (under the article of the Croisade, preached by St Bernard in the year 1147), \"That many women did not content themselves with taking the cross, but that they also took up arms to defend it, and composed squadrons of females, which rendered credible all that has been said of the prowess of the Amazons.\"\n\nIn the year 1590, the League party obtained some troops from the king of Spain. Upon the news of their being disembarked, Barri de St Aunez, Henry IV.'s governor at Leucate, set out to communicate a scheme to the duke de Montmorenci, commander in that province. He was taken in his way by some of the troops of the League, who were also upon their march with the Spaniards towards Leucate. They were persuaded, that by thus having the governor in their hands, the gates of that place would be immediately opened to them, or at least would not hold out long. But Conflantia de Cecelli, his wife, after having assembled the garrison, put herself so resolutely at their head, pike in hand, that she inspired the weakest with courage; and the besiegers were repulsed wherever they presented themselves. Shame, and their great loss, having rendered them desperate, they sent a messenger to this courageous woman, acquainting her, that if she continued to defend herself, they would hang her husband. She replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I have riches in abundance: I have offered them, and I do still offer them, for his ransom; but I would not ignominiously purchase a life which he would reproach me with, and which he would be ashamed to enjoy. I will not dishonour him by treason against my king and country.\" The besiegers having made a fresh attack without success, put her husband to death, and raised the siege. Henry IV. afterwards sent to this lady the brevet of governess of Leucate, with the reverence for her son.\n\nThe famous maid of Orleans, also, is an example known to every reader.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Arnaud, in his memoirs, speaks of a countess of St Balmont, who used to take the field with her husband, and fight by his side. She sent several Spanish prisoners of her taking to Marshal Feuquieres; and, what was not a little extraordinary, this Amazon at home was all affability and sweetness, and gave herself up to reading and acts of piety.\n\nDr Johnson seems to have given some credit to the accounts which have been transmitted down to us concerning the ancient Amazons; and he has endeavoured to show, that we ought not hastily to reject ancient historical narrations because they contain facts repugnant to modern manners, and exhibit scenes to which nothing now occurring bears a resemblance. \"Of what we know not (says he) we can only judge by what we know. Every novelty appears more wonderful, as it is more remote from anything with which experience...\"\nexperience or testimony have hitherto acquainted us; and, if it passes farther, beyond the notions that we have been accustomed to form, it becomes at last incredible. We seldom consider that human knowledge is very narrow; that national manners are formed by chance; that uncommon conjunctures of causes produce rare effects; or, that what is impossible at one time or place may yet happen in another. It is always easier to deny than to inquire. To refuse credit confers for a moment an appearance of superiority which every little mind is tempted to assume, when it may be gained so cheaply as by withdrawing attention from evidence, and declining the fatigue of comparing probabilities. Many relations of travellers have been slighted as fabulous, till more frequent voyages have confirmed their veracity; and it may reasonably be imagined that many ancient historians are unjustly suspected of falsehood, because our own times afford nothing that resembles what they tell. Few narratives will, either to men or women appear more incredible than the histories of the Amazons; of female nations, of whose constitution it was the essential and fundamental law, to exclude men from all participation, either of public affairs or domestic business; where female armies marched under female captains, female farmers gathered the harvest, female partners danced together, and female wits diverted one another. Yet several ages of antiquity have transmitted accounts of the Amazons of Caucasus; and of the Amazons of America, who have given their name to the greatest river in the world, Condamine lately found such memorials as can be expected among erratic and unlettered nations, where events are recorded only by tradition, and new swarms settling in the country from time to time confuse and efface all traces of former times.\n\nNo author has taken so much pains upon this subject as Dr Petit. But, in the course of his work, he has given it as his opinion, that there is great difficulty in governing the women even at present, though they are unarmed and unpractised in the art of war. After all his elaborate inquiries and discussions, therefore, this learned writer might probably think, that it is not an evil of the first magnitude that the race of Amazons now ceases to exist.\n\nRousseau says, \"The empire of the woman is an empire of softness, of address, of complacency. Her commands are carelessly, her menaces are tears.\" But the empire of the Amazons was certainly an empire of a very different kind. Upon the whole, we may conclude with Dr Johnson: \"The character of the ancient Amazons was rather terrible than lovely. The hand could not be very delicate that was only employed in drawing the bow, and brandishing the battleaxe. Their power was maintained by cruelty, their courage was deformed by ferocity; and their example only shows, that men and women live best together.\"","sp":396,"ep":401},{"h":"AMAZONS","t":"the river of, in America.

Hence also that prince himself engaged in combat in the amphitheatre in an Amazonian habit; and of all titles the Amazonius was one of those he most delighted in.

The Abyssinians give names to each of their rocks, as Amba-Dorbo, the rock of a hen, &c. Some of these rocks are said to have the name of Aorni; and are of such a stupendous height, that the Alps and Pyrenees are but low hills in comparison of them. Amongst the mountains, and even frequently in the plains, of this country, arise steep and craggy rocks of various forms, some resembling towers, others pyramids, &c., so perpendicular and smooth on the sides, that they seem to be works of art; infomuch, that men, cattle, &c. are craned up by the help of ladders and ropes; and yet the tops of these rocks are covered with woods, meadows, fountains, fish-ponds, &c. which very copiously supply the animals feasted thereon with all the conveniences of life. The most remarkable of these rocks is called Amba-Geflen. It is prodigiously steep, in the form of a castle built of freestone, and almost impregnable. Its summit is about half a Portuguese league in breadth, and the circumference at the bottom about half a day's journey. The ascent at first is easy; but grows afterwards so steep, that the Abafla-oxen, which will otherwise clamber like goats, must be craned up, and let down with ropes. Here the princes of the blood were formerly confined, in low cottages amongst shrubs and wild cedars, with an allowance barely sufficient to keep them alive. There is, according to Kircher, in this country, a rock so curiously hollowed by nature, that at a distance it resembles a looking-glass; and opposite to this another, on the top of which nothing can be so softly whispered but it may be heard a great way off.

In some ancient writers, ambacht is particularly used for the jurisdiction, government, or chief magistracy of a city. The word is very ancient, though used originally in a sense somewhat different. Ennius calls a mercenary, or slave hired for money, ambatus; and C\u00e6sar gives the same appellation to a kind of dependents among the Gauls, who, without being slaves, were attached to the service of great lords.\n\n**AMBAGES**.

Ambassadors in ordinary, is he who constantly resides in the court of another prince, to maintain a good understanding, and look to the interest of his master. Till about two hundred years ago, ambassadors in ordinary were not heard of; all, till then, were ambassadors extraordinary; that is, such as are sent on some particular occasion, and who retire as soon as the affair is dispatched.\n\nBy the law of nations, none under the quality of a sovereign prince can send or receive an ambassador. At Athens, ambassadors mounted the pulpit of the public orators, and there opened their commissions, acquainting the people with their errand. At Rome, they were introduced to the senate, and delivered their commissions to the fathers.\n\nAmbassadors should never attend any public solemnities, as marriages, funerals, &c. unless their matters have some interest therein; nor must they go into mourning on any occasions of their own, because they represent the person of their prince. By the civil law, the moveable goods of an ambassador, which are accounted an accession to his person, cannot be seized on, neither as a pledge, nor for payment of a debt, nor by order or execution of judgment, nor by the king's or state's leave where he resides, as some conceive; for all actions ought to be far from an ambassador, as well that which toucheth his necessities, as his person: if therefore, he hath contracted any debt, he is to be called upon kindly; and if he refuses, then letters of request are to go to his master. Nor can any of the ambassador's domestic servants that are registered in the secretaries of state's office be arrested in person or goods; if they are, the process shall be void, and the parties suing out and executing it shall suffer and be liable to such penalties and corporal punishment as the lord chancellor or either of the chief justices shall think fit to inflict. Yet ambassadors cannot be defended when they commit anything against that state, or the person of the prince, with whom they reside; and if they are guilty of treason, felony, &c. or any other crime against the law of nations, they lose the privilege of an ambassador, and may be subject to punishment as private aliens.","sp":401,"ep":402},{"h":"AMBER","t":"in Surgery, the name of an instrument for reducing dislocated bones. In Anatomy, a term for the superficial jutting out of a bone.\n\nAMBER (Sucinum), in Natural History, a solid, hard, semipellucid, bituminous substance of a particular nature, of use in medicine and in several of the arts. It has been called ambra by the Arabians, and eleostrum by the Greeks.\n\nAmber has been of great repute in the world from the earliest times. Many years before Christ it was in esteem as a medicine; and Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus, Aeschylus, and others, have commended its virtues. In the times of the Romans, it became in high esteem as a gem; and in the luxurious reign of Nero, immense quantities of it were brought to Rome, and used for ornamenting works of various kinds.\n\nThe most remarkable property of this substance is, that when rubbed it draws or attracts other bodies to it; and, this, it is observed, it does even to those substances which the ancients thought it had an antipathy to; as oily bodies, drops of water, human sweat, &c. Add, that, by the friction it is brought to yield light pretty copiously in the dark; whence it is reckoned among the native phosphors.\n\nThe property which amber possesses of attracting light bodies was very anciently observed. Thales of Miletus, 600 years before Christ, concluded from hence, that it was animated. But the first person who expressly mentions this substance is Theophrastus, about the year 300 before Christ. The attractive property of amber is likewise occasionally taken notice of by Pliny and other later naturalists, particularly by Gellius, Kemelm Digby, and Sir Thomas Brown; but it was generally apprehended that this quality was peculiar to amber and jet, and perhaps agate, till Gilbert published his treatise de Magnete, in the year 1600. From \u1f00\u03bc\u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1, the Greek name for amber, is derived the term Electricity, which is now very extensively applied, not only to the power of attracting light bodies inherent in amber, but to other similar powers, and their various effects in whatever bodies they reside, or to whatever bodies they may be communicated.\n\nAmber assumes all figures in the ground; that of a pear, an almond, a pea, &c. In amber there have been found to be letters found very well formed; and even Hebrew and Arabic characters.\u2014Within some pieces, leaves, insects, &c. have likewise been found included; which seems to indicate either that the amber was originally in a fluid state, or that having been exposed to the sun it was once softened, and rendered susceptible of the leaves, insects, &c. which came in its way. The latter of these suppositions seems the more agreeable to the phenomenon; because those insects, &c. are never found in the centre of the pieces of amber, but always near the surface. It is observed by the inhabitants of those places where amber is produced, that all animals, whether terrestrial, aerial, or aquatic, are extremely fond of it, and that pieces of it are frequently found in their excrements. The bodies of insects, found buried in amber, are viewed with admiration by all the world; but of the most remarkable of these, many are to be suspected as counterfeit, the great price at which beautiful specimens of this kind fell, having tempted ingenious cheats to introduce animal bodies in such artful manners, into seemingly whole pieces of amber, that it is not easy to detect the fraud.\n\nOf those insects which have been originally enclosed in amber, some are plainly seen to have struggled hard for their liberty, and even to have left their limbs behind them in the attempt; it being no unusual thing to see, in a mass of amber that contains a stout beetle, the animal wanting one, or perhaps two of its legs; and those legs left in different places, nearer that part of the mass from which it has travelled. This also may account for the common accident of finding legs or\nor wings of flies, without the rest of their bodies, in pieces of amber; the insects having, when entangled in the yet soft and viscid matter, escaped, at the expense of leaving those limbs behind them. Drops of clear water are sometimes also preserved into it while soft, and preserved by its hardening round them. Beautiful leaves of a pinnated structure, resembling some of the ferns, or maidenhairs, have been found in some pieces; but these are rare, and the specimens of great value. Mineral substances are also found at times lodged in masses of amber. Some of the pompous collections of the German princes boast of specimens of native gold and silver in masses of amber; but as there are many substances of the marcasite, and other kinds, that have all the glittering appearance of gold and silver, it is not to be too hastily concluded, that these metals are really lodged in these beds of amber. Iron is found in various shapes immersed in amber; and as it is often seen eroded, and sometimes in the state of vitriol, it is not impossible but that copper, and the other metals, may be also sometimes immersed in it in the same state; hence the bluish and greenish colours, frequently found in the recent pieces of amber, may be owing, like the particles of the gem colours, to these metals; but as the gems, by their dense texture, always retain their colours, this lighter and more lax bitumen usually loses what it gets of this kind by keeping some time. Small pebbles, grains of sand, and fragments of other stones, are also not unfrequently found immersed in amber.\n\nNaturalists have been greatly divided as to the origin of this substance, and what class of bodies it belongs to; some referring it to the vegetable, others to the mineral, and some even to the animal kingdom. Pliny describes it as \"a resinous juice, oozing from aged pines and firs (others say from poplars, whereof there are whole forests on the coasts of Sweden), and discharged thence into the sea, where undergoing some alteration, it is thrown, in this form, upon the shores of Prussia, which lie very low: he adds, that it was hence the ancients gave it the denomination succinum; from succus, juice.\n\nSome suppose amber a compound substance. Prussia, say they, and the other countries which produce amber, are moistened with a bituminous juice, which mixing with the vitriolic salts abounding in those places, the points of these salts fix its fluidity, whence it congeals; and the result of that congelation makes what we call amber; which is more or less pure, transparent, and firm, as these parts of salt and bitumen are more or less pure, and are mixed in this or that proportion.\n\nMr Brydone, in his tour to Sicily and Malta, says, that the river Gearetta, formerly celebrated by the poets under the name of Simetus, throws up near its mouth great quantities of amber. He mentions also a kind of artificial amber, not uncommon there, made, as he was told, from copal, but very different from the natural.\n\nAccording to Hartman, amber is formed of a bitumen, mixed with vitriol and other salts. But though this were allowed him in regard to the fossil amber, many dispute whether the sea amber be so produced. It is, however, apparent, that all amber is of the same origin, and probably that which is found in the sea has been washed thither out of the cliffs; though Hartman thinks it very possible, that some of it may be formed in the earth under the sea, and be washed up thence. The sea amber is usually finer to the eye than the fossil; but the reason is, that it is deprived of that coarse coat with which the other is covered while in the earth.\n\nUpon the whole, it seems generally agreed upon, that amber is a true bitumen of a fossil origin. In a late volume of the Journal de Physique, however, we find it affected by Dr Girtanner to be an animal product, a sort of honey or wax formed by a species of large ant called by Linnaeus formica rufa. These ants, our author informs us, inhabit the old pine forests, where they sometimes form hills about six feet in diameter: and it is generally in these ancient forests, or in places where they have been, that fossil amber is found. This substance is not hard as that which is taken up in the sea at Prussia, and which is well known to naturalists. It has the consistence of honey or of half melted wax, but it is of a yellow colour like common amber; it gives the same product by chemical analysis, and it hardens like the other when it is suffered to remain some time in a solution of common salt. This accounts for the insects that are so often found inclosed in it. Among these insects ants are always the most prevailing; which tends farther, Mr Girtanner thinks, to the confirmation of his hypothesis. Amber, then, in his opinion, is nothing but a vegetable oil rendered concrete by the acid of ants, just as wax is nothing but an oil hardened by the acid of bees; a fact incontrovertibly proved, we are told, since Mr Metherie has been able to make artificial wax by mixing oil of olives with the nitrous acid, and which wax is not to be distinguished from the natural.\n\nThere are several indications which discover where amber is to be found. The surface of the earth is there covered with a soft scaly stone; and vitriol in particular always abounds there, which is sometimes found white, sometimes reduced into a matter like melted glass, and sometimes figured like petrified wood.\n\nAmber of the finest kind has been found in England. It is frequently thrown on the shores of Yorkshire, and many other places, and found even in our clay pits; the pits dug for tile-clay between Tyburn and Kennington gravel pits, and that behind St George's Hospital at Hyde-park corner, have afforded fine specimens.\n\nPoland, Silesia, and Bohemia, are famous for the amber dug up there at this time. Germany affords great quantities of amber, as well dug up from the bowels of the earth, as toiled about on the shores of the sea and rivers there. Saxony, Meissen, Sweden, and many other places in this tract of Europe, abound with it. Denmark has afforded, at different times, several quantities of fossil amber; and the shores of the Baltic abound with it. But the countries lying on the Baltic afford it in the greatest abundance of all; and of these the most plentiful country is Prussia, and the next is Pomerania. Prussia was, as early as the time of Theodoric the Goth, famous for amber; for this substance coming into great repute with this prince, some natives of Prussia, who were about his court, offered their service to go to their own country, where\nthat substance, they said, was produced, and bring back great stores of it. They accordingly did so; and from this time Prussia had the honour to be called the country of amber, instead of Italy, which had before undeservedly that title. This article alone brings his Prussian majesty a revenue of $26,000 dollars annually. The amber of Prussia is not only found on the sea coasts, but in digging; and though that of Pomerania is generally brought from the shores, yet people who dig, on different occasions, in the very heart of the country, at times find amber.\n\nJunker describes, after Neumann, the Prussian amber mines, which are the richest known. First, At the surface of the earth is found a stratum of sand. Immediately under this sand is a bed of clay, filled with small flints of about an inch diameter each. Under this clay lies a stratum of black earth or turf, filled with fossil wood, half decomposed and bituminous; this stratum is extended upon a bank of minerals, containing little metal except iron, which are consequently pyrites. Lastly, Under this bed the amber is found scattered about in pieces, or sometimes accumulated in heaps.\n\nAmber has a subacid resinous taste, and fragrant aromatic smell, especially when distilled. It differs from the other bituminous substances in this, that it yields by distillation a volatile acid salt, which none of the others do; otherwise it affords the same sort of principles as them, viz. an acid phlegm, an oil which gradually becomes thicker as the distillation is continued; and when the operation is finished, there remains a black caput mortuum in the retort. When boiled in water, it neither softens nor undergoes any sensible alteration. Exposed to the fire in an open vessel, it melts into a black mass very like a bitumen: It is partly soluble in spirit of wine, and likewise in some essential oils; but it is with difficulty that the expressed ones are brought to act upon it. The stronger sorts of fixed alkaline lixivias almost totally dissolve it.\n\nThis substance is principally of two colours, white and yellow. The white is the most esteemed for medicinal purposes, as being the most odoriferous, and containing the greatest quantity of volatile salt; though the yellow is most valued by those who manufacture beads and other toys with it, by reason of its transparency.\n\nAmber is the basis of all varnishes, by solution in the ways described under the article Varnish.\n\nAmber, when it has once been melted, irrecoverably loses its beauty and hardness. There have been some, however, who pretended they had an art of melting some small pieces of amber into a mass, and constituting large ones of them: but this seems such another undertaking as the making of gold; all the trials that have yet been made by the most curious experimenters, proving, that the heat which is necessary to melt amber is sufficient to destroy it. (Phil. Trans. No 248. p. 25.)\n\nCould amber indeed be distilled without impairing its transparency, or one large mass be made of it by uniting several small ones, it is easy to see what would be the advantages of such a process. The art of embalming might possibly be also carried to a great height by this, if we could preserve the human corpse in a transparent case of amber, as the bodies of flies, spiders, grasshoppers, &c. are to a great perfection.\n\nSomething of a substitute of this kind we have in fine rosin; which being distilled by heat, and the bodies of Ambertigris, small animals several times dipped in it, they are thus coated with colophony, that in some degree resembles amber; but this must be kept from dust.\n\nAmber in substance has been much recommended as a nervous and cordial medicine; and alleged to be very efficacious in promoting the menstrual discharge, and the exclusion of the foetus and secundines in labour: but as in its crude state it is quite insoluble by our juices, it certainly can have very little effect on the animal system, and therefore it is now seldom given in substance. The forms in which amber is prepared are, A tincture, a salve, and an oil; the preparations and uses of which are described in the proper place under the article PHARMACY.\n\nAMBER-Tree, the English name of a species of ANTHOSPERMUM.","sp":402,"ep":404},{"h":"AMBERG","t":"a city of Germany, the capital of the palatinate of Bavaria, with a good castle, ramparts, bastions, and deep ditches.

It does not effervescence with acids: it melts freely over the fire into a kind of yellow rosin; and is hardly soluble in spirit of wine.\n\nIt is found swimming upon the sea, or the sea coast, or in the sand near the sea coast; especially in the Atlantic ocean, on the sea coast of Brazil, and that of Madagascar; on the coast of Africa, of the East Indies, China, Japan, and the Molucca islands: but most of the ambergris which is brought to England comes from the Bahama islands, from Providence, &c. where it is found on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the abdomen of whales by the whale fisherman, always in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from half an ounce to an hundred and more pounds. The piece which the Dutch East India Company bought from the king of Tydore, weighed 182 pounds. An American fisherman from Antigua found some years ago, about fifty-two leagues south-east from the Windward islands, a piece of ambergris in a whale which weighed about a hundred and thirty pounds, and sold for 500l. sterling.\n\nThere have been many different opinions concerning the origin of this substance.\n\nIt has been supposed to be a fossil bitumen or naphtha, exuding out of the bowels of the earth in a fluid form, and diffusing into the sea, where it hardens and floats on the surface. But having been frequently found in the bellies of whales, it has by others been considered as entirely an animal production.\n\nClusius asserted it to be a phlegmatic secretion, or indurated\nAmbergris, indurated indigestible part of the food, collected and found in the stomach of the whale, in the same manner as the Bezoars are found in the stomachs of other animals.\n\nIn an account communicated by Paul Dudley, Esq., in the 23rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, the ambergris found in whales is represented as a kind of animal product, like musk, and cafforeum, &c., secreted and collected in a particular bag or bladder, which is furnished with an excretory duct or canal, the spout of which runs tapering into and through the length of the penis; and that this bag, which lies just over the testicles, is almost full of a deep orange-colored liquor, not quite so thick as oil, of the same smell as the balls of ambergris, which float and swim loofe in it; which colour and liquor may also be found in the canal of the penis; and that therefore ambergris is never to be found in any female, but in the male only. But these circumstances are not only destitute of truth, but also contrary to the laws of the animal economy: For, in the first place, ambergris is frequently found in females as well as males; although that found in females is never in such large pieces, nor of so good a quality, as what is found in males. Secondly, No person who has the least knowledge in anatomy or physiology, will ever believe that organized bodies, such as the beaks of the sepia, which are constantly found in ambergris taken out of the whale, can have been absorbed from the intestines by the lacteals or lymphatics, and collected with the ambergris in the precluded bag above mentioned.\n\nK\u00e4mpfer, who has given us so many other faithful accounts in natural history, seems to come nearer the truth with regard to the origin of ambergris, when he says, that it is the dung of the whale; and that the Japanese for this reason call it kufira no fuu, i.e. whale's dung. This account, however, though founded on observation, has never obtained credit; but has been considered rather as a fabulous story, with which the Japanese imposed upon him, who had himself no direct observation to prove the fact.\n\nThis matter, therefore, remained a subject of great doubt; and it was generally thought to be more probable, that ambergris, after having been swallowed and somehow or other changed in the stomach and bowels of the whale, was found among its excrements.\n\nBut the most satisfactory account of the real origin of ambergris, is that given by Dr Swedlaur in the 73rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, art. 15.\n\nWe are told by all writers on ambergris, that sometimes claws and beaks of birds, feathers of birds, parts of vegetables, shells, fish, and bones of fish, are found in the middle of it, or variously mixed with it. Of a very large quantity of pieces, however, which the Doctor examined, he found none that contained any such thing; though he allows that such substances may sometimes be found in it: but in all the pieces of any considerable size, whether found on the sea or in the whale, he constantly found a considerable quantity of black spots, which, after the most careful examination, appeared to be the beaks of the Sepia Ophiodon; and these beaks, he thinks, might be the substances which have hitherto been always mistaken for claws or beaks of birds, or for shells.\n\nThe presence of these beaks in ambergris proves evi-\n\nVol. I. Part II.\nAmbregris hook a whale of this description, torpid, sickly, emaciated, or one that does not dung on being hooked, they immediately either cut up the above-mentioned protuberance, if there be any, or they rip open its bowels from the orifice of the anus, and find the ambergris sometimes in one sometimes in different lumps, of generally from three to twelve and more inches in diameter, and from one pound to twenty or thirty pounds in weight, at the distance of two, but most frequently of about six or seven feet from the anus, and never higher up in the intestinal canal; which, according to their description, is in all probability the intestinum c\u00e6cum, hitherto mistaken for a peculiar bag made by nature for the secretion and collection of this singular substance. That the part they cut open to come at the ambergris is no other than the intestinal canal is certain, because they constantly begin their incision at the anus, and find the cavity everywhere filled with the faeces of the whale, which from their colour and smell it is impossible for them to mistake. The ambergris found in the intestinal canal is not so hard as that which is found on the sea or sea coast, but soon grows hard in the air: when first taken out it has nearly the same colour, and the same disagreeable smell, though not so strong, as the more liquid dung of the whale has; but on exposing it to the air, it by degrees not only grows grayish, and its surface is covered with a grayish dust like old chocolate, but it also loses its disagreeable smell, and, when kept for a certain length of time, acquires the peculiar odour which is so agreeable to most people.\n\nThe gentlemen the Doctor conversed with confessed, that if they knew not from experience that ambergris thus found will in time acquire the above-mentioned qualities, they would by no means be able to distinguish ambergris from hard indurated faeces. This is so true, that whenever a whale voids its faeces upon being hooked, they look carefully to see if they cannot discover among the more liquid excrements (of which the whale discharges several barrels) some pieces floating on the sea, of a more compact substance than the rest. These they take up and wash, knowing them to be ambergris.\n\nIn considering whether there be any material difference between the ambergris found upon the sea or sea coast, and that found in the bowels or among the dung of the whale, the Doctor refutes the opinion, that all ambergris found in whales is of an inferior quality, and therefore much less in price. Ambergris, he observes, is only valued for its purity, lightness, compactness, colour, and smell. There are pieces of ambergris found on different coasts, which are of a very inferior quality; whereas there are often found in whales pieces of it of the first value; nay, several pieces found in the same whale, according to the above-mentioned qualities, are more or less valuable. All ambergris found in whales has at first, when taken out of the intestines, very near the same smell as the liquid excrements of that animal have; it has then also nearly the same blackish colour: they find it in the whale sometimes quite hard, sometimes rather softish, but never so liquid as the natural faeces of that animal. And it is a matter of fact, that after being taken out and kept in the air, all ambergris grows not only harder and whiter, but also loses by degrees its smell, and attains such an agreeable one, as that in general has which is found swimming upon the sea; therefore the goodness of ambergris seems rather to depend on its age. By being accumulated after a certain length of time in the intestinal canal, it seems even then to become of a whiter colour, and less ponderous, and to acquire its agreeable smell. The only reason why ambergris found floating on the sea generally possesses the above-mentioned qualities in a superior degree, is because it is commonly older, and has been longer exposed to the air. It is more frequently found in males than females; the pieces found in females are in general smaller, and those found in males seem constantly to be larger and of a better quality; and therefore the high price in proportion to the size is not merely imaginary, but the rarity's sake, but in some respects well founded, because such large pieces appear to be of a greater age and possess the above-mentioned qualities in general in a higher degree of perfection than smaller pieces.\n\nIt is known, that the sepia octopodia, or cuttle-fish, is the constant and natural food of the spermaceti whale, or phyceter macrocephalus. Of this the fishermen are so well persuaded, that whenever they discover any recent relics of it swimming on the sea, they conclude that a whale of this kind is, or has been, in that part. Another circumstance which corroborates the fact is, that the spermaceti whale on being hooked generally vomits up some remains of the sepia. Hence it is easy to account for the many beaks, or pieces of beaks, of the sepia found in all ambergris. The beak of the sepia is a black horny substance, and therefore passes undigested through the stomach into the intestinal canal, where it is mixed with the faeces; after which it is either evacuated with them, or if these latter be preternaturally retained, forms concretions with them, which render the animal sick and torpid, and produce an obilatation, which ends either in an abscess of the abdomen, as has been frequently observed, or becomes fatal to the animal; whence, in both the cases, on the bursting of its belly, that hardened substance known under the name of ambergris, is found swimming on the sea or thrown upon the coast.\n\nFrom the preceding account, and his having constantly found the above-mentioned beaks of the sepia in all pieces of ambergris of any considerable size, Dr Swediaur concludes with great probability, that all ambergris is generated in the bowels of the phyceter macrocephalus or spermaceti whale; and there mixed with the beaks of the sepia octopodia, which is the principal food of that whale. He therefore defines ambergris to be the preternaturally hardened dung or faeces of the phyceter macrocephalus, mixed with some indigestible relics of its food.\n\nThe opinion of Dr Swediaur, with regard to the origin of ambergris, has been confirmed by the information of Captain J. Coffin, master of a ship employed in the southern whale fishery, given to a committee of privy council in the year 1791. According to Mr Coffin's information, American ships had sometimes found small quantities of ambergris; but none, that he knew of, had ever been found by British ships. The quantity which he had brought home amounted to 362 ounces; and it was taken from the body of a female spermaceti whale on the coast of Guinea, which was\nAmbergris was lean, sickly, and old; and yielded but a small proportion of oil. While the people were employed in cutting up the blubber, ambergris was discovered coming from the fundament of the whale, and a piece of it was seen floating on the surface of the sea. More was observed in the same passage, and the rest was found in a bag a little below the passage and communicating with it. Mr Coffin supposes, that the sperm whale feeds almost wholly on the sepia or squid; for when the whale is dying a quantity of this fish, sometimes whole, sometimes in pieces, is thrown up. The bills of the squid were found, some on the outside adhering to it, and some mixed with it. The sperm whale, when struck, generally voids her excrement, and if she does not, Mr Coffin conjectures, that she has no ambergris; for he supposes, that the production of it is the cause or the effect of some disorder; and that it is most likely to be found in a sickly fish. The ambergris of the whale taken by Mr Coffin was mostly sold at 19s. 9d. per ounce; and a small part of it, when it was scarce, at 25s. It was bought partly for home consumption, and partly for exportation to Turkey, Germany, and France. (Phil. Trans., vol. lxxxii.)\n\nThe use of ambergris in Europe is now nearly confined to perfumery, though it has formerly been recommended in medicine by several eminent physicians. Hence the Effentia Ambrae Hoffmanni, Tinctura Regia Cod. Parisini, Trochisci de Ambra Ph. Wurtemberg, &c.\n\nIf we wish to see any medicinal effects from this substance, the Doctor observes, we must certainly not expect them from two or three grains, but give rather as many scruples of it for a dose; though even then, he thinks, there would not be reason to expect much effect from it, as he had himself taken of pure unadulterated ambergris in powder 30 grains at once without observing the least sensible effect from it. A sailor, however, who had the curiosity to try the effect of recent ambergris upon himself, took half an ounce of it melted upon the fire, and found it a good purgative; which proves that it is not quite an inert substance.\n\nIn Asia and part of Africa ambergris is not only used as a medicine and a perfume; but considerable use is also made of it in cookery, by adding it to several dishes as a spice. A great quantity of it is also constantly bought by the pilgrims who travel to Mecca; probably to offer it there, and make use of it in fumigations, in the same manner as frankincense is used in Catholic countries. The Turks make use of it as an aphrodisiac. Our perfumers add it to scented pills, candles, balls, bottles, gloves, and hairpowder; and its essence is mixed with pomatums, for the face and hands, either alone or mixed with musk, &c. though its smell is to some persons extremely offensive.\n\nAmbergris may be known to be genuine by its fragrant scent when a hot needle or pin is thrust into it, and its melting like fat of an uniform consistence; whereas the counterfeit will not yield such a smell, nor prove of such a fat texture. One thing, however, is very remarkable, that this drug, which is the most sweet of all the perfumes, should be capable of being resembled in smell by a preparation of one of the most odious of all stinks. Mr Homberg found, that a vessel in which he had made a long digestion of human faeces, acquired a very strong and perfect smell of ambergris, in so much that any one would have thought a great quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in it. The perfume was so strong and offensive, that the vessel was forced to be removed out of the laboratory.","sp":404,"ep":407},{"h":"AMBERT","t":"a small town of France, in the department of Puy de Dome, formerly Lower Auvergne.

Amici, or friends, under different relations, including cognati, affines, necessarii, familiares, vicini, tribules, clientes, municipes, sodales, college. 2. Nomenclatura, or the calling and saluting every person by his name; to which purpose, the candidates were attended by an officer, under the denomination of interpret, or nomenclator. 3. Blanditia, or obliging persons, by serving them, or their friends, patrons, or the like, with their vote and interest on other occasions. 4. Prehensio, the shaking every person by the hand, offering him his service, friendship, &c. The second kind was that wherein force, cajoling, money, or other extraordinary influence, was made use of. This was held infamous, and severely punished, as a source of corruption and other mischiefs.\n\nAmbitus was practised, not only at Rome, and in the forum, but in the meetings and assemblies of other towns in Italy, where numbers of citizens were usually found, on account of trade and business. The practice ceased in the city from the time of the emperors, by reason poets were not then to be had by courting the people, but by favour from the prince.\n\nPersons who had causes depending practised the same, going about among the judges to implore their favour and mercy. They who practised this were called Ambitiosi. Hence we also meet with ambitiosa decreta, and ambitiosa justa, used for such sentences and decrees as were thus procured from the judges, contrary to reason and equity, either gratuitously or for money.","sp":408,"ep":408},{"h":"AMBLE","t":"in Horsemanship, a peculiar pace by which a horse's two legs of the same side move at the same time.

His father was a descendant of the renowned house of Amboise, and, through the influence of his powerful connexions, he beheld the path of church preferment open before his son; therefore he destined him to the clerical order. In these languishing expectations he was not disappointed; for he had sufficient influence to procure for him the bishopric of Montauban at the early age of fourteen. Louis XI. appointed him one of his almoners; and in the course of political events, he became strongly attached to the duke of Orleans, and suffered imprisonment in his cause. When this prince, however, had regained his favour at court, he was elevated to the archbishopric of Narbonne. After he had remained there for some time, he changed that station for the archbishopric of Rouen. When the duke of Orleans was governor of Normandy, he made him lieutenant general; and in that situation he was of essential service to the province, in restoring justice and order. When the duke of Orleans became Louis XII., Amboise was suddenly raised to the elevated station of first minister and one of the cardinals. The same regard to equity, which characterized his conduct when lieutenant general induced him to diminish the imposts, which rendered him very popular as first minister of France. In 1499, by his advice, the king undertook the conquest of the Milanese, and, on their revolt, the first minister was sent to quell the rebellion. The great confidence which Louis had reposed in him, induced the pope to make him his legate in France; and, in that station, he piously laboured to reform the ecclesiastical orders. He enforced his doctrine by precept, not only in setting them an example of holding no more benefices than one at a time, but also by devoting two-thirds of the revenue of the same to the poor, and to the repair of religious edifices. According to his own account he was ambitious of the papal chair, \"merely for the purpose of effecting the reformation of abuses and the correction of manners.\" It is reported that, upon the death of Pius III., he would have been elected pope had he not been deceived by the Italian cardinals. Disappointed in his views with regard to the papal honours, he persuaded his master to declare war against the Venetians, to whose influence he supposed his failure was owing. But this imprudent undertaking was suddenly interrupted; for in the prosecution of his journey for the Venetian war, he was seized with an illness, and confined in the city of Lyons. Affliction robs the reflecting powers of the mind, and calls to remembrance the past actions of life. From the confidanthefs of his past errors and faults he was induced to express his contrition to a brother of the infirmary who attended him at the convent of the Celestines. In the year 1510, and in the 50th of his age, he breathed his last in that place. Industry, readiness, and good intention, characterized his conduct as a prime minister. He shone with peculiar brightness as a man of literature. By his liberality and patronage, the arts and sciences flourished under his administration. It may be proper to add, that, assisted by some\nAmboule, of the ablest lawyers in the kingdom; he formed a code of laws to reform the reigning abuses in the nation.

It lies in S. Lat. 3\u00b0 36' and E. Long. 126\u00b0 20', and is remarkable for being the centre of the commerce for nutmegs and cloves, which is entirely monopolized by the Dutch East India Company. It is about 24 leagues in circumference. Besides cloves, it likewise abounds in most of the tropical fruits and fish; nor is there here any deficiency of good water; but flesh is very scarce. This scarcity, however, proceeds more from the policy of the Dutch than either the intemperance of the climate, or the barrenness of the soil: For, excepting cloves, they have in Amboyna, as well as the Moluccas, industriously discouraged the cultivation of every edulent commodity, with the view of withholding subsistence from those who might be tempted to invade them.\n\nOf the natives, the men wear large whiskers, but leave little hair upon the chin; and have only a slight piece of stuff wrapped round their middle. The women tie their hair in knots: the maids are bought of their fathers before they are married; and if the wife proves barren, the marriage is dissolved. Some of the natives are Mahometans, and some Christians: but they are all said to be lazy, deceitful, and treacherous. They make war with small swift vessels, in shape like dragons with regard to the head and tail. Their houses are built of bamboo canes and fago trees. They sleep on mats. Their weapons are bows and arrows, javelins, scimitars, and targets.\n\nAmboyna was first discovered by the Portuguese, who built a fort upon it, which was taken from them by the Dutch in 1605. They did not, however, become masters of the whole island at once. The English had here five factors, who lived under the protection of the Dutch cattle; holding themselves safe, in respect of the friendship between the two nations. Great differences had arisen between the Dutch and English colonists in this part of the world; till at last, the English East India Company applying to King James, a treaty was concluded in 1619, by which the concerns both of the English and Dutch were regulated, and certain measures agreed upon for preventing future disputes. This was an additional security to the English; and, by virtue of the treaty, they continued two years in Amboyna, trading with the Dutch. During this time, however, several disputes happened; which occasioning mutual discontentments, the complaints were sent to Jacatra, in the island of Java Major, to the council of defence of both nations resident there: but they not agreeing, a state of the matter was sent over to Europe, to be decided by the East India Companies of both nations; or, in case they could not agree, by the king of England and the states of Holland, according to an article in the treaty of 1619.\u2014But before these disputes could be decided in a legal way, the Dutch, in order to give the more specious colouring to the violent seizure which they meditated of the island of Amboyna, made use of the stale pretext of a conspiracy being formed by the English and Japanese to dispossess them of one of their forts in this place. The plot, it was alleged, had been confabulated by a Japanese and Portuguese in the English service, who were most unhappily tortured till they should answer in the affirmative such interrogatories as might favour the secret design of those cruel inquisitors. Upon the injurious evidence of this constrained declaration, they immediately accused the English factors of the pretended conspiracy. Some of them they imprisoned, and others they loaded with irons, and sent on board their ships; seizing at the same time all the English merchandise, with their writings and books.\n\nThese acts of violence were followed by a scene of horror unexampled in the punishment of the most atrocious offenders. Some of the factors they tortured, by compelling them to swallow water till their bodies were distended to the utmost pitch; then taking the miserable victims down from the boards to which they had been fastened, and causing them to disgorge the water: if they did not acknowledge the imputed guilt, the process of torture was repeated. Others of the English they consumed by burning them gradually from the feet upwards, in order to extort the confession of a conspiracy, which was only pretended by the internal policy of those savage tormentors. Some had the nails of the fingers and toes torn off; and in some they made holes in their breasts, filling the cavities with inflammable materials, to which they afterwards put fire. Those who did not expire under the agonies of torture were confined to the hands of the executioner.\n\nThe allegation of this pretended conspiracy was equally void of probability and truth. The Dutch had a garrison of 300 men in the fort, besides the burghers in the town, and several other forts and garrisons in the island, while the number of the English did not amount to 20 men; nor were even those provided with arms or ammunition to effect such a design as that with which they were charged. There likewise was not one\nAmboyna. English vessel in the harbour, whereas the Dutch had eight ships riding near the town; neither, when the Dutch broke open the desks and trunks of the factors, was there found a single paper or letter which could be construed into the most distant relation to any conspiracy. Add to all this, that each of the unhappy sufferers as could speak to be heard, declared in the most solemn manner their innocence of the plot with which they were charged.\n\nThe whole of the transaction affords the most irrefragable testimony, that it was founded entirely upon a political fiction of the Hollander, who had themselves formed the design of monopolizing the trade of the Spice Islands; for the accomplishment of which they perpetrated, about the same time, a singular tragedy at Pooleon, where they put to the torture 162 of the natives, whom they likewise charged with a pretended conspiracy. It may justly be reckoned singular in the fortune of this commercial republic, that they have ever since been permitted to enjoy in peace those invaluable islands, which were originally obtained by such atrocious infringements of humanity and the laws of nations, as will stain the Dutch annals, to the latest ages, with indelible infamy.\n\nThe more effectually to preserve this trade, the Dutch have had all the clove trees in the adjacent islands grubbed up. Sometimes also, when the harvest is very large, part of the produce of Amboyna itself is burnt. To prevent the rearing of cloves in any of the neighbouring islands, or the inhabitants from selling them to strangers, the governor of Amboyna makes the tour of his government with a fleet of curriculuses, confining sometimes of 20, and at others of 30, 40, or 50 sail. This expedition is made with all the pomp imaginable, in order to gratify the pride and folly of the Indian chiefs. The true reason of their taking all this pains is, because experience has shown, that no contracts, however solemn, can prevent the inhabitants of those islands from selling their spice to strangers: and even now, frauds are frequently practised by the Dutch themselves, though the Company is inexorable in punishing them, that the common people call the cloves galgen-bruid, that is, the gallows spice.\n\nBesides the cloves, coffee is also cultivated here by the Dutch, and a gold mine has been lately found out. This was discovered by the quantities of gold dust that were washed from some mountains by the torrents. Here also grow several kinds of valuable wood, of which they make tables, chairs, escritoires, &c. for the principal persons in the government; and the rest is sold all over the Indies at a very extravagant rate.\n\nAmboyna is divided into two parts, viz. a greater and lesser peninsula. The former, called Hilton, is 12 leagues in length, and two and a half broad. In this the Dutch have no less than five forts, or rather strong redoubts, mounted with cannon. The other is called Leytimor, five leagues in length, and one and a half broad, which is the southern part of the island; on this stands the fort of Victoria, which is the residence of the governor and his council, composed of 15 gentlemen or merchants. The fortress is a square, the ramparts mounted with 60 pieces of brass cannon, and the garrison usually composed of 600 men. It is so strong by nature and art, as to be in a manner impregnable; and so effectually does it command the harbour, that no vessel could come in or go out without being sunk by the cannon, if the governor chose. The inhabitants of Amboyna are computed at 70 or 80,000, of whom but a small number are Dutch; and this obliges the latter to be continually upon their guard, and to keep a competent number of troops in each of their forts, particularly in that of Middleburgh, which stands upon the isthmus that connects these peninsulas. There are also redoubts and garrisons in all the islands of this government.","sp":410,"ep":411},{"h":"AMBRACIA","t":"one of the most considerable cities of ancient Epirus, situated on the river Arachthus, at a small distance from the sea. At first it was a free city; but was afterwards reduced by the Aetolian kings of Epirus, who chose it for the place of their residence. In process of time, the Aetolians made themselves masters of it, and held it till the year before Christ 189, when it fell into the hands of the Romans.\n\nAt this time Ambracia was a place of great strength. It was defended on one side by the river Arachthus, and on the other by steep and craggy hills; and surrounded with a high and thick wall, above three miles in compass. The Roman consul Fulvius began the siege by forming two camps, separated by the river, but with a communication between them; the Romans were posted in one, and the Epirots their allies in the other. He then threw up two lines, one of circumvallation, the other of contravallation; and built a wooden tower in form of a castle, over against the citadel, which stood on a hill. The Aetolians, however, before the lines were quite finished, found means to throw about 1000 men into the place.\n\nThe lines being completed, the city was attacked in five different places at once. The battering rams shook the walls on all sides: and the Romans, from their moveable towers, pulled down the battlements with a kind of scythes, which they fastened to long beams. The besieged made a vigorous defence. They were night and day on the walls, and indefatigable in preventing the effects of the rams and scythes. The strokes of the former they deadened, by letting down beams, large stones, lumps of lead, &c. by means of pulleys, upon them when they were in motion: the others they rendered useless, by pulling the beams to which they were fastened into the city with hooks contrived for the purpose.\n\nWhile Fulvius was carrying on the siege, Nicander the Aetolian praetor, found means to throw 500 men into the city, under the command of one Nicodamus, with whom Nicander agreed to attack the Roman camp in the night time; not doubting, that, if the garrison from within, and the army from without, fell upon them at the same time, they would be obliged to raise the siege. Nicodamus narrowly watched the time at which he was ordered to fall; and though Nicander did not appear, marched out at the head of the garrison, armed with firebrands and torches. The Roman sentinels, surprized at this sight, ran to wake the legionaries, and soon spread a general alarm all over the camp. The legionaries marched in small bodies as they happened to meet, to repulse the enemy, whom they engaged in three different places.

Jerome and Eusebius differ in the account they give of this man. One denominates him a Marcionite, the other a Valentinian; but they both agree that he was converted to the orthodox faith, through means of the preaching of Origen. As is generally the case with new proselytes, he became very zealous, and was appointed deacon either at Alexandria, or at Caesarea, where Protecletus was presbyter. Origen dedicated many of his works, and among others his book on martyrdom, to Ambrose; at whose desire and expense they were published. Origen and Ambrose were alike indefatigable in their application to study, and lived in terms of the most intimate friendship. Origen being poor, Ambrose assisted him, by providing notaries and amanuenses to copy his works.\n\nIn that period of society, when the increase of copies was a work of immense labour and great expense, there were not only instances of private friendship, but of public utility. Ambrose is thus justly entitled to rank among the patrons of learning. Ambrose has been blamed by some, for having made no provision at his death for the poor infant Origen. The friends of Ambrose excuse this part of his conduct, by saying, that Origen chose to live poor, and daily dependant on\nAmbrose, a divine Providence. According to some historians, Ambrose died as a martyr, along with his friend Pro- tectetus, in the persecution under Maximin, about the year 236; but the dedication of Origen's eight books against Celsus shows, that though he died before Ori-gen, yet he lived to the year 250, or near that period. Origen speaks of him as a man of great piety, and much devoted to the study of the sacred Scriptures.\n\n(Ambrose, bishop of Milan, was one of the most eminent fathers of the church in the fourth century. He was a citizen of Rome, and born in France; some historians say in the year 334, but others say in the year 340. The birth of Ambrose is said to have been attended with a remarkable prefiguration of his future eloquence, by a swarm of bees coming and settling upon his mouth as he lay in his cradle. At the period of his birth, his father was Praetorian prefect of Gallia Narbonensis; but upon his death, the widow repaired to Rome with her family. Ambrose received a religious education, and was reared in the habits of virtuous conduct by his mother, who was an accomplished woman, and eminent for piety. The names of those masters who instructed him in the rudiments of the Greek and Roman literature have not been transmitted to posterity: but in these branches he made early proficiency; and, having directed his attention to the law, he employed his eloquence with such reputation in the Praetorian court of Anicius Probus, that he was soon deemed worthy of a place in the council. After he had continued in this station for some time, Probus appointed him consul of Liguria and Emilia, comprehending the territories of Milan, Liguria, Turin, Genoa, and Bologna. Milan was chosen for the place of his residence, and by the prudent and gentle use of his power, he conducted the affairs of the province with general approbation and growing popularity.\n\nIn the year 374, Auxentius the bishop of that city died, and his death gave a sudden change to the fortune and literary pursuits of Ambrose. At that period, the tide of religious contention ran high between the Catholics and the Arians, and there ensued a strong contest concerning the choice of a new bishop. When the people assembled in the church to elect Ambrose, in the character of governor of the place, went into the assembly, and, in a grave, eloquent, and pathetic address, admonished the multitude to lay aside their contentions, and, in the spirit of religious meekness, to proceed to the important work of choosing a bishop. It is reported, that when Ambrose had finished his address, a child cried out, \"Ambrose is bishop.\" The agitated multitude suddenly caught the superstitious flame, and regarding this as a miraculous intimation, they unanimously elected Ambrose bishop of Milan. Some suppose that this was entirely a device of Ambrose or his friends, and others ascribe it to mere accident. Ambrose strongly affected reluctance, and even pretended to fly from the city in order to avoid the intended honour. It is, however, unfortunate for the artifice of the governor that the place of his concealment was soon discovered, when the will of the emperor was known concerning the confirmation of his election. Finding it inconvenient any longer to reflect the public choice, he exchanged the ensigns of civil for those of ecclesiastical dignity; and, after being baptized, he was ordained bishop of Milan, about the end of the year 374.\n\nBut whatever may be the sentiments of mankind concerning the singular conduct of Ambrose in accepting an office for which he was certainly unqualified in respect of previous studies, habits, and employments, yet it must be admitted, that he immediately betook himself to the necessary studies, and with ability, boldness, and integrity, acquitted himself in his new elevation. Having appropriated his money to the poor, settled his lands upon the church, with the exception of making his foster tenant during life, and having committed the care of his family to his brother, he entered upon a regular course of theological study, under the care of Simplician, a presbyter of Rome, and devoted himself to the labours of the church.\n\nCompelled by the irruption of the Goths and the northern barbarians, who rushed down upon the Roman empire, spreading terror and desolation all around, Ambrose, along with several others, fled to Illyricum; but he remained only a short period in exile, for the northern invaders were quickly defeated by the forces of the emperor, and driven back with considerable loss into their own dominions; therefore, he and his companions returned to their respective habitations.\n\nAfter he returned to his ecclesiastical station, the eloquence and abilities of that zealous bishop found ample scope in the dispute between the Arians and the Catholics. About this era, the doctrine of Arius concerning the person of Christ had been extensively received, and had many powerful defenders, both among the clergy and the common people. Ambrose espoused the cause of the Catholics. Gratian, the son of the elder Valentinian, marshalled on the same side. But the younger Valentinian, who was now become his colleague in the empire, adopted the opinions of the Arians; and all the arguments and eloquence of Ambrose were insufficient to reclaim the young prince to the orthodox faith. Theodosius, the emperor of the east, also professed the orthodox faith, yet there were numerous adherents to Arius scattered throughout his dominions. In this general state of religious opinions in the empire, two leaders of the Arians, Palladius and Secundianus, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation, but Ambrose, aware of the consequence, had the eloquence to persuade the emperor that a general council was improper, and that the matter could be determined by a council of the western bishops. The result was, that a synod, composed of 32 bishops, was held at Aquileia in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president, and Palladius being called upon to defend his opinions, declined; insisting that the meeting was a partial one, and that the whole bishops of the empire not being present, the feme of the Christian church could not be obtained concerning the question in dispute. Ambrose mentioned several precedents in favour of the authority of the court, and added, that the oriental bishops being acquainted with the place and nature of the meeting, might have been present, if they had deemed the matter in difficulty.\nAmbrose. fion worthy of their attention; therefore, the court, although Palladius persisted in his refusal to plead his cause, put the vote, and he, along with his associate Secundianus, was ejected from the episcopal office.\n\nIf Ambrose displayed great zeal in opposing the errors of Arius, he displayed equal zeal in opposing the heathen superstitions. Many of the senators remaining strongly attached to the heathen idolatry, upon Valentinian II. ascending the throne, they made a vigorous effort to restore the worship of the heathen deities. Symmachus, a very opulent man, and a great orator, who was at that time prefect of the city, was entrusted with the management of the pagan cause, and drew up a petition, praying that the altar of Victory might be restored to its ancient station in the hall of the senate, and for the proper support of seven veiled virgins, and the regular observance of the other pagan ceremonies. Great eloquence and peculiar infirmation characterized the petition. He argued that this form of religion had long been profitable to the Roman state, reminded the emperor how much Rome had been indebted to victory, and that it had been the uniform custom of the senators to swear fidelity to the government upon that altar. He likewise produced many facts to prove the advantages derived to the state from its ancient religious institutions, and intimated that it was one divinity that all men worshipped under different forms, so that ancient practice should not be rashly laid aside. He even proceeded so far as to state the injustice of increasing the public revenue by robbing the church, and attributed the late famine which had overtaken the empire to the neglect of the ancient worship.\n\nTo this petition, Ambrose replied in a letter to Valentinian, arguing that the devoted worshippers of idols had often been forsaken by their deities; that the native valour of the Roman soldiers had gained her victories, and not the pretended influence of pagan priests; that these idolatrous worshippers requested for themselves what they refused to Christians; that willing virginity was more honourable than that procured by the public money; that as the Christian ministers declined taking temporal emoluments, they should also be denied to pagan priests; that it was absurd to suppose that God would send a famine upon the empire for neglecting to support a religious system contrary to his revealed will in the Scriptures; that the whole proceeds of nature encouraged innovations; and that all nations had permitted these, even in religion; that heathen sacrifices were exceedingly offensive to Christians; and that every Christian prince should suppress these pagan ceremonies.\n\nIn the epistles of Symmachus and of Ambrose, both the petition and the reply are preserved, in which folly, superstition, sound sense, and solid argument, are strangely blended. It is scarcely necessary to add that the petition was unsuccessful.\n\nThe increasing strength of the Arians proved too formidable for the zealous Ambrose. The young emperor and Justina, along with a considerable number of clergy and laity professing the Arian faith, requested from the bishop the use of two churches, one in the city, the other in the suburbs of Milan. The prelate believing the bishops to be the guardians, both of the temporal and spiritual interests of the church, and that the religious edifices were the unquestionable property of the church, positively refused to deliver up the temples of the Lord into the impious hands of heretics. Filled with indignation, Justina resolved to employ the imperial authority of her son in procuring by force what she could not by persuasion. Ambrose was required to answer for his conduct before the council. He went, attended by a numerous crowd of people, whose impetuous zeal so overawed the ministers of Valentinian, that he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing divine service in the Basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian church in the suburbs. Still continuing obstinate, the court proceeded to violent measures. The officers of the household were commanded to prepare the Basilica and the Portian churches to celebrate divine service upon the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of Easter. The order respecting one of them was carried into effect, but the court perceiving the growing strength of the prelate's interest, deemed it prudent to use softer measures; but all measures proved in vain: the bishop boldly replied, \"If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar, rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage, but God alone can appease.\" This strong declaration was followed by a torrent of eloquence from the pulpit, pursuing his scheme with the most violent zeal. But the court remained unconvinced, and another attempt being made, under a strong guard of ferocious Goths, to seize the church of Basilica; when they were about to enter, Ambrose thundered the sentence of excommunication against them, and so overawed them that they retired; and Ambrose and his friends remained in possession of the churches. About this time, also, an Arian bishop challenged Ambrose to a dispute before the emperor; but he declined, saying that matters of faith should be determined by a council of bishops.\n\nMany circumstances in the history of Ambrose are strongly characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were, his great popularity, and the superstitious reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period of society. But it must also be admitted, that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his popular authority. Many indigent persons were supported by his liberal bounty; in his explanations of Scripture he made constant and severe allusions to existing and public characters; the alternate mode of singing had no small effect upon the minds of the vulgar. At a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he fortunately was admonished in a dream to search for the remains of Gervasius and Protasius, two martyrs who had quietly repose under the pavement of the church. The skeletons were found entire, were stained with blood, and the head of one of them separated from the body. The vulgar crowded in thousands to behold these venerable relics. According to report,\nAmbrose report, a blind man was restored to sight, several demons were expelled, and sick persons healed by touching these bones. Ambrose exulted in these miracles, and appealed to them in his eloquent sermons; whilst the court derided and called in question their existence. The bishop continued firm in his opinions; the people believed; and the existence of the miracles was established. And it is a very singular fact, that there, and many other miracles, obtained current credit among the Christian historians of the second, third, and fourth centuries. Dr Cave in speaking of them says, \"I make no doubt but God suffered them to be wrought, at this time, on purpose to confront the Arian imposters.\"\n\nAlthough the court were displeased with the religious principles and conduct of Ambrose, yet they respected his great political talents; and when necessity required, they solicited his aid, which he generously granted. When Maxentius usurped the supreme power in Gaul, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to him, who prevailed upon him to desist from the undertaking. On a second attempt of the same kind Ambrose was employed; and, although he was unsuccessful, yet, if his advice had been followed upon his return, the schemes of the usurper would have proved abortive; but indifferent to his counsels, the enemy was permitted to enter Italy, and Milan was taken. Jutina and her son fled; but Ambrose remained in his station, and proved beneficial to many of the sufferers, by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief. Theodosius, the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Jutina, and by force of arms regained the kingdom.\n\nIn the year 392, a tumult happened at Thessalonica, in which Botheric, one of the officers of Theodosius was slain; and he was so greatly enraged, that he issued a royal mandate for the promiscuous massacre of the inhabitants of that place: and about seven thousand persons were assassinated, without distinction or mercy. The courageous Ambrose, informed of this deed, wrote to the emperor a severe reproof, and an earnest admonition, charging him not to approach the holy communion with his hands stained with innocent blood. When the emperor was about to enter the church of Milan to attend upon the service, the bishop met him, and with a stern countenance prohibited him from approaching the temple of God. The emperor reminded him that David had been guilty of murder and of adultery. The bishop replied, You have \"imitated David in his guilt; go and imitate him in his repentance.\" The prince obeyed the priest, and, by a course of penitential sorrow, during the space of eight months, he laboured to regain the favour of the church. After the termination of this period, he was absolved, but at the same time was made to sign an edict that an interval of thirty days should intervene before the sentence of death or confiscation should be put in execution. When the mind reflects upon the numerous bad effects of instant and violent passion, this measure was certainly fraught with policy and humanity. If the reader laments the weakness which subjected the conscience to the clerical power, he must be gratified that a moderate use was made of that authority.\n\nThe undaunted courage of Ambrose received another severe trial in the year 392, after the assassination of Valentinian, and the base Eugenius had usurped the empire of the west. Rather than join the standard of the usurper, he fled from Milan. But after the army of Theodosius was victorious, he generously supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported the cause of Eugenius. Theodosius, soon after he had acquired the uncontrolled possession of the Roman empire, died at Milan. The bishop did not long survive the emperor; but died in the year 397. In his last illness he preserved perfect composure of mind, informing his friends that he had endeavoured so to conduct himself that he might neither be ashamed to live nor to die.\n\nOn many accounts the character of the bishop of Milan stands high among the fathers of the ancient church. With unvarying steadfastness he delivered his religious sentiments on all occasions; with unwearied assiduity he discharged the duties of his office; with unabated zeal and boldness he defended the orthodox cause, in opposition to the Arians; with a liberal hand he fed the numerous poor who flocked to his dwelling; with uncommon generosity he manifested kindness to his adversaries; and with Christian affection he sought the happiness of all men. His general habits were amiable and virtuous, and his powers of mind were uncommonly vigorous and persevering. Ambition and bigotry were the chief blemishes in his character.\n\nThe writings of Ambrose are voluminous, although little more than adulterated editions of Origen and other Greek fathers. The great design of his writings was to defend and propagate the Catholic faith. In some of these he recommends perpetual celibacy as the perfection of Christian virtue. Modern judgment and taste may perhaps induce some to esteem the writings of Ambrose absurd, trivial, and even ludicrous; but there is a freshness and vigour in his style, and there are excellent sentiments interspersed, which render the writings of the bishop of Milan worthy of a perusal. With his usual severity and acrimony, Gibbons too severely censures this prelate. \"Ambrose (says he) could act better than he could write; his compositions are destitute of taste or genius, without the spirit of Tertullian, the copious elegance of Lactantius, the lively wit of Jerome, or the grave energy of Augustin.\" The most accurate and complete edition of his works, is that published by the Benedictine monks printed at Paris in two volumes in 1682. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAmbrose, Isaac, an eminent Presbyterian minister, was educated at Brazen-nose college Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts, and became minister of Preston, and afterwards of Garstang in Lancashire, whence he was in 1662 ejected for nonconformity. It was usual for him to retire every year for a month into a little hut in a wood, where he shunned all society, and devoted himself to religious contemplation. Dr Calamy observes, that he had a very strong impulse on his mind of the approach of death, and took a formal leave of his friends at their houses a little before his departure; and the last night of his life he sent his discourse concerning angels to the press. The next day he shut himself up in his parlour, where to the great surprize and regret of all who saw him, he\nAmbrose was found just expiring. He died in 1663-4, in the 72d year of his age. He wrote several other books; as the Prima, Media, et Ultima, or the First, Middle, and Last Things; War with Devils; Looking unto Jesus, &c.\n\nAmbrose, or St Ambrose in the Wood, an order of religious, who use the Ambrosian office, and wear an image of that saint engraven on a little plate: in other respects they conform to the rule of the Augustins.

See Botany Index.","sp":416,"ep":416},{"h":"AMBROSIUS AURELIANUS","t":"or Aurelius Ambrosius, a famous general of the ancient Britons, of Roman extraction. He was educated at the court of Aldroen of Armorica: who, at the request of the Britons, sent him over with 10,000 men, to assist them against the Saxons, whom Vortigern had invited into Britain. Ambrosius had such success against the Saxons, that the Britons chose him for their king, and compelled Vortigern to give up to him all the western part of the kingdom divided by the Roman highway called Watling-street. Some time after, the Britons being discontented with Vortigern, and having withdrawn their allegiance from him, he retired to a castle in Wales, where being besieged by Ambrosius, and the castle taking fire, he perished in the flames, and left his rival sole monarch of Britain; who now took upon him the imperial purple, after the manner of the Roman emperors. Geoffrey of Monmouth tells us, that Ambrosius built Stonehenge near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Ambrosius, according to this historian, coming to a monastery near Caercaradoc, now Salisbury, where three hundred British lords, massacred by Hengist, lay buried, and resolving to perpetuate the memory of this action, he ordered his workmen to prepare a large quantity of stones and other materials. But having, at the instigation of Tremounus archbishop of Caerleon, consulted the famous Merlin, this magician advised him to send over to Ireland for certain great stones, called eborea gigantum, the giant's dance, placed in a circle on a hill called Killair, which were brought thither by giants from the farthest borders of Africa. A body of forces was accordingly sent into Ireland, under Pendragon, Ambrosius's brother, to fetch these stones; but were opposed in their attempt by Gilliomanus king of the country, who derided the folly of the Britons in undertaking so ridiculous an expedition. Nevertheless, the Britons having vanquished this prince in battle, brought away the stones; and by the direction and affluence of Merlin, who had accompanied them, these wonderful stones, by order of Ambrosius, were placed over the graves of the British lords, and are now what is called Stonehenge. Alexander Mechain celebrates this fable in his poem De divina sapientiae landibus. Polydore Virgil affirms another origin of Stonehenge: he tells us it was erected by the Britons as a monument to their general Ambrosius, on the place where he fell in battle, to perpetuate the memory of his glorious actions and services done to his country. Both these stories are rejected by our best antiquaries; who, however, are by no means agreed as to the true origin of this famous piece of antiquity. See Stonehenge.\n\nAfter the Britons had defeated the Saxons, and obliged them to retire northward, Ambrosius is said to have convened the princes and great men at York, where he gave orders for repairing the churches destroyed by the Saxons, and restoring the exercise of religion to its former lustre. This is confirmed by Matthew of Wellminster; who highly applauds the great zeal of Ambrosius in repairing the churches, encouraging the clergy, and restoring the honour of religion. The Monmouth historian gives this prince a very high character. \"He was a man (says he) of such bravery and courage, that when he was in Gaul no one durst enter the lists with him; for he was sure to unhorse his antagonist, or to break his spear into shivers. He was, moreover, generous in bestowing, careful in performing religious duties, moderate in all things, and more especially abhorred a lie. He was strong on foot, stronger on horseback, and perfectly qualified to command an army.\" The same author tells us he was poisoned at Winchester by one Eopa a Saxon, disguised as a physician, and hired for that purpose by Pafcentius one of the sons of Vortigern: but the generally received opinion is, that he was killed in a battle which he lost in the year 508, against Cerdic, one of the Saxon generals.","sp":416,"ep":416},{"h":"AMBRY","t":"a place in which are deposited all utensils necessary for housekeeping.

If the tumour be so low that nothing can be tied about it, they cut it out with a knife, or else burn it off with a sharp hot iron; and, in finewy parts, where a hot iron is improper, they eat it away with oil of vitriol, or white sulphur.\n\nMany of our farriers boast of a secret which infallibly cures all protuberances of this kind; the preparation of which is this: Take three ounces of green vitriol and one ounce of white arsenic; beat them to a coarse powder, and put them into a crucible; place the crucible in the midst of a charcoal fire, stirring the substance, but carefully avoiding the poisonous fumes: when the whole grows reddish, take the crucible out of the fire, and when cool, break it and take out the matter at the bottom; beat this to powder in a mortar, and add to four ounces of this powder five ounces of album rubris; make the whole into an ointment, and let it be applied cold to warts; rubbing them with it every day.

They sometimes signify no more than attacking a man who has no distrust of such a thing; attacking one behind, concealing one's self in some particular place in order to surprise any one. See the book of Judges, ch. ix. 25, 32, 34, 35. Abimelech, who lay lurking with his people in the heights of Sichem, so, however, as to rob and treat those who passed that way very ill, came and attacked the city of Sichem with his troops divided into three bodies: \"Tetendit infidias juxta Sichimam in quatuor locis.\" Literally, according to the Hebrew, \"They prepared ambuscades against Sichem in four heads or companies.\" And a little farther, verse 43. \"Abimelech, being informed that the Sichemites had marched, took his army and divided it into three bodies, and laid wait for them in the field.\" It seems certain, that in these parages ambushes, properly so called, were not the things in question. In the first book of Samuel, Saul complains that David laid ambuscades for him: \"Infidiator usque bodie permanentis.\" Now nothing could be worse grounded than this accusation, if we understand the word infidari in its proper signification; but he might say, though unjustly, that David was his secret enemy. And in the Chronicles it is said, that God turned the ambushes laid by the enemies of Israel upon themselves; that is to say, their endeavours, their malice, their arms, he turned against themselves; for the enemies there mentioned came not in private or by stratagem; they marched openly in arms against Israel.","sp":417,"ep":417},{"h":"AMEDIANS","t":"in Church History, a congregation of religious in Italy, so called from their professing themselves amantes Deum, \"lovers of God;\" or rather amati Deo, \"beloved of God.\" They wore a gray habit, and wooden shoes, had no breeches, and girt themselves with a cord.

The first works he printed were the History of the Government of Venice, and that of the Ulcoks, a people of Croatia. In 1683 he published his translations into French of Machiavel's Prince, and Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent, and Political Discourses of his own upon Tacitus. These performances were well received by the public. He did not prefix his own name to the two last-mentioned works, but concealed himself under that of La Mothe Joffeau. His translation of Father Paul was attacked by the partisans of the pope's unbounded power and authority. In France, however, it met with great success; all the advocates for the liberty of the Gallican church promoting the success of it to the utmost of their power, though at the same time there were three memorials presented to have it suppressed. When the second edition of this translation was published, it was violently attacked by the Abb\u00e9 St Real, in a letter he wrote to Mr Bayle, dated October 17, 1685. Amelot defended himself in a letter to the same gentleman. In 1684, he printed, at Paris, a French translation of Baltasar Graci\u00e1n's Oracula Manual, with the title of l'Homme de Cour. In 1686, he printed La Morale de Tacite de la Flatterie; in which work he collected several particular facts and maxims, which represent in a strong light the artifices of court flatterers, and the mischievous effect of their poisonous discourses. Frederick Leonard, a bookseller at Paris, having proposed, in the year 1692, to print a collection of all the treaties of peace between the kings of France and all the other princes of Europe, since the reign of Charles VII. to the year 1690, Amelot published a small volume in duodecimo, containing a preliminary discourse upon these treaties; wherein he endeavours to show, that most princes, when they enter into a treaty, think more how to evade than how to perform the terms they subscribe to. He published also an edition of Cardinal d'Ollat's letters in 1697, with several observations of his own; which, as he tells us in his advertisement, may serve as a supplement to the history of the reigns of Henry III. and Henry IV., kings of France. He wrote several other works; and died at Paris in 1706, at the age of 73. Amelot was at one time confined in the Bastille, probably on account of his political writings.\n\nAMELOTTE Denis, a celebrated French writer, was born at Saintonge in 1606. He maintained a close correspondence with the fathers of the Oratory, a congregation of priests founded by Philip of Neri. He wrote the life of Charles de Gendron, second superior of this congregation, and published it at Paris in 1643. In this work he said something of the famous Abbot of St Cyran, which greatly displeased the gentlemen of Port Royal, who, out of revenge, published a libel against him, entitled Id\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'esprit et de livre de P. Amelotte. He was so much provoked by this satire, that he did all in his power to injure them. They had finished a translation of the New Testament, and were desirous to have it published; for which purpose they endeavoured to procure an approbation from the doctors of the Sorbonne, and a privilege from the king. But Amelotte, by his influence with the chancellor, prevented them from succeeding. In this he had also a view to his own interest; for he was about to publish a translation of his own. Amelotte's translation with annotations, in 4 volumes octavo, was printed in the years 1666, 1667, and 1668. It is not very accurate, according to F. Simon, who tells us that it contains some very gross blunders. Amelotte wrote also an Abridgement of Divinity, a Catechism for the Jubilee, and a kind of Christian Manual for every day.

The line AP which expresses any value of x is called an abscissa; and PM which expresses the corresponding value of y is called an ordinate. Any two corresponding values of x and y are also called co-ordinates.\n\n338. When the equation that arises by substituting for x any particular value AP has all its roots positive, the points M, M', &c. will lie all on one side of AE, but if any of them be negative, these must be set off on the other side of AE towards m.\n\nIf x be supposed to become negative, then the line AP which represents it is to be taken in a direction opposite to that which represents the positive values of x; the points M, m, are to be taken as before, and the locus is only complete when it passes through all the points M, m, so as to exhibit a value of y corresponding to every possible value of x.\n\nIf in any case one of the values of y vanish, then the point M coincides with P, and the locus meets AE in that point. If one of the values of y become infinite, then it shows that the curve has an infinite arc, and in that case the line PM becomes an asymptote to the curve, or touches it at an infinite distance, if AP itself is finite.\n\nIf when x is supposed infinitely great, a value of y vanishes, then the curve approaches to AE as an asymptote.\n\nIf any values of y become impossible, then so many points M' vanish.\n\n339. From these observations and the theory of equations, it appears that when an equation is proposed involving two indeterminate quantities x and y, there may be as many intersections of the curve that is the locus of the equation and of the line PM, as there are dimensions of y in the equation; and as many intersections of the curve and the line AE as there are dimensions of x in the equation.\n\n340. A curve line is called geometrical or algebraic, when the equation which expresses the relation between x and y, any abscissa and its corresponding ordinate, consists of a finite number of terms, and contains besides these quantities only known quantities. Algebraic curves are divided into orders according to the dimensions of the equations which express the relations between their abscissas and ordinates, or according to the number of points in which they can intersect a straight line.\n\n341. Straight lines themselves constitute the first order of lines; and when the equation expressing the relation between x and y is only of one dimension, the points M must be all found in a straight line which contains with AE a given angle. Suppose for example that the given equation is ay = bx - cd = c, and that its locus is required.\n\nSince \\( y = \\frac{bx + cd}{a} \\), it follows that \\( APM \\) (fig. 8.), being a right angle, if AN be drawn making the angle NAP such that its cosine is to its sine as a to b, and drawing AD parallel to the ordinates PM, and equal to \\( \\frac{cd}{a} \\), if DF be drawn parallel to AN, then will DF\nTo illustrate these observations we shall take a few examples.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to describe the line that is the locus of this equation \\( y^2 = ax + ab \\) or \\( y^2 - ax - ab = 0 \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) denote given quantities. Since \\( y^2 = ax + ab \\), if \\( AP = x \\) (fig. 10.) be assumed of a known value and \\( PM, Pm \\) set off on each side equal to \\( \\sqrt{ax + ab} \\) the points \\( M, m \\) will belong to the locus required; and for every positive value of \\( AP \\) there may thus be found a point of the locus on each side. The greater \\( AP \\), or \\( x \\), is taken, the greater does \\( \\sqrt{ax + ab} \\) become, and consequently \\( PM \\) and \\( Pm \\) the greater, and if \\( AP \\) be supposed infinitely great, \\( PM \\) and \\( Pm \\) will also become infinitely great, therefore the locus has two infinite arcs that go off to an infinite distance from \\( AE \\) and from \\( AD \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed to vanish, then \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{ab} \\), so that \\( y \\) does not vanish in that case, but passes through \\( D \\) and \\( d \\), taking \\( AD \\) and \\( Ad \\) each \\( = \\sqrt{ab} \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\) be supposed to move to the other side of \\( A \\), then \\( x \\) becomes negative, and \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{ab - ax} \\), so that \\( y \\) will have two values as before, while \\( x \\) is less than \\( b \\); but if \\( AB = b \\), and the point \\( P \\) be supposed to come to \\( B \\), then \\( ab = ax \\), and \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{ab - ax} = 0 \\); that is, \\( PM \\) and \\( Pm \\) vanish, and the curve there meets the line \\( AE \\). If \\( P \\) be supposed to move from \\( A \\) beyond \\( B \\), then \\( x \\) becomes greater than \\( b \\), and \\( ax \\) greater than \\( ab \\), so that \\( ab - ax \\) being negative, \\( \\sqrt{ab - ax} \\) becomes imaginary; that is, beyond \\( B \\) there are no ordinates which meet the curve, and consequently on that side the curve is limited in \\( B \\).\n\nAll this agrees very well with what is known by other methods, that the curve whose equation is \\( y^2 = ax + ab \\) is a parabola whose vertex is \\( B \\), axis \\( BE \\), and parameter equal to \\( a \\). For since \\( b + x = BP \\) and \\( y = PM \\), from the equation \\( ab = ax + y^2 \\), or \\( a(b + x) = y^2 \\), we have \\( a \\times BP = PM^2 \\), which is the well-known property of the parabola.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to describe the line that is the locus of the equation \\( xy + ay + cy = bc + bx \\),\n\nor \\( y = \\frac{bc + bx}{a + c + x} \\).\n\nHere it is evident (fig. 11.) that the ordinate \\( PM \\) can meet the curve in one point only, there being but one value of \\( y \\) corresponding to each value of \\( x \\). When \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{bc}{a + c} \\) so that the curve does not pass through \\( A \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed to increase, then \\( y \\) will increase, but will never become equal to \\( b \\), since \\( y = \\frac{c + x}{a + c + x} \\) and \\( a + c + x \\) is always greater than \\( c + x \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) be supposed infinite, then the terms \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) vanish compared with \\( x \\), and consequently \\( y = \\frac{b}{x} = b \\) from which it appears, that taking \\( AD = b \\), and drawing \\( GD \\) parallel to \\( AE \\), it will be an asymptote, and touch the curve at an infinite distance. If \\( x \\) be now supposed negative, and \\( AP \\) be taken on the other side of \\( A \\),\n\nthen \\( y = \\frac{c - x}{a + c - x} \\) and if \\( x \\) be taken on that side,\n\n\\( = c \\), then \\( y = \\frac{c - c}{a} = 0 \\), so that the curve must pass through \\( B \\) if \\( AB = c \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed greater than \\( c \\), then will \\( c - x \\) become negative, and the ordinate will become negative, and lie on the other side of \\( AE \\), till \\( x \\) become equal to \\( a + c \\), and then \\( y = \\frac{-a}{x} \\), that is, because the denominator is \\( 0 \\), \\( x \\) becomes infinite, so that if \\( A \\) be taken \\( = a + c \\), the ordinate \\( KD \\) will be an asymptote to the curve.\n\nIt \\( x \\) be taken greater than \\( a + c \\) or \\( AP \\) greater than \\( AK \\), then both \\( c - x \\) and \\( a + c - x \\) become negative, and consequently \\( y = \\frac{x - c}{a - c} \\) becomes a positive quantity; and since \\( x - c \\) is always greater than \\( a - c \\), it follows that \\( y \\) will be always greater than \\( b \\) or \\( KG \\), and consequently the rest of the curve lies in the angle \\( FGH \\). And as \\( x \\) increases, since the ratio of \\( x - c \\) to \\( x - a - c \\) approaches still nearer to a ratio of equality, it follows that \\( PM \\) approaches to an equality with \\( PN \\), therefore the curve approaches to its asymptote \\( GH \\) on that side also.\n\nThis curve is the common hyperbola, for since \\( b(c + x) = y(a + c + x) \\), by adding \\( ab \\) to both sides, \\( b(a + c + x) = y(a + c + x) + ab \\), and \\( (b - y)(a + c + x) = ab \\), that is \\( NM \\times GN = GC \\times BC \\) which is the property of the common hyperbola.\n\nEx. 3. It is required to describe the locus of the equation \\( ay^2 - xy^2 = x^3 + bx^2 \\).\n\nHere \\( y^2 = \\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x} \\), and therefore \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x}} \\),\n\nhence \\( PM \\) and \\( PM \\) (fig. 12.) are to be taken on each side, and equal to \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x}} \\); this expression by supposing \\( x = a \\) becomes infinite because its denominator is then \\( = 0 \\), therefore if \\( AB \\) be taken \\( = a \\) and \\( BK \\) be drawn perpendicular to \\( AB \\), the line \\( PK \\) shall be an asymptote to the curve. If \\( x \\) be supposed greater than \\( a \\), or \\( AP \\) greater than \\( AB \\), then \\( a - x \\) being negative, the fraction \\( \\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x} \\) will become negative, and its square root impossible; so that no part of the locus can lie beyond \\( B \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed negative, or \\( P \\) taken on the other side of \\( A \\), then \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-x^3 + bx^2}{c + x}} \\), hence the values of \\( y \\) will be real and equal as long as \\( x \\) is less than \\( b \\), but if \\( x = b \\), then \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-x^3 + bx^2}{a - x}} = 0 \\), and consequently if \\( AD \\) be taken \\( = b \\); the curve will pass through \\( D \\), and there touch the\nthe ordinate. If \\( x \\) be taken greater than \\( b \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-x^2 - ax}{c + x}\n\\]\n\nbecomes imaginary, so that no part of the curve is found beyond \\( D \\). The portion between \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) is called a nodus. If \\( y \\) be supposed \\( = 0 \\), then will \\( x^3 + bx^2 = 0 \\) be an equation whose roots are \\( -b, 0, 0 \\), from which it appears that the curve passes twice through \\( A \\), and has in \\( A \\) a punctum duplex. This locus is a line of the 3rd order.\n\nIf \\( b \\) is supposed to vanish in the proposed equation, so that \\( ay^3 - xy^2 = x^3 \\), then will \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) coincide (fig. 13.) and the nodus vanish, and the curve will have in the point \\( A \\) a cuspis, the two arcs \\( AM \\) and \\( AM \\), in this case, touching one another in that point. This is the same curve which the ancients called the Clifford of Diocles.\n\nIf instead of supposing \\( b \\) positive, or equal to \\( 0 \\), we suppose it negative, the equation will be \\( ay^3 - xy^2 = x^3 - bx^2 \\), the curve will in this case pass through \\( D \\) as before, (fig. 14.) and taking \\( AB = a \\), \\( BK \\) will be its asymptote. It will have a punctum conjugatum in \\( A \\), because when \\( y \\) vanishes two values of \\( x \\) vanish, and the third becomes \\( -b \\) or \\( AD \\). The whole curve, besides this point, lies between \\( DQ \\) and \\( BK \\). These remarks are demonstrated after the same manner as in the first case.\n\n347. If an equation have this form\n\n\\[\ny = ax^n + bx^{n-1} + cx^{n-2} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand \\( n \\) is an even number, then will the locus of the equation have two infinite arcs lying on the same side of \\( AE \\), (fig. 15.) for if \\( x \\) become infinite, whether positive or negative, \\( x^n \\) will be positive and \\( ax^n \\) have the same sign in either case, and as \\( ax^n \\) becomes infinitely greater than the other terms \\( bx^{n-1}, \\ldots \\), it follows that the infinite values of \\( y \\) will have the same sign in these cases, and consequently the two infinite arcs of the curve will lie on the same side of \\( AE \\).\n\nBut if \\( n \\) be an odd number, then when \\( x \\) is negative \\( x^n \\) will be negative, and \\( ax^n \\) will have the contrary sign to what it had when \\( x \\) is positive, and therefore the two infinite arcs will in this case lie on different sides of \\( AE \\), as in fig. 16. and tend towards parts directly opposite.\n\n348. If an equation have this form \\( yx^n = a^n + 1 \\), and \\( n \\) be an odd number, then when \\( x \\) is positive \\( y = \\frac{a^n + 1}{x^n} \\), but when \\( x \\) is negative \\( y = -\\frac{a^n + 1}{x^n} \\), so that this curve must all lie in the vertically opposite angles \\( KAE, FAE \\), (fig. 17.) as the common hyperbola, \\( FK, EE \\), being asymptotes.\n\nBut if \\( n \\) be an even number then \\( y \\) is always positive whether \\( x \\) be positive or negative, because \\( x^n \\) in this case is always positive, and therefore the curve must all lie in the two adjacent angles \\( KAE \\) and \\( KAE \\) (fig. 18.) and have \\( AK \\) and \\( AE \\) for its asymptotes.\n\n349. If an equation be such as can be reduced into two other equations of lower dimensions, without affecting \\( y \\) or \\( x \\) with any radical sign, then the locus shall consist of the two loci of those inferior equations. Thus the locus of the equation \\( y^2 - 2xy + ly + x^3 - bx = 0 \\),\n\nwhich may be resolved into these two, \\( y - y = 0, y - x \\) Arithmetic \\( + b = 0 \\), is found to be two straight lines cutting the absciss \\( AE \\) (fig. 19.) in angles of \\( 45^\\circ \\) in the points \\( A, B \\), whose distance \\( AB = b \\). In like manner some cubic equations can be resolved into three simple equations, and then the locus is three straight lines, or may be resolved into a quadratic and simple equation, and then the locus is a straight line and a conic section.\n\nIn general, curves of the superior orders include all the curves of the inferior orders, and what is demonstrated generally of any one order is also true of the inferior orders. Thus, for example, any general property of the conic sections holds true of two straight lines as well as a conic section, particularly that the rectangles of the segments of parallels bounded by them will always be to one another in a given ratio.\n\n350. From the analogy which subsists between algebraic equations and geometrical curves it is easy to see that the properties of the former must suggest corresponding properties of the latter. Hence the principles of algebra admit of the most extensive application to the theory of curve lines. It may be demonstrated, for example, that the locus of every equation of the second order is a conic section; and, on the contrary, the various properties of the diameters, ordinates, tangents, &c. of the conic sections may be readily deduced from the theory of equations.\n\nSect. XXV. Of the Arithmetic of Sines.\n\n351. The relations which subsist between the sines and cosines of any arches of a circle, and those of their sums, or differences, &c. constitute what is called the arithmetic of sines. This branch of calculation has its origin in the application of algebra to geometry, and is of great importance in the more difficult parts of the mathematics, as well as in their application to physics.\n\n352. In treating this subject it is necessary to attend to the following observations.\n\n1. If the sines of all arches between \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 180^\\circ \\) be supposed positive, the sines of arches between \\( 180^\\circ \\) and \\( 360^\\circ \\) must be considered as negative; again, the sines of arches between \\( 360^\\circ \\) and \\( 540^\\circ \\) will be positive, and those of arches between \\( 540^\\circ \\) and \\( 720^\\circ \\) negative, and so on.\n\n2. If the cosines of arches between \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 90^\\circ \\) be supposed positive, the cosines of arches between \\( 90^\\circ \\) and \\( 270^\\circ \\) must be considered as negative, and the cosines of arches between \\( 270^\\circ \\) and \\( 450^\\circ \\) positive, and so on.\n\n3. When an arch changes from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), or from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\) its sine undergoes a like change, but its cosine is the same as before.\n\nThe truth of these observations must be evident from this consideration, that when a line, taken in a certain direction, decreases till it become \\( = 0 \\), and afterwards increases, but in a contrary direction; then, if in the former state it was considered as positive, it must be negative in the latter, and contrariwise.\n\n353. The following proposition may be considered as the foundation of the arithmetic of sines.\n\nLet \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) denote any two arches of a circle.\n\nThen, if radius be supposed \\( = 1 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{fin. } (a + b) = \\text{fin. } a \\times \\text{col. } b + \\text{col. } a \\times \\text{fin. } b.\n\\]\nLet C be the centre of the circle, (fig. 20.) and AB, BD the arches denoted by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); then AD = \\(a + b\\); draw the radii CA, CB, CD, and the fines BE, BF, DG; then BE, BF, DG are the fines of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(a + b\\), respectively; and CE, CF, CG their cofines. Join EF, and draw FH parallel to DG. Because the angles CEB, CFB are right angles, the points C, E, B, F are in the circumference of a circle, hence, the angle FCB is equal to FEB; that is, to the alternate angle EFH; now CFB, EHF are both right angles, therefore the triangles CFB, EHF are similar, hence CF : CB = (CD) : FE : FE; but CF : CD :: FH : DG; therefore FH : FE :: FH : DG, hence FE = DG = fin. \\((a + b)\\). Because EBFC is a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, from the elements of geometry, we have BC \u00d7 EF = BE \u00d7 CF + BF \u00d7 CE but BE = fin. \\(a\\), CF = cof. \\(b\\), BF = fin. \\(b\\), CE = cof. \\(a\\), BC = 1, and EF = DG = fin. \\((a + b)\\), therefore fin. \\((a + b)\\) = fin. \\(a\\) \u00d7 cof. \\(b\\) + cof. \\(a\\) \u00d7 fin. \\(b\\), as was to be proved.\n\n354. If in the preceding theorem we suppose the arch \\(b\\) to become negative, then fin. \\(b\\) will also become negative. Thus we obtain a second theorem, viz.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sin.} (a - b) = \\text{fin.} a \\times \\text{cof.} b - \\text{cof.} a \\times \\text{fin.} b.\n\\]\n\nBecause cof. \\((a + b)\\) = fin. \\((90^\\circ - a) - b\\), and by the second theorem fin. \\((90^\\circ - a) - b\\) = fin. \\((90^\\circ - a) \\times \\text{cof.} b - \\text{cof.} (90^\\circ - a) \\times \\text{fin.} b = \\text{cof.} a \\times \\text{cof.} b - \\text{fin.} a \\times \\text{fin.} b\\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. IX. } 2 \\text{Cof.} a \\times \\text{fin.} na = \\text{fin.} (n + 1) a + \\text{fin.} (n - 1) a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Theor.

XII. } 2 \\text{Sin.} a \\times \\text{fin.} na = -\\text{cof.} (n + 1) a + \\text{cof.} (n - 1) a.\n\\]\n\n356. By means of the four last theorems, the powers and products of the fines and cofines of arches may be expressed in terms of the sums and differences of certain multiples of those arches.\n\nThus, if in theor.

Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Cof. } a &= \\text{cof. } a \\\\\n2 \\text{Cof.}^2 a &= \\text{cof. } 2a + 1 \\\\\n4 \\text{Cof.}^3 a &= \\text{cof. } 3a + 3 \\text{cof. } a \\\\\n8 \\text{Cof.}^4 a &= \\text{cof. } 4a + 4 \\text{cof. } 2a + 3 \\\\\n16 \\text{Cof.}^5 a &= \\text{cof. } 5a + 5 \\text{cof. } 3a + 10 \\text{cof. } a \\\\\n32 \\text{Cof.}^6 a &= \\text{cof. } 6a + 6 \\text{cof. } 4a + 15 \\text{cof. } 2a + 10 \\\\\n64 \\text{Cof.}^7 a &= \\text{cof. } 7a + 7 \\text{cof. } 5a + 21 \\text{cof. } 3a + 35 \\text{cof. } a, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n357. As an example of the products of the sines and cosines of an arch, let it be proposed to express \\( \\sin^3 a \\times \\cos^2 a \\) by the sines, or cosines of multiples of \\( a \\). We have already found \\( 4 \\sin^3 a = -3 \\sin 3a + 3 \\sin a \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n16 \\sin^3 a \\times \\cos^2 a &= 2 \\cos^2 a \\times 2 \\cos a (-3 \\sin 3a + 3 \\sin a) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cos^2 a (-3 \\sin 4a + 2 \\sin 2a) \\\\\n&= -\\sin 5a + \\sin 3a + 2 \\sin a.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus it appears that all positive integer powers of the sine and cosine of an arch, or any product of those powers, may be expressed in finite terms by the sines and cosines of multiples of that arch.\n\n358. On the contrary, the sine and cosine of any arch may be expressed by the powers of the sine and cosine of an arch whereof it is a multiple. For it appears from the 9th and 11th theorems that\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin (n+1)a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin na - \\sin (n-1)a \\\\\n\\cos (n+1)a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\cos na - \\cos (n-1)a.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by taking \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) successively we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin a &= \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin 2a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin 3a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin 2a - \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin 4a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin 3a - \\sin 2a \\\\\n\\sin 5a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin 4a - \\sin 3a, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo that, putting \\( s \\) for the sine, and \\( c \\) for the cosine of the arch \\( a \\), and remarking that \\( c^2 = 1 - s^2 \\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin a &= s \\\\\n\\sin 2a &= 2cs \\\\\n\\sin 3a &= 4c^3s - s = -4s^3 + 3s \\\\\n\\sin 4a &= 8c^4s - 4cs = c(-8s^3 + 4s) \\\\\n\\sin 5a &= 16c^5s - 12c^3s + s = 16s^3 - 20s^3 + 5s, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos a &= c \\\\\n\\cos 2a &= 2c^2 - 1 \\\\\n\\cos 3a &= 4c^3 - 3c \\\\\n\\cos 4a &= 8c^4 - 8c^2 + 1 \\\\\n\\cos 5a &= 16c^5 - 20c^3 + 5c, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n359. If it be required to find the sine or cosine of an arch, from having given the sine or cosine of some multiple of that arch, it may be found by resolving an equation of an order denoted by the numerical coefficient of the multiple arch. Thus if the cosine of an arch be given, to determine the cosine of half the arch, let \\( C \\) denote the given cosine, and \\( x \\) that which is required, then the equation \\( \\cos 2x = 2x^2 - 1 \\) becomes \\( C = 2x^2 - 1 \\), which equation being resolved gives\n\n\\[\nx = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1+C}{2}}.\n\\]\n\nIf the sine be required, from that of twice the arch being given, it may be found from the equation \\( \\sin 2x = 2xt \\), which, by putting \\( S \\) for the given sine, and \\( y \\) for the sine required, becomes \\( S = 2y\\sqrt{1-y^2} \\), or, by squaring both sides, and reducing,\n\n\\[\ny^4 - y^2 = \\frac{S^2}{4}; \\quad \\text{whence} \\quad y^2 = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-S^2}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe two values of \\( x \\) indicate that there are two arches, the one as much less than \\( 90^\\circ \\), as the other exceeds \\( 90^\\circ \\), such, that the cosine of the double of each is expressed by the same number. And the four values of \\( y \\) show that there are four arches, viz., two positive and two negative, such, that the sine of the double of each is expressed by the same number.\n\nSuppose now that the cosine of an arch is given to find the cosine of one-third of that arch, then, putting \\( C \\) to denote the given cosine, and \\( x \\) that which is required, the equation to be resolved is\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 3x = C, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x^3 - \\frac{3}{4}x - \\frac{C}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\nBy comparing this cubic equation with the general equation \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\), it appears that \\( q \\) is negative and such that \\( 4q^3 > 27r^2 \\), for \\( C \\) is always less than unity; hence it follows that the equation belongs to the irreducible case, or that which cannot be resolved by Cardan's rule. The equation \\( 4 \\sin^3 a - 3 \\sin a = -\\sin 3a \\) is also of the same form; in order, therefore, to find either the sine or cosine of one-third of a given arch recourse must be had to the methods of approximation explained in Sect. XVI.\n\n360. The sum of any powers of the sines, or cosines of arches which constitute the arithmetical progression \\( a, a+p, a+2p, a+3p, \\ldots \\) to \\( a+np \\) may be\nArithmetic be found as follows. We have already found, therefore, by substituting \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) successively for \\(p\\) we obtain the following series of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin (a) &= \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin (a+d) &= \\sin (a-d) \\\\\n\\sin (a+2d) &= \\sin (a+2d) - \\sin (a-d) \\\\\n\\sin (a+3d) &= \\sin (a+3d) - \\sin (a+2d) + \\sin (a-d), \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n\\sin (a+nd) &= \\sin (a+(n-1)d) - \\sin (a+(n-2)d) \\\\\n\\sin (a+(n+1)d) &= \\sin (a+(n+1)d) - \\sin (a+nd) + \\sin (a-d)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if we substitute\n\n\\[\nS = \\sin a + \\sin (a+d) + \\sin (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\sin (a+nd),\n\\]\n\nby taking the sum of all the equations, it is evident that\n\n\\[\nS + \\sin (a+(n+1)d) = \\sin a + 2 \\cos d \\times S - \\sin (a-d) - (\\sin (a+nd))\n\\]\n\nwhich equation, by proper reduction becomes\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\sin a - \\sin (a+(n+1)d) + \\sin (a+nd) - \\sin (a-d)}{2(1-\\cos d)}\n\\]\n\nBy proceeding in the same manner with theor. VII. viz.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cof. } (p+d) = 2 \\cos d \\times \\cos p - \\cos (p-d)\n\\]\n\nand substituting \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) successively for \\(p\\), also putting\n\n\\[\nC = \\cos a + \\cos (a+d) + \\cos (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\cos (a+nd)\n\\]\n\nwe obtain this other theorem\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{\\cos a - \\cos (a+(n+1)d) + \\cos (a+nd) - \\cos (a-d)}{2(1-\\cos d)}\n\\]\n\n361. It is worthy of remark, that if the arch \\(d\\) is contained \\(n+1\\) times, either in the whole circumference, or any number of circumferences, that is, if \\((n+1)d = q \\times 360^\\circ\\), where \\(q\\) is any whole number, then \\(nd = q \\times 360^\\circ - d\\). Thus we have \\(\\sin (a+(n+1)d) = \\sin (a+q \\times 360^\\circ) = \\sin a\\), also \\(\\sin (a+nd) = \\sin (a-d)\\), for the sine of any arch is equal to the sine of the same arch increased by any number of circumferences, and the same is true also of the cosine of an arch. Hence it appears that in these circumstances the terms in the numerators of the fractions, which are equal to \\(S\\) and \\(C\\), destroy one another, and thus \\(S\\) and \\(C\\) are both \\(=0\\); that is, the positive sines, and cosines are equal to the negative sines, and cosines, respectively. Now if the circumference of a circle be divided into \\(n+1\\) equal parts at the points \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c. (fig. 21.) and any diameter \\(BC\\) drawn, then, if the arch \\(BA = a\\), and the arch \\(AA' = d\\), the arches \\(BAA', BAA'A''\\), &c. will be equal to \\(a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) respectively; and, supposing the extremity of the diameter to fall between \\(A\\) and \\(A'''\\), the arch \\(BA\\), &c. \\(A'''\\) will be equal to \\(a+nd\\). Hence we derive the following remarkable property of the circle. Let the circumference of a circle be divided into any number of equal parts at the points \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c.; and from the points of division let the fines \\(AD, AD', A'D', A''D'\\), &c. be drawn upon any diameter \\(BCE\\); then, the sum of \\(AD, A'D', \\ldots\\) the fines on one side of the diameter shall be equal to the sum of \\(A''D', A''D'', \\ldots\\) the fines on the other side of the diameter. Also, the sum of \\(CD, C'D', C''D', C''D''\\), the cosines on one side of the centre shall be equal to the sum of \\(C'D', C''D', \\ldots\\) the cosines on the other side of the centre.\n\n362. Let us next investigate the sum of the squares of the fines of the arches \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) For this purpose we may form a series of equations from the theorem\n\n\\[\n2 \\sin^2 a = 1 - \\cos 2a\n\\]\n\nThus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\sin^2 a &= 1 - \\cos 2a \\\\\n2 \\sin^2 (a+d) &= 1 - \\cos 2(a+d) \\\\\n2 \\sin^2 (a+2d) &= 1 - \\cos 2(a+2d) \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n2 \\sin^2 (a+nd) &= 1 - \\cos 2(a+nd)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nLet $S' = \\sin^2 a + \\sin^2 (a+d) + \\sin^2 (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\sin^2 (a+nd)$\n\nThen, by addition, and observing that $\\cos 2a + \\cos 2(a+d) + \\ldots + \\cos 2(a+nd)$ is by \u00a7 360\n\n$$\\frac{\\cos 2a - \\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) + \\cos 2(a+nd) - \\cos 2(a-d)}{2(1-\\cos 2d)}$$\n\nwe have\n\n$$2S' = n - \\frac{\\cos 2a - \\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) + \\cos 2(a+nd) - \\cos 2(a-d)}{2(1-\\cos 2d)}$$\n\nIn the same manner by forming a series of equations from this theorem $2 \\cos^2 a = 1 + \\cos 2a$, and putting\n\n$$\\cos^2 a + \\cos^2 (a+d) + \\cos^2 (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\cos^2 (a+nd)$$\n\nwe find\n\n$$2C' = n + \\frac{\\cos 2a - \\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) + \\cos 2(a+nd) - \\cos 2(a-d)}{2(1-\\cos 2d)}$$\n\n363. If we now suppose $d$ to be such an arch that $(n+1)d = \\text{the whole circumference} = 360^\\circ$, then\n\n$$\\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) = \\cos 2(a+2\\times 360^\\circ) = \\cos 2a,$$\n\nalso\n\n$$\\cos 2(a+nd) = \\cos 2(a-d) + 2\\times 360^\\circ = \\cos 2(a-d).$$\n\nThus it appears that in this particular case the numerators of the fractional parts of the values of $2S'$ and $2C'$ are each $=0$, and hence $2S'$ and $2C'$ are each $=n$.\n\nWe must except, however, the case of $n=1$, for then $d=180^\\circ$, and $\\cos 2d=1$, so that the denominator of each fraction vanishing as well as the numerator, it would be wrong to conclude that the fractions themselves vanish.\n\nNow if the circumference of a circle be divided into $n+1$ equal parts at the points $A, A', A'', \\ldots$ (fig. 21.) and any diameter $BE$, as also the fines $AD, A'D', A''D''$, &c., be drawn, then, if the arch $BA=a$, and the arch $AA'=d$, we have, as in \u00a7 361, $AD=\\sin a$, $A'D'=\\sin (a+d)$, $A''D''=\\sin (a+2d)$, &c., and, supposing the point $B$ to fall between $A$ and $A''$, $A''D''=\\sin (a+nd)$. Hence we derive the following very elegant and general theorem relating to the circle.\n\nLet the circumference of a circle be divided into $n$ equal parts (where $n$ is any number greater than 2) at the points $A, A', A'', \\ldots$; and from the points of division let the fines $AD, A'D', A''D''$, &c., be drawn perpendicular to any diameter whatever. Twice the sum of the squares of the fines $AD, A'D', A''D''$, &c., is equal to $n$ times the square of the radius of the circle: Also twice the sum of the squares of the cosines $CD, C'D', C''D''$, &c., is equal to $n$ times the square of the radius of the circle.\n\n364. We might now proceed to find the sum of the cubes of the fines of the arches $a, a+d, a+2d$, &c., from the equation\n\n$$ch.(n+1)a = ch.\\sup.na - ch.\\sup.(n-1)a$$\n\n367. Let $x$ = chord of $a$, and $y$ = chord of its supplement, then, putting $0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ successively for $n$, and observing that $ch.o a=0$, we obtain from the first of these theorems the following series of equations\n\n$$ch.a=x$$\n$$ch.2a=xy$$\n$$ch.3a=x(y^2-1)$$\n$$ch.4a=x(y^3-2y)$$\n$$ch.5a=x(y^4-3y^2+1)$$\n$$ch.6a=x(y^5-4y^3+3y)$$\n$$ch.7a=x(y^6-5y^4+6y^2-1),$$\n&c.\n\nIf $4=x^2$, and the powers of that quantity be substituted for $y^2$, and its powers, in the chords of $3a, 5a$, &c.,\nArithmetic \\(7a\\), &c., also in the chords of the supplements of \\(2a\\), \\(4a\\), \\(6a\\), &c., we shall obtain the following series of equations expressing the relations between the chord of any arch, and the chords of the multiples of that arch, if those multiples be odd numbers, or the chords of their supplements, if they be even numbers\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{ch. } a &= 4x \\\\\n\\text{ch. sup. } 2a &= -x^3 + 2 \\\\\n\\text{ch. } 3a &= -x^3 + 3x \\\\\n\\text{ch. sup. } 4a &= +x^3 - 4x^2 + 2 \\\\\n\\text{ch. } 5a &= +x^3 - 5x^2 + 5x \\\\\n\\text{ch. sup. } 6a &= -x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x^3 + 2 \\\\\n\\text{ch. } 7a &= -x^3 + 7x^2 - 14x^3 + 7x, \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThese equations are the foundation of the theory of angular sections, or method of dividing a given angle, or arch of a circle, into any proposed number of equal parts; a problem which evidently requires for its general algebraic solution the determination of the roots of an equation of a degree equal to the number of parts into which the arch is to be divided. By means of the same series of equations we may also find the side of any regular polygon inscribed in a circle, and in this case the multiple arch, being equal to the whole circumference, will have its chord \\(=0\\).\n\n368. The relation between the tangents of any two arches and that of their sum may be readily found by means of the 1st and 3d theorems of this section. For since \\(\\sin(a+b) = \\sin a \\times \\cos b + \\cos a \\times \\sin b\\) and \\(\\cos(a+b) = \\cos a \\times \\cos b - \\sin a \\times \\sin b\\), therefore, dividing the former equation by the latter\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin(a+b)}{\\cos(a+b)} = \\frac{\\sin a \\times \\cos b + \\cos a \\times \\sin b}{\\cos a \\times \\cos b - \\sin a \\times \\sin b}\n\\]\n\nBut the sine of any arch divided by its cosine is equal to the tangent of that arch, hence the last equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. XIII. tan.}(a+b) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b}{1 - \\tan a \\times \\tan b}\n\\]\n\nand by supposing the arch \\(b\\) negative, we also find\n\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. XIV. tan.}(a-b) = \\frac{\\tan a - \\tan b}{1 + \\tan a \\times \\tan b}\n\\]\n\n\u00a765. From the first of these two theorems a series of equations may be derived expressing the relations which take place between the tangent of an arch and the tangent of any multiple of that arch. Thus by assuming \\(b = a, 2a, &c.\\) and putting \\(t\\) for \\(\\tan a\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan 2a &= \\frac{2t}{1-t^2} \\\\\n\\tan 3a &= \\frac{3t-3t^3}{1-3t^2}, \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand hence the tangent of an arch being given, the tangent of any part of that arch, as its half, third, &c. may be found by the resolution of an equation.","sp":287,"ep":297},{"h":"WEST'S PINDAR","t":"Pausanias adds, that the Eleans had a law, which condemned any woman to death that should either appear at the Olympic games, or even cross this river during that solemnity: and the Eleans add, that the only woman who transgressed it, had disguised herself in the habit of a master or keeper of the games, and conducted her son thither; but when she saw him come off victorious, her joy made her forget her disguise, so that her sex was discovered.
