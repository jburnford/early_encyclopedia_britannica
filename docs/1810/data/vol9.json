I. Kitchen Garden.\n\nSow some prickly-fedded, or triangular-leaved spinach, for a winter and spring crop; for though the crops of round-fedded produces larger and more succulent leaves, spinach, the prickly-fedded is to be preferred now, because it is by much the hardier of the two. After the plants have got their first leaves about an inch broad, they should be thinned to the distance of four inches from one another, and kept free from weeds.\n\nSow some cabbage seed both of the early and late kinds, to produce plants for next year.\n\nSow some onions, to be used when young in winter or spring, or to produce a crop of early onions this summer. The Strafford or any other kind may be sown now, but the Welsh onion is very hardy, and stands the winter well; for though their tops should be destroyed by the severity of the weather, they will push up again from the root in the spring: this onion, however, does not produce bulbs.\n\nTowards the end of the month sow some cauliflower feed to produce plants for an early crop next summer, which may be protected during the winter, either under hot-bed frames, bell or hand-glasses, or in a well-sheltered border exposed to the south. Between the 18th and 24th of this month is, perhaps, the best time to sow these feeds. The London gardeners, who sow great quantities, are accustomed to sow them on a particular day, viz. the 21st of this month. If they be sown too early, they are apt to button, as the gardeners term it, i.e. run up to feed without producing heads of a proper size; and if they be sown too late, the plants do not acquire sufficient strength, before winter, to enable them to support the severity of the weather.\n\nSow some lettuce seed about the middle of the month, both to supply the table late in the autumn, or beginning of winter, and to plant out into well-sheltered borders, or under hot-bed frames, to stand during winter.\nPart III.","sp":62,"ep":63},{"h":"AXIOMS","t":"1.

They are fit for the table in October, and continue good all winter and spring.\n\nA full crop of potatoes may be planted any time towards the end of this or in the course of next month. Cuttings of moderate-sized potatoes (of the variety intended to be planted), each containing one or two eyes at least, may be put in with a blunt dibble, to the depth of about four inches, in rows two feet apart, and at the distance of about a foot from each other in the row, or in trenches or holes made with the spade. In the fields they are planted either with the dibble or in furrows made by the plough. See Agriculture. They succeed best in light soil, which should be well manured. After they have come above ground, they ought to be kept clear of weeds, and have a quantity of earth drawn up about their stems. There are many varieties of this vegetable, which are obtained from seed; the principal are, early dwarf, champion, large round white, oblong red and white kidney, common kidney, small white kidney, round red, large round dark red, &c.\n\nAny time in the course of this month new plantations of mint may be formed. This plant is propagated by parting the roots or by cuttings of the young stalks; the former is practised this month, the latter in next and following month. Procure a quantity of the roots from an old plantation of mint; part and plant them in rows six inches asunder, and about the same distance from each other in the row, either with the dibble, or in drills about an inch deep, drawn by the hoe. These plants succeed very well in any soil, but prefer a moist one. The kinds commonly cultivated are spearmint, peppermint, orange-mint, &c.\n\nThe leaves and flowers of Indian cresses are frequently used in salads, and their seeds for pickling. The cresses, seeds may be sown about the beginning of the month, at the distance of two or three inches from each other, in drills, about an inch deep. If they are not sown alongside of a hedge or other support, they may have sticks placed beside them like peas after they have come above ground. There are two kinds, the large, and dwarf; the former is generally preferred.\n\nSeeds of basil, love apple (or tomatoe), and capicum, may be sown any time this month. They are tender annuals, and must be sown in a hot-bed, to be afterwards planted out in the open ground in May; they must be managed like other tender annuals. See Flower Garden. Basil is used in soups and salads, and must be sown in very dry earth, otherwise the seeds will rot. Love apples are used in soups and for pickling. The capicum, of which there is great variety, is used as a pickle, and for seasoning. The principal kinds are the long-podded, heart-shaped, bell-shaped, angular-podded, round short-podded, cherry-shaped, &c.\n\nSow cucumbers and melons, to be planted out under hand or bell-glasses.\n\nSome cucumber and melon seed may be sown towards the end of this month, in any of the beds already employed; or one may be formed on purpose to raise plants to be reared under bell or hand-glasses. Those sown now will be fit for ridging out in the beginning of May. See May.\n\nVol. IX. Part II.\nSect. II. Fruit Garden.\n\nAll kinds of fruit trees mentioned under this head last month may be pruned now, though it ought to be performed as near the beginning of the month as possible; for if the weather has been mild during the preceding month, many of the trees will have advanced too far to be in a state proper for pruning. Figs, however, on account of the late period at which they begin to push, may be safely pruned; indeed this is the best season for pruning them.\n\nFruit trees may still be planted, though the earlier in the month the better; for if mild weather prevails, the buds of the trees will have advanced so far before the end of the month, as to render transplanting less safe. For the method, see October. The duration of the planting season depends more on the mildness and severity of the weather than the time of the year.\n\nWhen apricot, nectarine, and peach trees are in flower, they should be protected during frosts with large garden-mats fixed to the top of the walls by hooks, and fastened at the bottom to prevent them from being agitated by the wind so as to dash off the blossoms. These mats must be removed during the mildest part of the day, unless when the weather is very severe, and without sunshine. Instead of mats, old fish-nets doubled may be used for this purpose, and need not be removed during the day; a number of small branches of evergreens (well clad with leaves) fixed among the branches of the trees in flower, will also afford shelter to the blossom and setting fruit.\n\nDreys strawberry beds, if not done last month. See February.\n\nFruit trees on hot walls, in peach, cherry, and vine-houses, must be duly attended to, must receive air and water regularly, and have the fires put on every evening and cold morning.\n\nSect. III. Flower Garden and Pleasure Ground.\n\nIf any early annuals, such as balsams, cockscombs, &c., were sown last month, they will be fit for planting out into small pots or a hot-bed prepared for the purpose. This hot-bed should be raised to the height of two feet; and when the violent heat has subsided, covered over to the depth of six inches with rich dry earth. The plants may be put in at the distance of three or four inches from one another, or rather in small pots, because from these they can be more easily removed into larger ones at a subsequent period. Due attention must be paid to give them water and air when requisite; and linings of fresh dung must be applied to the bed whenever the heat begins to decline. If properly taken care of, they will be fit for final transplantation in May or June.\n\nIf no tender annuals were sown in February, some may be sown any time this month.\n\nSow less tender or half-hardy annuals, such as China aster, Indian pink, capsicum, French and African marigold, chrysanthemum, tree and purple amaranthus, and Chinese hollyhocks.\n\nForm a slight hot-bed any time this month, which need not be raised higher than two feet, and earth it over to the depth of about six inches. The seed may be sown in narrow drills, at the distance of two or three inches from one another, and each kind separately or in pots, plunged in the earth of the bed. After the plants have come up, they will require plenty of free air and moderate watering; and when they have acquired the height of two or three inches, they must be gradually hardened to bear the open air, by taking the lights entirely off in mild warm days. Instead of hotbed frames and lights, oil-paper frames, or hand-glasses, may be made use of. The plants raised now will be fit for transplanting into the flower border in May. If hardy annuals were not sown last month, they may be sown any time during the present.\n\nCuttings of double chrysanthemums which were planted last autumn in pots or boxes, should be planted out into pots or flower borders if mild weather prevails. Auricula plants in pots should be protected from rain and frost, and should still be kept covered with hoop arches, over which mats may be occasionally thrown, for should they be exposed to much rain or severe weather now when their flower-stalks begin to advance, the future bloom might be injured. Keep the pots clear of weeds, and give them a little water in dry weather, or expose them to a gentle shower. If the pots received no fresh earth last month, let them receive some now.\n\nLet the hoops mentioned the two preceding months still continue over the beds of tulips, hyacinths, ranunculus, &c., for if severe weather occurs, the beds must be protected by a covering of mats, as already mentioned. See January. When the stalks of hyacinths, particularly double ones, have advanced almost to their full height, they are apt to be borne down by the weight of their own flowers, therefore a neat small stick ought to be fixed in the ground close to every plant, to which the flowerstalks should be fastened by a piece of bals or other soft ligature.\n\nRanunculuses and anemones may still be planted; they will succeed the early ones, and flower in June and July.\n\nTowards the end of the month, seeds of biennial and perennial flowers may be sown, such as carnations, nials, &c., pinks, sweetwilliams, wallflowers, and stock. July flowers of all sorts, also rose campion, catchfly, scarlet lychnis, cumbines, Greek valerian, polyanthus, auriculas, scabiouses, and Canterbury bells; likewise hollyhocks, French honeyfuckles, rockets, honesty or satin flower, tree primrose, shrubby mallow, broad-leaved campanula, foxglove, snapdragon or frogmouth, &c.\n\nBiennial and perennial plants may likewise be transplanted at this season.\n\nTrees and shrubs, both deciduous and evergreen, may still be planted; but that work should be finished before the end of the month.\n\nSect. IV. Nursery.\n\nFruit trees, elms, &c., may be engrafted; and the shoots of trees engrafted last year should be shortened and treated about the time their buds begin to swell, as to leave four or five buds, which will push out branches to form the head. The shoots of last year's growth of trees budded the preceding summer should likewise be shortened, and the heads of trees budded last summer should be cut off about four inches above the bud, which will cause\ncause it to push out vigorously. The part of the stock which is left will serve as a support, to which the young branch may be fixed in the course of the summer to prevent it from being blown out by the wind.\n\nSeeds of hardy trees and shrubs may be sown any time this month, in beds three or four feet wide, which should be well dug, and thoroughly pulverized. The seed may be sown either regularly over the surface of the bed or in drills, and covered in proportion to their size; the acorns and other large seeds to the depth of from an inch and a half to two inches, and the smaller ones from about half an inch to an inch. Some of the more delicate shrubs, such as the arbutus, &c., may be sown in pots or boxes, by which means they will be more easily protected from the severity of the weather in winter.\n\nMost kind of trees and shrubs may be propagated by cuttings this month, particularly vines.\n\nThe vine cuttings must be shoots of last year's growth, about ten or twelve inches long, and each furnished with three buds. If cut from the vines during the winter, before the sap begins to rise, and preserved in dry earth, they will succeed the better. Some leave about an inch of the former year's wood attached to each cutting, but this is unnecessary. They may be planted in rows a foot and a half allunder, and at the distance of eight or ten inches from each other in rows, and so deep as to leave only their uppermost bud above ground; they should afterwards be occasionally watered, and kept clear of weeds. Though cuttings of vines may be raised in the open air, much better plants may be obtained by striking them in a hot-bed or tan-pit in a hot-house. At pruning season select some well-ripened shoots, cut them into pieces of a convenient length, and insert them a little way into pots filled with dry earth, where they may remain till wanted for planting. Protect them in severe, but in mild weather, expose them to the free air.\n\nAbout the beginning of this month, if there is no room in the hot-beds already made, prepare one on purpose, which may be formed and earthened over exactly like a feed-bed for melons. See January. Fill a number of pots, about four inches deep, corresponding to the cuttings you mean to plant, with light rich earth. Take the cuttings you have preserved during the winter; select the roundest and fullest buds; cut the branch about a quarter of an inch above, and about three inches below the bud, with a sharp knife, so as to make a smooth cut, and insert each close by the side of the pot, so deep, that the bud may be covered about a quarter of an inch by the earth of the pot; for it is alleged, that a cutting strikes with greater freedom when placed close to the side than in the middle of the pot. When plants are raised in this manner from a single bud, they seem as if reared from seed. As soon as the cuttings are planted, plunge the pots into the earth of the bed, give them a gentle watering, and put on the glasses. Attention must be paid to the bed, to see that the heat be not too strong, for a moderate bottom heat is all that is necessary. Air should be freely admitted during the day, and even during the night, in mild weather; but when the weather is cold, the beds should be covered with mats during the night, to protect them from frost. The cuttings should likewise be shaded when the sun shines very bright, with mats, and should receive occasional watering. When the plants are about six or eight inches high, they will require to be shifted into larger pots, which must be done cautiously for fear of injuring their roots. Take pots of about six inches deep, and about the same width; put a little good earth into the bottom of each, and turn the cutting out of the small pot into it with the ball of earth as entire as possible, and fill it up with earth. The frames of the beds should be raised in proportion as the plants increase in height, and the heat of the bed renewed by linings of fresh dung when on the decline. Support the shoots when they are about ten or twelve inches high, and pinch off the tendrils and lateral shoots as soon as they appear. They will be fit for planting out in the end of June or beginning of July.\n\nWhen dry weather prevails, give gentle waterings to feeding trees and shrubs, and keep them free from feedings, weeds.\n\nSect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.\n\nThe plants in the green-house should receive air to be freely, unless during wet or frothy weather, and more freely and frequent and plentiful waterings than in the two former months. Dead branches or decayed leaves should be removed, and any of the larger leaved plants that appear foul should have their leaves cleaned with a wet sponge. Those also which require shifting or pruning may be managed as directed last month. Sow seeds and plant cuttings of green-house plants; for which purpose a hot-bed or tan-pit of a hot-house will be necessary at this season.\n\nFine apple plants will require a good deal of warmth, particularly in the tan-pit; as their fruit will now be of pine considerably advanced, they must therefore be kept in a vigorous state of growth, to secure large fruit. If the heat of the tan-bed be not very great, at least one-third of new tan ought to be added. After the tan has been procured, it ought to be spread out and dried a little, and then laid up in a heap, in some shade adjacent to the hot-house, till it begin to ferment. The plants should then be taken from the tan-bed, and a quantity of the decayed tan removed from its surface and sides, to make room for the new, which must be thoroughly mixed with the old; and, as this operation ought to be completed in the course of one day, a sufficient number of hands should be employed to effect it. Both pine apples and other plants in the hot-house should be regularly watered, and have fresh air admitted in bright calm days, from about two hours before till two or three after noon.\n\nApril.\n\nSect. I. Kitchen Garden.\n\nIf the heat begin to decline in the cucumber and melon beds, they should receive linings as directed in the former months; for these plants will not yield fine cumber fruit, or a plentiful crop, if the beds are destitute of proper heat. Air must be admitted every day, and a moderate watering given every four or five days, particularly to cucumbers; but melons should receive it sparingly, especially when their fruits are setting, as much water at that time would prove injurious, and make the fruit drop off. Keep the plants clear of all decayed leaves.\nleaves and decayed male flowers. When the sun shines too bright as to cause the leaves of cucumbers and melons to flag, it will be proper to shade them for two or three hours, during its greatest heat, with a thin mat or a little loose hay, strewed thinly over the glases.\n\nMake hot-beds on which to ridge out cucumbers or melons under hand glases or oiled paper frames. See May.\n\nSow some cabbage, Cilicia, imperial, and large admirable cabbage lettuces any time this month; indeed, some ought to be sown about the beginning, middle, and towards the end of the month, to secure a regular succession. Should the lettuces that were sown last month or in February stand too thick, they may be thinned out and transplanted at the distance of about ten inches from each other, and watered occasionally till they take root.\n\nSome early kidney beans, viz. the Battersea, speckled, dun-coloured, and Canterbury dwarfs, may be planted towards the end of the month, in a well-sheltered situation, exposed to the south, in drills two feet or two feet and a half asunder, and about two inches from each other in the drills. The tall running kinds should not be planted till next month.\n\nSome of the cabbage and savoy plants, which were sown in February and March, should be thinned and transplanted, when their leaves are about two inches broad, into beds, to gain strength before their final transplantation; and those which have stood the winter may be planted out for good.\n\nCauliflower plants under bell or hand glases should have some earth drawn up about their stems, and should be exposed to the open air during the day in good weather. Those sown last month should be planted out into beds in the open air, or into slight hot-beds, to forward their growth. Some of the strongest of the plants raised in the early part of spring may be planted out at the end of the month, at the distance of two or two feet and a half each way from one another, and should be occasionally watered till they are well rooted.\n\nYoung plants of broccoli, which were sown last month, may be planted out at the distance of two or three inches from one another, to acquire strength for final transplantation; and some seed of the early purple, late purple, and cauliflower broccoli, may be sown to raise plants for transplanting in June. Some plants of last year's sowing, which produced heads this spring, should be allowed to remain for seed, which will ripen in August.\n\nSect. II. Fruit Garden.\n\nIn late seasons, pear, plum, and cherry trees may still be planted, and even apricot, peach, and nectarine; but it should be done as early in the month as possible, for if any of these have advanced much in growth before they are transplanted, they will not push freely in the course of the summer, and will be liable to be injured by drought. Where pruning has been neglected, it may still be done, but the sooner the better, for many fruit trees will now be in flower.\n\nFruit trees in flower should still be protected in cold weather. See March. All ill-placed shoots should be rubbed off, and the young fruit on apricot trees where set too thick should be thinned.\n\nLook over the vines trained on walls about the end of the month, and rub off the young shoots which proceed from the old wood, unless they happen to be situated where a supply of young wood is wanted; likewise where two shoots proceed from the same eye on branches of last year's growth, let the weakest be rubbed off. Stakes should be placed beside the vines in the vineyard, to which they should be tied, and the ground between the rows should be kept perfectly free from weeds.\n\nThe vine was introduced by the Romans into Britain, and appears formerly to have been very common. From the name of vineyard yet adhering to the ruinous sites of our castles and monasteries there seem to have been few in the country but what had a vineyard. The county of Gloucester is particularly commended by Malmesbury in the twelfth century, as excelling all the rest of the kingdom in the number and goodness of its vineyards. In the earlier periods of our history the Isle of Ely was expressly denominated the Isle of Vines by the Normans. Vineyards are frequently noticed in the descriptive accounts of Doomsday; and those of England are even mentioned by Bede as early as the commencement of the eighth century.\n\nDoomsday book exhibits to us a particular proof that wine was made in England during the period preceding the conquest. And after the conquest, the bishop of Ely appears to have received at least three or four tons annually, as tythes from the produce of the vineyards in his diocese, and to have made frequent reservations in his leases of a certain quantity of wine for rent. Dr Thomas, the late dean of Ely, gives the following extracts from the archives of that church.\n\n| Item                          | \u00a3  | s. | d. |\n|-------------------------------|----|----|----|\n| Exitus vineti                 | 2  | 15 | 3  |\n| Ditto vineae                  | 10 | 12 | 2  |\n| Ten bushels of grapes from the vineyard | 0  | 7  | 6  |\n| Seven dolia multi from the vineyard, 12th Edward II. | 15 | 1  | 0  |\n| Wine sold for                 | 1  | 12 | 0  |\n| Verjuice                      | 1  | 7  |    |\n| One dolium and one pipe filled with new wine, and suppos'd at Ely.

Maddocks in his history of the Exchequer, i. 364, says that the sheriffs of Northamptonshire and Leicestershire, were allowed their account, for the livery of the king's vinedresser at Rockingham, and for necessaries for the vineyard. A piece of land in London, now forming East Smithfield and some adjoining streets, was withheld from the religious house within Aldgate by four successive constables of the Tower, in the reigns of Rufus, Henry, and Stephen, and made by them into a vineyard, to their great emolument. In the old accounts of rectorial and vicarial revenues, and in the old registers of ecclesiastical suits concerning them, the\nthe tithe of wine is an article that frequently occurs in Kent, Surry, and other counties. And the wines of Gloucestershire within a century after the conquest were little inferior to the French in sweetness. It is alleged that a black grape very similar to the black mullein was introduced from Gaul into Britain, about the middle of the third century. To these proofs of the antiquity of vineyards in Britain, we shall add the following account of the vineyard at Painshill, Surry, (the most extensive one at present in England), given by the original proprietor, the honourable Charles Hamilton, to Sir Edward Barry, and published in his treatise on wines, p. 468.\n\n\"The vineyard at Pains-hill is situated on the fourth side of a gentle hill, the soil a gravelly sand; it is planted entirely with two kinds of Burgundy grapes, the Auvernat, which is the most delicate, but the tenderest; and the Miller grape, commonly called the black cluter, which is more hardy. The first year I attempted to make red wine in the usual way, by treading the grapes, then letting them ferment in a vat, till all the husks and impurities formed a thick crust at the top; the boiling ceased, and clear wine was drawn off from the bottom. This essay did not answer; the wine was so very harsh and astringent, that I despaired of ever making red wine fit to drink; but through that hardship I perceived a flavour something like that of some small French white wines, which made me hope I should succeed better with white wine. That experiment succeeded far beyond my most sanguine expectation; for the very first year I made white wine, it nearly resembled the flavour of Champagne; and in two or three years more, as the vines grew stronger, to my great amazement my wine had a finer flavour than the best Champagne I ever tasted. The first running was as clear as spirits; the second was eau de perdris; and both of them sparkled and creamed in the glass like Champagne. It would be endless to mention how many great judges of wine were deceived by my wine, and thought it superior to any Champagne they ever drank; but such is the prejudice of most people against any thing of English growth, I generally found it most prudent not to declare where it grew, till after they had passed their verdict upon it. The surest proof I can give of its excellence is, that I have sold it to wine merchants for fifty guineas a hogshead; and one wine merchant to whom I sold five hundred pounds worth at one time assured me, he sold some of the best of it from 7s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. per bottle. After many years experience, the best method I found of making and managing it was this: I let the grapes hang till they had got all the maturity the season would give them; then they were carefully cut off with scissors, and brought home to the wine barn, in small quantities, to prevent their heating, or pressing one another; then they were all picked off the stalks, and all the mouldy or green ones were discarded, before they were put upon the press; where they were all pressed in a few hours after they were gathered; much would run from them, before the press squeezed them, from their own weight one upon another. This running was as clear as water, and sweet as syrup; and all this of the first pressing, and part of the second continued white; the other pressings grew redish, and were not mixed with the best. As fast as the wine run from the press into a large receiver, it was put into the hogsheads, and closely bunged up. In a few hours one would hear the fermentation begin, which would soon burst the casks, if not guarded against, by hooping them strongly with iron, and securing them in strong wooden frames, and the heads with wedges. In the height of fermentation, I have frequently seen the wine oozing through the pores of the staves. The hogsheads were left all the depth of winter in the cold barn, to reap the benefit of the frosts. When the fermentation was over, which was easily discovered by the cessation of noise and oozing, but to be more certain, by pegging the cask, when it would be quite clear, then it was racked off into clean hogsheads, and carried to the vaults, before any warmth of weather could raise a second fermentation. In March, the hogsheads were examined; if any were not quite fine, they were fined down with common fish glue in the usual manner; those that were fine of themselves were not fined down, and all were bottled about the end of March; and in about six weeks more would be in perfect order for drinking, and would be in their prime for above one year; but the second year the flavour and sweetness would abate, and would gradually decline, till at last it lost all flavour and sweetness; and some that I kept fifteen years became so like old hock, that it might pass for such to one who was not a perfect connoisseur. The only art I ever used to it, was putting three pounds of white sugar candy to some of the hogsheads, when the wine was first tunned from the press, in order to conform to a rage that prevailed, to drink none but very sweet Champagne. I am convinced much good wine might be made in many parts of the south of England. Many parts are south of Pains-hill; many soils may be yet fitter for it; and many situations must be so; for mine was much exposed to the south west wind (the worst of all for vines), and the declivity was rather too steep; yet with these disadvantages it succeeded many years. Indeed the uncertainty of our climate is against it, and many fine crops have been spoiled by May frosts and wet summers; but one good year balances many disappointments.\"\n\nIn a dissertation on the growth of wine in England by F. X. Vilper, printed at Bath 1786, there is a method of training vines along the surface of the ground proposed, which seems well adapted to the northerly climate of Britain, for which the Rev. M. L. Broeg obtained a patent. Mr Vilper acknowledges, that he took the first hint from the following passage, from Lord Chancellor Bacon: \"The loveliness of the fruit boughs makes the fruit greater, and causes it to ripen better; for we always see in apricots, peaches, and melon-cottens upon a wall, the largest fruit is towards the bottom; and in France, the grapes that make the wine grow upon low vines bound to small stakes, while the raised vines in arbours make verjuice.\" He adds \"It is reported, that in some places vines are suffered to grow like herbs, spreading upon the ground, and the grapes of these vines are very large; it were proper to try whether plants usually sustained by props, will not bear large leaves and fruit if laid along the ground.\"\nSect. III. The Flower Garden, or Pleasure Ground.\n\nSow and transplant tender annuals. See February and March. Protect hyacinths, ranunculuses, and anemones, planted in beds, from heavy rain and frost, as directed in January and February; likewise, when they are in flower, from very bright sunshine, from about two hours before till two or three after noon; but in this case the covering should be raised a considerable height, to admit air, and allow them to be viewed.\n\nPlant tuberous in a hot-bed or hot-house, and give them but little water till they have come above ground.\n\nEvergreen shrubs and trees may still be planted, but the earlier in the month the better.\n\nGrafs walks and lawns should be poled, rolled, and mown. Gravel walks may be broken up and turned.\n\nSect. IV. Nursery.\n\nLook over newly engrafted trees, and see if the clay keeps close about the grafts, as it is apt to crack and fall off; when you find it any way defective so as admit the air and rain to the graft, then remove it and apply fresh clay in its stead. All shoots which rise from the stalk below the graft must be taken off whenever they are produced; for if permitted to remain, they would rob the graft of nourishment, and prevent it shooting freely.\n\nTrees that were budded last year, will now begin to push out their first shoots. Should they be infested with insects, so as to cause any of their leaves to curl, these should be picked off, and pains taken to destroy the vermin. Shoots that proceed from the stock under the bud must be rubbed off as soon as they appear.\n\nThe sowing and transplanting of young trees and shrubs from the seed bed, or where they stand too thick, should be finished early in the month, and if very dry weather prevail, water should be given to seed-beds, cuttings, and lately transplanted trees and shrubs.\n\nSect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.\n\nAir may be admitted, and water given more freely than in the former months, because the plants will begin now to advance in growth; but in general the management must be nearly the same as recommended last month.\n\nA proper degree of warmth, both in the bark bed and in the air of the hot-house, is requisite for fruiting pine apple plants. Water may be more frequently given, and air admitted more freely, because the weather will be milder; and in other respects they must be managed as directed in March. The succession pine apple plants, or such as are to fruit next year should be shifted into larger pots, (viz. 24s.) the size commonly made use of. When the plants are healthy, they should be turned out of the pots with the ball of earth about their roots as entire as possible, and put them into larger ones with an additional quantity of fresh earth; but should the plants be sickly, infested with insects, or appear to have bad roots, the whole of the earth should be shaken off, and the roots trimmed, a few of the under leaves stripped off the stem, and the plants then put into pots filled entirely with fresh earth.\n\nAfter the plants have been thus shifted, they should have a moderate quantity of water given them frequently, which will promote their growth. The young pine apple plants which were raised from suckers or crowns last season should likewise be shifted into larger pots, if their roots appear to have filled those in which they have stood during the winter: if healthy, they should be turned out of the pots with the ball of earth entire; if otherwise, they must be treated like the succession plants as above.\n\nThis is a proper season for propagating hot-house plants by cuttings, layers, &c. or for sowing their seeds, hot-house cuttings of green-house plants may likewise be struck in the bark bed of the hot-house, and kept there till fit for transplanting.","sp":53,"ep":58},{"h":"GARDENING","t":"July. Fruit Garden, &c.\n\nSome white and Batavian may likewise be sown. Some kidney-beans, of the dwarf kind, should be sown for a late crop. Some turnip-rooted or Spanish radish may be sown, and managed exactly like turnip: there are two kinds, the black and the white; both of which are very hardy, and stand the winter well.\n\nSome peas and beans may be sown when a late crop is wanted.\n\nAs artichokes now advance to maturity, those who prefer one large head to two or three smaller ones, ought to cut off all the lateral heads from the stalks, before they exceed the size of a hen's egg; which will promote the growth of the principal head. It is a common practice to break down the stalks of artichokes near the ground, as soon as their heads have been cut for the table, to make them push more vigorously from the root.\n\nIf the stalks of onions, garlic, and shallot, begin to decay, which is sometimes the case about the end of this month, they should be pulled up and dried. See AUGUST.\n\nSect. II. Fruit Garden.\n\nAs fruits advance to maturity, wall trees should be protected from birds by nets; and means should be taken to destroy snails, wasps, and other insects.\n\nSect. III. Flower Garden, or Pleasure Ground.\n\nSome tender annuals may be planted out into the flower borders in the open air.\n\nSeedling auriculas and polyanthus may be planted out, into a border not exposed to the midday sun, at the distance of two inches from one another, and watered occasionally.\n\nSect. IV. Nursery.\n\nInoculate apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, and pears; the first four are commonly inoculated on plum stocks, the last on pear or quince stocks. Inoculating or budding, as it is termed, may be performed on many other trees, and shrubs; the method of performing it is as follows.\n\nWith a budding knife, which resembles a penknife, with a flat handle, make a horizontal cut at some smooth part quite through the bark of the stock, from the middle of which make a perpendicular cut downwards, about two inches in length, so as to form a figure resembling the letter T. Take a young shoot of the tree, with which you intend to inoculate, cut off the leaves from its lower extremity, leaving a small part of the footstalk of each, then, about an inch under the lowest bud, make a cross cut in the shoot almost halfway through, with the knife slanting upwards, and with a clean cut, bring it out about half an inch above the bud, detaching part both of the wood and bark containing the bud. Separate the small piece of the wood which was taken off along with the bud, from the bark, which is readily done with your knife, placing the point of it between the bark and wood at one end; then examine the inside of the bark, to see if the internal eye of the bud be left; for if there appears a small hole, the eye is gone with the wood, and the bud becomes useless; but if no hole appears, the bud is good, and may be inserted into the stock, by raising the bark with the handle of the budding knife on each side of the perpendicular cut, immediately under the cross cut. If the piece of bark which contains the bud be too long for the incision made in the stock, it should be reduced to a proper length with the knife, and introduced between the bark and wood of the stock, and placed so as to make the bud project through the perpendicular cut. Having fixed the bud, and placed the bark of the stock closely about it, put a bandage of mat, which should be previously steeped in water to increase its tenacity, round the stock, which should extend from a little below to a little above the incision; taking care that none of the folds of the bandage cover the bud.\n\nIn three weeks or a month after the inoculation has been performed, the buds will have united with the stock, which is discoverable by the bud appearing plump; the bandages should then be removed: were they to remain, they would cramp the buds and injure them. The incisions should be made in the stocks, about six inches above ground, when dwarf trees are wanted; and at the height of five feet, when standards are to be inoculated: the buds remain dormant, and require no further attention till next spring; when they begin to push out, the heads of the stalks should be cut off.\n\nSeedling pines, where they stand too thick in the feed-bed, may be transplanted; but great care must be taken to water them and shade them from the sun.\n\nSect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.\n\nGreen-house plants require a plentiful supply of water at this season. If the fruit have set too thick on orange or lemon trees, they should be thinned, otherwise they will not acquire a proper size.\n\nAs many of the pines will ripen their fruit in the course of this month, it is a proper time to begin to propagate these plants, which is done by planting the crowns that are produced at the top of the fruit, and the suckers which proceed from the root of the plants, about the time the fruit is ripe, or soon after they are cut.\n\nThese suckers or crowns, if properly managed, will produce fruit in two years, and then decay. Each fruit is surmounted by at least one crown, which frequently has a number of offsets at its base; and each plant, after it has produced fruit, throws out from its root one or more suckers before it decays. The crowns, when they are separated from the fruit, must lie five or six days in some dry place, till the part which was attached to the fruit is completely dried, before they are fit for planting. The suckers which proceed from the root of the plant should be taken off, when they have acquired the length of five or six inches, and when their lower extremity has become brown; they must likewise lie in some dry situation for a few days, till the part by which they were connected with the root of the parent plant be thoroughly dried. Put each crown or sucker into a small pot, filled with light rich earth, and plunge them in the bark-bed of a hot-house, or in a hot-bed made on purpose.\n\nA method of raising pine apples in water is given by William Bastard, Esq. of Devonshire, in the 67th vol. of RAISING PINE APPLES IN WATER.\nlume of the Philosophical Transactions. His account of this method is as follows:\n\n\"In the front part of the house, and indeed anywhere in the lowest parts of it, the pine-apple plants will not thrive well in water. The way in which I treat them is as follows:\u2014I place a shelf near the highest part of the back wall, so that the pine apples may stand without absolutely touching, but as near as can be; on this shelf I place pans full of water, about seven or eight inches deep; and in these pans I put the pine-apple plants, growing in the same pots of earth as they are generally planted in, to be plunged into the bark-bed in the common way; that is, I put the pot of earth, with the pine plant in it, in the pan full of water, and as the water decreases I constantly fill up the pan. I place either plants in fruit, or young plants, as soon as they are well rooted, in these pans of water, and find they thrive equally well: the fruit reared this way is always much larger, as well as better flavoured, than when ripened in the bark-bed. I have more than once put only the plants themselves without any earth, I mean after they had roots, into these pans of water, with only water sufficient to keep the roots always covered, and found them flourish beyond expectation. In my house the shelf I mention is supported by irons from the top; and there is an intervening space of about ten inches between the back wall and the shelf. A neighbour of mine has placed a leaden cistern upon the top of the back flue, in which, as it is in contact with the flue, the water is always warm when there is fire in the house, and finds his fruit excellent and large. My shelf does not touch the back flue, but is about a foot above it; and, consequently, the water is only warmed by the air in the house. Both these methods do well. The way I account for this success is, that the warm air, always ascending to the part where the shelf is placed, as being the highest part of the house, keeps it much hotter than in any other part. The temperature at that place is, I believe, seldom less than what is indicated by the 73\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and when the sun shines it is often above 100\u00b0; the water the plants grow in seems to enable them to bear the greatest heat, if sufficient air be allowed; and I often see the roots of plants growing out of the holes in the bottom of the pot of earth, and shooting vigorously in the water.\n\n\"My hot-house, the dimensions of which it may be proper to know, is 60 feet long, and 11 feet wide, the flues included; five feet high in the front, and 11 feet at the back of the inside of the house. It is warmed by two fires. A leaden trough or cistern on the top of the back flue is preferable to my shelf; as in it the pine plants grow much faster in the winter, the water being always warmed by the flue. Of this I have seen great benefits these last two months in my neighbourhood.\n\n\"It is not foreign to this purpose to mention, that as a person was moving a large pine plant from the hot-bed in my house last summer, which plant was just flowering fruit, by some accident he broke off the plant just above the earth in which it grew, and there was no root whatever left to it. By way of experiment, I took the plant, and fixed it upright in a pan of water, without any earth whatever, in the shelf; it there soon threw out roots, and bore a pine apple that weighed upwards of two pounds.\"\n\n1. The bromelia ananas, of which there are six varieties: 1. Ovalis, or oval-shaped pine apple. 2. Pyramidalis (pyramidal), or sugar-loaf pine. 3. Glaber, with smooth leaves. 4. Lucida, with thinning green leaves. 5. Serotinus, with a yellowish-coloured leaf. 6. Viridis, or green pine apple.\n\nThe first sort of ananas is the most common in Europe; apple, but the second sort is much preferable to it, the fruit of this being larger and much better flavoured; the juice of this sort is not so alluring as that of the first; so that this fruit may be eaten in greater quantity, with less danger. This sort frequently produces suckers immediately under the fruit, whereby it may be increased much better than the common sort; so that in a few years it may be the best common sort in Britain.\n\nThe third sort is preferred for curiosity by way of variety; but the fruit is not worth anything.\n\nThe sort with very smooth green leaves, was raised from seeds taken out of a rotten fruit, which came from the West Indies to the late Henry Heathcote, Esq. from whom Mr Millar received one plant, which produced large fruit: this is what the people of America call the king pine.","sp":61,"ep":62},{"h":"GARDENING","t":"August.\n\nFruit Garden.\n\nPlant out broccoli, favoys, bore-cole, and celery, for the use of winter and spring.\n\nThe cardoons which were planted in June should have some earth laid up to their stems, to blanch them and render them fit for the table. That this may be accomplished the more easily, tie up the leaves of each plant, with a piece of bals mat or small straw rope, and apply some earth close round the stem, which earthing must be repeated at intervals, till it rise to the height of two feet.\n\nThe principal crops of onions will be fit for taking up in the course of this month. Choose a dry day for taking them up; take off the stalks within two or three inches of the bulb; spread them in some dry place, exposed to the sunshine, for 10 or 12 days, that they may be thoroughly dried.\n\nSect. II. Fruit Garden.\n\nLook over vines, figs, and other wall trees; remove all foreright and superfluous branches, and nail the others close into the wall, that the rays of the sun may have free access to the fruit.\n\nVines in the vineyard likewise should be fixed to the stakes, and cleared of all superfluous shoots.\n\nSect. III. Flower Garden or Pleasure Ground.\n\nAbout the end of the month, you may propagate by slips, fibrous-rooted perennial plants, such as double rose campion, catchfly, double scarlet lychnis, double rocket, double ragged robin, bachelor's button, gentianella, polyanthus, auriculas, double daisies, &c. As these plants frequently grow in tufts, they may be taken up and divided, taking care that every slip be provided with some roots.\n\nAuricula plants in pots should receive fresh earth.\n\nAuricula and polyanthus feed may be sown any time this month, but will not come up till spring.\n\nLayers of carnations, double sweetwilliams, and pinks, that are properly rooted, may be separated from the parent plant, and planted into borders or pots.\n\nCuttings and pipings of pinks and carnations, may be planted out into beds or borders.\n\nTowards the end of the month the seeds of bulbous-rooted flowers, such as tulips, hyacinths, narcissus, iris, crocus, fritillaria, crown imperial, lilies, and snowdrops; likewise, the seeds of anemone, ranunculus, and cyclamen, may be sown in beds or boxes, to obtain new varieties. They must be protected during winter from the frost; and when they appear above ground in spring, they must be kept clear of weeds.\n\nPlant out feeding biennials and perennials.\n\nAbout the end of this month hedges should receive their second clipping.\n\nSect. IV. Nursery.\n\nBudding may still be performed about the beginning of the month, and those trees which were budded three weeks or a month ago, should be examined. If the buds remain plump and fresh, there is reason to believe that they have succeeded; in that case the bandages must be loosened.\n\nSect. V. Greenhouse and Hot-house.\n\nGreenhouse plants, in the open air, must be managed as already directed.\n\nThe plants in the hot-house must receive a plentiful allowance of air and water.\n\nSuccession pine-apple plants, that are to produce fruit next year, should be shifted into larger pots, viz twenty-fours or sixteens, about the beginning of the month. The plants should be turned out of the old pots and placed in the new ones, a quantity of light rich earth being previously put into the bottom of each. Each pot should then be filled with some of the same earth, watered, and plunged into the tan, which, at the same time, should be turned over and receive an addition of about one-third of fresh tan.\n\nSeptember.\n\nSect. I. Kitchen Garden.\n\nPlant some brown Dutch, cos, and common cabbage lettuce, in a well-sheltered situation, exposed to the mid-day sun, to be covered with hot-bed frames and glases, which should not be put over them till some time next month.\n\nPlant out from the seed-bed the cauliflowers that were sown last month, into well-sheltered borders, at flowers, the distance of three or four inches from one another, taking care not to plant them so deep as to cover their hearts with earth. These plants may be either planted out again next month under garden frames, bell or hand-glases, to stand during the winter, or may remain where planted.\n\nPlant broccoli, favoys, bore-cole, celery, and endive.\n\nEarth up celery and cardoons.\n\nTie up the leaves of endive with a piece of bals mat, or something of that nature, to blanch them, and prepare them for the table.\n\nMushroom beds may be formed any time this month, as spawn will very easily be procured during August, of September, or October. The spawn has the appearance of a white mould shooting out in strings, which, when bruised, smells like mushrooms. It may be obtained either from old mushroom beds, old hot-beds, or dung hills that are principally composed of horse dung, and from pasture fields, indeed in any place where horse or sheep's dung has lain for some time undisturbed and not exposed to much moisture; and may be preserved for a considerable length of time, in a proper state for using. If spawn is not otherwise to be procured, some may be produced by laying a quantity of horse dung and rich earth in alternate layers, and covered with straw to exclude the rain and air; for the more these are excluded, the sooner the spawn will appear, which commonly happens in about two months after the dung and earth have been laid together. Mushroom beds should be formed of dung that has been spread out for some time, without having been fermented, and may be made two or three feet broad, and of any length. A stratum of dung about a foot thick, should be laid first, which should be covered with rich earth to the depth of about four inches, then ano-\nSeptember. ther stratum of dung about ten inches thick, which should be covered like the former; a third stratum of dung may be laid and covered with earth like the two former. The whole should be made to grow narrower as it advances in height, and formed into a ridge resembling the roof of a house. When the bed is finished it should be covered with straw, to exclude the rain, and to prevent the bed from being dried by the sun or wind, in which situation it should remain eight or ten days, when the bed will be in a proper temperature of warmth to receive the spawn. The spawn should be placed in lumps four or five inches asunder, in the sloping sides of the bed, and covered with a little rich earth; the whole must then be covered with a thick coat of straw. When these beds are made in spring or autumn, as the weather in those months is temperate, the spawn will take soon, and the mushrooms will appear in about a month after the bed has been made; but when these are made in winter, when the weather is cold, or even in summer when the weather is very hot, a much longer time will elapse. The principal thing to be attended to, in the management of these beds, is to preserve them in a proper degree of moisture and warmth. Therefore, when the weather is very cold or very wet, care must be taken to apply a thick covering of dry straw, and when the bed appears dry, a gentle watering must be given.\n\n**Sect. II. Fruit Garden.**\n\nWhere any fruit, particularly grapes, are shaded with leaves, pains should be taken to expose them to the rays of the sun, that they may acquire proper flavour, likewise when the clusters are entangled, they should be disengaged, that each may have the benefit of the sun and air.\n\nStrawberries may be planted any time this month when the weather is showery. If rain should not fall towards the beginning of the month, the transplanting should be deferred, otherwise they must be watered occasionally, for some time after they are planted. If any were planted into beds in June, they will be in excellent condition for planting out now; but if none were planted out then, the best rooted plants produced at the joints of the runners, or offsets from the old plants, should be chosen, and planted at the distance of a foot or 15 inches from one another, either in beds, about four feet wide, or in rows along the borders. Most kinds of strawberries succeed best in an open situation, but the wood strawberry may be planted under the shade of trees or bushes.\n\nThe principal kinds of strawberries, are, the scarlet or Virginian, white wood, green wood, red wood, large white wood, hautboy strawberry, large globe hautboy, oblong hautboy, royal hautboy, green hautboy, Chili strawberry, globe Chili, fugar-loaf Chili, pine-apple Chili, Bath Chili, Carolina Chili, white Carolina Chili, Devonshire Chili, Royal Chili, Dutch Chili, Alpine or prolific, which produces fruit from June to November, red Alpine, white Alpine, scarlet Alpine, pine-apple strawberry, red, white, and green.\n\nAbout the end of the month, most of the late pears and apples will be fit for taking down, to be laid up for keeping. See October.\n\n**Sect. III. Flower Garden or Pleasure Ground.**\n\nTransplant and propagate fibrous-rooted perennial plants by slips.\n\nTowards the end of the month, hyacinths, tulips, and other bulbs, may be planted. See October.\n\n**Sect. IV. Nursery.**\n\nTransplant evergreens towards the end of the month, such as Portugal laurels, laurustinus, arbutus, &c.\n\nBoth evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs may be propagated by layers or cuttings about the end of the month.\n\n**Sect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.**\n\nAbout the end of the month, if the weather be cold, orange and lemon trees, and many of the tenderer kinds of greenhouse plants, should be removed into the house.\n\nAbout the end of this month or beginning of next, the tan-bed in the hot-house should be refreshed with a quantity of new tan, one half or two thirds according as the old tan may be more or less decayed.\n\n**October.**\n\n**Sect. I. Kitchen Garden.**\n\nPlant out some of the lettuces that were raised in August, into a well sheltered border or into a hot-bed frame to supply the table during winter and spring. Cauliflower plants that were planted out last month from the seedbed, may now be planted under hot-bed frames, at the distance of about four inches from one another, or under bell or hand glases. Four or five plants may be put under each hand glass, all of which (should they survive the winter) may again be planted out in the spring, except one, or at most two, of the strongest, which should be allowed to remain and produce heads. See February.\n\nPropagate aromatic vegetables by slips, such as thyme, mint, balm, sage, &c.\n\nAsparagus beds should receive their winter dressing, i.e. their stalks should be cut down, and the alleys be raked between the beds should be dug, and a little of the earth from the alleys spread over the surface of each bed. Asparagus beds require some dung once every two years, which should be applied at this season. Before the alleys are dug, a little well rotten dung should be spread over the surface of the beds, dug in with a fork, and covered with a little of the earth from the alleys. Where forced asparagus is required early in winter, a hot-bed may be made any time this month. See January.\n\nPlant some early Mazagan beans, and hotspur peas about the end of the month, to stand the winter, and produce a crop early in summer.\n\n**Sect. II. Fruit Garden.**\n\nWinter pears and apples should in general be gathered this month. Some will be fit to take down the winter apples.\nbeginning of the month, others will not be ready before the middle, or towards the end. To know when the fruits have had their full growth, some of them should be tried in different parts of the tree, by turning them gently upwards; if they quit the tree early, it is a sign of maturity, and time to gather them. But none of the more delicate eating pears should be permitted to hang longer on the trees than the middle of the month, especially if the nights prove frothy; for if they are once touched with the frost, it will occasion many of them to rot before they are fit for the table: and therefore, in general, let neither apples nor pears remain longer on the trees than the middle or the end of this month, for they will not improve by hanging on the trees after that time. The best apples and pears which are intended for long keeping, should be taken down one by one, on a dry day, and carefully put into baskets, to be carried to the fruiterry, or place where they are to be stored up. The fruit themselves should be dry when taken down from the trees, therefore should not be gathered too early in the morning, before the dew on their surface has evaporated. They should be laid in a heap for ten days or a fortnight, that their watery juices may transpire; each should then be thoroughly dried with a cloth, and laid on the shelves of the fruiterry, or in boxes or hampers well covered with dry straw or hay.\n\nAbout the end of the month, apricots, peaches, and nectarines may be pruned. See January.\n\nAll sorts of fruit trees may be planted, such as apricots, peaches, nectarines, plums, cherries, apples, pears, quinces, vines, figs, mulberries, medlars, services, filberts, &c. The ground for this purpose should be trenched to the depth of one or two spades, and should be well manured. If the borders on which the fruit trees are to be planted have not a sufficient depth of soil, a quantity of good earth may be added. Peaches, nectarines, apricots, plums, and cherries, are commonly planted at the distance of about fifteen feet from one another. Pears and apples when grafted on dwarf stocks may be planted about the same distance, but those which are on free stocks, about eighteen or twenty feet. Cherries and plums for standards should be planted at the distance of twenty or twenty-five feet from one another. Apples and pears, on free stocks, should be planted in rows, thirty or forty feet asunder, and at the distance of twenty-five or thirty feet from one another in the row. Dwarf apples and pears, however, may be planted at less than half that distance.\n\nThe principal kinds of apricots are, the early mucedine, Turkey, Brussels, Roman, Breda, orange, Algiers, royal, Moor-park, alberget, transparent, Dunmore, or apricot peach, and Portugal.\n\nThe principal sorts of peaches are, the red magdalen, white magdalen, red nutmeg, white nutmeg, noblets, early Newington, old Newington, great French mignone, small mignone, admirable chancellor, Millet's mignone, incomparable, violet native, purple native, Royal George, Montauban, teton de Venus, round transparent, Catharine, and bloody peach.\n\nThe principal kinds of nectarines are, early nutmeg, Newington, red, Roman, violet, violet, musk, golden, scarlet, Elrige, Temple, Murray, Brugnon, white Italian.\n\nThe principal sorts of plums are, the Primordan or early white, Precoce or early black, early Morocco, Orleans, green gage, la royale, damas de Tour, damas violette, white bonum magnum or egg plum, red bonum magnum or Imperial, Perdrigron white, Perdrigron violet, Monfieur plum, drap d'or, royal dauphin, Fotheringham, azure native, or early blue gage, queen mother, myrobalan, apricot plum, red, white, diapree, Monfieur native, Roche carbon, Jaune native, groffe queen Claude, petite queen Claude, imperiale violette or blue imperial, petite mirabile, damas muleque, diapree noire, diapree violette, imperatrice blanche or white emprefs, imperatrice noire or late black, Spanish damas, damas of September, St Catharine, common damson, Bullace.\n\nThe principal kinds of cherries are, the early May, May-duke, arch-duke, Harrifon's duke, white heart, black heart, bleeding heart, Adams's crown heart, Hertfordshire heart, ox heart, Turkey, carnation, amber, Kentish or Flemish, Portugal, morella, white crofian, black coroun, small black guigne or geen, small red guigne, small red wild black of the woods and hedges, ditto red.\n\nThe principal kinds of apples are, the common cod-apples, lin, Kentish codlin, Dutch codlin, Margaret, golden pippin, gold rennet, Holland pippin, Kentish pippin, nonpareil, royal rufset, Wheeler's rufset, golden rufset, gray rufset, winter pearmain, scarlet pearmain, Loan's pearmain, aromatic rufset, pomme d'Appis, Newton pippin, English rennet, autumn rennet, winter queening, margille, nonefuch, gray Leadington, Marcat, tender rennet, kitchen rennet, large white, Italian, Spanish rennet, Canada rennet, groffe rennet de Normandie, Fearns pippin, white French rennet, clutter pearmain, lemon pippin, French pippin, winter greening, winter pippin, Flanders pippin, white coffin, Kirton pippin, stone pippin, couperdu, or hanging body, couperdu red, rambour summer, rambour winter, rennet grife, French rennet, cat's head, leathercoat, ruflet of winter, pomme de gel\u00e9e, Siberian crab, American cherry crab, two years apple hanging on the trees, if permitted, till the second year.\n\nThe principal kinds of pears are, the green miffal, Pearcatharine, jargonelle, cuisse madame, Windsor chamontelle, creflane, echaferie, graffe blanquette, beure de rois, white beure, winter beure, colmar, St Germain, lent St Germain, Martinnee, graffe nuifac, autumn nuifac, orange bergamot, Hambden's bergamot, red beure, golden beure, brown beure, great roufflelet, petit roufflelet, Holland bergamot, verte longue, winter bonchreien, summer ditto, Spanish ditto, Meffieur Jean, Green sugar, la marquis, fwan egg, virglefe, Portugal, gray goodwife, citron de carmes, ambrette, royal d'hiver, St Michael, Louise bonne, summer orange, winter orange, Swifs bergamot, devionett.\n\nBaking pears.

See January.\n\nSect. III. Flower Garden, or Pleasure Ground.\n\nBulbous-rooted plants, such as tulips, hyacinths, roots plant-narcissus, jonquils, crocus, dens-canis, crown imperial, sword lily, ixia, Persian and English iris, ranunculus, and anemone, may be planted any time this month, either in beds by themselves, or in flower borders, together with other flowers; but the finer sorts of tulip, hyacinths, ranunculus, and anemone, are commonly planted in beds, six or eight inches distant, and two or three deep.\n\nPlant out deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. The method of planting all these is to open a circular hole, wide enough to receive the roots, and about a spade deep, more or less, according to the length of the roots.\n\nThorn and other hedges may be planted towards the end of this month, or any time in the course of the next.\n\nSect. IV. Nursery.\n\nSow haws, holly berries, hips, barberries, yew-berries, acorns, beech-maids, maple and aln-wood, cherry and plum stones, in a bed about four feet wide. It is a common practice to keep haws and hips, in heaps covered over with earth for twelve months; for those which are sown without this preparation frequently lie a whole year in the seed-bed, without coming above ground. Plant cuttings of laurels and evergreens.\n\nSect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.\n\nThe harder kinds of green-house plants should be all removed into the green-house, when they should have plenty of air, except in very cold or wet weather.\n\nThe succession pine-apple plants should be removed into the fruiting house, which should previously receive a quantity of new tan, as directed last month. The younger succession plants likewise should be moved into the place of those that have been transferred into the fruiting house, air should be given freely in mild weather, and water very moderately.\n\nNovember.\n\nSect. I. Kitchen Garden.\n\nTie up endive for blanching, continue to earth-up cardoons, and dress the plantations of artichokes, i.e., cut down their larger leaves, and lay some earth about the plants, to protect them during winter.\n\nCarrots and parsnips may be taken up, and preserved in sand during the winter.\n\nSome more peas and beans may be sown to succeed those that were sown last month, or to supply their place if they should be cut off by the severity of the weather.\n\nThe best time for pruning vines is immediately after the fall of the leaf, because the greatest possible time in prune vines that way is allowed for healing the wounds. Vines that are cut about the time of the rise of the sap in the spring, are apt to bleed profusely; this happens sometimes even to those that are pruned in the course of the winter. It is a common error, in pruning vines, to allow the branches to grow too close together, particularly in those varieties which grow vigorously, and have very large leaves; for, in summer, when the leaves are fully expanded, they are so much crowded together as to exclude the rays of the sun from the fruit. When pruning is properly performed, the young branches should be left at the distance of from one foot or two feet, and even upwards from one another; but this in a great measure must be regulated by the size of their leaves. The Syrian grape has leaves about a foot and a half broad, with foot-stalks six inches long. The black Hamburgh has leaves twelve or thirteen inches broad, with footstalks seven inches long. The black cluster on the contrary has leaves five inches broad, with foot-stalks three inches long. Blue frontignac and claret grape have leaves six inches broad, with foot-stalks about four inches long. When vines are weakly, each shoot should be shortened so as to leave only three or four eyes; when they are moderately vigorous, each should be left about a foot long. When very vigorous, some of the shoots may be left three or four feet long or more; the shoots of vines, however, that are trained to the rafters of a vinery or pine-floor may be left eighteen or twenty feet long. It has been observed, that both the largest grapes and finest clusters are produced on shoots of a considerable length. When vines have been allowed to run into confusion, much time and pains are requisite to reduce them to regularity; but when they have been trained regularly from the beginning, pruning is easily and expeditiously performed.\n\nIf the following directions for training vines in a Directions vinery be observed, they will easily be kept in order, for training and plentiful crops of good fruit may be expected.\n\nVines may be planted both on the back wall and front of a vinery; those on the back wall should be planted from six to twelve feet asunder, according to the vigour of growth of the particular sort, and in such a position that the two uppermost buds may point east and west; these on the front should be planted so as one may be trained to each rafter. When the vines begin to grow, all the buds except the two uppermost must be rubbed off from those on the back wall, and all except the uppermost from those on the front wall. If any of the plants show fruit the first year, the clusters should be rubbed off, as well as the tendrils and lateral shoots and the principal shoots should be trained regularly to the trellis as they advance in growth. Fires should be put in the vinery during the spring, to encourage an early growth in the vines, that they may have full time to ripen their wood. In the month of June the gla\u00efffes may be taken off altogether, but should be put on again in September, and continued till the fall of the leaf, when the vines should be pruned. The two shoots which each vine on the back-wall was permitted to push, should be cut down to their third or fourth bud, according\nNovember, according as either of them appears fullest and strongest, and then bent down as near as possible to a horizontal position, forming a figure resembling the letter T. Plants in front that are trained to the rafters should be cut down almost to the bottom, and no more left than is merely sufficient to train them to the rafter. Only two shoots should again be permitted to grow on each plant on the back wall, and one on those of the front, and these may be allowed to run the whole height of the house before they are stopped. After the vine shoots are stopped (which is done by pinching off their tops), they will in general push out laterals at three or four eyes, on the upper part of the shoot. These laterals should not entirely be taken off, as it would cause more eyes lower upon the shoots to push out. It would therefore be prudent to permit the first laterals to grow twelve or fourteen inches, and then to pinch off their tops. These laterals, in their turn, will push out secondary laterals, which should be pinched off at the second or third joint, and in that way the sap may be diverted till the end of the season.\n\nThe shoots of the plants on the back wall must be brought down to a horizontal position, and cut so that the branches of each plant may reach within a foot of the other. If all the vines on the rafters have pushed vigorously, it will be proper to prune every other plant down to three or four eyes, and the rest to from twenty to twenty-five eyes each, the latter being intended to produce fruit, and the former to make bearing wood against another year. When the vines begin to push in the spring of the third year, the shoots of those on the back wall should not be allowed to stand nearer one another than a foot or fifteen inches, all the intermediate buds being carefully rubbed off. The shoots ought to be trained up perpendicularly, and however vigorous they may be, no more than one cluster should be allowed to remain on any of them: all of them may run up to the height of five or six feet before they are flopped. The shoots on the rafters, that were pruned to twenty or twenty-five eyes each, will probably push at all of them; but not more than five or seven shoots should be permitted to remain, even on the strongest; viz., a leading shoot, and two or three on each side. Care being taken to leave one shoot as near the bottom as possible, as the whole branch will require to be pruned down to this shoot next winter. Only one shoot should be left upon those vines that were pruned down to three or four eyes, at every other rafter; and this must be trained up the rafter as in the preceding year. At next pruning season all the shoots proceeding from the horizontal branches of the vines in the back wall should be pruned down to three or four eyes. The vines on the front which produced fruit should be pruned to their lowest shoot, which should be shortened, so as to leave four or five eyes. Those at every other rafter which were shortened the preceding year, and which were allowed to push one shoot, should now be pruned like the bearers of the former year; i.e., twenty or twenty-five eyes should be left on each. In the following and all succeeding seasons, these vines on the front will require a similar management, with this difference, that, as they acquire more strength, they may be permitted to push more shoots, and more clusters may be allowed to remain on each shoot; for, as the vines advance in age, they will certainly be enabled to produce every year for a certain period, a larger crop of fruit. The spurs of the vines on the back-wall, i.e., the shoots that were shortened to three or four eyes, should be allowed to push up one shoot: these shoots at next pruning season must be cut so as to leave a long one, viz., about four feet, and a short one, alternately. The long ones should be allowed to push five shoots (all the other buds being rubbed off), the four lateral of which should be cut down to two or three eyes each, at next pruning season, and the terminal one should be left about a foot and a half long. The short shoots between the long ones must constantly be pruned down to two or three eyes each, in order to keep up a proper succession of bottom wood. The pruning following season must be the same, with this difference, that the upright shoots, as they have acquired a foot and a half additional length, may be allowed to push seven shoots instead of five.\n\nThe principal kinds of vines (E) are, * the white muscat of Alexandria, * black damascus, * golden galli- cian, * white frontinac, * grilly frontinac, * black or purple frontinac, + blue or violet frontinac, +I red frontinac, + white sweet water, + black Hamburgh, +H red Hamburgh, or Gibraltar grape, * white Hamburgh, * malvoise or blue tokay, * genuine tokay, + flame-coloured tokay, + brick grape, + white muf cadine or chaffelas, + royal muscadine or d'arboye, +Malmsey grape, + claret grape, * Syrian, + Burgundy or Munier grape, + small black clutter, + large black clutter, + early black July grape or morillon, noir nati, + white parsley-leaved.\n\nGooseberries and currants may be pruned any time from the fall of the leaf, till their buds begin to grow berries and in the spring. If these bushes be not well pruned, the currants' fruit will neither be large nor well-flavoured. The principal thing to be attended to is, to keep them open; for they are very apt to become over-crowded with branches: all suckers therefore which arise from the root, or shoots which proceed from the main stem, should be removed, because they would only create confusion, by growing up into the heart of the bush. When last summer's shoots stand too thick, on the main branches, which is frequently the case, particularly with gooseberries, they should be thinned, and few either of them or of the main branches should be shortened, because the more they are shortened the more liable they are to run to wood. They who make use of garden-shears, for sake of expedition, which is too frequently the case, may save time, and make neat-looking bushes, but will be disappointed with respect to the quantity and quality of their fruit.\n\nSect.

IV. The Nursery.**\n\nTransplant young trees and shrubs, and protect tender seedlings during severe weather.\n\n**Sect. V. Green-House and Hot-House.**\n\nThe plants in the greenhouse should have air during the day, whenever the weather will permit, and should receive but little water. The plants in the hot-house should likewise receive air during the day in favourable weather, and fires must be put on every evening, but seldom need to be continued during the day, except the weather is very severe.\n\n**DECEMBER.**\n\n**Sect. I. Kitchen Garden.**\n\nThe cauliflower plants and lettuces planted under hot-bed frames, or under bell or hand-glasses, should be exposed to the air during the mild days, and protected during severe weather with a covering of mats or straw. In dry weather celery and cardoons should be earthed up, and endive tied up for blanching.\n\nIn this month there is nothing to be done either in the fruit garden, nursery, greenhouse, or hot-house, that has not already been taken notice of in the preceding months.\n\nHere we shall add some observations on the construction of greenhouses and hot-houses.\n\nA greenhouse constructed for the protection of such vegetables as cannot stand in the open air during winter, may vary in form and dimensions according to the fancy of the proprietor, and the number of plants it is intended to contain. When the front only is of glass, which formerly was the only, and even still is the prevalent, mode of constructing greenhouses, the pillars between the sashes ought to be as narrow as the weight they have to support will admit of, and formed so as to give the least possible obstruction to the light; they may be either of stone, brick, wood, or cast iron. The height of the sashes should equal if not exceed the width of the house, that a sufficient quantity of light may be thrown on the plants which stand near the back wall, otherwise they will lose colour, become unhealthy and deformed; for not only the colour, but the vigour, and even the form of vegetables, depends on the light. When one half or the whole of the roof is of glass, which ought to be the case, there is no necessity for attending to the proportion the height ought to bear to the width of the house. The ends of the house should also be of glass, unless when it is connected with a series of other buildings. The pots containing the plants are commonly set on benches, which gradually increase in height as they recede from the front; however, when the roof is of glass, the arrangement may be different. Every greenhouse ought to be furnished with flues; for though many winters may occur in which the application of fire-heat may not be necessary, yet such intense frosts at times prevail as would infallibly kill a great many of the plants: external coverings, it is true, are frequently made use of as a protection against the severity of the weather, but they do not answer the purpose equally well, for when the frost continues long they cannot be applied day and night without doing injury, by excluding air and light; the application of fire-heat is likewise necessary for banishing the damp, which very much injures and frequently destroys the plants, during long-continued, dull, rainy weather. The flues in greenhouse are frequently confined to the back wall, but they ought to pass in front of the house likewise, because the plants situated are most liable to be injured by the severity of the weather.\n\nAs fires are seldom required, and those but very slight ones, merely to banish frost and damp, it will not be necessary from economical motives to construct the flues, so as to throw off the greatest possible quantity of heat, they may therefore be concealed that they may not affect the appearance of the house.\n\nHot-houses for rearing plants which grow in warmer climates, or for forcing at an early period such vegetables as grow in the open air, vary considerably according to the different purposes for which they are intended. 1st, Conservatories, or dry stoves, so called because they are constructed without pits for containing tanners bark, oak leaves, or other fermentable substances, and in which the plants grow in the earth which forms the floor of the house, and not in pots. These are commonly of a considerable width and height, and are either covered entirely, or at least on the front, roof, and ends, with glass. 2dly, Hot-houses for rearing exotic plants, furnished with a pit containing tanners bark, oak leaves, heated sand, &c., in which pots containing the plants are plunged: these likewise are of considerable breadth and height, and have their front, roof, and ends, covered with glass. 3dly, Pine-houses which are furnished with a pit, as above: these are low, the roof being within a few feet of the surface of the pit, that the pine plants may be as near the light as possible, and the roof and part of the front only need be of glass.\n\nVine-houses are commonly constructed without pits, and are generally about 12 or 14 feet high, sometimes very narrow, at other times of considerable breadth; the former answer best for forcing at a very early period, and in both houses the vines are commonly trained both to the back and front.\n\nPeach-houses are almost always constructed without pits, are of a moderate height, and vary in breadth. The peaches are trained either to the front or back, or to both; and sometimes they are planted in the middle of the house, and allowed to grow like standard fruit trees, in which case the house should be spacious.\n\nCherry and fig-houses are constructed nearly in the same way as peach-houses. The flues for warming all these ought to pass round the front as well as the back of the house, and ought to have as much of their surface exposed as possible; for the more of the surface of the flue comes in contact with the air of the house, the more readily the house will be warmed: therefore they ought not to be built in contact with the front or back walls when that can be avoided, but ought to be supported on pillars of brick, to keep them from resting on the ground.\n\nThe furnaces for containing the fuel are placed sometimes","sp":63,"ep":68},{"h":"GARDENING","t":"| Pin apples, raised in water, | Seedlings, |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|\n| varieties of,                |           |\n| Plum trees, when pruned,     | Shrubs, how managed, |\n| different kinds of,          | Spinach, when sown, |\n| Potatoes, early, when planted, | winter crop of, |\n| full crop of,                | Strawberries, forcing of the growth |\n| Pot-herbs, when sown,        | time and mode of dressing, |\n| planted out,                 | plantations of, made, |\n| R.                           | different kinds of, |\n| Radishes, when sown,         | Trees, roots of, how protected, |\n| horse, how propagated,       | time proper for planting, |\n| Raspberries, when pruned and planted, | Trees, propagated by layers, |\n| S.                           | cuttings, |\n| Salad, small,                | suckers, |\n|                             | air cautiously admitted to, |\n|                             | Turnips, full crop of, |\n\nIndex.\n\n| Trees, propagated by layers, | No 61 |\n|-------------------------------|-------|\n| cuttings,                     | 62    |\n| suckers,                      | 63    |\n| Turnips, full crop of,        | 201   |","sp":69,"ep":70},{"h":"GARDINER","t":"Stephen, bishop of Winchester, and lord chancellor of England, born at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, natural son to Richard Woodville, brother to Queen Elizabeth wife to Edward IV. was learned in the canon and civil laws, and in divinity.

It has also a communication with the Mediterranean, by means of the royal canal of Louis XIV. The tide flows up this river 20 miles above Bordeaux.\n\n**Garrick, David**, Esq., the great Roscius of his age and country, who for near 40 years shone the brightest luminary in the hemisphere of the stage, was born at the Angel Inn at Hereford, in the year 1716. His father, Captain Peter Garrick, was a French refugee, and had a troop of horse which were then quartered in that city. This rank he maintained in the army for several years, and had a majority at the time of his death; that event, however, prevented him from ever enjoying it. Mr Garrick received the first rudiments of his education at the free-school at Litchfield; which he afterwards completed at Rochester, under the celebrated Mr Collon, since mathematical professor at Cambridge. Dr Johnson and he were fellow-students at the same school; and it is a curious fact, that these two celebrated geniuses came up to London, with the intention of pushing themselves into active life, in the same coach. On the 9th of March 1736, he was entered at the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn. The study of the law, however, he soon quitted; and followed for some time the employment of a wine merchant: but that too disquieting him, he gave way at last to the irresistible bias of his mind, and joined a travelling company of comedians at Ipswich in Suffolk, where he went by the name of Lyddle. Having in this poor school of Apollo got some acquaintance with the dramatic art, he burst at once upon the world, in the year 1740-1, in all the lustre of perfection, at the little theatre in Goodman's Fields, then under the direction of Henry Giffard.\n\nThe character he first performed was Richard III., in which, like the sun bursting from behind a cloud, he displayed in the earliest dawn even more than meridian brightness. His excellence dazzled and astonished every one; and the seeing a young man, in no more than his 24th year, and a novice in reality to the stage, reaching at one single step to that height of perfection which maturity of years and long practical experience had not been able to bestow on the then capital performers of the English stage, was a phenomenon that could not but become the object of universal speculation and of as universal admiration. The theatres at the west end of the town were deserted; Garrick, Goodman's Fields, from being the rendezvous of citizens and citizens wives alone, became the resort of all ranks of men; and Mr Garrick continued to act till the close of the season.\n\nHaving very advantageous terms offered him for the performing in Dublin during some part of the summer (1741), he went over thither, where he found the same just homage paid to his merit which he had received from his own countrymen. To the service of the latter, however, he esteemed himself more immediately bound; and therefore in the ensuing winter, engaged himself to Mr Fleetwood, then manager of Drury Lane; in which theatre he continued till the year 1745, when he again went over to Ireland, and continued there the whole season, joint manager with Mr Sheridan in the direction and profits of the theatre royal in Smock Alley. From thence he returned to England, and was engaged for the season of 1746 with Mr Rich at Covent Garden. This was his last performance as a hired actor: for in the close of that season, Mr Fleetwood's patent for the management of Drury Lane being expired, and that gentleman having no inclination further to pursue a design by which, from his want of acquaintance with the proper conduct of it, or some other cause, he had considerably impaired his fortune; Mr Garrick, in conjunction with Mr Lacy, purchased the property of that theatre, together with the renovation of the patent; and in the winter of 1747, opened it with the greatest part of Mr Fleetwood's company, and with the great additional strength of Mr Barry, Mrs Pritchard, and Mrs Cibber, from Covent Garden.\n\nWere we to trace Mr Garrick through the several occurrences of his life,\u2014a life so active, so busy, and so full of occurrences as his, we should swell this account to many pages. Suffice it to say, he continued in the unimpeached enjoyment of his fame and unrivalled excellence to the moment of his retirement. His universality of excellence was never once attacked by competition. Tragedy, comedy, and farce, the lover and the hero, the jealous husband who suspects his wife without cause, and the thoughtless lively rake who attacks her without design, were all alike his own. Rage and ridicule, doubt and despair, transport and tenderness, compassion and contempt; love, jealousy, fear, fury, and simplicity; all took in turn possession of his features, while each of them in turn appeared to be the sole possessor of his heart. In the several characters of Lear and Hamlet, Richard, Dorilas, Romeo, and Luigiane; in his Ranger, Bayes, Dragger, Kiteley, Brute, and Benedict, you saw the molecular conformations that your ideas attached to them all. In short, Nature, the mistress from whom alone this great performer borrowed all his lessons, being in herself inexhaustible, this her darling son, marked out for her truest representative, found an unlimited scope for change and diversity in his manner of copying from her various productions. There is one part of theatrical conduct which ought unquestionably to be recorded to Mr Garrick's honour, since the cause of virtue and morality, and the formation of public manners, are considerably dependent upon it; and that is, the zeal with which he aimed to banish from the stage all those plays which carry with them an immoral tendency,\nGarrick and to prune from those which do not absolutely, on the whole, promote the interests of vice, such scenes of licentiousness and liberty, as a redundancy of wit and too great liveliness of imagination have induced some of our comic writers to indulge themselves in, and to which the sympathetic disposition of our age of gallantry and intrigue has given sanction. The purity of the English stage has certainly been much more fully established during the administration of this theatrical minister, than it had ever been during preceding managements. He seems to have carried his modest, moral, chaste, and pious principles with him into the very management of the theatre itself, and refused performers from that obloquy which stuck on the profession. Of those who were accounted blackguards, unworthy the association of the world, he made gentlemen, united them with society, and introduced them to all the domestic comforts of life. The theatre was no longer esteemed the receptacle of all vice; and the moral, the serious, the religious part of mankind, did not hesitate to partake of the rational entertainment of a play, and pass a cheerful evening undefiled with the licentiousness, and uncorrupted by the immorality, of the exhibition.\n\nNowwithstanding the numberless and laborious avocations attendant on his profession as an actor, and his station as a manager; yet still his active genius was perpetually bursting forth in various little productions in the dramatic and poetical way, whose merit cannot but make us regret his want of time for the pursuance of more extensive and important works. It is certain that his merit as an author is not of the first magnitude: but his great knowledge of men and manners, of stage effect, and his happy turn for lively and striking satire, made him generally successful; and his prologues and epilogues in particular, which are almost innumerable, possess such a degree of happiness, both in the conception and execution, as to stand unequalled. His Ode on the death of Mr Pelham ran through four editions in less than six weeks. His Ode on Shakespeare is a masterly piece of poetry; and when delivered by himself, was a most capital exhibition. His alterations of Shakespeare and other authors have been at times successful, and at times exploded. The cutting out the gravediggers scene from Hamlet will never be forgotten to him by the inhabitants of the gallery at Drury. Though necessary to the chasteness of the scene, they cannot bear to lose so much true sterling wit and humour; and it must be owned, that exuberances of that kind, though they hurt the uniformity, yet increase the luxuriance of the tree. Among his alterations the following are part: Every Man in his Humour, altered from Ben Jonson; Romeo and Juliet, Winter's Tale, Catherine and Petruchio, Cymbeline, Hamlet, &c., altered and made up from Shakespeare; Gamesters, a comedy, from Shirley; Isabella, from Southerne. To these we add, as original productions, The Farmer's Return, and Linco's Travels, interludes; Guardian, Lethe, Lying Valet, Miss in her Teens, Male Coquet, Irish Widow, and other comedies in two acts; Enchanter, a musical entertainment; Lilliput: the Christmas Tale is ascribed to him, and many others.\n\nWe now bring him to the period of his retirement in the spring of 1776; when, full of fame, with the acquirement of a splendid fortune, and growing into Garrison years, he thought proper to seek the vale of life, to enjoy that dignified and honourable ease which was compatible with his public situation, and which he had so well earned by the activity and the merits of his dramatic reign. But very short indeed was the period allotted to him for this precious enjoyment: for on the 20th of January 1779, he departed this life; leaving no one rival in excellence upon earth to compensate for his loss, or a hope of our ever meeting with his like again.","sp":70,"ep":72},{"h":"GARRISON","t":"in the art of war, a body of forces, disposed in a fortref, to defend it against the enemy, or to keep the inhabitants in subjection; or even to be subsisted during the winter season: hence garrison and winter quarters are sometimes used indifferently for the same thing; and sometimes they denote different things.

The knights companions are generally princes and peers; and the king of England is the sovereign or chief of the order. The number of knights was originally 26; but five were added in 1786, on account of the increase of the royal family. They are a college or corporation, having a great and little seal.\n\nTheir officers are a prelate, chancellor, registrar, king at arms, and usher of the black rod. They have also a dean, with 12 canons and petty canons, vergers, and 26 pensioners or poor knights. The prelate is the head. This office is vested in the bishop of Winchester, and has ever been so. Next to the prelate is the chancellor; which office is vested in the bishop of Salisbury, who keeps the seals, &c. The next is the registrar, who by his oath is to enter upon the registry, the scrutinies, elections, penalties, and other acts of the order, with all fidelity: The dean of Windsor is always registrar ex officio. The fourth officer is Garter and king-at-arms, being two distinct offices united in one person.\nGarter carries the rod and sceptre at the feast of St George, the protector of this order, when the sovereign is present. He notifies the elections of new knights, attends the solemnity of their installations, carries the garter to foreign princes, &c. He is the principal officer within the college of arms, and chief of the heralds. See King-at-Arms.\n\nAll these officers except the prelate have fees and pensions. The college of the order is seated in the castle of Windsor, within the chapel of St George, and the charter house, erected by the founder for that purpose. The habit and ensign of the order are, a garter, mantle, cape, george, and collar. The three first were assigned the knights companions by the founder; and, the george and collar by Henry VIII.\n\nThe garter challenges pre-eminence over all the other parts of the dress, by reason that from it the noble order is denominated; that it is the first part of the habit presented to foreign princes and absent knights, who, and all other knights-elect, are therewith first adorned; and it is of so great honour and grandeur, that by the bare investiture with this noble ensign, the knights are esteemed companions of the greatest military order in the world. It is worn on the left leg between the knee and calf, and is enamelled with this motto, Honi soit qui mal y pense; i.e., Shame to him that thinks evil thereof! The meaning of which is, that King Edward having laid claim to the kingdom of France, retorted shame and defiance upon him that should dare to think amiss of the just enterprise he had undertaken, for recovering his lawful right to that crown; and that the bravery of those knights whom he had elected into this order, was such as would enable him to maintain the quarrel against those that thought ill of it.\n\nThe mantle is the chief of these vestments made use of upon all solemn occasions. The colour of the mantle is by the statutes appointed to be blue. The length of the train of the mantle only distinguishes the sovereign from the knights companions. To the collar of the mantle is fixed a pair of long strings, anciently woven with blue silk only, but now twisted round, and made of Venice gold and silk, of the colour of the robes, with knobs or buttons, and tassels at the end. The left shoulder of the mantle has from the institution been adorned with a large garter, with the device, Honi soit, &c. Within this is the cross of the order, which was ordained to be worn at all times by King Charles I. At length the star was introduced, being a fort of cross irradiated with beams of silver.\n\nThe collar is appointed to be composed of pieces of gold in fashion of garters, the ground enamelled blue, and the motto gold.\n\nWhen the knights wear not their robes, they are to have a silver star on the left side; and they commonly bear the picture of St George, enamelled on gold, and bejewelled with diamonds, at the end of a blue ribbon, crossing the body from the left shoulder. They are not to appear abroad without the garter, on penalty of 6s. 8d. paid to the registrar.\n\nThe manner of electing a knight companion into this most noble order, and the ceremonies of investiture, are as follow. When the sovereign deigns to elect a companion of the garter, the chancellor belonging to this order draws up the letters, which, passing both under the sovereign's sign manual and signet of the order, are sent to the person by Garter principal king at arms; and are in this manner, or to the same effect:\n\n\"We, with the companions of our most noble order of the garter, assembled in chapter, holden this present day at our castle at Windsor, considering the virtuous fidelity you have shown, and the honourable exploits you have done in our service, by vindicating and maintaining our right, &c. have elected and chosen you one of the companions of our order. Therefore, we require you to make your speedy repair unto us, to receive the ensigns thereof, and be ready for your installation upon the \u2014 day of this present month, &c.\"\n\nThe garter, which is of blue velvet bordered with fine gold wire, having commonly the letters of the motto of the same, is, at the time of election, buckled upon the left leg, by two of the senior companions, who receive it from the sovereign, to whom it was presented upon a velvet cushion, by Garter king at arms, with the usual reverence, whilst the chancellor reads the following admonition, enjoined by the statutes: \"To the honour of God omnipotent, and in memorial of the blest martyr St George, tie about thy leg, for thy renown, this noble garter; wear it as the symbol of the most illustrious order, never to be forgotten or laid aside; that thereby thou mayest be admonished to be courageous; and having undertaken a just war, in which thou shalt be engaged, thou mayest stand firm, valiantly fight, and successfully conquer.\" The princely garter being then buckled on, and the word of its significance pronounced, the knight elect is brought before the sovereign, who puts about his neck, kneeling, a dark blue ribbon, whereunto is appended, wrought in gold within the garter, the image of St George on horseback, with his sword drawn, encountering with the dragon. In the meantime, the chancellor reads the following admonition: \"Wear this ribbon about thy neck, adorned with the image of the blest martyr and soldier of Christ, St George, by whose imitation provoked, thou mayest so overpass both prosperous and adverse adventures, that having stoutly vanquished thy enemies both of body and soul, thou mayest not only receive the praise of this transient combat, but be crowned with the palm of eternal victory.\" Then the knight elected kisses the sovereign's hand; thanks his majesty for the great honour done him; rises up, and salutes all the companions severally, who return their congratulations. See a representation of the above insignia, among others, on the plate belonging to Orders of Knighthood.\n\nSince the institution of this order, there have been eight emperors and twenty-eight kings, besides numerous sovereign princes enrolled as companions thereof. Its origin is somewhat differently related. The common account is, that the countess of Salisbury at a ball happening to drop her garter, the king took it up and presented it to her with these words, \"Honi soit qui mal y pense;\" i.e., Evil to him that evil thinks. This accident, it is said, gave rise to the order and the motto; it being the spirit of the times to mix love and war together: but as in the original statutes of this order there is not the least conjecture to countenance such a feminine institution, credit cannot be given to this tradition. Camden, Fern, &c. take it\nto have been instituted on occasion of the victory obtained by Edward over the French at the battle of Creully; that prince, say some historians, ordered his garter to be displayed, as a signal of battle: in commemoration whereof, he made a garter the principal ornament of the order, erected in memory of this signal victory, and a symbol of the indissoluble union of the knights.\n\nIt appears from Raftel's Chronicle, lib. vi. quoted by Granger in the supplement to his Biographical History, that this order was devised by Richard I. at the siege of the city of Acre, when he caused twenty-six knights, who firmly stood by him, to wear thongs of blue leather about their legs, and that it was perfected in the nineteenth year of Edward III.\n\nIn 1551, Edward VI. made some alterations in the ritual of this order: that prince composed it in Latin, the original whereof is still extant in his own handwriting. He there ordained, that the order should no longer be called the order of St George, but that of the Garter; and, instead of the \"george,\" hung at the collar, he substituted a cavalier, bearing a book on the point of his sword, with the word protetio graven on the sword, and verbum Dei on the book: with a buckle in the left hand, and the word fides thereon.\n\nGarter, principal King at Arms. This office was instituted by Henry V.\n\nGarter, and principal king at arms, are two distinct offices united in one person: Garter's employment is to attend the service of the order of the garter; for which he is allowed a mantle and badge, a house in Windsor castle, and pensions both from the sovereign and knights, and lastly, fees. He also carries the rod and sceptre at every feast of St George, when the sovereign is present, and notifies the election of such as are new chosen; attends the solemnity of their installations, takes care of placing their arms over their seats; and carries the garter to foreign kings and princes, for which service it has been usual to join him in commission with some peer, or other person of distinction.\n\nGarter's oath relates only to services being performed within the order, and is taken in chapter before the sovereign and knights. His oath, as king at arms, is taken before the earl marshal.\n\nGarter is also a term in heraldry, signifying the moiety or half of a bend.\n\nGARTH is used in some parts of England for a little backside or clove. It is an ancient British word. Garth, in that language, signifies garden, and is pronounced and written garth. This word is also used for a dam or weir, &c.\n\nGarth Men is used in our statutes for those who catch fish by means of fish garths, or weirs. By statute it is ordained, that no fisher, nor garth man, shall use any nets or engines to destroy the fry of fish, &c. 17 Ric. II. cap. 9. The word is supposed by some to be derived from the Scotch word gart, which signifies forced or compelled; because fish are forced by the wear to pass in a loop, where they are taken.\n\nGarth, Sir Samuel, an excellent English poet and physician, was descended from a good family in Yorkshire. He was admitted into the college of physicians at London in 1693. He at that time zealously promoted and encouraged the erecting of the dispensary for the relief of the sick poor, by giving them advice gratis, and medicines at low rates. This work of charity having exposed him and many other physicians to the envy and resentment of several persons of the same faculty as well as apothecaries, he ridiculed them, with a peculiar spirit and vivacity, in a poem called the Dilpenary, in six cantos, highly esteemed. He was one of the most eminent members of the famous society called the Kit Kat Club, which consisted of noblemen and gentlemen distinguished by their excellent parts and affection to the house of Hanover. Upon the accession of George I. he was knighted, and made physician in ordinary to his majesty, and physician general to the army. Nor were these more than just rewards even of his physical merit. He had gone through the office of censor of the college in 1702; and had practiced always with great reputation, and a strict regard to the honour and interest of the faculty, never stooping to prostitute the dignity of his profession, through mean and sordid views of self-interest, to any, even the most popular and wealthy apothecaries. In a steady adherence to this noble principle, he concurred with the much celebrated Dr Radcliffe, with whom he was also often joined in physical consultations. He had a very extensive practice, but was very moderate in his views of advancing his own fortune; his humanity and good nature inclining him more to make use of the great interest he had with persons in power, for the support and encouragement of other men of letters. He chose to live with the greatest in that degree of independency and freedom which became a man possessed of a superior genius, whereof he was daily giving fresh proofs to the public. One of his last performances in polite letters, was his translation of the whole fourteenth book, and the story of Cinnus in the fifteenth book, of Ovid's Metamorphoses. These, together with an English version of the rest, were published in 1717; and he has prefixed an excellent preface to the whole, wherein he not only gives an idea of the work, and points out its principal beauties, but shows the uses of the poem, and how it may be read to most profit. The difference which seized him the ensuing year, and ended not but with his life, caused a general concern; which was particularly testified by Lord Landowne, a brother poet, though of a different party, in some admirable verses written on the occasion. He died, after a short illness, which he bore with great patience, in January 1719.\n\nGarumna, a noble and navigable river of Gaul, which rising from the Pyrenees, formerly bounded Aquitain on the north (Caesar); but by the new regulation of Augustus divided it in the middle, emptying itself to the north of Burdegala, in the Aquitanian ocean.

Mela observes concerning it, that unless it is swelled by winter rains, or the melting of the snow, it is for a great part of the year shoaly and scarce navigable; but when increased by the meeting tide, whereby its waters are impelled, it is somewhat fuller; and the farther the river advances, it is broader, till at length it resembles a large frith or arm of the sea, not only bearing large vessels, but al-\nGas so swelling like a raging sea, tosses them extremely, especially if the direction of the wind be one way and that of the current another.","sp":72,"ep":75},{"h":"GASCOIGNE","t":"Sir William, chief justice of the court of king's bench under Henry IV.

Being at length, says Wood, weary of those vanities, he returned to England; and settled once more in Gray's Inn, where he wrote most of his dramatic and other poems.

When a child, he took particular delight in gazing at the moon and stars as often as they appeared in clear unclouded weather. This pleasure frequently drew him into bye places, in order to fealt his eye freely and undisturbed; by which means his parents had him often to seek, not without many anxious fears and apprehensions. They therefore put him to school at Digne; where, in a short time, he made such an extraordinary progress in learning, that some persons, who had seen specimens of his genius, resolved to have him removed to Aix, in order to study philosophy under Felay, a learned minor friar. This proposal was so disagreeable to his father, who intended to breed him up in his own way to country busines, as being more profitable than that of a scholar, that he would consent to it only upon condition that he should return home in two years at farthest. Accordingly young Gassendi, at the end of the appointed time, repaired to Chantier; but he had not been there when he was invited to be professor of rhetoric at Digne, before he was quite 16 years of age; and he had been engaged in that office but three years, when his master Felay dying, he was made professor in his room at Aix. When he had been there a few years, he composed his Paradoxical Exercitations; which, coming to the hands of Nicholas Peiresc, that great patron of learning joined with Joseph Walter prior of Valette in promoting him; and he having entered into holy orders, was first made canon of the church of Digne and doctor of divinity, and then obtained the wardenship or rectoryship of that church. Gassendi's fondness for astronomy grew up with his years; and his reputation daily increasing, he was in 1645 appointed royal professor of mathematics at Paris. This institution being chiefly designed for astronomy, our author read lectures on that science to a crowded audience. However, he did not hold this place long; for a dangerous cough and inflammation of the lungs obliged him, in 1647, to return to Digne for the benefit of his native air.\u2014Gassendi wrote against the metaphysical meditations of Descartes; and divided with that great man the philosophers of his time, almost all of whom were Cartesians or Gassendians. He joined to his knowledge of philosophy and the mathematics an acquaintance with the languages and a profound erudition. He wrote, 1. Three volumes on Epicurus's Philosophy; and five others, which contain his own philosophy. 2. Astronomical Works. 3. The Lives of Nicholas de Peiresc, Epicurus, Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Puerbachius, and Regiomontanus. 4. Epistles, and other treatises.

From the Jesuits he received the rudiments of his education, and was much esteemed by them on account of his abilities; but his father afterwards sent him to the orphan house of Halle, lest he should be obliged to abjure his religion. The nature of the discipline, however, he here found to be much too severe, which induced him to request his father to remove him from it, which was accordingly complied with. His teacher at this hospital attributing the dislike of young Gaubius to the want of genius, urged him to give his son some mechanical employment; but the father thought proper to indulge his ardent desire after knowledge, and accordingly sent him to Amsterdam to study under his uncle John, who was an eminent physician. After prosecuting his medical studies for some time at Hardwyck, he resolved to visit Leyden, where the immortal Boerhaave was an eminent professor, and whose penetrating eye soon discovered that Gaubius was possessed of talents above mediocrity. He honoured him with unlimited access to his house, delighted in imparting instruction to him, and gradually forwarded the cultivation of his mind. He took the degree of doctor at the age of 20, after a disputation on the nature of solids, containing an abstract of the system which he himself followed through life.\n\nHe travelled through various parts of Europe, and when he returned to Heidelberg by the way of Strasbourg, he was appointed city-physician at Deventer in the province of Overijssel; but he soon after removed to Amsterdam. Boerhaave never lost sight of his favourite pupil; for when the infirmities of old age and indefatigable labour made him anxious to resign his chair, Gaubius on his recommendation was appointed to succeed him. He published his Instructions for writing Recipes in the year 1738, by which he acquired great and justly merited approbation, as he reduced the art from a mere mechanical to a scientific form. His Principles of Nofology is perhaps his most masterly performance, as it evinced that he was highly worthy of such a preceptor. His next publication, which appeared in 1771, was his \"Adversaria vari Argumenti,\" a work which was particularly interesting to chemists; and his oration on the 200th anniversary of the academy of Leyden attracted considerable notice, as in it he traced out, with his accustomed acumen, the chief epochs of the arts and sciences in Holland.\n\nHe was likewise the author of numerous and valuable papers in the Transactions of the Society of Haarlem, and was editor of many excellent performances, among which we may rank Cramer's Elementa artis doctrinae; Albinius de praeganda vita et morte, and Swammerdam's Book of Nature, which he partly translated. His literary merit spread his fame so far beyond the bounds of his native country, that pupils repaired to Leyden from every quarter of Europe. In addition to his widely extended reputation, he was blessed with the enjoyment of good health till he was 70 years of age, and died on the 29th of November 1780, in his seventy-fifth year.\n\nOne work of his, entitled \"Institutiones Pathologiae Medicinalis,\" was deemed so valuable by Professor Ackerman, and of such singular advantage in academical lectures, that he gave the world a fourth edition of it, published at Nuremberg in 1787.","sp":77,"ep":77},{"h":"GAUDEN","t":"Dr. Joseph, son of John Gauden vicar of Mayfield in Essex, was born there in 1605. At the commencement of the civil war, he was chaplain to Robert earl of Warwick; who taking part with the parliament against the king, was followed by his chaplain. Upon the establishment of the Presbyterian model of church government, he complied with the ruling powers, and was nominated one of the assembly of divines who met at Westminster in 1643, and took the covenant; yet having offered some scruples and objections to it, his name was afterwards struck out of the list. Nor did he espouse the parliament cause any longer than they adhered to their first avowed principles of reforming only, instead of destroying, monarchy and episcopacy. In this spirit he was one of those divines who signed a protestation to the army against the violent proceedings that affected the life of the king; and a few days after his execution published the famous Exon Barium, A Portraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitude and Sufferings; which ran through 50 editions in the course of a year. Upon the return of Charles II. he was promoted to the see of Exeter; and in 1662 was removed to Worcester, much to his regret.\nregret, having flattered himself with the hopes of a translation to Winchester; and his death happened the same year. He wrote many controversial pieces suited to the circumstances of the times, and to his own views from them. The Eikon Basilike above-mentioned he published as the king's private meditations: though on this point there has been a long controversy. After the bishop's death, his widow, in a letter to one of her sons, calls it The jewel; and said, her husband had hoped to make a fortune by it; and that he had a letter of a very great man's, which would clear up that he writ it. This assertion, as the earl of Clarendon had predicted, was eagerly espoused by the anti-royalists, in the view of disfavoring Charles I. But it has been observed, that Gauden had too luxuriant an imagination, which betrayed him into a rankness of style in the Asiatic way; and from thence, as Bishop Burnet argues with others, it may be certainly concluded, that not he, but the king himself, was the true author of the Eikon Basilike; in which there is a nobleness and justness of thought, with a greatness of style, that made it be looked on as the best written book in the English language.","sp":77,"ep":78},{"h":"GAUGAMELA","t":"in Ancient Geography, a village of Aturia, lying between the rivers Lycus and Tigris; famous for Alexander's victory over Darius.

See GEOMETRY.\n\nGAUGING-Rod, an instrument used in gauging or measuring the contents of any vessel. That usually employed is the four-foot gauging rod. It is commonly made of box, and consists of four rules, each a foot long and about three-eighths of an inch square, joined together by three brads joints; by which means the rod is rendered four feet long when the four rules are quite opened, and but one foot when they are all folded together. On the first face of this rod, marked 4, are placed two diagonal lines; one for beer and wine gallons may be readily found, by putting the rod in at the bung hole of the vessel till it meets the intersection of the head of the vessel with the staves opposite to the bung hole. For distinction of this line, there is written thereon, beer and wine gallons. On the second face, 5, are a line of inches and the gauge-line; which is a line expressing the areas of circles, whose diameters are the correspondent inches in ale gallons. At the beginning is written, ale area. On the third face, 6, are three scales of lines; the first, at the end of which is written hoghead, is for finding how many gallons there are in\nGauging Rod.\n\nA hoghead when it is not full, lying with its axis parallel to the horizon. The second line, at the end of which is written B. L. signifying a butt lying is for the same use as that for the hoghead. The third line is to find how much liquor is wanting to fill up a butt when it is standing; at the end of it is written B. S. signifying a butt standing. In the half of the fourth face of the gauging rod, there are the three scales of lines, to find the wants in a firkin, kilderkin, and barrel, lying with their areas parallel to the horizon. They are distinguished by letters F. K. B. signifying a firkin, kilderkin, and barrel.\n\nUse of the diagonal lines on this rod. To find the content of a vessel in beer or wine gallons, put the braided end of the gauging rod into the bung hole of the cask, with the diagonal lines upwards, and thrust this braided end to the meeting of the head and staves; then with chalk make a mark at the middle of the bung hole of the vessel, and also on the diagonal lines of the rod, right against, over one another, when the braided end is thrust home to the head and staves: then turn the gauging rod to the other end of the vessel, and thrust the braided end home to the end, as before. Lastly, See if the mark made on the gauging rod come even with the mark made on the bung hole, when the rod was thrust to the other end; which if it be, the mark made on the diagonal lines will, on the same lines, show the whole content of the cask in beer or wine gallons.\n\nIf the mark made on the bung hole be not right against that made on the rod when you put it the other way, then right against the mark made on the bung hole make another on the diagonal line; and the division on the diagonal line between the two chalks will show the vessel's whole contents in beer or wine gallons. Thus, e.g., if the diagonal line of the vessel be 28 inches four-tenths, its contents in beer gallons will be near 51, and in wine gallons 62.\n\nIf a vessel be open, as a half barrel, tun, or copper, and the measure from the middle of one side to the head and staves be 38 inches, the diagonal line gives 122 beer gallons; half of which, viz. 61, is the content of the open half tub.\n\nIf you have a large vessel, as a tun or copper, and the diagonal line taken by a long rule proves 70 inches; the content of that vessel may be found thus: Every inch at the beginning end of the diagonal line call ten inches. Thus ten inches becomes 100 inches; and every tenth of a gallon call 100 gallons; and every whole gallon call 1000 gallons.\n\nExample. At 44.8 inches on the diagonal beer line is 200 gallons; so that 4 inches 48 parts, now called 4.4 inches 8-tenths, is just two tenths of a gallon, now called 200 gallons; so also if the diagonal line be 76 inches and 7-tenths, a close cask of such diagonal will hold 1000 beer gallons; but an open cask but half so much, viz. 500 beer gallons.\n\nUse of the Gauging Line. To find the content of any cylindrical vessel in ale gallons; seek the diameter of the vessel in inches, and just against it on the gauge line is the quantity of ale gallons contained in one inch deep: this multiplied by the length of the cylinder will give its content in ale gallons.\n\nFor example, suppose the length of the vessel 32.06, and the diameter of its base 25 inches; to find what is the content in ale gallons? Right against 25 inches on the gauge line is one gallon and .745 of a gallon; which multiplied by 32.06, the length, gives 55.9447 gallons for the content of the vessel.\n\nThe bung diameter of a hoghead being 25 inches, the head diameter 22 inches, and the length 32.06 inches; to find the quantity of ale gallons contained in it?\u2014Seek 25, the bung diameter, on the line of inches; and right against it on the gauge line you will find 1.745; take one third of it, which is .582, and set it down twice; seek 22 inches in the head diameter, and against it you will find on the gauge line 1.356; one-third of which added to twice .580 gives 1.6096; which multiplied by the length 32.06, the product will be 51.603776, the content in ale gallons. Note, this operation supposes, that the aforesaid hoghead is in the figure of the middle frustum of a fisheroid.\n\nThe use of the lines on the two other faces of the rod is very easy; you need only put it downright into the bung hole (if the vessel you desire to know the quantity of ale gallons contained therein be lying) to the opposite staves; and then where the surface of the liquor cuts any one of the lines appropriated to that vessel, will be the number of gallons contained in that vessel.","sp":78,"ep":79},{"h":"GAUL","t":"the name given by the Romans to the country that now forms the kingdom of France.\u2014The original inhabitants were descended from the Celts or Gomerians, by whom the greatest part of Europe was peopled; the name of Galli, or Gauls, being probably given them long after their settlement in that country.\n\nSee Gallia.\n\nThe ancient history of the Gauls is entirely wrapped up in obscurity and darkness; all we know concerning them for a long time is, that they multiplied so fast, that, their country being unable to contain them, they poured forth in vast multitudes into other countries, which they generally subdued, and settled themselves in. It often happened, however, that these colonies were so molested by their neighbours, that they were obliged to send for assistance to their native country. This was always very easily obtained. The Gauls were upon every occasion, ready to send forth great numbers of new adventurers; and as they spread desolation wherever they came, the very name of Gauls proved terrible to most of the neighbouring nations.\u2014The account of earliest excursion of these people, of which we have any Gaulish distinct account, was into Italy, under a famed leader, named Bellovesus, about 622 years before Christ. He crossed the Rhone and the Alps, till then unattempted; defeated the Hetrurians; and seized upon that part of their country, since known by the names of Lombardy and Piedmont.\u2014The second grand expedition was made by the Cenomani, a people dwelling between the rivers Seine and Loire, under a general named Elitomir. They settled in those parts of Italy, now known by the names of Brescia, Cremona, Mantua, Carniola, and the Venetian.\u2014In a third excursion, two other Gaulish nations settled on both sides of the river Po; and in a fourth, the Boii and Lingones settled in the country between Ravenna and Bologna. The time of these three last expeditions is uncertain.\n\nThe third expedition of the Gauls was more remarkable than any of the former, and happened about 200 years after that of Bellovesus. The Senones settled...\nbetween Paris and Meaux, were invited into Italy by a Heturian lord, and settled themselves in Umbria. Brennus their king laid siege to Clusium, a city in alliance with Rome; and this produced a war with the Romans, in which the latter were at first defeated, and their city taken and burnt; but at length the whole army was cut off by Camillus, infamously, that not a single person escaped.\n\nSome other expeditions the Gauls undertook against the Romans: in which, though they always proved unsuccessful, by reason of their want of military discipline; yet their fierceness and courage made them formidable to the republic, that, on the first news of their march, extraordinary levies of troops were made, sacrifices and public supplications offered to the gods, and the law which granted an immunity from military service to priests and old men, was, for the time, abolished.\n\nAgainst the Greeks, the expeditions of the Gauls were very little more successful than against the Romans. The first of these we hear of was about 279 years before Christ, in the year after Pyrrhus had invaded Italy. At this time, the Gauls finding themselves greatly overstocked at home, sent out three great colonies to conquer new countries for themselves. One of these armies was commanded by Brennus, another by Cerethrius, and the third by Belgius. The first entered Pannonia or Hungary; the second Thrace; and the third marched into Illyricum and Macedonia. Here Belgius at first met with great success; and enriched himself by plunder to such a degree, that Brennus envying him, resolved to enter the same countries, in order to share the spoil. In a short time, however, Belgius met with such a total defeat, that his army was almost entirely destroyed; upon which Brennus hastened to the same place. His army at first consisted of 150,000 foot and 15,000 horse; but two of his principal officers revolted, and carried off 20,000 men, with whom they marched into Thrace; where, having joined Cerethrius, they seized on Byzantium and the western coast of the Propontis, making the adjacent parts tributary to them.\u2014To retrieve this loss, Brennus sent for fresh supplies from Gaul; and having increased his army to 150,000 foot, and upwards of 60,000 horse, he entered Macedon, defeated the general who opposed him, and ravaged the whole country. He next marched towards the straits of Thermopylae, with a design to invade Greece; but was stopped by the forces sent to defend that pass against him. He passed the mountains, however, as Xerxes had formerly done; upon which the guards retired, to avoid being surrounded. Brennus then having ordered Acichorius, the next to him in command, to follow at a distance with part of his army, marched with the bulk of the forces to Delphi, in order to plunder the rich temple there. This enterprise proved exceedingly unfortunate: a great number of his men were destroyed by a dreadful storm of hail, thunder, and lightning; another part of his army was destroyed by an earthquake; and the remainder, somehow or other, imagining themselves attacked by the enemy, fought against each other the whole night, so that in the morning scarce one half of them remained. The Greek forces then poured in upon them from all parts; and that in such numbers, that though Acichorius came up in due time with his forces, Brennus found himself unable to make head against the Greeks, and was defeated with great slaughter. He himself was desperately wounded; and so disheartened by his misfortune, that, having assembled all his chiefs, he advised them to kill all the wounded and disabled, and to make the best retreat they could; after which he put an end to his own life. On this occasion, it is said that 20,000 of these unhappy people were executed by their own countrymen. Acichorius then set out with the remainder for Gaul; but, by being obliged to march through the country of their enemies, the calamities they met with by the way were so grievous, that not one of them reached their own country. A just judgment, say the Greek and Roman authors, for their sacrilegious intentions against Delphi.\n\nThe Romans having often felt the effects of the Gaulish ferocity and courage, thought proper at last, in order to humble them, to invade their country. Their first successful attempt was about 118 years before Christ, under the command of Quintus Marcius, surnamed Rex. He opened a way betwixt the Alps and the Pyrenees, which laid the foundation for conquering the whole country. This was a work of immense labour of itself, and rendered still more difficult by the opposition of the Gauls, especially those called the Stani, who lived at the foot of the Alps. These people, finding themselves overpowered by the confederate army, set fire to their houses, killed their wives and children, and then threw themselves into the flames. After this Marcius built the city of Narbonne, which became the capital of a province. His successor Scaurus also conquered some Gaulish nations; and in order to facilitate the sending troops from Italy into that country, he made several excellent roads between them, which before were almost impassable. These successes gave rise to the invasion of the Cimbri and Teutones; an account of whose unfortunate expedition is given under the articles Cimbri, Rome, Teutones, &c.\n\nFrom this time, the Gauls ceased to be formidable to the Romans, and even seem to have been for some time on good terms with them. At last, however, the Helvetii kindled a war with the republic, which brought Caesar over the Alps, and ended in the total subjection of the country. Orgetorix was the first to cause it; who had engaged a vast number of his countrymen to burn their towns and villages, and to go in search of new conquests. Julius Caesar, to whose lot the whole country of Gaul had fallen, made such haste to come and suppress them, that he was got to the Rhone in eight days; broke down the bridge of Geneva, and, in a few days more, finished the famed wall between that city and Mount Jura, now St Claude, which extended seventeen miles in length, was sixteen feet high, fortified with towers and castles at proper distances, and a ditch that ran the whole length of it. If his own account of it may be relied upon, he did not set out till the beginning of April; and yet this huge work was finished by the ides or 13th of the month: so that, subtracting the eight days he was away, it must have been all done in about five days; a prodigious work, considering he had but one legion there, or even though the whole country had given him assistance. Whilst this was doing, and the reinforcements he wanted were coming, he amused the Helvetii,\nHelvetii, who had sent to demand a passage through the country of the Allobroges, till he had got his reinforcements; and then flatly refused it to them: whereupon a dreadful battle ensued; in which they lost one hundred and thirty thousand men, in spite of all their valour; besides a number of prisoners, among whom were the wife and daughter of Orgetorix, the leader of this unfortunate expedition. The rest submitted, and begged they might be permitted to go and settle among the Aedui, from whom they originally sprung; and, at the request of these last, were permitted to go.\n\nThe Gauls were constantly in a state of variance with one another; and Caesar, who knew how to make the most of these intestine broils, soon became the protector of the oppressed, a terror to the oppressor, and the umpire of all their contentions. Among those who applied to him for help, were his allies the Aedui; against whom Ariovitus, king of the Germans, had joined with the Arverni, who inhabited the banks of the Loire, had taken the country of the Sequani from them, and obliged them to send hostages to him. Caesar forthwith sent to demand the restitution of both, and, in an interview which he soon after obtained of that haughty and treacherous prince, was like to have fallen a sacrifice to his perfidy: upon which he bent his whole power against him, forced him out of his strong intrenchments, and gave him a total overthrow. Ariovitus escaped, with difficulty, over the Rhine; but his two wives, and a daughter, with a great number of Germans of distinction, fell into the conqueror's hand. Caesar, after this signal victory, put his army into winter quarters, whilst he went over the Alps to make the necessary preparations for the next campaign. By this time all the Belgae in general were so terrified at his success, that they entered into a confederacy against the Romans as their common enemy. Of this, Labienus, who had been left in Gaul, sent Caesar notice; upon which he immediately left Rome, and made such dispatch, that he arrived upon their confines in about fifteen days. On his arrival, the Remi submitted to him; but the rest, appointing Galba king of the Sueiones general of all their forces, which amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand men, marched directly against him. Caesar, who had seized on the bridge of the Axona, now Ainse, led his light horse and infantry over it; and whilst the others were encumbered in crossing that river, made such a terrible slaughter of them, that the river was filled with their dead, insomuch that their bodies served for a bridge to those who escaped. This new victory struck such terror into the rest, that they dispersed themselves; immediately after which, the Sueiones, Bellocavi, Ambiones, and some others, submitted to him. The Nervii, indeed, joined with the Atrebates and Veromandui against them; and having first secured their wives and children, made a vigorous resistance for some time; but were at length defeated, and the greatest part of them slain. The rest, with their wives and old men, surrendered themselves, and were allowed to live in their own cities and towns as formerly. The Aduatuci were next subdued; and, for their treachery to the conqueror, were sold for slaves, to the number of 50,000. Young Crassus, the son of the triumvir, subdued likewise seven other nations, and took possession of their cities; which not only completed the conquest of the Belgae, but brought several nations from beyond the Rhine to submit to the conqueror. The Veneti, or ancient inhabitants of Vannes in Brittany, who had been likewise obliged to send hostages to the conqueror, were, in the mean time, making great preparations by sea and land to recover their liberty. Caesar, then in Illyricum, was forced to equip a fleet on the Loire; and having given the command of it to Brutus, went and defeated them by land, as Brutus did by sea; and having put their chief men to death, sold the rest for slaves. The Unelli, with Veridorix their chief, together with the Lexovii and Aulerci, were about the same time subdued by Sabinus, and the Aquitani by Crassus, with the loss of 30,000 men. There remained nothing but the countries of the Morini and Menapii to be conquered of all Gaul. Caesar marched himself against them: but he found them so well entrenched in their inaccessible fortresses, that he contented himself with burning and ravaging their country; and having put his troops into winter quarters, again passed over the Alps, to have a more watchful eye on some of his rivals there. He was, however, soon after obliged to come to defend his Gaulish conquests against some nations of the Germans, who were coming to settle there, to the number of 400,000. These he totally defeated, and then resolved to carry his conquering arms into Germany; but for an account of his exploits there, see the article GERMANY.\n\nUpon his return into Gaul, he found it labouring under a great famine, which had caused a kind of universal revolt, but was subdued. Cotta and Sabinus, who were left in the country of the Eburones, now Liege, were betrayed into an ambush by Ambiorix, one of the Gaulish chiefs, and had most of their men cut off. The Aduatuci had fallen upon Q. Cicero, who was left there with one legion, and had reduced him to great straits: at the same time Labienus, with his legion, was attacked by Indutiomarus, at the head of the Rhemi and Senones; but had better luck than the rest, and by one bold fall upon them, put them to flight, and killed their general. Caesar acquired no small credit by quelling all these revolts; but each victory lost the lives of so many of his troops, that he was forced to have recourse to Pompey for a fresh supply, who readily granted him two of his own legions to secure his Gaulish conquests.\n\nBut it was not long before the Gauls, ever restless under a foreign yoke, raised up a new revolt, and obliged him to return thither. His fear lest Pompey should gain the affections of the Roman people, had obliged him to strip the Gauls of their gold and silver, to bribe them over to his interest; and this gave no small handle to those frequent revolts which happened during his absence. He quickly, however, reduced the Nervii, Aduatuci, Menapii, and Treviri; the last of whom had raised the revolt, under the command of Ambiorix: but he found the flame spread much farther, even to the greatest part of the Gauls, who had chosen Vercingetorix their generalissimo. Caesar was forced to leave Insubria, whither he had retired to watch the motions of Pompey, and, in the midst of winter and snow, to repass the Alps into the province of Narbonne. Here he gathered his scattered troops with all possible speed; and, in spite of the hard weather, besieged and took Noviodunum, now Noyons; and defeated Vercingetorix, who was come to the relief of that place. He\nnext took the city of Avaricum, now Bourges, one of the strongest in Gaul, and which had a garrison of 40,000 men; of whom he made such a dreadful slaughter, that hardly 800 escaped. Whilst he was besieging Gergovia, the capital of the Arverni, he was informed that the Nitiobriges, or Agenois, were in arms; and that the \u00c6dui were sending to Vercingetorix 10,000 men, which they were to have sent to reinforce Caesar. Upon this news, he left Fabius to carry on the siege, and marched against the \u00c6dui. These, upon his approach, submitted, in appearance, and were pardoned; but soon after that whole nation rose up in arms, and murdered all the Italian troops in their capital. Caesar, at this, was in great straits what measures to take; but resolved at length to raise the siege of Gergovia, and at once attack the enemy's camp, which he did with some success; but when he thought to have gone to Noviodunum, or Noyons, where his baggage, military chest, &c. were left, he heard that the \u00c6dui had carried it off, and burnt the place. Labienus, justly thinking that Caesar would want his assistance in the condition he now was, went to join him, and in his way defeated a Gaulish general named Camulogenes, who came to oppose his march; but this did not hinder the revolt from spreading itself all over Celtic Gaul, whither Vercingetorix had sent for fresh supplies, and, in the meantime, attacked Caesar; but was defeated, and forced to retire to Alesia, a strong place, now Alise in Burgundy, as is supposed. Hither Caesar hastened, and besieged him; and having drawn a double circumvallation, with a design to starve him in it, as he was likely to have done, upon that account refused all offers of a surrender from him. At length, the long-expected reinforcement came, consisting of 160,000 men, under four generals: these made several fruitless attacks on Caesar's trenches; but were defeated in three several battles, which at length obliged Vercingetorix to surrender at discretion. Caesar used all his prisoners with great severity, except the \u00c6dui and Arverni, by whose means he hoped to gain their nations, which were the most potent of Celtic Gaul: nor was he disappointed; for both of them submitted to him, and the former received him into the capital, where he spent the winter, after he put his army into winter quarters. This campaign, as it proved one of the hardest he ever had, so he gained more glory by it than any Roman general had done before: yet could not at all by this procure from the servile senate, now wholly dedicated to his rival, a prolongation of his proconsulship; upon which he is reported to have laid his hand upon his sword, and said, that that should do it.\n\nHe was as good as his word; and the Gauls, upon their former ill success, resolving to have as many separate armies as provinces, in order to embarrass him the more, Caesar, and his generals Labienus and Fabius, were forced to fight them one after another; which they did, however, with such success, that notwithstanding the hardness of the season, they subdued the Bituriges, Carnutes, Rheni, and Bellocaci, with their general Correus, by which he at once quieted all the Belgic provinces bordering on Celtic Gaul. The next who followed were the Treviri, the Eburones, and the Andes, under their general Dunnacus. The last place which held out against him was Uxellodunum; which was defended by the two last acting generals of the Gauls, Drapes the Senonian, and Luterius the Cadurcean. The place being strong and well garrisoned, Caesar was obliged to march thither from the farthest part of Belgic Gaul; and soon after reduced it, for want of water. Here again he caused the right hands of all that were fit to bear arms to be cut off, to deter the rest from revolting afresh. Thus was the conquest Gaul reduced of Gaul finished from the Alps and Pyrenees to the Rhine, all which vast tract was now reduced to a Roman province under the government of a praetor. During his several expeditions into Gaul, Caesar is said to have taken 800 cities; to have subdued 300 different nations; and to have defeated, in several battles, three millions of men, of whom one million were killed, and another taken prisoners.\u2014The history of the country, from the time of its conquest by the Romans to the present, is given under the articles Rome and France.\n\nThe Gauls anciently were divided into a great number of different nations, which were continually at war &c. of the ancient Gauls, but even almost all families, were divided and torn by factions; and this undoubtedly facilitated the conquest of the whole. The general character of all these people was an excessive ferocity and love of liberty. This last they carried to such an extreme, that either on the appearance of servitude, or incapacity of action through old age, wounds, or chronic diseases, they put an end to their own lives, or prevailed upon their friends to kill them. In cities, when they found themselves so strictly besieged that they could hold out no longer, instead of thinking how to obtain honourable terms of capitulation, their chief care very often was to put their wives and children to death, and then to kill one another, to avoid being led into slavery. Their excessive love of liberty and contempt of death, according to Strabo, very much facilitated their conquest by Caesar; for pouring their numerous forces upon such an experienced enemy, as Caesar, their want of conduct very soon proved the ruin of the whole.\n\nThe chief diversion of the Gauls was hunting; and indeed, considering the vast forests with which their country abounded, and the multitude of wild beasts which lodged in them, they were under an absolute necessity to hunt and destroy them, to prevent the country from being rendered totally uninhabitable. Besides this, however, they had also their hippodromes, horse and chariot races, tilts and tournaments; at all of which the bards assisted with their poems, songs, and musical instruments.\u2014For an account of their religion, see the article Druid.\n\nThe Gauls were excessively fond of feasting, in which they were very profuse; as, like all other northern nations, they were great lovers of good eating and drinking. Their chief liquors were beer and wine. Their tables were very low. They ate but little bread, which was baked flat and hard, and easily broken in pieces: but devoured a great deal of flesh, boiled, roasted, or broiled; and this they did in a very slovenly manner, holding the piece in their hands, and tearing it with their teeth. What they could not part by this way, they cut with a little knife which hung at their girdle.

The word is said by Lambert to be compounded of three Saxon words, gyfe, eal, kyn, \"omnibus cognatione proximis data.\" Vertefegan calls it gavelkind, quafi \"give all kind,\" that is, to each child his part; and Taylor, in his history of gavelkind, derives it from the British gavel, i.e. a hold or tenure, and cened, \"generatio aut familia;\" and so gavel cened might signify tenura generationis.\u2014It is universally known what struggles the Kentish men made to preserve their ancient liberties, and with how much success those struggles were attended. And as it is principally here that we meet with the custom of gavelkind (though it was and is to be found in some other parts of the kingdom), we may fairly conclude, that this was a part of their liberties; agreeable to Mr Selden's opinion, that gavelkind, before the Norman conquest, was the general custom of the realm. The distinguished properties of this tenure are various: some of the principal are these: 1. The tenant is of age sufficient to alienate his estate by feoffment, at the age of 15. 2. The estate does not escheat in case of an attainder and execution for felony; their maxim being, \"the father to the bough, the son to the plough.\" 3. In most places he had the power of divesting lands by will, before the statute for that purpose was made. 4.

In 1712 we find him secretary, or rather domestic steward, to the duchess of Monmouth, in which station he continued till the beginning of the year 1714; at which time he accompanied the earl of Clarendon to Hanover, whither that nobleman was despatched by Queen Anne. In the latter end of the same year, in consequence of the queen's death, he returned to England, where he lived in the highest estimation and intimacy of friendship with many...\nmany persons of the first distinction both in rank and abilities.\u2014He was even particularly taken notice of by Queen Caroline, then princess of Wales, to whom he had the honour of reading in manuscript his tragedy of the Captives; and in 1726 dedicated his Fables, by permission, to the duke of Cumberland.\u2014From this countenance shown to him, and numberless promises made him of preferment, it was reasonable to suppose, that he would have been genteelly provided for in some office suitable to his inclination and abilities. Instead of which, in 1727, he was offered the place of gentleman usher to one of the young princesses; an office which, as he looked on it as rather an indignity to a man whose talents might have been so much better employed, he thought proper to refuse; and some pretty warm remonstrances were made on the occasion by his sincere friends and zealous patrons the duke and duchess of Queensberry, which terminated in those two noble personages withdrawing from court in disgust. Mr Gay's dependencies on the promises of the great, and the disappointments he met with, he has figuratively described in his fable of the Hare with many friends. However, the very extraordinary success he met with from public encouragement made an ample amends, both with respect to satisfaction and emolument, for those private disappointments.\u2014For, in the season of 1727-8, appeared his Beggar's Opera; the vast success of which was not only unprecedented, but almost incredible.\u2014It had an uninterrupted run in London of 63 nights in the first season, and was renewed in the ensuing one with equal approbation. It spread into all the great towns of England; was played in many places to the 30th and 40th time, and at Bath and Bristol 50; made its progress into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, in which last place it was acted for 24 successive nights; and last of all it was performed at Minorca. Nor was the fame of it confined to the reading and representation alone, for the card table and drawing room shared with the theatre and closet in this respect; the ladies carried about the favourite songs of it engraven upon their fan mounts; and screens, and other pieces of furniture were decorated with the same. In short, the satire of this piece was so striking, so apparent, and so perfectly adapted to the taste of all degrees of people, that it overthrew the Italian opera, that Dagon of the nobility and gentry, which had so long seduced them to idolatry, and which Dennis, by the labours and outcries of a whole life, and many other writers by the force of reason and reflection, had in vain endeavoured to drive from the throne of public taste. The profits of this piece were so very great, both to the author and Mr Rich the manager, that it gave rise to a quibble, which became frequent in the mouths of many, viz. That it had made Rich gay, and Gay rich; and it has been asserted, that the author's own advantages from it were not less than \u00a32000. In consequence of this success, Mr Gay was induced to write a second part to it, which he entitled Polly. But the disgust subsisting between him and the court, together with the misrepresentations made of him as having been the author of some disaffected libels and seditious pamphlets, occasioned a prohibition and suppression of it to be sent from the lord chamberlain, at the very time when everything was in readiness for the rehearsal of it. A very considerable sum, however, accrued to him from the publication of it afterwards in quarto.\u2014Mr Gay wrote several other pieces in the dramatic way, and many very valuable ones in verse. Among the latter, his Trivia, or the Art of Walking the Streets of London, though his first poetical attempt, is far from being the least considerable, and is what recommended him to the esteem and friendship of Mr Pope: but as, among his dramatic works, his Beggar's Opera did at first, and perhaps ever will, stand as an unrivalled masterpiece, so, among his poetical works, his Fables hold the same rank of estimation; the latter having been almost as universally read as the former was represented, and both equally admired. Mr Gay's disposition was sweet and affable, his temper generous, and his conversation agreeable and entertaining. But he had one foible, too frequently incident to men of great literary abilities, and which subjected him at times to inconveniences which otherwise he needed not to have experienced, viz. an excess of indolence, without any knowledge of economy. So that, though his emoluments were, at some periods of his life, very considerable, he was at others greatly straitened in his circumstances; nor could he prevail on himself to follow the advice of his friend Dean Swift, whom we find in many of his letters endeavouring to persuade him to the purchasing of an annuity, as a reserve for the exigencies that might attend on old age.\u2014Mr Gay chose rather to throw himself on patronage, than secure to himself an independent competency by the means pointed out to him; so that, after having undergone many vicissitudes of fortune, and being for some time chiefly supported by the liberality of the duke and duchess of Queensberry, he died at their house in Burlington gardens, in December 1732. He was interred in Westminster Abbey, and a monument erected to his memory, at the expense of his aforementioned noble benefactors, with an inscription expressive of their regards and his own deserts, and an epitaph in verse by Mr Pope.","sp":83,"ep":84},{"h":"GAZA","t":"Theodore, a famous Greek in the 15th century, was born in 1398.

The city was anciently an emporium and fortress of Sablestan, not far from the confines of India. During the vast and rapid conquests of the Arabs, all this country had been reduced under their subjection. On the decline of the power of the caliphs, however, the vast empire established by Mahomet and his successors was divided into a number of independent principalities, most of which were but of short duration. In the year of the Hegira 384, answering to the 994th of the Christian era, the city of Gazna, with some part of the adjacent country, was governed by Mahmud Gazni; who became a great conqueror, and reduced under his subjection a considerable part of India and most of Persia.\n\nThis empire continued in the family of Mahmud Gazni for upwards of 200 years. None of his successors, however, were possessed of his abilities; and therefore the extent of the empire, instead of increasing, was very considerably diminished soon after Mahmud's death. The Seljuks made themselves masters of Khorasan, and could not be driven out; the greatest part of the Persian dominions also fell off; and in the 347th year of the Hegira, the race of Gazni sultans was entirely set aside by one Gauri, who conquered Gazna. Khofru Shah the reigning prince, and bestowed his dominions on his own nephew Gayathoddin Mohammed. These new sultans proved greater conquerors than the former, and extended their dominions farther than even Mahmud Gazni himself had done. They did not however, long enjoy the sovereignty of Gazna; for in 1218, Jenghiz Khan having conquered the greatest part of China and almost all Tartary, began to turn his arms westward; and set out against the sultan of Gazna at the head of 700,000 men.\n\nTo oppose this formidable army, Mohammed, the reigning sultan, could muster only 400,000 men; and, in the first battle, 160,000 of his troops are said to have perished. After this victory, Jenghiz Khan advanced; Mohammed not daring to risk a second battle, the loss of which would have been attended with the entire ruin of his kingdom. He therefore distributed his army among the strongest fortified towns he had in his dominions; all of which Jenghiz Khan took one after another. The rapid progress of his conquests, indeed, almost exceeds belief. In 1219 and 1220, he had reduced Zarnuk, Nur, Bokhara, Otrar, Sagannak, Uzkant, Alhath, Jund, Tonkat, Khojend, and Samarcan. Mohammed, in the mean time, fled first to Bokhara; but on the approach of Jenghiz Khan's army, quitted that place, and fled to Samarcan. When this last city was also in danger of being invested, the sultan did not think proper to trust himself in it more than in the other, though it was garrisoned by 110,000 of his bravest troops; and therefore fled through byways into the province of Ghilan in Persia, where he took refuge in a strong fortress called Eflabod. But being also found out in this retreat, he fled to an island in the Caspian sea called Abijan; where he ended his days, leaving his empire, such as it was, to his son Jaloloddin.\n\nThe new sultan was a man of great bravery and experience in war; but nothing was able to stop the progress of the Moguls. In 1220 and 1221, they made themselves masters of all the kingdoms of Karazim and Khorasan, committing everywhere such massacres as were never heard of before or since that time. In the meantime Jaloloddin assembled his forces with the utmost diligence, and defeated two detachments of the Mogul army. This happened while Jenghiz Khan was besieging Bamiyan; but answered little other purpose, than serving to bring upon that city the terrible destruction of which an account is given under the article BAMIYAN. Immediately after the reduction of that city, Jenghiz Khan marched towards Gazna; which was very strongly fortified, and where he expected to have found Jaloloddin. But he had left the place 15 days before; and, as Jenghiz Khan's army was much reduced, he might perhaps have stood his ground, had it not been for an accident. He had been lately joined by three Turkish commanders, each of whom had a body of 10,000 men under his command. After his victories over the Moguls, these officers demanded the greatest share of the spoils; which being refused, they separated themselves from the sultan. He used his utmost endeavours to make them hearken to reason; and sent several messengers and letters to them, representing the inevitable ruin which must attend their separation, as Jenghiz Khan\nGazna was advancing against them with his whole army. At last they were persuaded to lay aside their animosities; but it was now too late; for Jenghiz Khan, being informed of what passed, detached 60,000 horse to prevent their joining the sultan's army; who, finding himself deprived of this powerful aid, retired towards the river Indus. When he was arrived there, he stopped in a place where the stream was most rapid and the place confined, with a view both to prevent his soldiers from placing any hopes of safety in flight, and to hinder the whole Mogul army from attacking him at once. Ever since his departure from Gazna he had been tormented with a colic; yet, at a time when he suffered most, hearing that the enemy's vanguard was arrived at a place in that neighbourhood called Herder, he quitted his litter, and, mounting a horse, marched with some of his chosen soldiers in the night; surprized the Moguls in their camp; and having cut them almost all in pieces, without the loss of a single man on his side, returned with a considerable booty.\n\nJenghiz Khan, finding by this that he had a vigilant enemy to deal with, proceeded with great circumspection. When he came near the Indus, he drew out his army in battalia: to Jagatay, one of his sons, he gave the command of the right wing; to Oktay, another son, he gave the command of the left: and put himself in the centre, with 6000 of his guards. On the other side, Jaloloddin prepared for battle like one who had no resource but in victory. He first sent the boats on the Indus farther off; reserving only one to carry over his mother, wife, and children: but unluckily the boat split when they were going to embark, so that they were forced to remain in the camp. The sultan took to himself the command of the main body of the army. His left wing, drawn up under shelter of a mountain which hindered the whole right wing of the Moguls from engaging at once, was commanded by his vizir; and his right by a lord named Amin Malek. This lord began the fight; and forced the enemy's left wing, notwithstanding the great disparity of numbers, to give ground. The right wing of the Moguls likewise wanting room to extend itself, the sultan made use of his left as a body of reserve, detaching from thence some squadrons to the affiance of the troops who stood in need of them. He also took one part of them with him when he went at the head of his main body to charge that of Jenghiz Khan; which he did with so much resolution and vigour, that he not only put it in disorder, but penetrated into the place where Jenghiz Khan had originally taken his station: but that prince, having had a horse killed under him, was retired from thence, to give orders for all the troops to engage.\n\nThis disadvantage had like to have lost the Moguls the battle; for a report being immediately spread that the enemy had broken through the main body, the troops were so much disconcerted, that they would certainly have fled, had not Jenghiz Khan encouraged them by riding from place to place in order to show himself. At last, however, Jaloloddin's men, who were in all but 30,000, having fought a whole day with ten times their number, were seized with fear and fled. One part of them retired to the rocks which were on the shore of the Indus, where the enemy's horse could not follow them; others threw themselves into the river, where many were drowned, though some had the good fortune to cross over in safety; while the rest surrounding their prince, continued the fight through despair. The sultan, however, considering that he had scarce 7000 men left, began to think of providing for his own safety: therefore, having bidden a final adieu to his mother, wife, and children, he mounted a fresh horse, and spurred him into the river, which he crossed in safety, and even stopped in the middle of it to insult Jenghiz Khan, who was now arrived at the bank. His family fell into the hands of the Moguls; who killed all the males, and carried the women into captivity.\n\nJaloloddin being now securely landed in India, got up into a tree in order to preserve himself from wild beasts. Next day, as he walked melancholy among the rocks, he perceived a troop of his soldiers, with some officers, three of whom proved to be his particular friends. These, at the beginning of the defeat, had found a boat in which they had sailed all night, with much danger from the rocks, shelves, and rapid current of the river. Soon after, he saw 500 horse coming towards him; who informed him of 4000 more that had escaped by swimming over the river; and these also soon after joined the rest. In the meantime an officer of his household, named Jamalarrazad, knowing that his master and many of his people were escaped, ventured to load a very large boat with arms, provisions, money, and stuff to clothe the soldiers; with which he crossed the river. For this important service Jaloloddin made him steward of his household, and named him the Ghofor or the Glory of the Faith. For some time after, the sultan's affairs seemed to go on prosperously: he gained some battles in India; but the princes of that country, envying his prosperity, conspired against him, and obliged him to repass the Indus. Here he again attempted to make head against the Moguls; but was at last defeated and killed by them, and a final end put to the once mighty empire of Gazna.\n\nThe metropolis was reduced by Otkay; who no sooner entered the country in which it was situated, than he committed the most horrid cruelties. The city was well provided with all things necessary for sustaining a siege; had a strong garrison, and a brave and resolute governor. The inhabitants, expecting no mercy from Jenghiz Khan, who they knew had sworn their ruin, were resolved to make a desperate defence. They made frequent forays on the besiegers, several times overthrew their works, and broke above 100 of their battering rams. But one night, after an obstinate fight, part of the city walls fell down; and a great number of Moguls having filled up the ditch, entered the city sword in hand. The governor perceiving all was lost, at the head of his bravest soldiers rushed into the thickset of his enemies, where he and his followers were all slain. However, Gazna was not entirely destroyed, nor were the people all killed; for after the massacre had continued for four or five hours, Otkay ordered it to cease, and taxed those who were left alive at a certain rate, in order to redeem themselves and the city. It does not, however, appear that after this time the city of Gazna ever made any considerable figure.\u2014It was taken by the Moguls in the year 1222.\nGEBRES.

The invention, first practised by Ged in 1725, was simply this. From any types of Greek or Roman, or any other character, he formed a plate for every page, or sheet, of a book, from which he printed, instead of using a type for every letter, as is done in the common way. This was first practised, but on blocks of wood, by the Chinese and Japanese, and pursued in the first essays of Coffer the European inventor of the present art. \"This improvement (says James Ged the inventor's son) is principally confederate in three most important articles, viz., expense, correctness, beauty and uniformity.\"\n\nIn July 1729, William Ged entered into partnership with William Fenner, a London stationer, who was to have half the profits, in consideration of his advancing all the money requisite. To supply this, Mr John James, then an architect at Greenwich (who built Sir Gregory Page's house, Bloomsbury church, &c.) was taken into the scheme, and afterwards his brother Mr Thomas James, a letter founder, and James Ged the inventor's son. In 1730, these partners applied to the university of Cambridge for printing Bibles and common prayer books by blocks instead of single types; and, in consequence, a leaf was sealed to them, April 23, 1731. In their attempt they sunk a large sum of money, and finished only two prayer books; so that it was forced to be relinquished, and the leaf was afterwards given up. Ged imputed his disappointment to the villany of the pressmen, and the ill treatment of his partners (which he specifies at large), particularly Fenner, whom John James and he were advised to prosecute, but declined it. He returned to Scotland in 1736, where he gave his friends a specimen of his performance, by an edition of Sallust. But being still unsuccessful, and having failed in obtaining redress from Fenner, who died insolvent, he was preparing again to set out for London, in order to join with his son James as a printer there, when he died October 19, 1749. Ged's son attempted unsuccessfully, in 1751, to revive this invention; Messrs Tilloch and Foulis about the year 1782 practised it on a small scale at Glasgow; and of late years many beautiful editions of the classics have been printed in this way by Didot of Paris.*","sp":87,"ep":87},{"h":"GEDDES","t":"ALEXANDER, a learned Scots catholic divine and eminent bible critic, was born in the parish of Ruthven in Banffshire, in the year 1737. His parents were respectable, although not opulent. His father was a farmer, who deemed no trouble too great, in order to procure for his children as liberal an education as possible. Both father and mother were of the catholic persuasion, and the only book of consequence which the former had in his library was an English translation of the bible, in which young Geddes was instructed with such care and attention, that he was able to give an account of the history of it before he had reached the eleventh year of his age. The first instructions he received, after those of his parents, were communicated by a school-mistress in the vicinity, by whom he was so much distinguished, that it became the first mental gratification which, in his own opinion, he ever felt. He was next put under the tuition of a young man from the city of Aberdeen, who had been engaged by the laird for the education of his own children; and afterwards went to a place called Scalcan, in the Highlands, where those were to be trained up who designed to devote themselves to the catholic priesthood, and to finish their education at some foreign university. Here it was, in this obscure retreat, that Geddes laid the foundation of that intimate acquaintance with the learned languages, by which he was so eminently distinguished in the subsequent part of his life. He went to the Scots university at Paris in the year 1758, and soon after began the study of rhetoric in the college of Navarre. By the strength of his genius and his indefatigable attention, he was soon at the head of this class, although he had to contend with two veterans, and became the favourite of Vicaire the professor, whose friendship lasted to the close of life.\n\nInstead of entering into the philosophical class at the usual time, he studied that subject at home, in order to facilitate his theological studies, on which he entered under M. M. Bur\u00e9 and de Sauvent, at the college of Navarre, and Lavocat at the Sorbonne was his Hebrew preceptor. So great, or rather astonishing, was his progress, that Professor Lavocat urged him strongly to continue at Paris; but his friends prevailed with him to return to his native country in 1764. His first charge as a priest was in a catholic chapel in the county of Angus, from which he removed to Traquair in 1765, and became chaplain to the earl of that name, where he remained for about three years. This situation was most agreeable to his literary pursuits, as he had unlimited access to a very extensive library, which greatly assisted him in the prosecution of his darling studies. He left the earl's house in the year 1768, and returned to Paris, where he devoted his time during the following winter to the perusal of books and manuscripts in the king's libraries, making large extracts from scarce copies, particularly such as were in the Hebrew tongue.\n\nIn the spring of 1769, he returned to his native country, and became pastor of a congregation at Auchinharig in Banffshire, where he was for some time involved in pecuniary difficulties, out of which he was extricated by the liberality of the then duke of Norfolk. These were occasioned by the debts he incurred in building a new chapel for his flock, and in making the parson's house one of the neatest and most convenient in Scotland. With the view of bettering his circumstances he commenced farmer; but as he had to borrow money to stock his farm, and as the crops failed for three successive seasons, he was under the necessity of abandoning this scheme in a much poorer state than when he\nGeddes first projected it. But his unwearied exertions, joined to the assistance of friends, again relieved him, and he was enabled to discharge every claim against him of a pecuniary nature in an honourable manner.\n\nIn the year 1779 he resigned his pastoral charge at Auchinhalrig, which was a heavy stroke to the members of his congregation, as the zeal and diligence with which he discharged the duties of his ministerial function had endeared him to all. He was also justly esteemed for his attention to the instruction of youth. Next year the university of Aberdeen conferred on him the degree of L.L.D., a literary honour which was never bestowed on any Roman-catholic by that body since the Reformation. He afterwards went to London, that he might prosecute his favourite studies with greater facility, and give the world his English translation of the Old and New Testament, to which he had turned his attention for a number of years. He officiated for some months after his arrival in the imperial ambassador's chapel in Duke-street, till the term of Easter 1782, at which time it was suppressed by order of the emperor Joseph II, after which Dr Geddes seems to have declined entirely the exercise of his clerical functions.\n\nNo sooner had the design of Mr Geddes, relative to a new translation of the Bible been made public, than he met with formidable opposition from his Catholic brethren; an event which the doctor with good reason seems to have anticipated. His own words on this occasion were: \"I expect not excessive profits from excessive exertion. I trust I shall never want meat, and clothes, and fire; to a philosophical and contented mind, what more is necessary?\" He was many years employed in preparing this important work for the press, before he had any prospect of adequate success. In addressing the English Catholics on the subject of his translation, he has these memorable words: \"At any rate, I do what I think my duty to do, and do it fairly and openly. In the following pages ye will find neither palliation nor disguise. I pour out my sentiments with the same sincerity as if I were before the tribunal of Him who is to judge the living and the dead. Mistake I may, but prevaricate I never will.\" He discovered this noble spirit in every action of his life, and in all his transactions and intercourse with mankind, although he did not conciliate the regard of those who could have bestowed upon him the most effectual assistance.\n\nAfter spending much of his life in biblical studies, he met with a long and cruel interruption, of which he thus speaks: \"I had but little hope of ever living in a situation to resume them, when Providence threw me into the arms of such a patron as Origen himself might have been proud to boast of\u2014a patron, who, for these ten years past, has, with a dignity peculiar to himself, afforded me every convenience that my heart could desire towards the carrying on and completing of my arduous work.\"\n\nIt is needless to inform the public, that the patron to whom the learned doctor here alludes was Lord Petre. For this munificence continued through the whole of his life, and even beyond it by his latter will, Christians of every denomination will feel sentiments of gratitude, when they are qualified to make a true estimate of the advantages of free and impartial enquiry.\n\nIn the year 1792, the first volume of his translation was published, dedicated to his patron Lord Petre, containing the first six books of the Old Testament. Soon after this volume made its appearance, three apostolic vicars, calling themselves the bishops of Rama, Acanthos and Centurie, issued a pastoral letter addressed to their respective flocks over which they presided, warning them against the reception of Dr Geddes's translation. In his reply to the bishop of Centurie we find these words: \"Perhaps, my lord, you wish to have another occasion of exercising your episcopal authority, and of playing with censures as children do with a new ball.\u2014I with your lordship much joy of the bauble; but however, my lord, beware of playing too often with it. Read St Chrysothem on Ecclesiastical Censures, and learn from him a little more moderation. Permit an old priest to tell you, that it is a very great ornament in a young bishop. As to myself, my lord, I am not afraid of your threats, and shall laugh at your censures as long as I am conscious that I deserve them not.\u2014You cannot hinder me from praying at home; and at home I will pray, in defiance of your censure, as often as I please. The chief Bishop of our fools is always accessible; and through him I can, at all times, have free access to the Father, who will not reject me, but for voluntary unrepented crimes. In the panoply of conscious innocence, the whole thunder of the Vatican would in vain be levelled at my head.\"\n\nThe second volume of his translation, owing to a variety of interruptions, did not make its appearance till the year 1797, to which was prefixed a dedication to her royal highness the duchess of Gloucester, as an \"early, spontaneous, and liberal encourager of the work.\" In this volume the doctor gives up, and boldly combats, the absolute inspiration of scripture, believing that the Hebrews, like all other historians, wrote from such human documents as they could find, and were of consequence liable to similar mistakes. This latitude of thinking naturally led the doctor to give up as fabulous, and wholly unworthy of the divine philanthropy, every command, precept, and injunction, which appeared unworthy even of human authority. He denied of consequence, that the command given to destroy the Canaanites could have God for its author. His volume of Critical Remarks was published in 1800, in which he enters into an able vindication of his own theory, which rather increased than diminished the number of his enemies, for as he wrote to please no party, he foretold that he would have enemies in every party, and so it happened.\n\nDr Geddes was a man of extensive literature, uncommon liberality of thinking, the friend of all mankind; a man of integrity, honour and benevolence; in the strictest sense of the word, a truly genuine Catholic, and whose love of truth was so invincible, that neither hopes nor fears could induce him to conceal it.\n\nHis prospectus of a new translation of the Bible in 4to was published in 1786, and a letter to the bishop of London on the same subject in 1787. His proposals were printed in 1788. As a controversial writer, Dr Geddes was eminently distinguished by his letter to Dr Priestley, in defence of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and by one to a member of parliament, on the expediency of a general repeal of the penal statutes.\nGeddes, tutes which have a respect to religious opinions. In the spring of the year 1800, he published an apology for the Roman Catholics of Great Britain, in which he zealously defended his peculiar tenets, but displayed a commendable moderation, when he mentioned the injuries to which he himself and brethren were subjected by the continuance of persecuting laws; and, when he argued in behalf of abolishing all legal disabilities, he discovered the profoundest logical understanding.\n\nWe shall close our short account of this great man in the words of one who was well acquainted with him, and fully qualified to appreciate his merits. \"It must be lamented, that, in the death of Dr Geddes, the world has lost the services of a man, who by his acute and penetrating genius\u2014his various, profound, and extensive erudition\u2014his deep research\u2014his indefatigable application\u2014and his independent, dignified, and unfettered spirit, rising superior to the prejudices of education; nobly disdaining the shackles of system; spurning the petty temporizing arts of unworthy accommodation; and setting at defiance all the terrors of malignity, bigotry, and intolerance, was supereminently qualified for the great, laborious, and important work in which he had, for a long series of years, been engaged, of giving an English version of the venerable literary remains of sacred antiquity, the scriptures of the Old and New Testament. During his life, this work did not meet with encouragement adequate to the magnitude of the design; or, it may be added, to the merit of the execution. In this last respect, it will be matter of surprise to all who are competent to judge of the nature of such an enterprise, how much has been done, and with what unceasing ability and success. It everywhere displays the skilful hand of a master.\"\n\nHe had corrected and prepared his translation for the press up to the hundredth and eighteenth psalm, when he was seized with a most painful and excruciating distemper, which put a period to his ineffable life on the 26th of February 1802. The learned world will unquestionably have cause to lament, that Dr Geddes was arrested by the hand of death in the midst of his career, unless that unexpected phenomenon, another Geddes, should make his appearance, and happily finish what his extraordinary predecessor conducted so far with such astonishing abilities;\u2014but, rara avis in terris.","sp":87,"ep":89},{"h":"GEHENNA","t":"a scripture term which has given some pain to the critics.

When but 13 years of age he discovered a poetical genius; but having none to guide his taste for this kind of composition, he was led to imitate Gunther, Neukerch, and Hanke, men of indifferent abilities. He studied theology at Leipzig in 1734, and returned home at the expiration of four years, when he commenced public speaking; but his timid disposition prevented him from shining as an orator in the pulpit. The delicacy of his constitution forbidding him to aspire after extensive learning, he confined himself to the acquisition of that which might render him useful. He was much respected for his first attempts in poetry, called Amusements of Reason and Wit, which appeared in 1742.\n\nThe labour which he found requisite for the composition of fables, inclined him to lay aside the clerical profession, and devote himself wholly to the instruction of youth, in which he not only diffused knowledge through the minds of his pupils, but also inspired them with the love of religion and virtue. He was made A.M. in 1744, and published the first volume of his fables in the ensuing year. His \"Swedish Countess\" was the first German romance deserving of notice. He gave the world the second part of his fables in 1748, although two years before this period he was much afflicted with hypochondriacal affections. In 1751, he was solicited to accept the office of extraordinary professor of philosophy, together with a decent salary, which was augmented on the termination of the war.\n\nAfflicted by unconquerable lowness of spirits and confirmed melancholy, he still exhibited the same patience, resignation, and universal philanthropy as he had ever shewn, and which excited the admiration of the enemy during the war.

He contributed much to the improvement of the taste and morals of his countrymen, and their gratitude for his services made them deeply lament his loss.

If it would indicate too much partiality to call him a genius of the first class, he certainly was a most agreeable and fertile writer; the poet to whom religion and virtue are deeply indebted; an able reformer of public manners, and fonder of affording consolation, than of plunging into despondency.

Their hardness is commonly\ncommonly allowed to stand in the following order: The diamond the hardest of all; then the ruby, sapphire, jacinth, emerald, amethyst, garnet, carnelian, chalcedony, onyx, jasper, agate, porphyry, and marble. This difference, however, is not regular and constant, but frequently varies. Good crystals may be allowed to succeed the onyx; but the whole family of metallic glassy fluors seems to be still softer.\u2014In point of colour, the diamond is valued for its transparency, the ruby for its purple, the sapphire for its blue, the emerald for its green, the jacinth for its orange, the amethyst for its carnelian, the onyx for its tawny, the jasper, agate, and porphyry, for their vermillion, green, and variegated colours, and the garnet for its transparent blood red.\n\nAll these gems are sometimes found coloured and spotted, and sometimes quite limpid and colourless. In this case the diamond cutter or polisher knows how to distinguish their different species by their different degrees of hardness upon the mill. For the cutting or polishing of gems, the fine powder of the fragments of those that are next in degree of hardness is always required to grind away the softer; but as none of them are harder than the diamond, this can only be polished by its own powder.\n\nCronstedt observes of gems in general, that the colour of the ruby and emerald are laid to remain in the fire, while that of the topaz flies off: hence it is usual to burn the topaz, and thence substitute it for the diamond. \"Their colours (says our author) are commonly supposed to depend upon metallic vapours; but may they not justly be supposed to arise from a phlogiston united with a metallic or some other earth? because we find that metallic earths which are perfectly well calcined give no colour to any glass: and that the manganese, on the other hand, gives more colour than can be ascribed to the small quantity of metal which is to be extracted from it.\" M. Magellan is of opinion, that their colour is owing chiefly to the mixture of iron which enters their composition; but approves the sentiment of Cronstedt, that phlogiston has a share in their production, it being well known that the calces of iron when dephlogisticated produce the red and yellow colours of marble, and when phlogisticated to a certain degree produce the blue or green colours.\n\nWith regard to the texture of gems, M. Magellan observes, that all of them are foliated or laminated, and of various degrees of hardness. Whenever the edges of these laminae are sensible to the eye, they have a fibrous appearance, and reflect various shades of colour, which change successively according to their angular motion to the eye. These are called by the French chatoyantes; and what is a blemish in their transparency, often enhances their value on account of their scarcity. But when the substance of a gem is composed of a broken texture, consisting of various sets of laminae differently inclined to each other, it emits at the same time various irradiations of different colours, which succeed one another according to their angle of position. This kind of gems has obtained the name of opals, and are valued in proportion to the brilliancy, beauty, and variety of their colours. Their crystallization, no doubt, depends on the same cause which produces that of salts, earths, and metals, which is treated of under the article Crystallization. The following table shows the component parts of gems according to the analysis of Bergman and M. Achard; the letter B prefixed to each denoting Bergman's analysis, and A that of Achard.\n\n| Gem | Argil. | Silic. Calc. Iron. |\n|-----|-------|-------------------|\n| Red oriental ruby, | B 40 | 39 9 10 |\n| Ditto, | A 37.5 | 42.5 9 11 |\n| Blue oriental sapphire, | B 58 | 35 5 2 |\n| Ditto, | A 58 | 33 6 3 |\n| Yellow topaz from Saxony, | B 46 | 39 8 6 |\n| Green oriental emerald, | B 60 | 24 8 6 |\n| Ditto, | A 60 | 23 10 7 |\n| Yellow brown orient. hyacinth, | B 40 | 25 20 13 |\n| Ditto, | A 42 | 22 20 16 |\n| Tourmalin from Ceylon, | B 39 | 37 15 9 |\n| Ditto from Brazil, | B 50 | 34 11 5 |\n| Ditto from Tyrol, | B 42 | 40 12 6 |\n| Garnet from Bohemia, | A 30 | 48 11 10 |\n\nBut later analyses show that the component parts are different from the above, particularly the colouring matters which are here ascribed to iron. See Mineralogy.\n\nThe chrysopeira from Koseinitz in Silesia was likewise analyzed by M. Achard; who found that it contained 4.56 grains of siliceous earth, 13 of calcareous, 5 of magnetite, three of copper, and two of iron. \"This (says M. Magellan) seems to be the only gem that contains no argillaceous earth.\"\n\nImitation or Counterfeiting of Gems in Glass. The art of imitating gems in glass is too considerable to be passed without notice: some of the leading compositions therein we shall mention upon the authority of Neri and others.\n\nThese gems are made of pastes; and are noway inferior to the native stones, when carefully made and well polished, in brightness or transparency, but want their hardness.\n\nThe general rules to be observed in making the pastes are these: 1. That all the vessels in which they are made be firmly luted, and the lute left to dry before they are put into the fire. 2. That such vessels be chosen for the work as will bear the fire well. 3. That the powders be prepared on a porphyry stone; not in a metal mortar, which would communicate a tinge to them. 4. That the just proportion in the quantity of the several ingredients be nicely observed. 5. That the materials be all well mixed; and, if not sufficiently baked the first time, to be committed to the fire again, without breaking the pot; for if this be not observed, they will be full of blisters and air bladders. 6. That a small vacancy be always left at the top of the pot, to give room to the swelling of the ingredients.\n\nTo make paste of extreme hardness, and capable of all the colours of the gems, with great lustre and beauty.\u2014Take of prepared crystal, ten pounds; fat of polverine, five pounds; sulphur of lead, two pounds: mix all these well together into a fine powder; make the whole with common water into a hard paste; and make this paste into small cakes of about three ounces weight each, with a hole made in their middle; dry them in the sun, and afterwards calcine them in the flintell part of a potter's furnace. After this, pow-\nder them, and levigate them to a perfect fineness on a porphyry stone, and let this powder in pots in a glass furnace to purify for three days; then cast the whole into water, and afterwards return it into the furnace, where let it stand 15 days, in which time all foulnesses and blisters will disappear, and the paste will greatly resemble the natural jewels. To give this the colour of the emerald, add to it bras thrice calcined; for a sea green, bras simply calcined to a redness; for a sapphire, add zaffer, with manganese; and for a topaz, manganese and tartar. All the gems are thus imitated in this, by the same way of working as the making of coloured glasses; and this is so hard, that they very much approach the natural gems.\n\nThe colour of all the counterfeit gems made of the several pastes, may be made deeper or lighter according to the work for which the stones are designed; and it is a necessary general rule, that small stones for rings, &c. require a deeper colour, and large ones a paler. Besides the colours made from manganese, verdigris, and zaffer, which are the ingredients commonly used, there are other very fine ones which care and skill may prepare. Very fine red may be made from gold, and one not much inferior to that from iron; a very fine green from bras or copper; a sky colour from silver, and a much finer one from the granates of Bohemia.\n\nA very singular and excellent way of making the paste to imitate the coloured gems is this: Take a quantity of saccharum saturni, or sugar of lead, made with vinegar in the common way; set it in sand, in a glass body well luted from the neck downwards; leave the mouth of the glass open, and continue the fire 24 hours; then take out the salt, and if it be not red but yellowish, powder it fine, and return it into the vessel, and keep it in the sand heat 24 hours more, till it becomes as red as cinnamon. The fire must not be made so strong as to melt it, for then all the process is spoiled. Pour distilled vinegar on this calcined salt, and separate the solution from the dregs; let the decanted liquor stand six days in an earthen vessel, to give time for the finer sediments to subside; filter this liquor, and evaporate it in a glass body, and there will remain a most pure salt of lead; dry this well, then dissolve it in fair water; let the solution stand six days in a glazed pan; let it subside, then filter the clear solution, and evaporate it to a yet more pure white and sweet salt; repeat this operation three times; put the now perfectly pure salt into a glass vessel, set it in a sand heat for several days, and it will be calcined to a fine impalpable powder of a lively red. This is called the sulphur of lead.\n\nTake all the ingredients as in the common composition of the pastes of the several colours, only instead of red lead, use this powder; and the produce will well reward the trouble of the operation, as experience has often proved.\n\nA paste proper for receiving colours may be readily made by well pounding and mixing five pounds of white sand cleansed, three pounds of red lead, two pounds of purified pearl-ashes, and one pound of nitre. A softer paste may be made in the same manner, of five pounds of white sand cleansed; red lead, and purified pearl-ashes, of each three pounds; one pound of nitre, half a pound of borax, and three ounces of arsenic. For common use a pound of common salt may be substituted for the borax. This glass will be very soft, and will not bear much wear if employed for rings, buckles, or such imitations of stones as are exposed to much rubbing; but for ear-rings, ornaments worn on the breast, and those little used, it may last a considerable time.\n\nIn order to give paste different colours, the process is as follows: For\n\nAmethyst. Take ten pounds of either of the compositions described under Colouring of Glass, one ounce and a half of manganese, and one drachm of zaffer; powder and fuse them together.\n\nBlack. Take ten pounds of either of the compositions just referred to, one ounce of zaffer, six drachms of manganese, and five drachms of iron, highly calcined; and proceed as before.\n\nBlue. Take of the same composition, ten pounds; of zaffer, six drachms; and of manganese, two drachms; and proceed as with the foregoing.\n\nChrysolite. Take of either of the compositions for paste above described, prepared without saltpetre, ten pounds, and of calcined iron five drachms; and pursue the same process as with the rest.\n\nRed Cornelian. Take of the compositions mentioned under Colouring of Glass, two pounds; of glass of antimony, one pound; of the calcined vitriol called scarlet ochre, two ounces; and of manganese, one drachm. Fuse the glass of antimony and manganese with the composition; then powder them, and mix them with the other, by grinding them together, and fuse them with a gentle heat.\n\nWhite Cornelian. Take of the composition just referred to, two pounds; of yellow ochre well washed, two drachms; and of calcined bones, one ounce. Mix them, and fuse them with a gentle heat.\n\nDiamond. Take of the white sand, five pounds; of red lead, four pounds; of pearl ashes, purified, three pounds; of nitre two pounds; of arsenic five ounces; and of manganese, one scruple. Powder and fuse them.\n\nEagle-marine. Take ten pounds of the composition under Glass; three ounces of copper highly calcined with sulphur; and one scruple of zaffer. Proceed as before.\n\nEmerald. Take of the same composition with the last nine pounds; three ounces of copper precipitated from aquafortis; and two drachms of precipitated iron. See Emerald, Mineralogy Index.\n\nGarnet. Take two pounds of the composition under Glass; two pounds of the glass of antimony, and two drachms of manganese. For vinegar garnet, take of the composition for paste, described in this article, two pounds; one pound of glass of antimony, and half an ounce of iron, highly calcined; mix the iron with the uncoloured paste, and fuse them; then add the glass of antimony powdered, and continue them in the heat till the whole is incorporated.\n\nGold or full Yellow. Take of the composition for paste ten pounds; and one ounce and a half of iron strongly calcined; proceeding as with the others.\n\nDeep Purple. Take of either of the compositions for paste, ten pounds; of manganese, one ounce; and of zaffer, half an ounce.\n\nRuby. Take one pound of either of the compositions\nMuch of the success in the art of making coloured stones depends on the accurate proportion of the substances made use of to form the crystal which serves as a base to the facitious stones. After having tried a great variety of receipts, our author found they might be reduced to the following:\n\n1. Take two parts and a half of lead in scales, one part and a half of rock crystal or prepared flints, half a part of nitre, as much borax, and a quarter part of glas of arfenic. These being well pulverized and mixed together, are to be put into a Hessian crucible, and submitted to the fire. When the mixture is well melted, pour it into cold water; then melt it again a second and a third time; taking care, after each melting, to throw it into fresh cold water, and to separate from it the lead that may be revived. The same crucible should not be used a second time, because the glas of lead is apt to penetrate it in such a manner as to run the risk of losing the contents. One must also be careful to cover the crucible well, to prevent any coals getting into it, which would reduce the calx of lead, and spoil the composition.\n\n2. Take two parts and a half of white ceruse, one part of prepared flints, half a part of salt of tartar, and a quarter part of calcined borax; melt the mixture in a Hessian crucible, and then pour it into cold water; it is then to be melted again, and washed a second and a third time, the same precautions being observed as for the first base.\n\n3. Take two parts minium, one part rock crystal, half a part of nitre, and as much salt of tartar; this mixture being melted, must be treated as the former.\n\n4. Take three parts of calcined borax, one part of prepared rock crystal, and one part of salt of tartar; these being well mixed and melted together, must be poured into warm water; the water being decanted and the mass dried, an equal quantity of minium must be added to it; it is then to be melted and washed several times as directed above.\n\n5. That called by our author the Mayence Base, and which he considers as one of the finest crystalline compositions hitherto known, is thus composed: Take three parts of fixed alkali of tartar, one part of rock crystal or flint pulverized; the mixture to be well baked together, and then left to cool. It is afterwards poured into a crucible of hot water to dissolve the frit; the solution of the frit is then received into a stone-ware pan, and aquafortis added gradually to the solution till it no longer effervesces; this water being decanted, the frit must be washed in warm water till it has no longer any taste; the frit is then dried, and mixed with one part and a half of fine ceruse or white lead in scales; and this mixture must be well levigated with a little distilled water. To one part and a half of this powder dried add an ounce of calcined borax; let the whole be well mixed in a marble mortar, then melted and poured into cold water as the other bases already described. These fusions and lotions having been repeated, and the mixture dried and powdered, a 12th part of nitre must be added to it, and then melted for the last time; when a very fine crystal will be found in the crucible.\n\n6. As a composition for furnishing very fine white stones: Take eight ounces of ceruse, three ounces of rock\nrock crystal pulverized, two ounces of borax finely powdered, and half a grain of manganese: having melted and washed this mixture in the manner directed above, it will produce a very fine white crystal.\n\nII. Of the Colours. The calces of metals, as already observed, are the substances employed to colour fictitious gems; and on the preparation of these calces depends the vividness of their colours.\n\na. From Gold.] To obtain the mineral purple known by the name of precipitate of Caffius, M. Fontanieu employs the following different processes.\n\n1. Dissolve some pure gold in aqua regia, prepared with three parts of precipitated nitrous acid and one part of marine acid; and to hasten the dissolution, the matras should be placed in a sand bath. Into this solution pour a solution of tin in aqua regia. The mixture becomes turbid, and the gold is precipitated with a portion of the tin, in the form of a reddish powder; which, after being washed and dried, is called precipitate of Caffius.\u2014The aqua regia employed to dissolve the tin is composed of five parts of nitrous acid and one part of marine acid: to eight ounces of this aqua regia, are added fifteen ounces of distilled water. Some leaves of Malacca tin, about the size and thickness of a finger, are then put into this diluted aqua regia, till it will dissolve no more of them: which operation our author observes, requires commonly twelve or fourteen days; though it might probably be hastened by beating the tin still thinner, and then rolling it into the form of a hollow cylinder, or turning it round into spiral convolutions, and thus exposing a greater extent of surface to the action of the menstruum. In order to prepare more readily the precipitate of Caffius, M. Fontanieu puts into a large jug eight ounces of solution of tin, to which he adds four pints of distilled water: he afterwards pours into this metallic lye some solution of gold, drop by drop, taking care to stir the whole with a glass tube: when the mixture becomes of a deep purple colour, he ceases dropping the solution of gold; and in order to hasten the precipitation of the mineral purple, pours into the mixture a pint of fresh urine. Six or seven hours after, the precipitate is collected at the bottom of the vessel: the fluid is then decanted; and the precipitate, washed once or twice, is dried till it becomes a brown powder.\n\n2. Pour into a vessel of fine tin with a thick bottom four ounces of the solution of gold; three minutes after add two pints of distilled water. Let this mixture stand in the tin vessel during seven hours, taking care to stir it every hour with a glass tube; afterwards pour it into a conical glass jug, and add to it a pint of new urine: the mineral purple is soon precipitated, and then is to be washed and dried.\n\n3. Distil in a glass retort placed in a bath of ashes, some gold dissolved in aqua regia, made with three parts nitrous and one part marine acid; when the acid is passed over and the gold contained in the retort appears dry, leave the vessel to cool, then pour into it some new aqua regia, and proceed to distill as before. Replace the aqua regia twice upon the gold, and distil the same. After these four operations, pour by little and little into the retort some oil of tartar per deliquium, which will occasion a brisk effervescence: when this ceases, distil the mixture till it becomes dry, and then put some warm water into the retort. Shake the whole and pour it into a cucurbit, when a precipitate is deposited, the colour of which is sometimes brown and sometimes yellow: After having washed this precipitate, dry it. Our author says, this mineral purple was much superior to the foregoing, since two grains of it only were sufficient to an ounce of the base, whilst it required of the other two a 20th part of the base. And he adds, that he found a means of exalting the colour of the precipitate of Caffius, by putting to it a sixth part of its weight of glas of antimony finely powdered, and of nitre in the proportion of a drachm to eight ounces of the base.\n\nb. From Silver.] The oxide of silver, being vitrified, produces a yellowish gray colour. This oxide enters only into the composition of the yellow artificial diamond and the opal. M. Fontanieu introduces it into the base in the form of luna cornea.\n\nIn order to prepare it, he directs to dissolve the silver in precipitated nitrous acid, and afterwards to pour into it a solution of sea salt: a white precipitate is obtained; which, being washed and dried, melts very readily in the fire, and is soon volatilized if not mixed with vitrifiable matters. To make the yellow diamond, 25 grains of this luna cornea are put to an ounce of the fourth base: the dose of silver may be diminished according to the shade of yellow that one wishes to procure.\n\nc. From Copper.] The oxide of copper imparts to white glass the finest green colour; but if this metal be not exactly in a state of oxide, it produces a brownish red colour. Mountain blue verdigris, and the residue of its distillation, are the different preparations of copper which our author employs to make the artificial emeralds.\n\nd. From Iron.] Although it has been asserted that the oxides of iron introduce a very fine transparent red colour into white glass, M. Fontanieu could only obtain from it a pale red a little opake. The oxide of iron that he employed was in the proportion of the 20th part of the base.\n\nThere are several ways of preparing the oxide of iron called crocus Martis, or saffron of Mars. In general, it is necessary that this metal be too far oxidated that the magnet ceases to attract it: thus one may use the scales of iron found upon the bars of the furnaces, which serve to distil aquafortis. By digesting filings of steel with distilled vinegar, then evaporating and replacing the vinegar 10 or 12 times upon these filings and drying them alternately, an oxide of iron is obtained, which must be sifted through a silk sieve, and then calcined. The oxide of iron thus obtained by the vinegar, our author says, only introduced into his bases a green colour inclining to a yellow.\n\nBy the following process a saffron of Mars of the finest red colour is obtained: Let an ounce of iron filings be dissolved in nitrous acid in a glass retort, and distilled over a sand bath to dryness. After having replaced the acid or the dry oxide, and re-distilled it a second and a third time, it is then edulcorated with spirits of wine, and afterwards washed with distilled water.\n\ne. From the Magnet.] It is necessary to calcine the magnet before it be introduced into the vitrifications: Having therefore torrefied the magnet during two hours,\nhours, it must be washed and dried. It is only employed in the composition of the opal.\n\nf. From Cobalt.] The oxide of cobalt is only proper to introduce a blue colour into glass; but this metal is rarely found free from iron and bismuth, and therefore it is first necessary to separate them from it. This is done by calcining the ore of cobalt in order to disengage the arsenic; afterwards the oxide must be distilled in a retort with sal ammoniac, and the iron and the bismuth are found sublimed with this salt. The distillation must be repeated with the sal ammoniac till this salt is no longer coloured yellow. The cobalt which remains in the cornute is then calcined in a potter's wheel, and becomes a very pure oxide; which being introduced into the base, in the proportion of a good part, gives it a very fine blue colour, the intensity of which may be increased at discretion by the addition of oxide of cobalt. In order to prepare black enamel resembling that which is called black agate of Iceland; melt together a pound and a half of one of the bases, two ounces of the oxide of cobalt, two ounces of crocus Martis prepared with vinegar, and two ounces of manganese.\n\ng. From Tin.] The oxide of tin, which is of a white colour, renders opake the glass with which it is melted, and forms white enamel. For this purpose, calcine the putty of tin; then wash and dry it, and sift it through a silk sieve. Take six pounds of the second base, the same quantity of the calcined putty of tin, and 49 grains of manganese.\n\nh. From Antimony.] Antimony is only susceptible of vitrification in a certain state of oxidation, and then it produces a reddish or hyacinth coloured glass; but if the antimony be in a state of absolute calx, such as the diaphoretic antimony, then it is no longer vitrifiable, and may be substituted for oxide of tin to make white enamel. M. Fontanieu introduces the glass of antimony in the composition of artificial topazes. For the oriental topaz, he takes 24 ounces of the first base, and five drachms of the glass of antimony. To imitate the topaz of Saxony, he adds to each ounce of the base five grains of the glass of antimony. For the topaz of Brazil, he takes 24 ounces of the first base, one ounce 24 grains of glass of antimony, and 8 grains of the precipitate of Cassius.\n\ni. From Manganese.] This mineral employed in a small quantity, renders the glass whiter; a larger quantity produces a very fine violet colour, and a still larger dose of it renders the glass black and opake.\n\nThere are two ways of preparing manganese. 1. The most simple consists in exposing it to a red heat, and then quenching it with distilled vinegar; it is afterwards dried and powdered, in order to pass it through a silk sieve. 2. Haudiquier de Blancour describes the second manner of preparing the manganese, proper to furnish a red colour, and names it fusible manganese. Take of manganese of Piedmont one pound; torrefy and pulverize it; then mix it with a pound of nitre, and calcine the mixture during 24 hours; afterwards wash it repeatedly in warm water, till the water of the eyes has no longer any taste; dry the manganese, and mix with it an equal weight of sal ammoniac; levigate this mixture on a flab of porphyry with oil of vitriol diluted with water to the strength of vinegar. Dry the mixture, and introduce it into a cornute; distil by a graduated fire; and when the sal ammoniac is sublimed weigh it, and add to the mixture an equal quantity. Then distil and sublimate as before, and repeat the operation five times, being careful at each time to mix the sal ammoniac and the manganese upon the porphyry with diluted oil of vitriol.\n\nAt Tourninait in Bohemia, there is sold a fusible glass of a yellow colour, very like that of the topaz of Brazil, which, when exposed to a degree of fire in a cupel sufficient to redden it, becomes of a very fine ruby colour, more or less deep according to the degree of fire to which it has been exposed. Our author assayed this glass, and found it to contain a great deal of lead, but was not able to discover any gold in it.\n\nIII. Of the different degrees of fire necessary for Factitious Gems. Our author observes, that there are three degrees of heat very different in their energy. The fire kept up in the wind furnaces in the laboratories of chemists, is less active than that whose effect is accelerated by the means of bellows; and a fire supported by wood, and kept up during 60 hours without interruption, produces singular effects in vitrification, and renders the glass finer and less alterable.\n\nWhen recourse is had to the forge, in order to operate a vitrification, it is necessary to turn about the crucible from time to time, that the mass may melt equally. Some coal also should be replaced, in proportion as it consumes towards the nozzle of the bellows; for without this precaution, we should run the risk of cooling the crucible opposite to the flame, and probably of cracking it, when all the melted mass running among the coals would be totally lost. Though this is the readiest way of melting, it should not be employed out of choice; for the crucible often breaks, or coals get into it, which may reduce the lead to the metallic state.\n\nThe wind furnace is either square or round. A small cake of baked clay or brick, of the thickness of an inch, is placed upon the grate; and upon this cake is placed the crucible, surrounded with coals. The degree of heat produced by this furnace is much less than that of the forge; but in order to succeed in the vitrification, M. Fontanieu recommends the use of a furnace described by Kunckel, of which, the interior part is so disposed, that we may place crucibles at three different heights; and the name of chambers is given to those steps upon which the crucibles are placed.\n\nIt is obvious, that the degree of heat cannot be equal in the said three chambers. In the first or lowest chamber the heat is greatest; afterwards in the next, and lastly, in the highest. We should begin by placing the crucibles according to their size, in these different chambers; by which means the best effect in vitrification is produced.\n\nIn order to conduct the fire well, only three billets of white wood should be put into the furnace at a time for the first 20 hours, four billets at a time for the next 20 hours, and six billets for the last 20 hours; in all 60 hours. The furnace is then left to cool, care being taken to stop the air holes with some lute; and in about 48 hours after, when the kiln is quite cold, the crucible is to be withdrawn.\n\nIV. The Compositions. 1. For the white diamond:\nTake the base of Mayence. This crystal is very pure, and has no colours.\n\n2. For the yellow diamond: To an ounce of the fourth base, add for colour 25 grains of luna cornea or 10 grains of glas of antimony.\n\n3. For the emerald: 1. To 15 ounces of either of the bases, add for colour one drachm of mountain blue and six grains of glas of antimony; or, 2. To an ounce of the second base, add for colour 20 grains of glas of antimony and three grains of calx of cobalt.\n\n4. For the sapphire: To 24 ounces of the Mayence base, add for colour two drachms 46 grains of the calx of cobalt.\n\n5. For the amethyst: To 24 ounces of the Mayence base, add for colour four drachms of prepared manganese and four grains of precipitate of Cassius.\n\n6. For the beryl: To 24 ounces of the third base, add for colour 96 grains of glas of antimony and four grains of calx of cobalt.\n\n7. For the black agate: To 24 ounces of either of the bases, add two ounces of the mixture directed above in par. f.\n\n8. For the opal: To an ounce of the third base, add for colour 10 grains of luna cornea, two grains of magnet, and 26 grains of absorbent earth.\n\n9. For the oriental topaz: To 24 ounces of the first or third base, add for colour five drachms of glas of antimony.\n\n10. For the topaz of Saxony: To 24 of the same base, add for colour six drachms of the glas of antimony.\n\n11. For the topaz of Brazil: to 24 ounces of the second or third base, add for colour one ounce 24 grains of the glas of antimony and eight grains of precipitate of Cassius.\n\n12. For the hyacinth: To 24 ounces of the base made with rock crystal, add for colour two drachms 48 grains of glas of antimony.\n\n13. For the oriental ruby: 1. To 16 ounces of the Mayence base, add for colour a mixture of two drachms 48 grains of the precipitate of Cassius, the same quantity of crocus Martis prepared in aquafortis, the same of golden sulphur of antimony and of fusible manganese, with the addition of two ounces of mineral crystal: or, 2. To 20 ounces of the base made with flint, add half an ounce of fusible manganese and two ounces of mineral crystal.\n\n14. For the balas ruby: 1. To 16 ounces of the Mayence base, add the above colouring powder, but diminished a fourth part; or, 2. To 20 ounces of the base made with flints, add the same colouring powder, but with a fourth less of the manganese.\n\nThe fictitious gems are easily distinguished from the natural, by their softness and fusibility; by their solubility in acids; by their causing only a single refraction of the rays of light; and in many cases, by their specific gravity, which exceeds 2.76 in all precious gems of the first order, as the diamond, ruby, sapphire, &c.\n\nImitation of Antique Gems. There has been at different times a method practised by particular persons of taking the impressions and figures of antique gems, with their engravings, in glas of the colour of the original gem. This has always been esteemed a very valuable method, and greatly preferable to the more ordinary ones of doing it on sealing wax or brimstone; but, to the misfortune of the world, this art being a secret only in the hands of some particular persons who got their bread by it, died with them, and every new artist was obliged to re-invent the method; till at length Mr Homberg having found it in great perfection, gave the whole process to the world to be no more forgotten or lost; and since that time it has been very commonly practised in France, and sometimes in other places.\n\nMr Homberg was favoured in his attempts with all the engraved gems of the king's cabinet; and took such elegant impressions, and made such exact resemblances of the originals, and that in glasses so artfully tinged to the colour of the gems themselves, that the nicest judges were deceived in them, and often took them for the true antique stones. The counterfeit gems also serve, as well as the original ones, to make more copies from afterwards; so that there is no end of the numbers that may be made from one; and there is this farther advantage, that the copy may be easily made perfect, though the original should not be so, but should have sustained some damage from a blow or otherwise.\n\nThe great care in the operation is to take the impression of the gem in a very fine earth, and to press down upon this a piece of proper glas, softened or half melted at the fire, so that the figures of the impression made in the earth may be nicely and perfectly expressed upon the glas. In general, the whole process much resembles that of the common founders. But when it is brought to the trial, there is found a number of difficulties which were not to be foreseen, and which would not at all affect the common works of the founder. For his purpose, every earth will serve that is fine enough to receive the impressions, and tough enough not to crack in the drying: these all serve for their use, because the metals which they cast are of a nature incapable of mixing with earth, or receiving it into them, even if both are melted together, so that the metal always easily and perfectly separates itself from the mould; but it is very difficult in these casts of glas. They are composed of a matter which differs in nothing from that of the mould, but that it has been run into this form by the force of fire, and the other has not yet been so run, but is on any occasion ready to be so run, and will mix itself inseparably with the glas in a large fire: consequently, if there be not great care used, as well in the choice of the glas as in the manner of using it, when the whole is finished there will be found great difficulty in separating the glas from the mould; and often this cannot be done without wholly destroying the impression.\n\nAll earths run more or less easily in the fire as they are more or less mixed with saline particles in their natural formation. As all salts make earths run into glas, and as it is necessary to use an earth on this occasion for the making a mould, it being also necessary to the perfection of the experiment that this earth should not melt or run, it is our business to search out for this purpose some earth which naturally contains very little salt. Of all the species of earth which Mr Homberg examined on this occasion, none proved so much\nmuch divested of salts, or so fit for the purpose, as the common tripela, or Trifoli, used to polish glass and stones. Of this earth there are two common kinds: the one reddish, and composed of several flake or strata; the other yellowish, and of a simple structure. These are both to be had in the shops. The latter kind is from the Levant; the former is found in England, France, and many other places. The tripela must be chosen soft and smooth to the touch, and not mixed with sandy or other extraneous matter. The yellowish kind is the best of the two, and is commonly called Venetian tripoli. This receives the impressions very beautifully; and never mixes with the glass in the operation, which the red kind sometimes does. Mr Homburg usually employed both kinds at once in the following manner: first powder a quantity of the red tripela in an iron mortar, and fitting it through a fine sieve set it by for use; then scrape with a knife, a quantity of the yellow tripela into a sort of powder, and afterwards rub it till very fine in a glass mortar with a glass pestle. The finer this powder is, the finer will be the impression, and the more accurately perfect the cast. The artificer might naturally suppose, that the best method to obtain a perfect fine powder of this earth would be by washing it in water; but he must be cautioned against this. There is naturally in this yellowish tripoli a sort of uncleanness, which when it is formed into a mould keeps granules together, and gives the whole an uniform glossy surface; now the washing the powder takes away this uncleanness; and though it renders it much finer, it makes it leave a granulated surface, not this smooth one, in the mould; and this must render the surface of the cast less smooth.\n\nWhen the two tripelas are thus separately powdered, the red kind must be mixed with so much water as will bring it to the consistence of paste, so that it may be moulded like a lump of dough between the fingers: this paste must be put into a small crucible of a flat shape, and about half an inch or a little more in depth, and of such a breadth at the surface as is a little more than that of the stone whose impression is to be taken. The crucible is to be nicely filled with this paste lightly pressed down into it, and the surface of the paste must be strewed over with the fine powder of the yellow tripela not wetted. When this is done, the stone, of which the impression is to be taken, must be laid upon the surface, and pressed evenly down into the paste with a finger and thumb, so as to make it give a strong and perfect impression; the tripela is then to be pressed nicely even to its sides with the fingers, or with an ivory knife. The stone must be thus left a few moments, for the humidity of the paste to moisten the dry powder of the yellow tripela which is strewed over it: then the stone is to be carefully raised by the point of a needle fixed in a handle of wood; and the crucible being then turned bottom upwards, it will fall out, and the impression will remain very beautifully on the tripoli.\n\nIf the sides of the cavity have been injured in the falling out of the stone, they may be repaired; and the crucible must then be set, for the paste to dry, in a place where it will not be incommoded by the dust.\n\nThe red tripoli being the more common and the cheaper kind, is here made to fill the crucible only to save the other, which alone is the substance fit for taking the impression. When the stone is taken out, it must be examined, to see whether any thing be lodged in any part of the engraving, because if there be any of the tripela left there, there will certainly be so much wanting in the impression. When the crucible and paste are dry, a piece of glass must be chosen of a proper colour, and cut to a size proper for the figure; this must be laid over the mould, but in such a manner that it does not touch the figures, otherwise it would spoil them. The crucible is then to be brought near the furnace by degrees, and gradually heated till it cannot be touched without burning the fingers; then it is to be placed on the furnace under a muffle, surrounded with charcoal. Several of these small crucibles may be placed under one muffle; and when they are properly disposed, the aperture of the muffle should have a large piece of burning charcoal put to it, and then the operator is to watch the process, and see when the glass begins to look bright: this is the signal of its being fit to receive the impression. The crucible is then to be taken out of the fire; and the hot glass must be pressed down upon the mould with an iron instrument to make it receive the regular impression: as soon as this is done, the crucible is to be set at the side of the furnace out of the way of the wind, that it may cool gradually without breaking. When it is cold, the glass is to be taken out, and its edges should be grated round with pincers, which will prevent its flying afterwards, which is an accident that sometimes happens when this caution has been omitted, especially when the glass is naturally tender. The different coloured glasses are of different degrees of hardness, according to their composition; but the hardest to melt are always the best for this purpose, and this is known by a few trials.\n\nIf it be desired to copy a stone in relief which is naturally in creux, or to take one in creux which is naturally in relief, there needs no more than to take an impression first in wax or sulphur, and to mould that upon the paste of tripela instead of the stone itself; then proceeding in the manner before directed, the process will have the desired success.\n\nA more simple and easy method than the above, is by taking the casts in gypsum, or plaster of Paris as it is commonly called. For this purpose, the gypsum must be finely pulverized, and then mixed with clear water to the consistence of thick cream. This is poured upon the face of the gem or seal of which the impression is wanted, and which must be previously moistened with oil to facilitate the separation of the cast; and in order to confine the liquid plaster, it is only necessary to pin a slip of oiled paper round the sides of the seal by way of a cap or rim. When the plaster is dry, it is to be taken off, and set before the mouth of the furnace, in order to free it entirely from moisture; when it is fit to be used as a matrix in the same way as that formed with the tripoli earths. Only no crucible or other receptacle is at all necessary; the casts being formed like so many small cakes half an inch thick, and thus put into the furnace with bits of glass upon them. The glass, after coming to a proper heat, is pressed down upon the mould with an iron spatula to receive the desired impression, the pressure requisite being more or less according to the size of the stone. This method has been long practised very successfully, and\nwith no small emolument, by that ingenious seal engraver Mr Deuchar of Edinburgh. The only respect in which it is inferior to the other more operose and expensive methods, consists in the chance of air bubbles arising in pouring on the platter; which chance, however, is less in proportion to the fineness of the gypsum employed. When air bubbles do occur, the casts may be laid aside, as it is easy to replace them.\n\nThe application of pastes to multiply and preserve the impressions of cameos and intaglios, is an object very interesting to artists and antiquaries, as well as to men of learning and taste in the fine arts.\n\nThis art, though only lately restored in any degree of perfection, is of very considerable antiquity. The great prices which the ancients paid for the elegant gems engraved by the celebrated Greek artists, could not but early suggest to them the idea of multiplying their numbers, by taking off their impressions in wax, in sulphur, in plaster, or in clay; but more particularly in coloured glass, or that vitrified substance commonly called pate.\n\nAs the impressions on paste are durable, and imitate the colours and brilliancy of the original stones, they serve the same purposes as the gems themselves. This art was therefore practised not only by the Greeks, but by all the nations who cultivated Grecian taste.\n\nMany of the finest gems of antiquity are now lost, and their impressions are to be found only on ancient pastes. Great therefore is the value of these pastes. Numerous collections of them have been formed by the curious. Instances of this are found in the Florentine Museum, in Stoch's work on ancient gems with inscriptions, in Winckelmann's description of Stoch's cabinet, and in the noble collection of Mr Charles Townley in London.\n\nThe art of taking impressions of gems seems not to have been altogether lost even in the Gothic ages; for Heraclius, who probably lived in the ninth century, and wrote a book *De coloribus et artibus Romanorum*, teaches in very plain though not elegant terms how to make them. Indeed, some of the few persons who then possessed this art, taking advantage of the ignorance of the times, sold pastes for original gems. Thus the famous emerald of the abbey of Reichnau near Constance, although a present made by Charlemagne, is now found to be a piece of glass. And thus the celebrated emerald vase in the cathedral of Genoa is likewise found to be a piece of paste (a). The Genoese got this vase at the taking of Cefalu in the year 1101 as an equivalent for a large sum of money; nor was any imposition then suspected, for in the year 1319 they pawned it for 1200 marks of gold.\n\nBut this ingenious art, revived indeed in Italy in the time of Laurence of Medici and Pope Leo X. was not cultivated in an extensive manner till the beginning of the present century, when M. Homberg restored it, as already mentioned. In this he is said to have been greatly assisted and encouraged by the then duke of Orleans regent of France, who used to amuse himself with that celebrated chemist in taking off impressions in paste from the king of France's, from his own, and other collections of gems.\n\nAccording to the French Encyclopedists, M. Clanchant the elder, an engraver of some note, who died at Paris in 1781, learned this art from his royal highness, to whose household his father or he seems to have belonged. Mademoiselle Feloix next cultivated this art, and it is believed still carries it on. She had been taught by her father, who in quality of gar\u00e7on de chambre to the regent had often assisted in the laboratory of his master, where he acquired this knowledge. Her collection consists of 1800 articles.\n\nBaron Stoch, a Prussian, who travelled over Europe in quest of original engraved stones and impressions of ancient gems, for the elegant work which he published and Picart engraved (b), was well acquainted with this art. He had taught it to his servant Christian Dehn, who settled at Rome, where he made and sold his well-known sulphur impressions and pastes. He had collected 2500 articles. Dolce has arranged them in a scientific order, and given a descriptive catalogue of them.\n\nIt was chiefly from Dehn's collection that the taste for sulphurs and pastes has become so universal. They are great objects of study, and often require much learning to explain them. They have unquestionably served to extend and improve the art of engraving on stones; and have been of infinite use to painters, to statuaries, and to other artists, as well as to men of classical learning and fine taste.\n\nIt is very difficult to take off impressions, and perfectly to imitate various-coloured cameos. It cannot be properly done in wax, sulphur, plaster, or glas of one colour only. The difficulties arising from their size and form, and from the various nature of the different sorts of glas which do not well unite into different strata, are very numerous; nor could the completest success in this chemical and mechanical branch of the art produce a tolerable cameo. Impressions or imitations, if unassisted by the tool of the engraver, do not succeed; because the undercutting and deep work of most of the originals require to be filled up with clay or wax, that the moulds may come off safe without injuring them. Hence the impressions from these moulds come off hard and destitute of delicacy, sharpness, and precision of outline, till the underworking of the moulder is cut away. But Mr Reiffenstein at Rome, by his genius, perseverance, and the assistance of able artists, has overcome these difficulties; and has had the satisfaction of succeeding, and producing variegated cameos which can hardly be distinguished from the originals.\n\nMr Lippart of Dresden, an ingenious glazier, and an enthusiast in the fine arts, practised this branch not unsuccessfully; but not finding sufficient encouragement for his pastes of coloured glas, or perhaps from local difficulties in making them well and cheap, he abandoned\n\n---\n\n(a) See M. de la Condamine's Diff. in Memoir. de l'Acad. Roy. de Paris, 1757.\n(b) Gemmae antiquae coloratae, sculptorum nominibus insignitae, \u00e6re incise per Bernardum Picart. Amstelodam. 1724, folio.\nGem. done this art. He substituted in its place impressions of fine white alabaster or felsite plaster. Such impressions, when carefully soaked in a solution of white Castile soap, then dried, and rubbed over with a soft brush, take a very agreeable polish. They show the work perhaps to better advantage than red or white sulphur does; but they are not so durable, and are liable to be defaced by rubbing.\n\nOf these impressions Mr Lippart published three different collections, each of them containing 1000 articles; and to the merit of having increased the number of Mademoiselle Feloix's and Christiano Delin's collections, which are all inserted in his, he added that of employing two learned Germans to arrange and describe them. The first thousand were arranged and described by the late Professor Christ at Leipzig, and the second and third thousand by Professor Heine at Goettingen. Nor did Mr Lippart stop here; but to make the study of antiquity more easy and acceptable to artists, he selected out of the whole collection of 3000, a smaller one of 2000 of the best and more instructive subjects, of which he himself drew up and published a description in German.\n\nBut of all the artists and ingenious men who have taken impressions of engraved gems in sulphur and in paste, no one seems to have carried that art to such perfection as Mr James Taffie, a native of Glasgow, who resided in London from the year 1756 till his death. His knowledge in various branches of the fine arts, particularly in that of drawing, naturally led him to it. The elegant portraits which he modelled in wax, and afterwards moulded and cast in paste, and which entirely resemble cameos, are well known to the public.\n\nMr Taffie, profiting of all the former publications of this sort, and by expense, industry, and access to many cabinets in England and other kingdoms to which former artists had not obtained admittance, was enabled to increase his collection of impressions of ancient and modern gems to the number of above 15,000 articles. It is the greatest collection of this kind that ever existed; and serves for all the purposes of artists, antiquaries, scholars, men of taste, and even philosophers. The great demand for his pastes was perhaps owing in the beginning to the London jewellers, who introduced them into fashion by setting them in rings, seals, bracelets, necklaces, and other trinkets.\n\nThe reputation of this collection having reached the empress of Russia, she was pleased to order a complete set; which being accordingly executed in the best and most durable manner, were arranged in elegant cabinets, and are now placed in the noble apartments of her imperial majesty's superb palace at Czarsko Zelo.\n\nMr Taffie, in executing this commission, availed himself of all the advantages which the improved state of chemistry, the various ornamental arts, and the knowledge of the age, seemed to afford. The impressions were taken in a beautiful white enamel composition, which is not subject to shrink or form air bladders; which emits fire when struck with steel, and takes a fine polish; and which shows every stroke and touch of the artist in higher perfection than any other substance. When the colours, mixed colours, and nature of the respective originals, could be ascertained, they were imitated as completely as art can imitate them; infomuch that many of the pastes intaglios and cameos in this collection are such faithful imitations, that artists themselves have owned they could hardly be distinguished from the originals. And when the colour and nature of the gems could not be authenticated, the pastes were executed in agreeable, and chiefly transparent, colours; constant attention being bestowed to preserve the outlines, extremities, attributes, and inscriptions.\n\nIt was the learned Mr Raspe (from whom this account is taken) who arranged this great collection, and made out the descriptive catalogue. His arrangement is nearly the same with that of the late Abb\u00e9 Winkelmann, in his description of the gems which belonged to Baron Stofch. But as modern works were inserted in this collection, he found it necessary to make a few alterations, and added some divisions to those of M. Winkelmann, as will appear from the following conjectus, with which we shall conclude this detail.\n\nI.

C. Raspe, London, 1786, 8vo.\nThe word *gemara*, is commonly supposed to denote a supplement; but in strictness it rather signifies complement, perfection: being formed of the Chaldee words *gemar* or *ghemer*, \"to finish, perfect, or complete anything.\"\n\nThe rabbins call the Pentateuch simply the law: the first part of the Talmud, which is only an explication of that law, or an application thereof to particular cases, with the decisions of the ancient rabbins thereon, they call the *Mishnah*, i.e., \"second law;\" and the second part, which is a more extensive and ample explication of the same law, and a collection of decisions of the rabbins posterior to the Mishnah, they call *Gemara*, q.d., \"perfection, completion, finishing;\" because they esteem it the finishing of the law, or an explication beyond which there is nothing farther to be desired.\n\nThe Gemara is usually called simply *Talmud*, the common name of the whole work. In this sense we say, there are two Gemaras or Talmuds; that of Jerusalem and that of Babylon: though in strictness the Gemara is only an explication of the Mishnah, given by the Jewish doctors in their schools; much as the commentaries of our school divines on St Thomas, or the matter of the sentences, are an explication of the writings of those authors.\n\nA commentary, Mons. Tillemont observes, was wrote on the Mishnah, by one Johanan, whom the Jews place about the end of the second century: but Fa. Morin proves, from the work itself, wherein mention is made of the Turks, that it was not wrote till the time of Heraclius, or about the year 620; and this is what is called the Gemara, or *Talmud of Jerusalem*, which the Jews do not use or esteem much because of its obscurity.\n\nThey set a much greater value on the Gemara, or Talmud of Babylon, begun by one Afa; discontinued for 73 years, on occasion of the wars with the Saracens and Persians; and finished by one Jofa, about the close of the seventh century. See TALMUD.\n\nThough the name Talmud, in its latitude, includes both the Mishnah and the two Gemaras, yet it is properly that of Afa and Jofa alone which is meant under that name. This the Jews prize above all their other writings, and even set it on a level with Scripture itself: in effect, they conceive it as the word of God, derived by tradition from Moses, and preserved without interruption to their time. R. Jehuda, and afterwards R. Johanan, R. Afa, and R. Jofa, fearing the traditions should be lost in the dispersion of the Jews, collected them into the Mishnah and the Gemara.

He received his first instructions in music from Alessandro Scarlatti; and after that became a pupil of Carlo Ambroso Lunati, named *Il Gobbo*, a most celebrated performer on the violin; after which he became a disciple of Corelli, and under him finished his studies on that instrument. In the year 1714 he came to England; where Geminiani, in a short time he so recommended himself by his exquisite performance, that all who professed to love and understand music were captivated with hearing him. Many of the nobility laid claim to the honour of being his patrons; but he seemed chiefly to attach himself to Baron Kilmanegge, chamberlain to King George I. as elector of Hanover, and a favourite of that prince. In 1716, he published and dedicated to his patron 12 sonatas a violino violone e cembalo: the first six with fugues, or double stops as they are vulgarly called; the last with airs of various measures, such as allemandes, courantes, and jiggs. This publication was so well relished by the baron, that he mentioned Geminiani to the king as an excellent performer; in consequence of which our musician had the honour to perform before his majesty, in concert with the celebrated Handel, who played on the harpsichord. But though Geminiani was exceedingly admired, yet he had not a talent at associating music with poetry, nor do we find that he ever became a public performer: he was therefore obliged to depend for his subsistence on the friendship of his patrons and the profits which accrued to him from teaching. He had also the misfortune to be an enthusiast in painting; and the versatility of his temper was such, that, in order to gratify this passion, he not only suspended his studies, and neglected to exercise his talents, but involved himself in debts. In 1727, he was offered the place of master and composer of the state music in Ireland; but this could not be conferred on a Catholic, and Geminiani refused to change his religion: upon which it was given to Matthew Dubourg, a young man who had been one of his pupils, and was a celebrated performer on the violin. Geminiani then set himself to compose parts to the opera *quinta* of Corelli; or, in other words, to make concertos of the first six of his solos. This work he completed, and, with the help of a subscription, at the head of which were the names of the royal family, published in 1726. In 1732, he published his opera *seconda*, which contains a celebrated minuet that goes by his name. He published many other pieces, the profits of which did not much mend his circumstances; but this perhaps was owing to his rambling disposition and enthusiastic fondness of painting. He was also an utter stranger to the business of an orchestra, and had no idea of the labour and pains necessary in the instruction of fingers for the performance of music to which they were strangers. The consequence of this was, that a *concerto spirituale*, which he had advertised for his own benefit in 1748, failed in the performance. The audience, however, compassionated his distress, and sat very silent till the books were changed; when the performance was continued with compositions of the author's own, and which he executed in such a manner as was never forgot. The profits arising from this performance enabled him to take a journey to Paris; where he staid long enough to get plates engraven for a score of solos, and the parts of two operas of concertos. About the year 1755 he returned to England, and advertised them for sale. In 1761 Geminiani went over to Ireland; and was kindly entertained there by Mr Matthew Dubourg, who had been his pupil, and was then master of the king's band in Ireland. This person through the course\ncourse of his life had ever been disposed to render him friendly offices; and it was but a short time after Geminiani's arrival at Dublin that he was called upon to do him the last. It appears that Geminiani had spent many years in compiling an elaborate treatise on music, which he intended for publication; but soon after his arrival at Dublin, by the treachery of a female servant, who, it was said, was recommended to him for no other end than that she might steal it, it was conveyed away, and could not be recovered. The greatness of this loss, and his inability to repair it, made a deep impression on his mind; and, as it is conjectured, hastened his end; at least he survived it but a short time, ending his days on the 17th of September 1762.\n\nThe following list comprises the whole of his publications, except two or three articles of small account:\n\nTwelve solos for a violin, opera prima; six concertos in seven parts, opera seconda; six concertos in seven parts, opera terza; twelve solos for a violin, opera quarta; six solos for a violoncello, opera quinta; the same made into solos for a violin; six concertos from his opera quarta; six concertos in eight parts, opera sextima; rules for playing in taite; a treatise on good taste; the art of playing the violin; 12 sonatas from his first solos, opera undecima; Ripieno parts to ditto; lessons for the harpsichord; Guida Armonica; supplement to ditto; the art of accompaniment, two books; his first two operas of concertos in score; and the Enchanted Forest.\u2014Of his solos the opera prima is esteemed the best. Of his concertos some are excellent, others of them scarce pass the bounds of mediocrity. The fifth of the third opera not only surpasses all the rest, but, in the opinion of the best judges of harmony, is the finest instrumental composition extant.","sp":100,"ep":101},{"h":"GEMMA","t":"or Bud, in Botany: a compendium or epitome of a plant, seated upon the stem and branches, and covered with scales, in order to defend the tender rudiments enclosed from cold and other external injuries, till, their parts being unfolded, they acquire strength, and render any further protection unnecessary.\n\nBuds, together with bulbs, which are a species of buds generally seated upon or near the root, constitute that part of the herb called by Linnaeus hybernacula; that is, the winter quarters of the future vegetable: a very proper appellation, as it is during that severe season that the tender rudiments are protected in the manner just mentioned.\n\nPlants, considered in analogy to animals, may properly enough be reckoned both viviparous and oviparous. Seeds are the vegetable eggs; buds, living fetuses, or infant plants, which renew the species as certainly as the seeds.\n\nBuds are placed at the extremity of the young shoots, and along the branches, being fixed by a short footstalk upon a kind of brackets, the remainder of the leaves, in the wings or angles of which the buds in question were formed the preceding year. They are sometimes placed single; sometimes two by two, and those either opposite or alternate; sometimes collected in greater numbers in whirls or rings.\n\nWith respect to their construction, buds are composed of several parts artificially arranged. Externally, we find a number of scales that are pretty hard, frequently armed with hairs, hollowed like a spoon, and placed over each other like tiles. These scales are fixed into the inner plates of the bark, of which they appear to be a prolongation. Their use is to defend the internal parts of the bud; which, being unfolded, will produce, some, flowers, leaves, and stipules; others, footstalks and scales. All these parts, while they remain in the bud, are tender, delicate, folded over each other, and covered with a thick clammy juice, which is sometimes resinous and odoriferous, as in the tamarind tree. This juice serves not only to defend the more tender parts of the embryo plant from cold, the assaults of insects, and other external injuries; but likewise from excessive perspiration, which, in its young and infant state, would be very destructive. It is conspicuous in the buds of horse chestnut, poplar, and willow trees.\n\nIn general, we may distinguish three kinds of buds; that containing the flower, that containing the leaves, and that containing both flower and leaves.\n\nThe first, termed gemma florifera, and by the French bouton \u00e0 fleur or \u00e0 fruit, contains the rudiments of one or several flowers, folded over each other, and surrounded with scales. In several trees, this kind of bud is commonly found at the extremity of certain small branches, which are shorter, rougher, and less garnished with leaves, than the rest. The external scales of this species of bud are harder than the internal; both are furnished with hairs, and in general more swollen than those of the second sort. The bud containing the flower too is commonly thicker, shorter, almost square, less uniform, and less pointed; being generally terminated obtusely. It is called by Pliny oculus gemmei; and is employed in that species of grafting called inoculation, or budding.\n\nThe second species of bud, viz. that containing the leaves, termed gemma folifera, and by the French bouton \u00e0 feuilles or \u00e0 bois, contains the rudiments of several leaves, which are variously folded over each other, and outwardly surrounded by scales, from which the final stipule that are seated at the foot of the young branches are chiefly produced. These buds are commonly more pointed than the former sort. In the hazel nut, however, they are perfectly round; and in horse chestnut, very thick.\n\nThe third sort of bud is smaller than either of the preceding; and produces both flowers and leaves, though not always in the same manner. Sometimes the flowers and leaves are unfolded at the same time. This mode of the flower and leaf bud is termed by Linnaeus gemma folifera et florifera. Sometimes the leaves proceed or emerge out of this kind of bud upon a small branch, which afterwards produces flowers. This mode of the flower and leaf bud is termed by Linnaeus gemma folifera florifera, and is the most common bud of any.\n\nSuch buds as produce branches adorned only with leaves, are called barren; such as contain both leaves and flowers, fertile. From the bulk of the bud we may often with ease foretel whether it contains leaves only, or leaves and flowers together, as in cherry and pear trees.\n\nNeither the buds produced on or near the root, called by some authors turiones, nor those produced on the trunk, and from the angles or wings of the leaves, contain, in strict propriety, an entire delineation of the plant; since the roots are wanting; and in various\nbuds, as we have seen, shoots are contained with leaves only, and not with flowers: but as a branch may be considered as a part similar to the whole plant, and, if planted, would in processes of revegetation exhibit or produce roots and flowers, we may in general allow, that the bud contains the whole plant, or the principles of the whole plant, which may be unfolded ad libitum; and thus resembles the seed, in containing a delineation of the future plant in embryo: for although the bud wants a radicle, or plumula, of which the seed is possessed, yet it would undoubtedly form one, if planted in the earth. But as the medullary part adhering to the bud is too tender, and by the abundance of juice flowing into it from the earth would be disposed to putrefaction, the buds are not planted in the soil, but generally inserted within the bark of another tree; yet placed so that the production of the marrow, or pith, adhering to them, may be inserted into the pith of the branch in which the fissure or cleft is made; by which means there is a large communication of juice. This propagation by gems or buds, called inoculation, is commonly practised with the first sort of buds above described.\n\nFrom the obvious uses of the buds, we may collect the reason why the Supreme Author of nature has granted this sort of protection to most of the trees that are natives of cold climates: and, on the other hand, denied it to such as, enjoying a warm benign atmosphere, have not the tender parts of their embryo shoots exposed to injuries and depredations from the severities of the weather. Of this latter kind are the plants of the following list; some of them very large trees; others smaller woody vegetables, of the shrub and under-shrub kind: Citron, orange, lemon, caltiva, mock orange, blad apple, shrubby swallow-wort, alaternus, shrubby geraniums, berry-bearing alder, Christ's thorn, Syrian mallow, baobab or Ethiopian four gourd, justicia, mild fena, the acacias and sensitive plant, coral tree, stinking bean trefoil, medicago, elder, viburnum, fumach, ivy, tamarisk, heath, Barbados cherry, lavatera, rue, shrubby nightshades, Guinea henweed, cypriss, lignum vitae, and savine, a species of juniper.\n\nOn annual plants, whose root as well as stalk perishes after a year, true buds are never produced; in their stead, however, are produced small branches, like a little feather, from the wings of the leaves, which wither without any farther expansion if the plants climb and have no lateral branches; but if, either by their own nature or from abundance of sap, the plants become branched, the ramuli just mentioned obtain an increase similar to that of the whole plant.\n\nThe same appearance obtains in the trees of warm countries, such as those enumerated in the above list, in which a plumula, or small feather, sends forth branches without a scaly covering; as, in such countries, this tender part requires no defence or protection from cold. A scaly covering then is peculiar to buds, as it protects the tender embryo enclosed from all external injuries. When we therefore speak of trees having buds that are naked or without scales, our meaning is the same as if we had said that they have no buds at all.\n\nThe buds that are to be unfolded the following year, break forth from the evolved buds of the present year, in such a manner as to put on the appearance of small eminences in the wings or angles of the leaves. These eminences or knots grow but little during the summer; as, in that season, the sap is expended on the increase of the parts of the plant; but in autumn, when the leaves begin to wither and fall off, the buds, placed on the wings, increase; and the embryo plant contained in the bud is so expanded, that the leaves and flowers, the parts to be evolved the following year, are distinctly visible. Thus in holly chestnut the leaves, and in cornel tree the flowers, are each to be observed in their respective buds.\n\nAs each bud contains the rudiments of a plant, and would, if separated from its parent vegetable, become every way similar to it; Linnaeus, to show the wonderful fertility of nature, has made a calculation, by which it appears, that, in a trunk scarce exceeding a span in breadth, 10,000 buds (that is, herbs) may be produced.

These troops were commanded by captain lieutenants, the king and the princes of the blood being their captains; the king's troop, besides a captain-lieutenant, had two sublieutenants, three ensigns, and three guidons.\n\nGrand Gendarmes, latterly were a troop composed of 250 gentlemen; the king himself was their captain, and one of the first peers their captain-lieutenant, who had under him two lieutenants, three ensigns, three guidons, and other officers.\n\nSmall Gendarmes, were the Scots gendarmes, the queen's, the dauphin's, the gendarmes of Anjou, Burgundy, the English and Flemish gendarmes, having each a captain lieutenant, sub-lieutenant, ensign, guidon, and quarter-master.\n\nScots Gendarmes, were originally instituted by Charles VII. of France, about the middle of the 15th century,\nGender, century, and formed a part of his guard; in which station also they acted under other princes. It was their prerogative to take precedence of all the companies of the gendarmeries of France; and, on particular occasions, they even preceded the two companies of the king's mousquetaires. The sons of the Scottish monarchs were the usual captains of this company; and, after Mary's accession to the throne, its command belonged to them as a right. It was thence that James VI. made a claim of it for his son Prince Henry. This honour, and its emoluments, were also enjoyed by Charles I. and the next in command to this prince was Louis Stuart duke of Lennox. George Gordon marquis of Huntly succeeded the duke of Lennox in the year 1674, and took the title of captain or commander in chief when Charles I. mounted the English throne. It is not certain whether Charles II. was ever captain of this company; but it was conferred on his brother the duke of York, who was captain of the Scots gendarmes till the year 1667, when he resigned his commission into the hands of the French King. Since that time no native of Great Britain has enjoyed this command. See Scots Guards.\n\nAll the different gendarmeries are now abolished, in consequence of the reforming systems that have lately taken place in France.","sp":102,"ep":103},{"h":"GENDER","t":"among grammarians, a division of nouns, or names, to distinguish the two sexes.\n\nThis was the original intention of gender: but afterwards other words, which had no proper relation either to one sex or the other, had genders assigned them, rather out of caprice than reason; which is at length established by custom.

The major general has one aid-de-camp, paid for executing his orders.\n\n**General** is also used for a particular march, or beat of drum; being the first which gives notice, commonly in the morning early, for the infantry to be in readiness to march.\n\n**General** is likewise an appellation by which officers in law, in the revues, &c. are distinguished; as, attorney general, solicitor general, &c. receiver general, comptroller general, &c.

It was easy for Moses to be satisfied of the truth of what he delivers in this book, because it came down to him through a few hands; for from Adam to Noah there was one man, viz.

Long. and 46\u00b0 1' 2\" N. Lat. It stands on the banks of the river Rhone, just at the place where the latter issues from the lake which takes its name from the city; and part of it is built on an island in the river. It is handsome, well fortified, and pretty large; the streets in general are clean and well paved, but the principal one is encumbered with a row of shops on each side between the carriage and foot-path. The latter is very wide, and protected from the weather by great wooden penthouses projecting from the roofs; which, though very convenient, give the street a dark and dull appearance. The houses are generally constructed of freestone, with balments of limestone; the gutters, spouts, ridges,\nridges, and outward ornaments, being made of tinned iron. Some of them have arched walks or piazzas in front. The place called Tireille is very agreeable, being planted with linden trees, and commanding a fine prospect of the lake, with several ranges of rocks rising behind one another, some covered with vineyards and herbage, and others with snow, having openings between them. Immediately below Geneva the Rhone is joined by the Arve, a cold and muddy stream rising among the Alps, and deriving a considerable part of its waters from the Glaciers. The Rhone is quite clear and transparent, so that the muddy water of the Arve is distinguishable from it even after they have flowed for several miles together. There are four bridges over the Rhone before it joins the Arve; and from it the city is supplied with water by means of an hydraulic machine, which raises it 100 Paris feet above its level. The principal buildings are, 1. The maison de ville, or townhouse, a plain ancient edifice, with large rooms, in which the councils assemble, and public entertainments are held; and in one of them a weekly concert is held by subscription during the winter. The ascent to the upper story is not by steps but a paved acclivity: which, however, is so gentle, that horses and mules can go up to the top. 2. The church of St Peter's, formerly the cathedral, is an ancient Gothic building, with a modern portico of seven large Corinthian columns of red and white marble from Roche. The only thing remarkable in the inside is the tomb of Henry duke of Rohan. 3. The arsenal is in good order, and supplied with arms sufficient for 12,000 men. There are many ancient suits of armour; and the scaling ladders, lanthorns, hatchets, &c., used by the Savoyards in their treacherous attempt on the city in the year 1662, to be afterwards noticed, are here preserved. The magazines contain 110 cannon, besides mortars. 4. The hospital is a large handsome building, by which and other charities near 4000 poor people are maintained. 5. The fortifications on the side of Savoy are of the modern construction, but are commanded by some neighbouring grounds. On the side of France they are old fashioned, and at any rate are rather calculated to prevent a surprize than to sustain a regular siege. There are three gates, towards France, Savoy, and Switzerland; and the access to the lake is guarded by a double jetty and chain.\n\nThe territory belonging to this city contains about seven square leagues, and is divided into nine parishes; the town is by far the most populous in Switzerland, having about 30,000 inhabitants, of whom, however, 5000 are generally supposed to be absent. It has a small district dependent on it, but this does not contain above 16,000. The adjacent country is extremely beautiful, and has many magnificent views arising from the different positions of the numerous hills and mountains with regard to the town and lake. The inhabitants were formerly distinguished into four classes, viz., citizens, burgesses, inhabitants, and natives; and since the revolution in 1782, a fifth class named domicilis, has been added, who annually receive permission from the magistrates to reside in the city. The citizens and burgesses alone, however, are admitted to a share in the government; those called inhabitants are strangers allowed to settle in the town with certain privileges; and the natives are the sons of those inhabitants, who possess additional advantages. The people are very active and industrious, carrying on an extensive commerce.\n\nThis city is remarkable for the number of learned State of men it has produced. The reformed doctrines of religion were very early received in it, being preached there in 1533 by William Farel and Peter Viret of Orbe, and afterwards finally established by the celebrated John Calvin. Of this reformer Voltaire observes, that he gave his name to the religious doctrines first broached by others, in the same manner that Americus Vespucius gave name to the continent of America, which had formerly been discovered by Columbus. It was by the affluence of this celebrated reformer, and the influence that he acquired among the citizens, that a public academy was first established in the city, where he, Theodore Beza, and some of the more eminent first reformers, read lectures with uncommon success. The intolerant spirit of Calvin is well known; but little of it now appears in the government of Geneva: on the contrary, it is the most tolerating of all the estates in Switzerland, being the only one of them which permits the public exercise of the Lutheran religion. The advantages of the academy at Geneva are very conspicuous among the citizens at this day, even the lower class of them being exceedingly well informed; so that, according to Mr Coxe, there is not a city in Europe where learning is so generally diffused. \"I received great satisfaction (says he) in conversing even with several tradesmen upon topics both of literature and politics; and was astonished to find in this class of men so uncommon a share of knowledge; but the wonder ceases when we are told that all of them were educated at the public academy.\" In this seminary the industry and emulation of the students are excited by the annual distribution of prizes to those who distinguish themselves in each class. The prizes consist of small medals, but are conferred with such solemnity as cannot fail to produce a striking effect on the minds of youth. There is also a public library to which the citizens have access, and which undoubtedly tends greatly to that universal diffusion of learning so remarkable among the inhabitants. It was founded by Bonivard, remarkable for his sufferings in the cause of the liberties of his country. Having been a great antagonist of the dukes of Savoy, against whom he asserted the independence of Geneva, he had the misfortune at last to be taken prisoner, and was imprisoned for six years in a dungeon below the level of the lake, in the castle of Chillon, which stands on a rock in the lake, and is connected with the land by a drawbridge. In 1536 this castle was taken from Charles III. of Savoy by the canton of Berne, assisted by the Genevans, who furnished a frigate (their whole naval force) to besiege it by water. Bonivard was now taken from his dungeon, where by constant walking backward and forward, his only amusement, he had worn a hollow in the floor which consisted of solid rock. Bonivard considered the hardships he had endured as ties which endeared him to the city, and became a principal promoter of the reformation by the mild methods of persuasion and instruction. He closed his benefactions by the gift of his books and manuscripts, and bequeathing his fortune towards the establishment and support of the seminary. His works, which chiefly relate to the history\nhistory of Geneva, are still preserved with great care and reverence. The library contains 25,000 volumes, with many curious manuscripts, of which an account has been published by the reverend M. Semmelier the librarian, who has likewise distinguished himself by several literary works. Messrs Bonnet, Sauvire, Mallet, and De Luc, are the other most distinguished literary geniuses of which Geneva can boast. The last is particularly remarkable for the perfection to which he has brought the barometer, and which is now so great, that very little seems possible to be done by any body else. His cabinet merits the attention of naturalists, as containing many rare and curious specimens of fossils, which serve to illustrate the theory of the globe.\n\nIt may be divided into three parts: 1. Such as enable the naturalist to compare the petrifications of animals and vegetables with the same bodies which are still known to exist in our parts of the globe. 2. To compare these petrifications of animals with the same bodies which are known to exist in different countries. 3. To consider the petrifications of those bodies which are no longer known to exist. The second part comprehends the stones under three points of view: 1. Those of the primitive mountains, which contain no animal bodies; 2. Those of the secondary mountains, which contain only marine bodies; 3. Those which contain terrestrial bodies. The third part contains the lavas and other volcanic productions; which are distinguished into two classes: 1. Those which come from volcanoes now actually burning; 2. Those from extinguished volcanoes.\n\nIn the time of Charles the Great, the city and territory of Geneva made part of his empire; and, under his successors, it became subject to the German emperors. By reason of the imbecility of these princes, however, the bishops of Geneva acquired such authority over the inhabitants, that the emperor had no other means of counterbalancing it than by augmenting the privileges of the people. In these barbarous ages also the bishops and counts had constant disputes, of which the people took the advantage; and by siding sometimes with one, and sometimes with the other, they obtained an extension of their privileges from both. The house of Savoy at length purchased the territory, and succeeded the counts with additional power; against them therefore the bishops and people united in order to resist their encroachments; and, during this period, the government was strangely complicated, by reason of the various pretensions of the three parties. The counts of Savoy, however, had at last the address to dissolve the union between the bishops and citizens, by procuring the episcopal see for their brothers, and even their illegitimate children; by which means their power became gradually to extensive, that towards the commencement of the 16th century, Charles III. of Savoy (though the government was accounted entirely republican) obtained an almost absolute authority over the people, and exercised it in a most unjust and arbitrary manner. Thus violent commotions took place; and the citizens became divided into two parties, one of which, viz. the patriots, were styled Eidgenossen or confederates; the partisans of Savoy being disgraced by the appellation of Mamelucks or slaves. The true period of Genevan liberty may therefore be considered as commencing with the treaty concluded with Berne and Friburg in Geneva, the year 1526; in consequence of which the duke was in a short time deprived of his authority, the bishop driven from the city, and the reformed religion and a republican form of government introduced. A long war commenced with Savoy on this account; but the Genevans proved an overmatch for their enemies by their own bravery and the alliance of the inhabitants of Berne. In 1584, the republic concluded a treaty with Zurich and Berne, by which it is allied to the Swiss cantons. The house of Savoy made their last attempt against Geneva in 1602, when the city was treacherously attacked in the night time during a profound peace. Two hundred soldiers had scaled the walls, and got into the town before any alarm was given; but they were repulsed by the desperate valour of a few citizens, who perished in the encounter. A petard had been fastened to one of the gates by the Savoyards; but the gunner was killed before it could be discharged. The war occasioned by this treachery was next year concluded by a solemn treaty, which has ever since been observed on both sides; though the independence of Geneva was not formally acknowledged by the king of Sardinia till the year 1754.\n\nThe restoration of tranquillity from without in consequence of the above treaty, was however soon followed by the flames of internal discord, so common in popular governments; so that during the whole of the last century the history of Geneva affords little more than an account of the struggles betwixt the aristocratical and popular parties. About the beginning of the present century the power of the grand council was become almost absolute; but in order to restrain its authority, an edict was procured in 1727 by the popular party, enacting, that every five years a general council of the citizens and burgurers should be summoned to deliberate upon the affairs of the republic. In consequence of this law a general assembly was convened in 1712; and the very first act of that assembly was to abolish the edict by which they had been convened. A proceeding to extraordinary can scarcely be accounted for on the principles of popular fickleness and inconstancy. Rousseau, in his Miscellaneous Works, ascribes it to the artifices of the magistrates, and the equivocal terms marked upon the billets then in use. For the question being put, \"Whether the opinion of the councils for abolishing the periodical assemblies should pass into a law?\" the words approbation or rejection, put upon the billets by which the votes were given, might be interpreted either way. Thus, if the billet was chosen on which the word approbation was written, the opinion of the councils which rejected the assemblies was approved; and by the word rejection, the periodical assembly was rejected of course. Hence several of the citizens complained that they had been deceived, and that they never meant to reject the general assembly, but only the opinion of the councils.\n\nIn consequence of the abolition of the general assemblies, the power of the aristocratical party was greatly augmented; till at length the inhabitants exerting themselves with uncommon spirit and perseverance, found means to limit the power of the magistrates, and enlarge their own rights. In 1776, as Mr Cox informs us, the government might be considered as a mean betwixt\ntwixt that of the aristocratical and popular cantons of Switzerland. The members of the senate, or little council of 25, enjoyed in their corporate capacity several very considerable prerogatives. By them half the members of the great council were named; the principal magistrates were supplied from their own body; they convoked the great and general councils, deliberating previously upon every question which was to be brought before these councils. They were vested also with the chief executive power, the administration of finances, and had in a certain degree the jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes. Most of the smaller posts were likewise filled by them; and they enjoyed the sole privilege of conferring the burghership. These, and other prerogatives, however, were balanced by those of the great council and the privileges of the general council. The former had a right to choose the members of the senate from their own body; receiving appeals in all causes above a certain value, pardoning criminals, &c., besides which they had the important privilege of approving or rejecting whatever was proposed by the senate to be laid before the people.\n\nThe general council or assembly of the people is composed of the citizens and burghers of the town; their number in general amounting to 1500, though usually not more than 1200 were present; the remainder residing in foreign countries, or being otherwise absent. It meets twice a-year, chooses the principal magistrates, approves or rejects the laws and regulations proposed by the other councils, imposes taxes, contracts alliances, declares war or peace, and nominates half the members of the great council, &c. But the principal check to the power of the senate arose from the right of re-election, or the power of annually expelling four members from the senate at the nomination of the syndics or principal magistrates, and from the right of representation. The syndics are four in number, chosen annually from the senate by the general council; and three years elapse before the same members can be again appointed. In choosing these magistrates, the senate appointed from its own body eight candidates, from whom the four syndics were to be chosen by the general council. The latter, however, had it in their power to reject not only the first eight candidates, but also the whole body of senators in succession: in which case, four members of the senate retired into the great council; and their places were filled by an equal number from that council. With regard to the power of representation, every citizen or burgher has the privilege of applying to the senate in order to procure a new regulation in this respect, or of remonstrating against any act of the magistracy. To these remonstrances the magistrates were obliged to give an explicit answer; for if a satisfactory answer was not given to one, a second was immediately presented. The representation was made by a greater or smaller number of citizens according to the importance of the point in question.\n\nSince the 1776, however, several changes have taken place. This right of re-election, which the aristocratical party were obliged to yield to the people in 1768, soon proved very disagreeable, being considered by the former as a kind of ostracism; for which reason they watched at every opportunity of procuring its abolition. They were now distinguished by the title of negatives, while the popular party had that of representatives; and the point in dispute was the compilation of a new code of laws. This measure the negatives opposed, as supposing that it would tend to reduce their prerogatives; while, on the other hand, the representatives used their utmost endeavours to promote it, in hopes of having their privileges augmented by this means. At last in the month of January 1777, the negatives were obliged to comply with the demands of their antagonists; and a committee for forming a new code of laws was appointed by the concurrence of the little, great, and general councils. The committee was to last for two years, and the code to be laid before the three councils for their joint approbation or rejection. A sketch of the first part of the code was presented to the little and great councils on the first of September 1779, that they might profit by their observations before it was presented to the general council. Great disputes arose; and at length it was carried by the negatives that the code should be rejected and the committee dissolved. The opposite party complained of this as unconstitutional, and violent disputes ensued; the issue of which was, that the great council offered to compile the code, and submit it to the decision of the public. This did not give satisfaction to the popular party, who considered it as insidious; the contentions revived with more fury than ever, until at length the negatives supposing, or pretending to suppose, that their country was in danger, applied to the guarantees, France, Zurich, and Berne, entreating them to protect the laws and constitution. This was productive of no good effect; so that the negatives found no other method of gaining their point than by fomenting dissension among the different classes of inhabitants. The natives were discontented and jealous on account of many exclusive privileges enjoyed by that class named citizens: they were besides exasperated against them for having, in 1779, banished eight of the principal natives, who pretended that the right of burghership belonged to the natives as well as to the citizens, and demanded that this right ought to be gratuitously conferred instead of being purchased. The negatives, in hopes of making such a considerable addition to their party, courted the natives by all the methods they could think of, promising by a public declaration that they were ready to confer upon them those privileges of trade and commerce which had hitherto been confined exclusively to the citizens. The designs of the negatives were likewise openly favoured by the court of France, and despatches were even written to the French resident at Geneva to be communicated to the principal natives who sided with the aristocratic party. The attorney-general, conceiving this mode of interference to be highly unconstitutional, presented a spirited remonstrance; by which the French court were so much displeased, that they procured his deposition from his office; and thus their party was very considerably increased among the natives. The representatives were by no means negligent in their endeavours to conciliate the favour of the same party, and even promised what they had hitherto opposed in the strongest manner, viz., to facilitate the acquisition of the burghership, and to bestow it as the recompense of industry and good behaviour. Thus two parties were formed among the natives themselves; and the dissensions becoming\ncourse of his life had ever been disposed to render him friendly offices; and it was but a short time after Gemminian's arrival at Dublin that he was called upon to do him the last. It appears that Gemminian had spent many years in compiling an elaborate treatise on music, which he intended for publication; but soon after his arrival at Dublin, by the treachery of a female servant, who, it was said, was recommended to him for no other end than that she might steal it, it was conveyed away, and could not be recovered. The great-ness of this loss, and his inability to repair it, made a deep impression on his mind; and, as it is conjectured, hastened his end; at least he survived it but a short time, ending his days off the 17th of September 1762.\n\nThe following list comprises the whole of his publications, except two or three articles of small account:\n\nTwelve solos for a violin, opera prima; six concertos in seven parts, opera seconda; six concertos in seven parts, opera terza; twelve solos for a violin, opera quarta; six solos for a violoncello, opera quinta; the same made into solos for a violin; six concertos from his opera quarta; six concertos in eight parts, opera sextima; rules for playing in taste; a treatise on good taste; the art of playing the violin; 12 sonatas from his first solos, opera undecima; Ripieno parts to ditto; lessons for the harpsichord; Guida Armonica; supplement to ditto; the art of accompaniment, two books; his first two operas of concertos in score; and the Enchanted Forest.\u2014Of his solos the opera prima is esteemed the best. Of his concertos some are excellent, others of them scarce pass the bounds of mediocrity. The sixth of the third opera not only surpasses all the rest, but, in the opinion of the best judges of harmony, is the finest instrumental composition extant.","sp":105,"ep":109},{"h":"GENEVA","t":"a city of Switzerland, on the confines of France and Savoy, situated in 46\u00b0 E.

Those from extinguished volcanoes.\n\nIn the time of Charles the Great, the city and territory of Geneva made part of his empire; and, under his successors, it became subject to the German emperors. By reason of the imbecility of these princes, however, the bishops of Geneva acquired such authority over the inhabitants, that the emperor had no other means of counterbalancing it than by augmenting the privileges of the people. In these barbarous ages also the bishops and counts had constant disputes, of which the people took the advantage; and by siding sometimes with one, and sometimes with the other, they obtained an extension of their privileges from both. The house of Savoy at length purchased the territory, and succeeded the counts with additional power: against them therefore the bishops and people united in order to resist their encroachments; and, during this period, the government was strangely complicated, by reason of the various pretensions of the three parties. The counts of Savoy, however, had at last the address to dissolve the union between the bishops and citizens, by procuring the episcopal see for their brothers, and even their illegitimate children; by which means their power became gradually so extensive, that towards the commencement of the 16th century, Charles III. of Savoy (though the government was accounted entirely republican) obtained an almost absolute authority over the people, and exercised it in a most unjust and arbitrary manner. Thus violent commotions took place; and the citizens became divided into two parties, one of which, viz., the patriots, were styled Eidgenossen or confederates; the partisans of Savoy being disgraced by the appellation of Mamelucks or slaves. The true period of Genevan liberty may therefore be considered as commencing with the treaty concluded with Berne and Fribourg in Geneva, the year 1526; in consequence of which the duke was in a short time deprived of his authority, the bishop driven from the city, and the reformed religion and a republican form of government introduced. A long war commenced with Savoy on this account; but the Genevans proved an overmatch for their enemies by their own bravery and the assistance of the inhabitants of Berne. In 1584, the republic concluded a treaty with Zurich and Berne, by which it is allied to the Swiss cantons. The house of Savoy made their last attempt against Geneva in 1602, when the city was treacherously attacked in the night time during a profound peace. Two hundred soldiers had scaled the walls, and got into the town before any alarm was given; but they were repulsed by the desperate valour of a few citizens, who perished in the encounter. A petard had been fastened to one of the gates by the Savoyards; but the gunner was killed before it could be discharged. The war occasioned by this treachery was next year concluded by a solemn treaty, which has ever since been observed on both sides: though the independence of Geneva was not formally acknowledged by the king of Sardinia till the year 1754.\n\nThe restoration of tranquillity from without in consequence of the above treaty, was however soon followed by the flames of internal discord, so common in popular governments; so that during the whole of the last century the history of Geneva affords little more than an account of the struggles between the aristocratical and popular parties. About the beginning of the present century the power of the grand council was become almost absolute; but in order to restrain its authority, an edict was procured in 1757 by the popular party, enacting, that every five years a general council of the citizens and burgheurs should be summoned to deliberate upon the affairs of the republic. In consequence of this law a general assembly was convened in 1712; and the very first act of that assembly was to abolish the edict by which they had been convened. A proceeding to extraordinary can scarcely be accounted for on the principles of popular fickleness and inconstancy. Rousseau, in his Miscellaneous Works, attributes it to the artifices of the magistrates, and the equivocal terms marked upon the billets then in use. For the question being put, \"Whether the opinion of the councils for abolishing the periodical assemblies should pass into a law?\" the words approbation or rejection, put upon the billets by which the votes were given, might be interpreted either way. Thus, if the billet was chosen on which the word approbation was written, the opinion of the councils which rejected the assemblies was approved; and by the word rejection, the periodical assembly was rejected of course. Hence several of the citizens complained that they had been deceived, and that they never meant to reject the general assembly, but only the opinion of the councils.\n\nIn consequence of the abolition of the general assemblies, the power of the aristocratical party was greatly augmented; till at length the inhabitants exerting themselves with uncommon spirit and perseverance, found means to limit the power of the magistrates, and enlarge their own rights. In 1776, as Mr Cox informs us, the government might be considered as a mean betwixt\ntwixt that of the aristocratical and popular cantons of Switzerland. The members of the senate, or little council of 25, enjoyed in their corporate capacity several very considerable prerogatives. By them half the members of the great council were named; the principal magistrates were supplied from their own body; they convoked the great and general councils, deliberating previously upon every question which was to be brought before these councils. They were vested also with the chief executive power, the administration of finances, and had in a certain degree the jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes. Most of the smaller posts were likewise filled by them; and they enjoyed the sole privilege of conferring the burghership. These, and other prerogatives, however, were balanced by those of the great council and the privileges of the general council. The former had a right to choose the members of the senate from their own body; receiving appeals in all causes above a certain value, pardoning criminals, &c., besides which they had the important privilege of approving or rejecting whatever was proposed by the senate to be laid before the people.\n\nThe general council or assembly of the people is composed of the citizens and burghers of the town; their number in general amounting to 1500, though usually not more than 1200 were present; the remainder residing in foreign countries, or being otherwise absent. It meets twice a-year, chooses the principal magistrates, approves or rejects the laws and regulations proposed by the other councils, imposes taxes, contracts alliances, declares war or peace, and nominates half the members of the great council, &c. But the principal check to the power of the senate arose from the right of re-election, or the power of annually expelling four members from the senate at the nomination of the syndics or principal magistrates, and from the right of representation. The syndics are four in number, chosen annually from the senate by the general council; and three years elapse before the same members can be again appointed. In choosing these magistrates, the senate appointed from its own body eight candidates, from whom the four syndics were to be chosen by the general council. The latter, however, had it in their power to reject not only the first eight candidates, but also the whole body of senators in succession: in which case, four members of the senate retired into the great council; and their places were filled by an equal number from that council. With regard to the power of representation, every citizen or burgher has the privilege of applying to the senate in order to procure a new regulation in this respect, or of remonstrating against any act of the magistracy. To these remonstrances the magistrates were obliged to give an explicit answer; for if a satisfactory answer was not given to one, a second was immediately presented. The representation was made by a greater or smaller number of citizens according to the importance of the point in question.\n\nSince the 1776, however, several changes have taken place. This right of re-election, which the aristocratical party were obliged to yield to the people in 1768, soon proved very disagreeable, being considered by the former as a kind of outrage; for which reason they caught at every opportunity of procuring its abolition. They were now distinguished by the title of negatives, while the popular party had that of representatives; and Geneva, the point in dispute was the compilation of a new code of laws. This measure the negatives opposed, as supposing that it would tend to reduce their prerogatives; while, on the other hand, the representatives used their utmost endeavours to promote it, in hopes of having their privileges augmented by this means. At last in the month of January 1777, the negatives were obliged to comply with the demands of their antagonists; and a committee for forming a new code of laws was appointed by the concurrence of the little, great, and general councils. The committee was to last for two years, and the code to be laid before the three councils for their joint approbation or rejection. A sketch of the first part of the code was presented to the little and great councils on the first of September 1779, that they might profit by their observations before it was presented to the general council. Great disputes arose; and at length it was carried by the negatives that the code should be rejected and the committee dissolved. The opposite party complained of this as unconstitutional, and violent disputes ensued; the illuse of which was, that the great council offered to compile the code, and submit it to the decision of the public. This did not give satisfaction to the popular party, who considered it as insidious: the contentions revived with more fury than ever, until at length the negatives supposing, or pretending to suppose, that their country was in danger, applied to the guarantees, France, Zurich, and Berne, entreating them to protect the laws and constitution. This was productive of no good effect; so that the negatives found no other method of gaining their point than by fowing diffusion among the different classes of inhabitants. The natives were discontented and jealous on account of many exclusive privileges enjoyed by that class named citizens: they were besides exasperated against them for having, in 1770, banished eight of the principal natives, who pretended that the right of burghership belonged to the natives as well as to the citizens, and demanded that this right ought to be gratuitously conferred instead of being purchased. The negatives, in hopes of making such a considerable addition to their party, courted the natives by all the methods they could think of, promising by a public declaration that they were ready to confer upon them those privileges of trade and commerce which had hitherto been confined exclusively to the citizens. The designs of the negatives were likewise openly favoured by the court of France, and despatches were even written to the French resident at Geneva to be communicated to the principal natives who sided with the aristocratical party. The attorney-general, conceiving this mode of interference to be highly unconstitutional, presented a spirited remonstrance; by which the French court were so much displeased, that they procured his deposition from his office; and thus their party was very considerably incarcerated among the natives. The representatives were by no means negligent in their endeavours to conciliate the favour of the same party, and even promised what they had hitherto opposed in the strongest manner, viz. to facilitate the acquisition of the burghership, and to bestow it as the recompense of industry and good behaviour. Thus two parties were formed among the natives themselves; and the dissensions becoming\ncoming every day worse and worse, a general insurrection took place on the 5th of February 1781. A dispute, accompanied with violent reproaches, having commenced between two neighbouring and opposite parties of natives, a battle would have immediately taken place, had it not been for the interposition of the syndics on the one side, and the chiefs of the representatives on the other. The tumult was beginning to subside, when a discharge of musketry was heard from the arsenal. Some young men who sided with the negatives, having taken possession of the arsenal, had fired by mistake upon several natives of their own party, and had killed one and wounded another. This was considered by the representatives as the signal for a general insurrection, on which they instantly took up arms and marched in three columns to the arsenal; but finding there only a few young men who had rashly fired without orders, they permitted the rest to retire without molestation. In the opinion of some people, however, this affair was preconcerted, and the representatives are said to have been the first aggressors.\n\nThe representatives having thus taken up arms, were in no haste to lay them down. They took possession of all the avenues to the city; and their committee being summoned next morning by the natives to fulfil their engagements with respect to the burghership, they held several meetings with the principal negatives on that subject, but without any success: for though the latter readily agreed to an augmentation of the commercial privileges of the natives, they absolutely refused to facilitate the acquisition of the burghership. The committee, however, embarrassed and alarmed at the number and threats of the natives, determined to abide by what they had promised; drew up an edict permitting the natives to carry on trade, and to hold the rank of officers in the military associations; and conferred the burghership on more than 100 persons taken from the natives and inhabitants, and even from the peasants of the territory. This was approved by the three councils; the negatives, dreading the power of their adversaries, who had made themselves masters of the city, not daring to make their appearance.\n\nThus the popular party imagined that they had got a complete victory; but they soon found themselves deceived. They were prevailed upon by the deputies from Zurich and Berne (who had been sent to conciliate the differences) to lay down their arms; and this was no sooner done, than the same deputies declared the edict in favour of the natives to be null and illegal. The senate declared themselves of the same opinion; and maintained, that the assent of the councils had been obtained only through fear of the representatives who were under arms, and whom none at that time durst oppose. The representatives, exasperated by this proceeding, presented another remonstrance on the 18th of March 1782, summoning the magistrates once more to confirm the edict; but a month afterwards received the laconic answer, that \"government was neither willing nor able to confirm it.\" The natives, now finding themselves disappointed in their favourite object at the very time they had such strong hopes of obtaining it, behaved at first like frantic people; and these transports having subsided, an universal tumult took place. The most moderate of the popular party endeavoured in vain to allay their fury, by dispersing themselves in different quarters of the city; and the citizens, finding themselves at last obliged either to abandon the party of the natives or to join them openly, hastily adopted the latter measure; after which, as none could now oppose them, the officers of the representatives took possession of the town, and quelled the insurrection. Various negotiations were carried on with the negatives in order to prevail upon them to ratify the edict, but without success: on which a few of the magistrates were confined by the popular party along with the principal negatives; and as they justly expected the interference of France on account of what they had done, they resolved to prolong the confinement of the prisoners, that they might answer the purpose of hostages for their own safety. In the meantime the body of citizens, deceived by the pretences of the popular party, acted as if their power was already established and permanent. In consequence of this, they deposed several members of the great and little councils, appointing in their room an equal number of persons who were favourable to the cause of the representatives. The great council thus new modelled, executed the edict for conferring the burghership upon a number of the natives; and appointed a committee of safety, composed of eleven members, with very considerable authority. By this committee the public tranquillity was re-established; after which, the fortifications were ordered to be repaired; and the people were buoyed up by the most dangerous notions of their own prowess, and a confidence that France either durst not attack them or did not incline to do so. In consequence of this fatal error, they refused every offer of reconciliation which was made them from the other party; until at last troops were dispatched against them by the king of Sardinia and the canton of Berne; and their respective generals, Messrs de la Marmora and Lentulus, were ordered to act in concert with the French commander, M. de Jaucourt, who had advanced to the frontiers with a considerable detachment. The Genevans, however, vainly puffed up by a confidence in their own abilities, continued to repair their fortifications with indefatigable labour; the peasants repaired from all quarters to the city, offering to mount guard and work at the fortifications without any pay; women of all ranks crowded to the walls as to a place of amusement, encouraging the men, and even afflicting them in their labour. The besiegers, however, advanced in such force, that every person of discernment foresaw that all resistance would be vain. The French general Jaucourt, on the 29th of June 1782, dispatched a message to the syndics; in which he insisted on the following humiliating conditions: 1. That no person should appear on the streets under pain of military punishment. 2. That a certain number of citizens, among whom were all the chiefs of the representatives, should quit the place in 24 hours. 3. That all arms should be delivered to the three generals. 4. That the deposed magistrates should be instantly re-established: And, lastly, That an answer should be returned in two hours. By this message the people were thrown into the utmost despair; and all without exception resolved to perish rather than to accept of terms so very disgraceful. They instantly hurried to the ramparts with a view of putting their resolution\nin force; but in the mean time the syndics found means to obtain from the generals a delay of 24 hours. During this interval, not only men of all ages prepared for the approaching danger, but even women and children tore the pavement from the streets, carrying the stones up to the tops of the houses, with a view of rolling them down upon the enemy in case they should force their way into the town. About 80 women and girls, dressed in uniforms, offered to form themselves into a company for the defence of their country. The committee of safety accepted their services, and placed them in a barrack secured from the cannon of the besiegers. The negatives were greatly alarmed at this appearance of desperate resistance; and some of the most moderate among them endeavoured, but without success, to effect a reconciliation. At the hour in which it was expected that the attack would begin, the ramparts were filled with defenders; and though the most zealous of the popular party had calculated only on 3000, upwards of 5000 appeared in the public cause. The French general, however, justly alarmed for the prisoners, who were now in imminent danger, again prolonged the period proposed for the capitulation. By these repeated delays the ardour of the defendants began to abate. The women first began to figure to themselves the horrors of a town taken by assault, and given up to an enraged and licentious soldiery; many timid persons found means not only to disguise their own fears, but to inspire others with them under the pretence of prudence and caution: at last the committee of safety themselves, who had so strenuously declared for hostilities, entirely changed their mind. Being well apprized, however, that it would be dangerous for them to propose surrendering in the present temper of the people, they assembled the citizens in their respective circles, representing, that if the city should be attacked in the night, it would be no longer possible to convene them: for which reason they recommended to them that each circle should nominate several deputies with full authority to decide in their stead; adding, that they ought rather to appoint those persons who from their age and respectable character were capable of assailing their country by their advice, while others were defending it by their valour. Thus a new council, composed of about 100 citizens, was formed; in which the chiefs, by various manoeuvres, first intimidating, and then endeavouring to persuade the members of the necessity of surrendering, at last found means to take the thoughts of the people entirely off the defence of the city, and engage them in a scheme of general emigration. A declaration was drawn up to be delivered to the syndics with the keys of the city, the chiefs summoned the principal officers from their posts, ordered the cannon of several batteries to be rendered unfit for service, and at last took care of themselves by quitting the town. The people were in the utmost despair; and left the town in such multitudes, that when the Sardinians entered it in the morning, they found it almost deserted. This was followed by the restoration of the former magistrates, a complete subjection of the popular party, and the establishment of a military government.\n\nThe changes which took place on this occasion were as follow: 1. An abolition of the right of re-election, 2. The abolition of that right by which the general council nominated half the vacancies in the great council. 3. The right of remonstrating was taken from the citizens at large, and vested in 36 adjuncts, who might be present in the great council the first Monday of every month. They enjoyed a right of representation, and in consequence of that had a deliberative voice; but on the whole were so insignificant, that they were nicknamed Les Imagiers, or \"The Shadows.\" 4. The introduction of the grabeau, or annual confirmation of the members of the senate and of the great council, vested entirely in the latter. By this law part of the authority both of the senate and general council was transferred to the great council; and by subjecting the senate to this annual revision, its power was greatly lessened, and it was made in fact dependent upon the general councils. 5. The circles or clubs in which it was customary to convene the citizens, and all public assemblies whatever, were prohibited; and so rigorously was this carried into execution, that the society of arts was prohibited from meeting. 6. The militia were abolished; firing at marks, even with bows and arrows, was prohibited; and the town, instead of being guarded by the citizens, was now put under the care of 1000 foreign soldiers, whose colonel and major were both to be foreigners. These troops were to take an oath of fidelity to the republic, and of obedience to the great council and the committee of war; but were under the immediate command and inspection of the latter, and subject to the superior control of the former. 7. No person was permitted to bear arms, whether citizen, native, or inhabitant. 8. Several taxes were imposed without the consent of the general council; but in time to come it was provided, that every change or augmentation of the revenue should be submitted to that body. 9. Several privileges with regard to trade and commerce, formerly possessed by the citizens alone, were now granted both to citizens and inhabitants.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that this revolution would be agreeable to people who had such a strong sense of liberty, and had been accustomed to put such a value upon it, as the Genevans. From what has been already related, it might seem reasonable to conclude, that an almost universal emigration would have taken place; but after their resentment had time to subside, most of those who fled at first, thought proper to return; and, in the opinion of Mr. Coxe, not more than 600 finally left their country on account of the revolution in 1782. The emigrants principally settled at Bruffels and Constance, where they introduced the arts of printing linens and watchmaking. Soon after the revolution, indeed, a memorial, signed by above 1000 persons of both sexes, all of them either possessed of some property or versed in trade or manufactures, was presented to the earl of Temple, then lord lieutenant of Ireland, expressing a desire to settle in that kingdom. The proposal met with general approbation; the Irish Scheme of parliament voted 50,000l. towards defraying the expenses of their journey, and affording them a proper settlement in the island. Lands were purchased for 800l. in a convenient situation near Waterford; part of New Geneva was actually completed at the expense of 10,000l.; a charter was granted with very considerable privileges; the standard of gold was altered.\ned for the accommodation of the watch manufacturers; and the foundation of an academy laid upon an useful and liberal plan. Seven Genevans landed in Ireland in the month of July 1783; but when the nation had expended near 32,000l. on the scheme, it was suddenly abandoned. This seems principally to have been owing to the delays necessarily occasioned in the execution of such a complicated plan; and in some degree also by the high demands of the Genevan commissioners, who required many privileges inconsistent with the laws of Ireland. By these delays the Genevans, whose character seems not to be perseverance, were induced to abandon the scheme, and return to their former place of residence. Even the few who had already landed, though maintained at the public expense, were discontented at not finding the new town prepared for their reception; and as those among the proposed emigrants who possessed the greatest share of property had already withdrawn their names, the remainder did not choose to remain in a country where they had not capital sufficient to carry on any considerable trade or manufacture. A petition was then presented by the Genevan commissioners, requesting that 10,000l. of the 50,000l. voted might be appropriated to the forming a capital: but as this had been voted for other purposes, the petition was of course rejected; in consequence of which, the Genevans relinquished the settlement by an address, and soon after quitted the island.\n\nThe people of Old Geneva, though returned to their former place of abode, were far from being inclined to submit to the yoke with patience. They were obliged to pay heavy taxes for maintaining a military force expressly calculated to keep themselves in subjection; and so intolerable did this appear, that in a few years everything seemed ready for another revolution. The success of this seemed more probable than that of the former, as France was not now in a condition to interfere as formerly. The general ferment soon rose to such a height, that government was obliged to call in the aid of the military to quell a tumult which happened in the theatre. This produced only a temporary tranquillity; another tumult took place on the 26th of January 1789, on account of the publication of an edict raising the price of bread a farthing per pound. On this the people instantly rose, plundered the bakers shops: and next day a carriage loaded with bread and escorted by soldiers was plundered in its way to the distribution office. The soldiers fired on the populace, by which one man was killed and another wounded: but the tumult still increasing, the soldiers were driven away; and the body of the deceased was carried in a kind of procession before the town house, as a monument of the violence and oppression of the aristocratic party. The magistrates in the meantime spent their time in deliberation, instead of taking any effectual method of quelling the insurrection. The people made the best use of the time afforded them by this delay of the magistrates; they attacked and carried two of the gates, dangerously wounding the commanding officer as he attempted to allay the fury of both parties. At last the magistrates despatched against them a considerable body of troops, whom they thought the insurgents would not have the courage to resist; but in this they found themselves deceived. The people had formed a strong barricade, behind which they played off two fire pumps filled with boiling water and soap lyes against the extremities of two bridges which the military had to cross before they could attack them. The commanding officer was killed and several of his men wounded by the discharge of small arms from windows; and the pavement was carried up to the tops of houses in order to be thrown down upon the troops if they should force the barricades and penetrate into the streets. The tumult in the mean time continued to increase, and was in danger of becoming universal; when the magistrates, finding it would be impossible to quell the insurgents without a great effusion of blood, were reduced to the necessity of complying with their demands. One of the principal magistrates repaired in person to the quarter of St Gervais, proclaimed an edict for lowering the price of bread, granted a general amnesty, and released all the insurgents who had been taken into custody. Thus a momentary calm was produced; but the leaders of the insurrection, sensible that the magistrates were either unable or unwilling to employ a sufficient force against them, resolved to take advantage of the present opportunity to procure a new change of government. A new insurrection, therefore, took place on the 29th of the month, in which the soldiers were driven from their posts, disarmed, and the gates seized by the people. The magistrates then, convinced that all opposition was fruitless, determined to comply with the demands of their antagonists in their full extent; and the aristocratical party suddenly changing their sentiments, renounced in a moment that system to which they had hitherto so obstinately adhered. On the application of the solicitor general, therefore, for the recovery of the ancient liberties of the people, the permission of bearing arms, re-establishment of the militia, and of their circles or political clubs, the removal of the garrison from the barracks, and the recall of the representatives who were banished in 1782; these moderate demands were received with complacency, and even satisfaction. The preliminaries were settled without difficulty, and a new edict of pacification was published under the title of Modifications \u00e0 l'\u00c9dition de 1782, and approved by the senate, great council, and general council. So great was the unanimity on this occasion, that the modifications were received by a majority of 1321 against 52. The pacification was instantly followed by marks of friendship between the two parties which had never been experienced before; the sons of the principal negatives frequented the circles of the burghers; the magistrates obtained the confidence of the people; and no monument of the military force so odious to the people will be allowed to remain. \"The barracks of the town house (says Mr Coxe) are already evacuated, and will be converted into a public library; the new barracks, built at an enormous expense, and more calculated for the garrison of a powerful and despotic kingdom than for a small and free commonwealth, will be converted into a building for the university. The reformation of the studies, which have scarcely received any alteration since the time of Calvin, is now in agitation. In a word, all things seem at present to conspire for the general good; and it is to be hoped that both parties, shocked at the recollection of past troubles, will continue on as friendly terms,\"\nGeneva, as well as the whole of Switzerland fell a victim to French rapacity in 1802. The following observations, made by a traveller on the spot, afford us some information of the consequences of this event to Geneva, of its degraded state, and of the manners of the inhabitants.\n\n\"The population of Geneva is about 24,000: moreover it contains at present between 1200 and 1400 French troops: the parties intermix but little, and have had no disputes, although they certainly regard each other with an eye of jealousy. The Genevans do the French soldiers the justice to say, that they have demeaned themselves in a very becoming manner during their residence here: they acknowledge themselves to be a conquered people, and dare not open their mouths, except to an Englishman, against the treacherous invaders of their country, and destroyers of their liberties.\n\n\"You are too well versed in the history of this people to require being told, that, notwithstanding their present humiliated condition, Freedom is the goddess they worship; and that, had there been any possibility of securing her from violation, they would gladly have bled before her altars. However various has been their success, in the different revolutions which have agitated this secluded state, the Genevans have uniformly evinced a courage which awed their enemies, and a determined bravery in defence of their rights, which in shewing that they prized them highly, gave proof that they were worthy to enjoy them.\n\n\"The territory of Geneva is comprehended in the Department du Leman, which department contains about 16 square leagues of land; its population is estimated at 609,000 persons. It is divided into three cantons or hundreds, the largest of which has Geneva for its capital, and contains about 75,000 souls, of which 10,000 only are Genevans, 20,000 are French, and the remainder are Savoyards. The prefect, as in all the other departments, is appointed by the First Consul, durant\u00e9 beneplacito. The care of the high roads and public walks, public finances, executive justice, military affairs, and passports, are under his immediate direction. All military appointments are given to Frenchmen: one general commands the town, and another the country. At the first moment of the revolution all the old magistrates were displaced, and since that time the civil officers have been elected by the citizens at large, consequently some are Frenchmen, and some Genevans: the present mayor is one of the latter: he is a gentleman of great respectability, and is much esteemed by both parties. Whenever a new code of laws shall be established in France, its operations will be extended over the territory of Geneva; but at present the people here retain their old laws with some trifling alterations only, rather the form than the substance: thus, the guillotine is now substituted for the gallows, and the punishments in general, without varying the degree, are inflicted according to the French manner.\n\n\"In their treaty with France, the Genevans stipulated, that their hospital should not be obliged to receive French soldiers: this hospital was founded in the early part of the last century, by some of the richest citizens, and is so well supported by legacies, and by annual subscriptions, that the fund enables the directors to expend two thousand louis a year. In contempt of his treaty, Bonaparte has inflicted on the admission of French soldiers, for whose accommodation, however, he promised to pay a certain sum per diem: in contempt of his promise, again, he has withheld the payment! An hospital, however, is now preparing at Carouge, a village in Savoy, between Geneva and Grange Colonge, for Frenchmen, to which, it is expected, the soldiers will be removed in May or June. Here is also a general hospital, once the nunnery of St Clair; it was founded, together with many other useful institutions, by that celebrated reformer, John Calvin, who fled from the persecution of Francis I. and found an asylum in Geneva. The revenue arising from the estates of this hospital has, till within these last few years, been commensurate with its expenses; but, for some time back, it has been found necessary to collect almost an additional fourth, in order to supply its disbursements: twice in the year the treasurer goes round to every house, and solicits the charitable contribution of its inmates.\n\n\"Prior to the last revolution, I learn, that 600,000 French livres discharged all the public expenses: with this very trifling sum were paid the salaries of the magistrates, of the matter of the town, of the matter of the country, the expenses of the academy, of repairing the roads, of cleaning and lighting the town; in short, these 600,000 livres were sufficient to defray all the ordinary expenses of the government. Since that too-memorable event, the citizens of Geneva have been assessed to the amount of 1,500,000 livres, the salaries of the inferior magistrates are in arrears, the roads are not kept in good repair, the town is very dimly lighted, and the streets, a few of the principal ones excepted, are left with all their dirty honours thick upon them! The inhabitants go so far as to assert, that, in consequence of the neglect which the public drains have suffered, they have been affected with fevers and other illnesses to which they had hitherto been strangers.\n\n\"I understand, that the revenue of Geneva, since it has been annexed to the republic of France, arises chiefly from the following sources.\u2014An excise duty is laid on all provisions (wheat excepted), on wine and merchandise of every description, which is brought into Geneva: the annual produce of this tax is about 120,000 French livres; a land tax; a tax on doors and windows; a tax on the sale of estates; a heavy tax on the collateral inheritance of an estate\u2014where the inheritance is lineal and immediate, the tax is moderate. To these taxes or contributions, as they are called, must be added la contribution mobili\u00e8re, which is a small tax on personal property, and produces annually about 75,000 livres. The collectors of these taxes are appointed by the First Consul, and are paid very highly for their trouble: the prefect, and all the principal public officers, are very regularly paid, but those in a subordinate situation seldom get above one-third of their stipends.\n\n\"Divorces seem to be obtained here with too much facility. But, in the first place, as to marriages, they must be celebrated, according to the French law, before the municipality, at the maison de ville. Marriage in France, you know, is merely a civil ceremony, the parties being obliged to swear before an appointed magistrate, that they are of age, and that they have consented\nconfented to become man and wife. The Genevans, however, do not consider this ceremony as sufficient; but, as our Gretna Green couples, on their return to Britain, think it necessary, after the fervour of passion is abated, and the mercury is fallen, in the animal thermometer, something lower than blood heat, to have the holy rites performed with the solemnity prescribed by law; so the Genevans, in addition to the civil ceremony prescribed by the laws of the republic of France, voluntarily conform to the religious ordinance of their own church. That a man should be able to obtain a divorce from the wife who is unfaithful to his bed, is highly reasonable; but here, if a woman leaves her husband, and refuses to return to his habitation, after being summoned by him for that purpose, he can repudiate her for disobedience. This doublet was grounded on the presumption, that, if a woman fled from her husband, and refused his solicitation to return, it could only be for the purpose of cohabiting with some other man: but an advantage is taken of this presumption; and now, when the parties, for whatever reasons, are desirous of being divorced, the wife, with the knowledge and consent of her husband, generally goes into Switzerland, where she remains six months, during which time the husband summons her to return, she refuses, and at the end of that term a divorce is declared between them.*\n\nGENEVA Lake. This lake is in the shape of a crescent; along the concave side of which Mr. Coxe travelled 54 miles. Switzerland forms the hollow, and Savoy the convex part; the greatest breadth being about 12 miles. The country on the side of Savoy is full of high and craggy mountains; but from Geneva to the environs of Lausanne it slopes to the margin of the lake, and is very rich and fertile. The banks rise considerably in the neighbourhood of Lausanne, and form a most beautiful terrace, with a rapid descent a few miles beyond the town. A plain begins in the neighbourhood of Vevey, which continues for a great way beyond the end of the lake, but contracting towards the water by the approach of the mountains. The lake itself appears at a distance of a beautiful blue colour, and the water is very clear and transparent. Near Geneva the coast of the lake abounds with pebbles; between that city and Lausanne it is sandy; from thence to Chillon it is bounded by hard calcareous rocks; and the extremity of the shore is a marsh formed by mud collected from the river Rhone. The greatest depth of this lake found by M. de Luc is 160 fathoms. Here the birds called tippet grebes make their appearance in December, and retire in February to other places where they breed. They make floating nests of reeds; but as the lake of Geneva affords none of these, they are obliged to migrate to other places where they grow. Their skins are much esteemed, and sell for 12s. or 14s. each. The lake of Geneva, like all others situated between mountains, is subject to sudden storms.","sp":113,"ep":121},{"h":"GENEVA","t":"or Gin, among distillers, an ordinary malt spirit, distilled a second time, with the addition of some juniper berries.\n\nOriginally, the berries were added to the malt in the grinding; so that the spirit thus obtained was flavoured with the berries from the first, and exceeded all that could be made by any other method.

See Daemon.\n\nAmong the Romans, Festus observes, the name genius was given to the god who had the power of doing all things, deum qui vim obtinereat rerum omnium gerendarum; which Voilius, de Idol. rather chooses to read genendarum, who has the power of producing all things; by reason Censorinus frequently uses gere for signere.\n\nAccordingly St Augustin, de Civitate Dei, relates, from Varro, that the genius was a god who had the power of generating all things; and presided over them when produced.\n\nFestus adds, that Aufidius spoke of the genius as the Son of God, and the Father of men, who gave them life; others, however, represented the genius as the peculiar or tutelary god of each place; and it is certain, the last is the most usual meaning of the word. The ancients had their genii of nations, of cities, of provinces, &c. Nothing is more common than the following inscription on medals, GENIUS POPULI ROM. \"the genius of the Roman people;\" or GENIO POP. ROM. \"to the genius of the Roman people. In this sense genius and lar were the same thing; as, in effect, Censorinus and Apulius affirm they were. See Lares and Penates.\n\nThe Platonists, and other eastern philosophers, supposed the genii to inhabit the vast region or extent of air between earth and heaven. They were a sort of intermediate powers, who did the office of mediators between gods and men. They were the interpreters and agents of the gods; communicated the wills of the deities to men; and the prayers and vows of men to the gods. As it was unbecoming the majesty of the gods to enter into such trifling concerns, this became the lot of the genii, whose nature was a mean between the two; who derived immortality from the one, and passions from the other; and who had a body framed of an aerial matter. Most of the philosophers, however, held, that the genii of particular men were born with them, and died; and Plutarch attributes the ceasing of oracles partly to the death of the genii.\u2014See Oracle.\n\nThe heathens, who considered the genii as the guardians of particular persons, believed that they rejoiced and were afflicted at all the good and ill fortune that befell their wards. They never, or very rarely, appeared to them; and then only in favour of some person of extraordinary virtue or dignity. They likewise held a great difference between the genii of different men; and that some were much more powerful than others; on which principle it was, that a wizzard in Appian bids Antony keep at a distance from Octavius, by reason Antony's genius was inferior to and stood in awe of that of Octavius. There were also evil genii, who took a pleasure in persecuting men, and bringing them evil tidings: such was that mentioned by Plutarch which appeared to Brutus the night before the battle of Philippi. These were also called larvae and lemures. See Larvae and Lemures.\n\nGenius, in matters of literature, &c., a natural talent or disposition to do one thing more than another; or the aptitude a man has received from nature to perform well and easily that which others can do but indifferently and with a great deal of pains.\n\nTo know the bent of nature is the most important concern. Men come into the world with a genius determined not only to a certain art, but to certain parts of that art, in which alone they are capable of success. If they quit their sphere, they fall even below mediocrity in their profession. Art and industry add much to natural endowments, but cannot supply them where they are wanting. Every thing depends on genius. A painter often pleases without observing rules; whilst another displeases though he observes them, because he has not the happiness of being born with a genius for painting.\n\nA man born with a genius for commanding an army, and capable of becoming a great general by the help of experience, is one whose organical conformation is such, that his valour is no obstruction to his presence of mind, and his preference of mind makes no abatement of his valour. Such a disposition of mind cannot be acquired by art; it can be polished only by a person who has brought it with him into the world. What has been said of these two arts may be equally applied to all other professions. The administration of great concerns, the art of putting people to those employments for which they are naturally formed, the study of physic, and even gaming itself, all require a genius. Nature has thought fit to make a distribution of her talents.\ntalents among men, in order to render them necessary to one another; the wants of men being the very first links of society: she has therefore pitched upon particular persons, to give them aptitude to perform rightly some things which she has rendered impossible to others; and the latter have a greater facility granted them for other things, which facility has been refused to the former. Nature indeed has made an unequal distribution of her blessings among her children; yet she has disfavored none; and a man divested of all kinds of abilities, is as great a phenomenon as an universal genius.\n\nFrom the diversity of genius the difference of inclination arises in men, whom nature has had the precaution of leading to the employments for which they are designed, with more or less impetuosity in proportion to the greater or lesser number of obstacles they have to surmount in order to render themselves capable of answering this vocation. Thus the inclinations of men are so very different, because they follow the same mover, that is, the impulse of their genius. This, as with the painter, is what renders one poet pleasing, even when he trespasses against rules; while others are disagreeable, notwithstanding their strict regularity.\n\nThe genius of these arts, according to the abb\u00e9 du Bos, consists in a happy arrangement of the organs of the brain; in a just conformation of each of these organs; as also in the quality of the blood, which diffuses it to ferment, during exercise, so as to furnish plenty of spirits to the springs employed in the functions of the imagination. Here he supposes that the composer's blood is heated; for that painters and poets cannot invent in cool blood; nay, that it is evident they must be rapt into a kind of enthusiasm when they produce their ideas. Aristotle mentions a poet who never wrote so well as when his poetic fury hurried him into a kind of frenzy. The admirable pictures we have in Tasso of Armida and Clorinda were drawn at the expense of a disposition he had to real madness, into which he fell before he died. \"Do you imagine (says Cicero), that Pacuvius wrote in cold blood? No, it was impossible. He must have been inspired with a kind of fury, to be able to write such admirable verses.\"","sp":122,"ep":123},{"h":"GENOA","t":"a city of Italy, and formerly capital of a republic of the same name, situated in E. Long. 9\u00b0 30'. N. Lat. 44\u00b0 30'.\u2014By the Latin authors it is very frequently, though corruptly called Janus; and its present territories made part of the ancient Liguria. The era of its foundation is not known. In the time of the second Punic war it was a celebrated emporium; and having declared for the Romans, was plundered and burnt by Mago the Carthaginian. It was afterwards rebuilt by the Romans; and with the rest of Italy continued under their dominion till the decline of the western empire in 476. Soon after, it fell under the power of Theodoric the Ostrogoth; who having defeated the usurper Odoacer, became king of Italy. This happened in the year 498; and in a short time, the Goths being almost entirely subdued by Belisarius the emperor Justinian's general, Genoa was reannexed to the Roman empire. In 638, it was plundered and burnt by the Lombards, whose king Protharis erected it into a provincial dukedom.\n\nThe Lombards continued masters of Genoa till the year 774, when they were conquered by Charles the Great, son to Pepin king of France. He reduced Liguria to the ancient bounds settled by Augustus, and erected it into a marquirate; appointing his relation Audemarus the first count or margrave. Genoa at this time being distinguished for its wealth and populousness, began to give its name to the whole coast; and continued under the dominion of these counts for about 100 years, till the race of the Pepins became entirely extinct in Italy, and the empire was transferred to the German princes.\u2014In the year 935 or 936, while the Genoese forces were absent on some expedition, the Saracens surprized the city, which they plundered and burnt, putting to death a great number of the inhabitants, and carrying others into captivity. Having embarked their captives, together with an immense booty, they set sail for Africa; but the Genoese immediately returning, pursued the invaders; and having entirely defeated them, recovered all the captives and booty, and took a great many of the enemy's ships.\n\nAbout the year 950, the Franks having lost all authority in Italy, the Genoese began to form themselves into a republic, and to be governed by their own magistrates, who were freely elected, and took the name of Consuls. In order to support their independence, they applied themselves with great activity to commerce and navigation; and being apprehensive that some of the German emperors, who frequently entered Italy as invaders, might renew their pretensions to their state, they consented to acknowledge Berengarius III., duke of Friuli, who had been elected emperor by a party of Italian nobles. Berengarius, who had much ado to maintain himself in his new dignity, endeavoured by his concessions to enlarge the number of his friends and adherents; and accordingly made no difficulty to confirm the new republic in all its rights and privileges. After this the Genoese began to extend their commerce from Spain to Syria, and from Egypt to Constantinople; their vessels, according to the customs of those times, being fitted for fighting as well as merchandise. Having thus acquired great reputation, they were invited in 1075, by the Pisans, who had likewise formed themselves into a republic, to join with them in an expedition against Sardinia, which had been conquered by the Moors. In this expedition they were successful; the island was reduced; but from this time an enmity commenced between the two republics, which did not end but with the ruin of the Pisans.\n\nThe first war with Pisa commenced about 30 years after the Sardinian expedition, and lasted 18 years; when the two contending parties having concluded a treaty of peace, jointly sent their forces against the Moors in Africa, of whom they are said to have killed 100,000. The Genoese were very active in the time of the crusades, and had a principal share in the taking of Jerusalem. They also waged considerable wars with the Moors in Spain, of whom they generally got the better. They also prevailed against the neighbouring states; and, in 1220, had enlarged their territories beyond the skirts of the Apennines, so that the rest of Italy looked upon them with a jealous eye: but in 1311 the factions which had for a long time reigned in the city, notwithstanding all its wealth and power, induced...\ninduced the inhabitants to submit themselves for 20 years to the dominion of Henry VII., emperor of Germany. That emperor, however, died in August 1312; and the vicar he had left soon after went to Pisa, upon which the dissensions in Genoa revived with greater fury than ever. In 1317, a quarrel happened between the families of Spinola and Doria; which came to such a height, that both parties fought in the streets for 24 days without intermission, raised battering engines against each other's houses, and filled the city with blood. At last the Spinolae quitted the city, and retired to their territories in the Apennine mountains. The civil war continued till the year 1331; when, by the mediation of the king of Naples, it was concluded, that all exiles should return to the city; that the republic should be governed by the king's vicar; and all the offices of the state be equally divided between the Guelfs and the Gibellines, the two contending parties.\n\nBy this ruinous war, the coast of Genoa, formerly adorned with palaces and vineyards, was now reduced to the appearance of a barren waste. So great was the general desolation, that, according to Petrarch, the spectators who sailed along were struck with astonishment and horror. Villani, a contemporary author, relates, that it was supposed by the learned, that greater exploits had not been performed at the siege of Troy; and that the losses each party had sustained would have been sufficient to have purchased a kingdom, the Genoese republic being in his time the richest and most powerful state in Christendom. The annalist Stella informs us, that, before the war, the most extravagant profusion and luxury prevailed among the Genoese: but that, towards the end, many noble families were reduced to indigence and poverty; so that, about 100 years after, it became fashionable for the nobles to live in a plain manner, without any show or magnificence.\n\nIn 1336, both parties, suspending their mutual animosities, sent two fleets of 20 galleys each into the German ocean, to the assistance of the king of France, who was engaged in a war with Edward III., king of England. This naval expedition proved the cause of a most remarkable revolution in the Genoese government. The sailors of the fleet, thinking themselves injured by their officers, whom they accused of defrauding them of their pay, proceeded to an open mutiny; and, having expelled the admiral, and other commanders, seized the galleys. The king of France being chosen arbitrator, decided in favour of the officers, and imprisoned 16 of the chiefs of the mutineers. Upon this several of the sailors left the fleet, and returned to Genoa; where they went round the coasts, repeating their mutinous complaints, which were greatly hearkened to, upon a false report that the mutineers who had been imprisoned were broke upon the wheel. The factious spirit increased; and at last the Genoese inflicted in a tumultuous manner for having an abbot of their own choosing, and 20 of the people with the consent of the captains of the republic assembled for that purpose. While the mob were impatiently expecting their decision, a mechanic, generally accounted a fool, mounted a wooden bench, and called out that one Simon Bucanigree should be chosen abbot. This being instantly echoed by the populace, he was first declared abbot, then lord, and at last duke of Genoa.\n\nThis new expedient did not at all answer the purpose. The dissensions continued as violent as ever, notwithstanding the power of the new magistrates; and by these perpetual divisions the republic was at last so much weakened, that in 1390 the king of France was declared lord of Genoa. Under the French government, however, they soon became exceedingly impatient; and, in 1422, the duke of Milan obtained the sovereignty. With this situation they were equally displeased, and therefore revolted in 1436. Twenty-two years after, finding themselves pressed by a powerful fleet and army sent by Alphonso king of Naples, they again conferred the sovereignty of their state upon the king of France. In 1460, they revolted from the French; and, four years after, put themselves again under the protection of the duke of Milan: from whom they revolted in 1478. He was again declared sovereign of the republic in 1488; and, 11 years after, the city and territories of Genoa were conquered by Louis XII., of France.\n\nThe almost unparalleled fickleness of the Genoese disposition was not to be corrected by this misfortune. They revolted in 1506; but next year were again subdued by Louis. Six years after, they again revolted; and in 1516, the city was taken and plundered by the Spaniards. In 1528, Andrew Doria, a Genoese admiral in the service of the French, undertook to rescue his country from the dominion of foreign princes, and restore it to its liberty. Knowing well the fickle disposition of his countrymen, he took all occasions of exciting discontent among them against the government. He persuaded them, that the French (who had again obtained the sovereignty) had left them only a shadow of liberty, while they pretended to protect them from their enemies. To the nobility he represented the disgrace of suffering the government to be vested in the hands of foreigners less worthy of authority than themselves. Thus he soon formed a strong faction, and formed his plan; for the execution of which he took the most proper time, namely, when almost three-fourths of the French garrison had been carried off by the plague. He advanced with 500 men; and his friends having opened the gates of the city to him, he seized the principal posts, and thus became master of it without drawing his sword. The garrison retired to the forts, where they soon after capitulated, and being driven out of the city, Doria re-established the ancient form of government. See Doria.\n\nThe republic hath since continued to preserve her liberty, though greatly fallen from her ancient splendour, and now become a very inconsiderable state. In 1684, the Genoese had the misfortune to fall under the resentment of Louis XIV., at which time the city was almost destroyed by a formidable bombardment. In the year 1688, it was bombarded by Admiral Byng, and forced to capitulate; but there were at that time no views of making a permanent conquest of the city. In 1730, the island of Corsica revolted from the Genoese, and could never afterwards be reduced by them; for which reason it was sold to the French, who in the year 1770 totally reduced it.\nThe Genoese territories extend along that part of the Mediterranean sea, commonly called the gulf of Genoa, about 152 miles; but their breadth is very unequal, being from eight to about 20 miles. Where they are not bounded by the sea, the following states and countries, taking them from west to east, are their boundaries, viz. Piedmont, Montferrat, Milan, Placentia, Parma, the dukedom of Tuscany, and the republic of Lucca. This tract, though a great part of it is mountainous, and some of that barren enough, yet produces plenty of excellent fruit, good pasture, wood, garden stuff, and mulberry trees, with some wine and oil, but little corn. What they want of the last, they have either from Lombardy, Sicily, or Naples.\n\nGenoa stands on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, at the bottom of a little gulf, partly on the flat, and partly on the declivity, of a pleasant hill; in consequence of which, it appears to great advantage from the sea. It is defended on the land side by a double wall, which in circumference is about ten Italian miles. Two of the streets consist entirely of a double straight row of magnificent palaces. The others, though clean and well paved, are crooked and narrow. The palaces of the nobility are almost all of marble, and many of them are painted on the outside. That there should be such a profusion of marble here, is not to be wondered at, as the neighbouring hills abound with it. The city contains a vast number of palaces, churches, and convents, and several hospitals. The palace where the doge resides, and where the great and little council, and the two colleges of the procurators and governors assemble, is a large stone building in the centre of the city: but it contains some fine paintings in fresco; two statues of Andrew and John Doria in white marble; and an arsenal, in which are said to be arms for thirty-four thousand men, with a shield, containing one hundred and twenty pistol barrels, and thirty-three coats of mail, which, it is pretended, were worn by as many Genoese heroes in a croftade. Of the churches, the finest are those of the Annunciation, St Mary Carignan, St Dominic, and St Martha. In the cathedral is a dish made of a single emerald. All the inhabitants have, except the principal ladies, who are carried in chairs, walk on foot, on account of the narrowness of the streets. The fortifications of the city, towards the sea, are remarkably strong. There are two fine stone bridges over the rivers Bonzerra and Bifagno, the first whereof washes the west, and the other the east side of the city, within which there is also a surprising stone bridge joining two hills. The harbour, though large, is far from being safe; but no care or expense have been spared to render it as safe and commodious as possible. The wind to which it is most exposed, is that called Labecio, or the south-west. The place where the republic's galleys lie, is called the Darrena, where are a great number of Turkish slaves. On a rock, on the west side of the harbour, is the fanal or lighthouse, a high tower, on the top of which is a lanthorn, containing thirty-five lamps. The trade of Genoa is chiefly in velvets, damasks, plush, and other silks, brocades, lace, gloves, sweetmeats, fruits, oil, Parmesan cheese, anchovies, and medicinal drugs from the Levant; but the badness of the harbour, and the high price of commodities, greatly checks the commerce. In 1751, Genoa was declared a free port for ten years, under certain restrictions: in that called Porto Franco, any merchant may have a warehouse, and import or export goods duty free; but such as are disposed of in the city, or on the continent, are taxed pretty high. The nobility are allowed to trade in the wholesale way; to carry on velvet, silk, and cloth manufactures; and to have shares in merchant ships: and some of them, as the Palavicini, are actually the greatest merchants in Genoa. Another very profitable article of trade carried on by them is banking, and dealing in bills of exchange. A new academy of painting, sculpture, civil and military architecture, was instituted here in 1751. One may walk the streets of Genoa in the night with the greatest safety, which is more than can be said of many cities in Italy. Excessive splendour and luxury are, in several respects, restrained by salutary laws. No beggars are permitted to ask alms in Genoa, and the inns are better than those at Turin. When a single person is buried, a kind of garland of all sorts of artificial flowers is placed on the coffin. The Genoese in general are esteemed crafty, industrious, and inured to labour above the other Italians.\n\nAmidst the political convulsions which agitated Europe, in consequence of the unexampled French revolution, it was scarcely to be expected that Genoa would escape the shock. Accordingly in the year 1798, by the force and intrigues of the French republicans, its political constitution was totally subverted, and changed into what was afterwards denominated the Ligurian Republic, which was to be governed in a manner similar to that of their own, and the country also was divided into departments. As the preceding campaign had terminated in favour of the combined powers, and left them in the possession of every important place in Italy, this only excepted, the capture of it became an object of the utmost consequence to the contending parties. To regain it was the highest ambition of the house of Austria, while the retaining of it was matter of solicitude to the French republic. The reason is obvious. The conquest of it restored to the emperor of Germany the possession of all Italy, gave him the means of returning his former positions in the Maritime Alps, and reinforcing his former position on the Rhine. To the French it was a place of the utmost consequence, because while they were enabled to retain it in their own hands, they could easily favour the operations of their army in Switzerland, or their entrance into Italy by the defiles of Piedmont.\n\nAs the allies were fully determined on its conquest for the reasons already assigned, as well as for others of an inferior nature and magnitude, it is but candid to admit that the general by whom it was defended had innumerable difficulties to struggle with, and obstacles to surmount. When Massena succeeded Championet, the army was reduced to the most melancholy situation. Confined during the winter season to the bleak summits of the Apennines, it was reduced in numbers more than one half, and a constant prey to famine and disease. To add to the difficulties which everywhere prevented themselves to Massena, the higher classes of the Genoese looked upon the French only as the destroyers of their rank, commerce, and political importance; in consequence of which they fiercely aided every measure by which they might be driven from the country. Instead\nGentling of 60,000 men which he was promised, Massena had no more than 20,000 after all his unwearied exertions, and with these he had to defend an extent of country from Mount Cenis to the frontiers of Tuscany. He wisely dismissed all the former generals, independent of their merit, because the soldiers associated with them the idea of former misery and disgrace. In addition to the superior strength of the Austrian army, Massena found a formidable insurrection raised against him in the eastern territory of the Genoese republic. The passage by sea was obstructed by the British fleet, and his expected succours from Marseille only reached him in part. As he could not meet the army in the field by which he was blockaded, his only alternative was to remain in Genoa, every moment in dread of perishing by famine, if not speedily relieved.\n\nIn the mean time, the Austrian army had nothing to do during the winter but to remain in a state of observation; the distress to which the republican general was reduced was unspeakably great.

In this sense it continued among the Christian writers, till their manner of speech, together with their religion, was publicly and by authority received in the empire; when gentiles, from gentes, came into use: and then both words had two significations, viz., in treatises or laws concerning religion, they signified Pagans, neither Jews nor Christians; and in civil affairs, they were used for all such as were not Romans.\n\nGentile, in the Roman law and history, a name which sometimes expresses what the Romans otherwise called barbarians, whether they were allies of Rome or not: but this word was used in a more particular sense for all strangers and foreigners not subject to the Roman empire.","sp":126,"ep":126},{"h":"GENTILESCHI","t":"Horatio, an Italian painter, was born at Pisa in 1563.

He was well received by that king, who appointed him lodgings in his court, together with a considerable salary; and employed him in his palace at Greenwich, and other public places. The most remarkable of his performances in England, were the ceilings of Greenwich and York house. He did also a Madonna, a Magdalen, and Lot with his two daughters, for King Charles; all which he performed admirably well. After the death of the king, when his collection was exposed to sale, nine pictures of Gentileschi were sold for 600l. and are now said to be the ornaments of the hall in Marlborough house. His most esteemed piece abroad was the portico of Cardinal Bentivoglio's palace at Rome. He made several attempts in face painting, but with little success; his talent lying altogether in histories, with figures as big as the life. He was much in favour with the duke of Buckingham, and many others of the nobility. After 12 years continuance in England, he died here at 84 years of age, and was buried in the queen's chapel at Somerset-house.

Under this denomination are comprehended all above the rank of yeomen; wherefore noblemen are truly called gentlemen.\n\nA gentleman is usually defined to be one, who, without any title, bears a coat of arms, or whose ancestors have been freemen: and by the coat that a gentleman giveth, he is known to be, or not to be, descended from those of his name that lived many hundreds of years since.\n\nThe word is formed of the French gentilhomme; or rather of gentil, \"fine, fashionable, or becoming;\" and the Saxon man, q.d. honestus, or honeste loco natus.\u2014The same signification has the Italian gentilhuomo, and the Spanish hidalgo, or hijo delgo, that is, the son of somebody, or a person of note.\u2014If we go farther back, we shall find gentleman originally derived from the Latin gentilis homo; which was used among the Romans for a race of noble persons of the same name, born of free or ingenuous parents, and whose ancestors had never been slaves or put to death by law. Thus Cicero in his Topic, \"Gentiles sunt, qui inter se eodem sunt nomine, ab ingenuis oriundi, quorum majorum nemo servitutem servivit, qui capite non sunt diminuit,\" &c.\n\n\u2014Some\nGentleman.\u2014Some hold that it was formed from gentile, i.e., pagan; and that the ancient Franks, who conquered Gaul, which was then converted to Christianity, were called gentiles by the natives, as being yet heathens.\n\nOthers relate, that towards the declension of the Roman empire, as recorded by Ammianus Marcellinus, there were two companies of brave soldiers, the one called gentiles, and the other scutarii; and that it was hence we derive the names gentleman and esquire.\n\nSee Esquire.\u2014This sentiment is confirmed by Palaire, who supposes the appellation gentiles and ecuyers to have been transmitted to us from the Roman soldiery; it being to the gentiles and scutarii, who were the bravest of the soldiery, that the principal benefices and portions of lands were assigned. See Benefice.\n\n\u2014The Gauls observing, that during the empire of the Romans, the scutarii and gentiles had the best tenements or appointments of all the soldiers on the frontiers of the provinces, became insensibly accustomed to apply the same names, gentillommes and ecuyers, to such as they found their kings gave the best provisions or appointments to.\n\nGentleman Usher of the Black Rod.

It is observed, however, that Hindoo is not the name by which the inhabitants originally styled themselves; but according to the idiom of the Shangcrit which they use, jumbodeep, from jumbo, a \"jackall,\" an animal common in their country; and deep, a large portion of land surrounded by the sea; or bhertekhunt, from khunt, i.e., \"a continent;\" and bherrihut, the name of one of the first Indian rajahs. It is also to be observed, that they have assumed the name of Hindoos only since the era of the Tartar government, to distinguish themselves from their conquerors the Mussulmans. The term Gentoo or Gent, in the Shanfcrit dialect, denotes animal in general, and in its more confined sense mankind, and is never appropriated particularly to such as follow the doctrines of Brama. They are divided into four great tribes, each of which has its own separate appellation; but they have no common or collective term that comprehends the whole nation under the idea affixed by the Europeans to the word Gentoo. Mr Halbed, in the preface to his translation of the Code of Gentoo Laws, conjectures, that the Portuguese, on their first arrival in India, hearing the word frequently in the mouths of the natives, as applied to mankind in general, might adopt it for the domestic appellation of the Indians themselves, or perhaps their bigotry might force from the word Gentoo a fanciful allusion to gentile or Pagan. The Hindoos, or Gentoos, vie with the Chinese as to the antiquity of their nation. They reckon the duration of the world by four jogues, or distinct ages; the first the Suttee jogue, or age of purity, which is said to have lasted about 3,200,000 years; during which the life of man was 100,000 years, and his stature 21 cubits; the second, the Tiratah jogue, or the age in which one-third of mankind were reprobate; which consisted of 2,400,000 years, when men lived to the age of 10,000 years; the third, the Dwaper jogue, in which half of the human race became depraved, which endured to 600,000 years, when men's lives were reduced to 1000 years; and fourthly, the Collee jogue, in which all mankind were corrupted, or rather diminished, which the word collee imports. This is the present era, which they suppose will subsist for 400,000 years, of which near 5000 are already past; and man's life in this period is limited to 100 years. It is supposed by many authors, that most of the Gentoo shafters, or scriptures, were composed about the beginning of the Collee jogue: but an objection occurs against this supposition, viz., that the shafters take no notice of the deluge; to which the bramins reply, that all their scriptures were written before the time of Noah, and the deluge never extended to Hindoostan. Nevertheless, it appears from the shafters themselves, that they claim a much higher antiquity than this; instances of which are recited by Mr Halbed.\n\nThe doctrine of transmigration is one of the distinguishing tenets of the Gentoos. With regard to this subject, it is their opinion, according to Mr Holwell, that those souls which have attained to a certain degree of purity, either by the innocence of their manners or the severity of their mortifications, are removed to regions of happiness proportioned to their respective merits; but that those who cannot so far surmount the prevalence of bad example, and the powerful degeneracy of the times, as to deserve such a promotion, are condemned to undergo continual punishment in the animation of successive animal forms, until, at the stated period, another renovation of the four jogues shall commence, upon the dissolution of the present. They imagine five different spheres above this earth; the highest of which called jattee, is the residence of Brama, and his particular favourites. This sphere is also the habitation of those men who never uttered a falsehood, and of those women who have voluntarily burned themselves with their husbands; the propriety of which practice is expressly enjoined in the code of the Gentoo laws. This code, printed by the East India Company in 1776, is a very curious collection of Hindoo...\nGentoo, doo jurisprudence, which was selected by the most experienced pundits or lawyers from curious originals in the Shanferit language, who were employed for this purpose from May 1773 to February 1775; afterwards translated into the Persian idiom, and then into the English language by Mr Halleck.\n\nThe several institutes contained in this collection are interwoven with the religion of the Gentooos, and revered as of the highest authority. The curious reader will discover an astonishing similarity between the institutes of this code and many of the ordinances of the Jewish law: between the character of the bramins or priests, and the Levites; and between the ceremony of the scape goat under the Mosaic dispensation, and a Gentoo ceremony called the absummed jigg, in which a horse answers the purpose of the goat. Many obsolete customs and usages alluded to in many parts of the Old Testament, may also receive illustrations from the institutes of this code. It appears from the code, that the bramins, who are the priests and legislators of the country, have resigned all the secular and executive power into the hands of another caste or tribe; and no bramin has been properly capable of the magistracy since the time of the fatter jogue. The only privilege of importance which they have appropriated to themselves, is an exemption from all capital punishment: they may be degraded, branded, imprisoned for life, or sent into perpetual exile; but it is everywhere expressly ordained, that a bramin shall not be put to death on any account whatsoever.\n\nWe have already observed, that the Hindoos are divided into four great and original tribes, which according to the Gentoo theology, proceeded from the four different members of Brama, the supposed immediate agent of the creation under the spirit of the Almighty. These tribes are the Bramins, which proceeded from his mouth, and whose office is to pray, read, and instruct; the Chehteree, which proceed from his arms, whose office is to draw the bow, to fight, and to govern; the Bice, proceeding from the belly or thighs, who are to provide the necessaries of life by agriculture and traffic; and the Soonder, from the feet, which are ordained to labour, serve, and travel.\n\nFew Christians, says the translator of the Gentoo code, have expressed themselves with a more becoming reverence of the grand and impartial designs of Providence, in all its works, or with a more extensive charity towards all their fellow creatures of every profession, than the Gentooos. It is indeed an article of faith among the Bramins, that God's all merciful power would not have permitted such a number of different religions, if he had not found a pleasure in beholding their varieties.","sp":127,"ep":128},{"h":"GENUFLEXION","t":"(of genu, \"knee,\" and fleo \"I bend,\") the act of bowing or bending the knee; or rather of kneeling down.\n\nThe Jesuit Roefweyd, in his Onomasticon, shows, that genuflexion, or kneeling, has been a very ancient custom in the church, and even under the Old Testament dispensation; and that this practice was observed throughout all the year, excepting on Sundays, and during the time from Easter to WhitSunday, when kneeling was forbidden by the council of Nice.\n\nOthers have shown, that the custom of not kneeling on Sundays had obtained from the time of the apostles, as appears from St Irenaeus, and Tertullian; and the Genus Ethiopic church, scrupulously attached to the ancient ceremonies, still retains that of not kneeling at divine service. The Ruffians esteem it an indecent posture to worship God on the knees. Add, that the Jews usually prayed standing. Roefweyd gives the reasons of the prohibition of genuflexion on Sundays, &c., from St Basil, Anastasius, St Justin, &c.\n\nBaronius is of opinion, that genuflexion was not established in the year of Christ, 38, from that passage in Acts xx. 36, where St Paul is expressly mentioned to kneel down at prayer; but Saurin shows, that nothing can be thence concluded. The same author remarks, also, that the primitive Christians carried the practice of genuflexion so far, that some of them had worn cavities in the floor where they prayed: and St Jerome relates of St James, that he had contracted a hardness on his knees equal to that of camels.","sp":128,"ep":128},{"h":"GENUS","t":"among metaphysicians and logicians, denotes a number of beings which agree in certain general properties common to them all: so that a genus is nothing else but an abstract idea, expressed by some general name or term.

Leland conjectures that he was educated in a Benedictine convent at Monmouth, where he was born; and that he became a monk of that order. Bale, and after him Pits, call him archdeacon of Monmouth; and it is generally asserted that he was made bishop of St Asaph in the year 1151 or 1152, in the reign of King Stephen. His history was probably finished after the year 1138. It contains a fabulous account of British kings, from the Trojan Brutus to the reign of Cadwallader in the year 690. But Geoffrey, whatever censure he may deserve for his credulity, was not the inventor of the stories he relates. It is a translation from a manuscript written in the British language, and brought to England from Armorica by his friend Gualter, archdeacon of Oxford. But the achievements of King Arthur, Merlin's prophecies, many speeches and letters, were chiefly his own addition. In excuse for this historian, Mr Wharton judiciously observes, that fabulous histories were then the fashion, and popular traditions a recommendation to his book.\n\nGeoffroy, Stephen-Francis, a physician eminent for his chemical and botanical knowledge, was born at Paris in the year 1672, where his father kept an apothecary's shop, and had been several times in the magistracy. He received a liberal education; and, while prosecuting the study of medicine, he had conferences at his father's house with Cassini, du Verney, Homberg, and other men of distinguished eminence.\n\nAt Montpellier he attended the lectures of the most able professors of physic, and afterwards visited the south of France, carefully viewing every object deserving of his attention. He accompanied count de Tallard to England in 1698, where he became acquainted with the chief men of science, and was made a member of the Royal Society. He next went into Holland, and in 1700 he attended the abbe de Louvois in a tour to Italy. He was, on his return, made bachelor of medicine in 1702, and, in two years after, he was created M.D. One of his theses was on the question, \"An hominis primordia vermis?\" which was translated into French for the sake of some ladies of exalted rank, by whom it was deemed interesting.\n\nGeoffroy did not hastily commence the practice of medicine, continuing the prosecution of his studies in retirement for some years. He never appeared anxious to push himself forward, although his knowledge made him be often consulted by several gentlemen of the faculty. He was so concerned for the recovery of his patients, that it gave him an air of melancholy, which at first alarmed them, till they became acquainted with the cause. He was, in 1709, made professor of physic by the king to the Royal College, vacant by the death of the celebrated Tournefort. He began with lectures on materia medica; and in 1712, M. Fagon resigned to him the chemical chair: on both which topics Geoffroy lectured with unrestrained affluency. He was twice chosen to the office of dean by the faculty of Paris, and he filled a place in the Royal Academy of Sciences, from the year 1699. His health at last yielded to his toils, and he died in January, 1731. He is known to the chemical world by his table of affinities, far superior to any which had appeared before his time. His greatest work was his History of the Materia Medica, which, in an unfinished state, was published after his death in the year 1741, in 3 vols 8vo.\n\nGeographical mile, the same with the sea mile; being one minute, or the 60th part of a degree of a great circle on the earth's surface.\n\n**Geography**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nGeography is that part of knowledge which describes the surface of the earth; its divisions, extent, and boundaries; the relative position of the several countries and places on the globe, and the manners, customs, and political relations of their inhabitants. The word is Greek, \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, from \u03b3\u1fc6 or \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2, terra, \"the earth,\" and \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03c9, scribo, \"I write.\" As everything that immediately contributes to the ascertaining of the situation and limits of countries and places on the surface of the earth, is within the province of geography, this science includes the description and use of globes, maps, and charts, with the methods of constructing them.\n\nThis science has been divided into Geography properly so called, or a description of the lands of the geography-globe, and Hydrography, or a description of the waters; but this division is of little consequence, and is now seldom employed. Geography has also been divided into general and particular, terms which are variously understood by different writers on the subject. By Varenius, one of the oldest and best modern writers on general geography, general or universal geography is used to denote that part of the subject which considers the earth in general, and explains its affections as a terrestrial globe, without attending to its arbitrary division into different regions; and by particular or special geography, this writer understands the description of the particular regions of the earth; and he divides this latter into two parts; chorography, describing some considerable...","sp":128,"ep":129},{"h":"GEOGRAPHY","t":"Geography may be conveniently divided into descriptive geography, or that part of the science which describes the form, limits, extent, and variety of surface of different countries, with the manners and customs of their inhabitants; and physical geography, or that part which teaches how to determine the situations of different places on the globe, and to lay down and delineate their positions for the information of others. Descriptive geography is the more popular and entertaining part of the subject. It is usually divided into ancient or classical geography, geography of the middle ages, and modern geography. The first branch of the subject considers the state of the earth so far as it was known or discovered at different periods, previous to the fifth century of the Christian era. The geography of the middle ages extends from the sixth to the fifteenth century, and modern geography from the fifteenth century to the present time. One of the most useful subdivisions of descriptive geography is that employed by Mr Pinkerton, who considers the geography of the several countries which he describes under four different heads. 1. Historical or progressive geography; in which he treats of the names, extent, original population, progressive geographical improvements, historical epochs and antiquities of the countries. 2. Political geography; under which he describes the religion and ecclesiastic institutions, government, laws, population, colonies, military force, revenue, and political relations. 3. Civil geography, comprehending manners and customs, language, literature, and the arts, education, cities and towns, principal edifices, roads, manufactures and commerce. And, 4. Natural geography, comprehending an account of the climate and seasons, face of the country, its soil, and state of agriculture, its rivers, lakes, mountains, and forests, and an enumeration of the natural productions and natural curiosities, which are usually found within each district. Descriptive geography is sometimes styled political geography, while physical or general geography is called natural geography.\n\nAmong the other departments of this study we may mention sacred geography, or that which illustrates the sacred writings; and ecclesiastic geography, which describes the division of a country according to its church government, as into archbishoprics, bishoprics, &c.\n\nMany writers of treatises or systems of geography give a detailed account of the historical events and commercial concerns of the several countries which they describe; but we consider this as unnecessary in a pure geographical work, as these departments belong rather to History and Political Economy.\n\nSome systematic writers on geography considering the term in a very comprehensive view, as including a description of the internal structure of the earth, as well as of its surface, have thought it necessary to enter into discussions respecting the original formation of the earth, and the minerals of which it is composed. How far they are right in this we shall not pretend to determine. In this work, these subjects will be treated of under the articles GEOLOGY and MINERALOGY.\n\nAnother subject relative to the affections of the earth, respects the physical and chemical changes that take place in its atmosphere. These properly belong to the science of METEOROLOGY, and will be found under that article.\n\nWe propose in this article to offer only an introductory outline of descriptive geography, as the several quarters of the globe, and their subdivisions into empires, kingdoms, and states, are described as particularly as is compatible with the limits of this work, under the several articles to which they belong in the general alphabet.\n\nOur attention will be chiefly directed to physical geography, especially that part of it which describes the construction and use of globes, maps, and charts.\n\nPhysical geography is properly a branch of mixed mathematics, and its principles depend on geometry, and its kindred sciences, trigonometry and perspective. It is intimately connected with astronomy; and as these two sciences mutually illustrate each other, they are commonly taught at the same time. The physical changes that take place on the earth, as far as it is considered in its general character of an individual of the solar system, have been already explained under ASTRONOMY; and we shall have little here to add respecting them, except as they are modified by the situation of the observer on different parts of the earth's surface.\n\nThe principles and practice of physical geography, though strictly dependent on pure mathematics, may be, for the most part, explained in a popular way, so as to be understood by the generality of readers. This popular view of the subject we shall attempt in the present article, throwing everything that is purely mathematical into the form of notes. It must be evident, however, that a reader who is conversant with mathematics will study physical geography to more advantage; and for this purpose, it will be sufficient to possess a moderate acquaintance with arithmetic, the elements of geometry, plane trigonometry, spherics, and perspective.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to enlarge on the importance or utility of geography. It is one of those sciences, the knowledge of which is almost constantly required. Without an acquaintance with the geography of the countries that are the scenes of the actions which he relates, the historian must either be extremely concise, or his narration must be obscure and unintelligible. Geography affords the best illustration of history, and is equally necessary to the historian and his reader. To the traveller, under which denomination we may clasps the folder, the sailor, the merchant, as well as those who travel for pleasure or curiosity, a previous knowledge of the countries, through which he is to pass, is always useful, and often indispensable. To the politician a comprehensive knowledge of geography is of the highest importance. If he is ignorant of the extent, form, boundaries, appearances, climate, &c. of the country with which he is at war, he will plan his hostile expeditions without effect, and will send his invading armies only to perish among the defiles of the enemy, or to meet a more inglorious and deplorable fate from the diseases of the climate.\n\nEven, if we consider geography as a study of mere amusement and curiosity, it forms one of the most rational and interesting studies in which we can engage. Nothing can be more gratifying to the observer of mankind than to survey the manners and customs of various...\nPART I. HISTORY AND PRESENT STATE OF GEOGRAPHY.\n\nAn historical account of geography would be extremely interesting, as it would include, not only the progressive improvements of the science, considered as a branch of mixed mathematics, but an account of the successive discoveries of different parts of the earth that have been made by the more civilized communities. Such an account in detail, however, cannot be expected here; and we shall confine ourselves principally to a cursory view of the geographical discoveries of ancient and modern nations, referring the progressive improvements of physical geography for those parts of the article to which they properly belong; as they would neither be so interesting nor so intelligible to a general reader, before he has been made acquainted with the principles of the science.\n\nAs soon as mankind had formed themselves into societies, and begun to establish connexions with their neighbours, they would find it necessary to inform themselves of the position of the countries which bordered on their own; and very soon their curiosity would lead them to desire to form an acquaintance with the extent of the country in which they lived, and with many particulars respecting those which were remote from them. Thus, we see that scarcely had the sciences arisen among the Greeks, before their philosophers began to occupy themselves in geographical pursuits. We are told that Anaximander exhibited to his countrymen a plan of Greece and the neighbouring countries, and in this he was imitated by his countryman Hecateus of Miletus. Of the nature of these ancient plans or maps, and their progressive improvements, we shall speak more at large hereafter.\n\nCommerce, and the taste for adventures, which usually accompanies it, were doubtless among the first causes of geographical researches; but the Phoenicians are the earliest commercial people of whose discoveries we have any correct accounts. This people seem first to have investigated the coasts on the Mediterranean; and their navigators, extending their voyages beyond this sea, through the narrow channel which is now called the Straits of Gibraltar, entered the Atlantic ocean, and planted colonies in Iberia, a part of Spain, in the country of Tharshish, which is probably the modern Andalusia, and upon the western shores of Africa.\n\nThe learned Bochart, led by the analogy between the Phoenician tongue, and the oriental languages, has followed the tracks of the Phoenicians, both along the shores of the Mediterranean, and those of the Atlantic. These analogies are not always sure guides; but we can scarcely doubt that the city of Cadiz was a Phoenician colony, and it is not likely that this was the only one formed by that enterprising people.\n\nIn the time of Solomon, Phoenician ships, employed by him, set sail from a port in the Red sea, called Ophir. Azion-Gaber, and passing from that sea through the straits of Babelmandel, carried on their commerce in the Indian ocean. The country of Ophir, to which they sailed, must have been at a considerable distance from the Red sea, as we are told that a voyage thither required three years. \"The king (says the author of the first book of Kings) had a navy of Tharshish, with the navy of Hiram. Once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes and peacocks.\" Some have placed Ophir upon the coast of Africa, where the modern Sofala is situated; Others suppose it was a port in the island of Ceylon, or in the island of Sumatra, in which latter island there is still a place called Ophir. The gold dust and ivory brought from thence, seem to shew that it was an African port. * Montucla (See OPHIR.) M. Montucla supposes that the Phoeni-Hift de Mathem. ciens must even at this period have sailed round the continent of Africa, and that Ophir was some place on the Gold Coast (A).\n\nThe Carthaginians, a Phoenician colony, imitated their predecessors. We know that they sailed into the Atlantic ocean, as far as the coast of Cornwall in England, whence they procured large quantities of tin. The same people made several attempts towards a complete survey of the western coast of Africa. Of these we have an account only of one expedition, that of Hanno, of which we have already given an account under the article AFRICA.\n\nThe Carthaginian navigators, if we may believe the recital of Diodorus Siculus, (lib. xv.) discovered a country situated in the Atlantic ocean, which furnished all the necessaries and conveniences of life. Some pretend that this country was America, but it is much more probable that it was some one of the Cape de Verd islands.\n\n(A) The most celebrated writers who have supported the opinion, that Ophir was a port in Africa, are Montesquieu, Bruce, and d'Anville. Dr Prideaux and M. Goffelin again contend, that Ophir was a port in Arabia Felix, and the same with Sab\u00e9a or Sheba; and their opinions have lately been ably supported by Dr Vincent. See Vincent's Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, Part II.\nThe Carthaginian senate, fearful that the relations of the sailors who had discovered such a country, might be the means of producing frequent emigrations, are said to have used every endeavour to stifle the memory of this expedition.\n\nHistory speaks of several voyages undertaken by order of the kings of Egypt and of Persia, for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of Africa; and Herodotus relates that Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, employed some Phoenician navigators to sail along the coast of Africa, for the purpose of taking a more exact survey of it. See Africa.\n\nM. Goffelin, who has considered the geography of the ancients in a very learned dissertation, maintains, that the different passages of ancient writers, who have always declared that the Phoenicians and the Greeks circumnavigated Africa, are not sufficient to prove the certainty of such a voyage. The passage in Herodotus has been discussed by him at considerable length, and he seems to have proved his relation to be nothing more than a romance, founded on the historical knowledge of the Egyptians. M. Goffelin, however, admits, that many ancient voyages took place from those countries in which geography had arrived at some perfection; and there are numerous arguments, proving that all the shores of the old continent had been sailed round. See Bailly's History of Astronomy, p. 307, edit. 1775.\n\nXerxes, king of Persia, according to Herodotus, gave a similar commission about the year before Christ 480, to one of his satraps named Satafpes, who had been condemned to die. Satafpes entered the Atlantic ocean through the straits of Gibraltar, and bending his course towards the south, he coasted the continent of Africa, till he doubled a cape which was called Syloco, and which Riccioli considers as the same with the Cape of Good Hope. He is said to have continued his course to the south for some time, and then to have returned home, alleging as a reason for not proceeding further, that he had encountered a sea so full of herbage, that his passage had been completely obstructed. This reason appeared so ridiculous to Xerxes, that he ordered Satafpes to be crucified; but in this sentence he appears to have been rather too precipitate, as it is certain that in some latitudes there grows such a quantity of seaweed, that a vessel can scarcely make way through it; as in that part of the sea which lies between the Cape de Verd islands, the Canaries, and the coast of Africa, and is called by the Portuguese the sea of Saragossa. This shews that the relation of Satafpes may have been correct, as he might think it dangerous to attempt proceeding where he found himself so much entangled.\n\nHerodotus has commemorated another marine expedition, undertaken by Scylax, by order of Darius the son of Hystaspes, and which probably took place about the year 422 B.C. Scylax embarked upon the river Indus, the course of which he followed to its mouth, from whence he sailed in the course of 30 months, either into the Arabian gulf, or the Red sea. This Scylax must not be confounded with a navigator of the same name, who, at a later period, made a voyage of investigation round the Red sea.\n\nThe conquests of Alexander the Great, if they added little to the happiness of mankind, had at least the advantage of throwing considerable light on the state of geography at that time, as they afforded to the Greeks a more perfect knowledge of the river Indus, and of many parts of that vast country which derives its name from that river. Alexander does not seem to have penetrated to the Ganges, though his expedition led the way to the knowledge of that river; for soon after he went as far as Palibothra, a town situated on the river Indus, at its confluence with another river coming from the west. The followers of Alexander went down the Indus, as far as its opening into the Indian ocean, where they witnessed for the first time the phenomenon of the flux and reflux of the sea,\u2014a phenomenon which excited in them great astonishment and terror. It was after this that Alexander detached, about the year 327 before Christ, two of his captains, Nearchus and Onecritus, to investigate the coast of the Indian sea. Nearchus was ordered to return by the Red sea, and this he effected. Some fragments of his voyage have come down to us, and upon these has been formed an excellent work by Dr Vincent, entitled the \"Periplus of the Erythrean Sea.\" This learned and valuable work is just completed by the publication of the Second Part, and affords much additional illustration of the geographical information and commercial enterprises of the ancients.\n\nOneferitus failed to the east, and if we may believe the account that is left of his voyage, he gave us the first exact information respecting the island of Ceylon. The measure given by Oneferitus, of the extent of the island which he investigated, viz. 7000 stadia, does not correspond to Ceylon, whether we consider the length or circumference of the island, (see Ceylon); and if we take it as the measure of the length, it more nearly corresponds to that of Sumatra. The relations of Nearchus and Oneferitus were extant in the time of Strabo, by whom the latter is said to exceed, in point of exaggeration, all the other historians of Alexander's expedition. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that there are many things related by Oneferitus, as quoted by Strabo, which sufficiently agree with what we know of India, and the productions of that country; for he speaks of the sugar cane, the cotton plant, the bamboo, &c.\n\nThe kings of Egypt who succeeded Alexander, took by Ptolemy considerable interest in the progress of geography. The Philadelphus of these kings, Ptolemy Philadelphus, about the plus year 280 before Christ, sent into India two ambassadors, Megasthenes and Daimachus, accompanied by the mathematician Dionysius. Megasthenes was sent to the king of Palibothra on the banks of the Ganges, and Daimachus to another Indian potentate. No account remains of the proceedings of Dionysius and Daimachus, but Megasthenes left an account of his journey, which is frequently quoted by Strabo, by whom it is considered as a mixture of real adventures and improbable exaggerations. These quotations of Strabo are certainly all that remain of the relation of Megasthenes; for the work published under the name of Megasthenes is a literary imposture, similar to the works of Berossus, Manetho and Ctesias.\n\nIn the reign of Ptolemy Lathyrus, about 115 years before Christ, other expeditions were undertaken, for the purpose of sailing round the continent of Africa. Endoxus and Cylicus having incurred the displeasure of Ptolemy, were sent on this voyage of discovery. They\nThey passed through the straits of Gibraltar, and circumnavigating Africa, returned by the Red Sea. Lastly, in the reign of Ptolemy, surnamed Alexander, about 90 years before Christ, Agatharchides, who had been the king's governor, was sent to take a complete survey of the Red Sea, and wrote an account of his voyage, of which, however, there remain only a few extracts that are preserved by Photius, in his Bibliotheca, a work of ninth century.\n\nThe extension of commerce seems always to have been one of the principal objects of these voyages of discovery. It is not surprising, therefore, that the inhabitants of Marseille, which was early celebrated as a commercial city, appear among the ancient navigators who laboured to extend geographical knowledge. Two voyagers, Pythias and Euthymenes, undertook an expedition about 320 years before the Christian era. Euthymenes entered the Atlantic through the straits of Gibraltar, and turned towards the south, for the purpose of taking a survey of the coast of Africa. This is all that we know of his route; but Pythias steered northward, and after reconnoitring the coasts of Spain and Gaul, sailed round the island of Albion, and stretching still farther to the north, discovered an island which is believed to be the modern Iceland, or the Thule of the ancients, terrarum ultima Thule. Perhaps, however, this was only one of the Ferro islands. Strabo, who appears to have been prejudiced against Pythias, treats his relation as fabulous, founding his opinion principally on the number of incredible circumstances that occur in his narration. Taking these circumstances, however, not according to their literal meaning, but in a figurative sense, they represent pretty well the state of the sea and sky in these countries which are so little favoured by nature. Pythias certainly seems to have been one of the first Greek navigators who entered the Baltic.\n\nWe have thus traced the progress of geographical discoveries to very nearly the period which we assigned as the limit of ancient geography; and shall now notice very briefly some of the principal scientific geographers of antiquity, whose names or writings have descended to posterity, and shall afterwards give a summary sketch of the knowledge which the ancients seem to have possessed of the habitable globe.\n\nAs geography is a branch of knowledge intimately connected with geometry and astronomy, it became an object of consideration with many of the ancient geometers and astronomers. We have already mentioned the names of Anaximander of Miletus, and his countryman Hecateus. Strabo also notices Democritus, Eudoxus of Cnidus, and Parmenides, to the last of whom he attributes the division of the earth into zones. These were followed by Eratosthenes, who lived about 240 years before the Christian era, and Hipparchus, who flourished about 80 years afterwards; Polybius, Geminus, and Posidonius. Eratosthenes wrote three books on geography, of which Strabo criticizes some passages, though he frequently defends him against Hipparchus, who often affects an opposite opinion. Polybius wrote on geography as well as history, and as well as Geminus and Posidonius, is frequently quoted by Strabo. Polybius and Geminus argue with considerable acuteness for the possibility of the torrid zone being inhabited, a circumstance which was generally disbelieved by the ancients; and they even adduce arguments which are very plausible, to prove that the climate of the countries under the equator is more temperate than that of those which are situated nearer the tropics.\n\nWe must not here omit a geographer and mathematician who lived about the time of Alexander the Great. This was Dicaearchus of Messina, the disciple of Theophrastus, who wrote a description of Greece in iambic verses, of which some fragments yet remain. What renders this work most remarkable is, that it contains the height of several mountains measured geometrically by Dicaearchus. Thus, for instance, the height of Mount Cyrene is stated at 15 stadia, and that of Satalyce at about 14. Taking the stadium at 94\u00bd toises, we have for the latter of these heights, at most 1,400 toises, whereas many of the ancients assigned 300, 400, or even 500 stadia, as the height of some of their mountains.\n\nWith Dicaearchus we may mention another geometer noticed by Plutarch in his life of Paulus Emilius; viz. Xenagoras, a disciple of Aristotle, who also employed himself in measuring mountains, and has assigned only 15 stadia, which is equal to about 1,417 toises, as the height of Mount Olympus. In some of the later periods previous to the Christian era, we find the names of several geographers, as Artemidorus of Ephesus, who wrote a geographical work in eleven books, of which nothing remains; Scymnus of Chio, author of a description of the earth in iambic verses, which remains in a very mutilated state; Isidorus of Charax, who left a description of the Parthian empire, and Scylax of Caryades, author of a voyage round the Mediterranean sea, which is still extant.\n\nThe works of all these geographers, however, are Strabo trifling when compared with the geography of Strabo, a work in 16 books, which has come down to us entire. This is one of the most valuable works of antiquity, both from the spirit of discussion which runs through it, and the number of curious observations which the author has collected of different geographers and navigators who preceded him; and of whole works nothing remains except these extracts. Strabo lived in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, and was nearly contemporary with Pomponius Mela. This latter geographer wrote a work de situ orbis, which is little more than a bare summary, though it is valuable, as it gives us a sketch of what was known in his time respecting the state of the habitable globe. Pomponius Mela was followed by Julius Solanus, who has also treated of geography in his Polyhistor, a compilation which is sufficiently valuable from the number of curious observations which are there collected.\n\nOf all the ancient geographers, posterity is most indebted to Ptolemy, who produced a work much more scientific than had ever before been written on this science; a geography in eight books, which must ever be considered as one of the principal monuments of the labours of its author. In this work there appear, for the first time, an application of geometrical principles to the construction of maps; the different projections of the sphere, and a distribution of the several places on the earth, according to their latitudes and longitudes. This work must have been the result of a great many relations both historical and geographical, that had been collected by Ptolemy. It has passed through numerous editions.\nSome time after Ptolemy lived, Dionysius the African, commonly called the Periegetic, from the title of a work that he composed in verse, containing a description of the world, which may be considered as one of the most correct systems of ancient geography, and was by Pliny proposed to himself as a pattern. This work was afterwards translated into Latin verses by Priscian, and by Avienus, the latter of whom also wrote a description of the maritime coasts in iambic verses, of which there remain about 700. Among the latest geographers of this period are reckoned Marciannus and Agathemares, of whom little is known, except that the latter was author of two books on geography.\n\nThe scattered works of most of these authors being difficult to procure, were collected by Hudson into one work, and published by him in four volumes octavo, in the years 1698, 1702, and 1712, under the title of Geographiae veteris scriptores Graeciae minores, together with a Latin translation and notes and dissertations on each by Dodwell. In this work we find the remains of Hanno, Scylax, Nearchus, Agatharchides, Arrian, Marciannus, Dicearchus, Idiodore of Charax, Scymnus, Agathemares, Dionysius the Periegetic, Artemidorus, Dionysius of Bisanthe, Avienus, Priscian, and some fragments of Strabo, of Plutarch, of Ptolemy, of Abulfeda, and of Ulug Beg. This is a most valuable collection, and as it had become extremely scarce, was a few years ago reprinted at Leipzig.\n\nThe above is a hasty sketch of the names and characters of most of the geographical writers within the period which we have assigned to the ancient history of the science. We shall have occasion to make some further observations on the more eminent of these geographers in a future part of this article.\n\nWith respect to the knowledge of the globe that was possessed by the ancients, there have been various opinions; some have considered them as very extensively acquainted with almost every part of it, not excepting some portion of America; while others have confined their geographical knowledge within very narrow limits. The following observations are chiefly drawn from M. Montucla, an eminent judge in everything that relates to the history of the mathematical sciences.\n\nAs to the knowledge which the ancients possessed of the habitable globe, it is certain that they were well acquainted with Europe, or at least all that part of it which had been made subject to the Roman empire, as far as the banks of the Rhine and the Danube. They were tolerably well acquainted with Germany and Sarmatia. They had some knowledge of the Baltic sea, as a fleet had been sent by Augustus, which sailed as far as the peninsula then called the Cimbrian Chersonesus, the modern Jutland. The Baltic was at that time celebrated for the production of ambergrise. They had acquired a knowledge of the island of Britain, from the expeditions of Julius Caesar, and Claudius; but the northern parts of this island, and the whole of Ireland, were to them nations of rude, uncivilized savages. The boundary of their knowledge of Europe to the north, was the Thule of Pythias, or Iceland; at least if it is certain, as is the general opinion, that this island is the ultima Thule.\n\nWith respect to Asia, they seem to have surveyed the country as far towards the east as the river Ganges; and the immense extent of country comprehended between the Indus and the Ganges, was called by them India on this side the Ganges. Further on towards the north of China, in the neighbourhood of the mountains where these rivers derive their source, they placed several nations of people, of whom they related the most ridiculous fables. Beyond these, still more towards the east, they placed the Seres, and upon the coast of the gulf, which is now the bay of Cochin China, called by Ptolemy the Great Bay, were situated the Sin\u00e6, so called by Ptolemy, though they are not mentioned by Strabo, Pomponius Mela, or Solinus. The Seres were probably the inhabitants of the northern parts of China, and the Sin\u00e6, those of the southern parts of China, who very early occupied Cochin-China, Tonquin, &c., countries which in the sequel they have entirely subjugated. They maintained a commerce by land with the Seres, and their route is pointed out in one of Ptolemy's maps. Beyond the Seres, according to Strabo and Pomponius Mela, lay between the Oriental sea, though Ptolemy, for want of certain intelligence respecting that part of Asia, considers the point as undecided, and places there several unknown countries. The ancients carried this extremity of Asia much farther to the east than it is found to extend by modern geographers; for, according to them, the Seres and the Sin\u00e6 were situated about the longitude of 180\u00b0, while the meridian of Pekin, or about the middle of the Chinese empire, reaches no farther than to 134\u00b0, reckoning the longitude from the most distant of the Canary islands, as was done by Ptolemy. To the north of the Indus the ancient geographers placed the Scythians, and Hyperboreans (the Tartars and Samoedics of more modern date) and some other nations to an indefinite extent, who were supposed to form on that side an insurmountable barrier, having behind them an ocean of ice, which was believed to communicate with the Calm sea, though this was at least at the distance of 450 leagues.\n\nThe boundary of Asia, assigned by the ancients to the south, was the Indian ocean, and they were acquainted with its communication with the Red sea, by means of a strait, the figure of which is very ill expressed in their maps. This is also the case with the Persian gulf, with which they were acquainted, but which in the ancient maps has nearly the form of a rhombus, one side of which, towards the mouths of the Indus, was pretty well known to them, but the side next the mouths of the Ganges is very inaccurately delineated, being continued nearly in a straight line. It is even probable that the island which Ptolemy calls Taprobana, was only the peninsula of India very much disfigured in the delineation.\n\nThe situation of this island of Taprobana, so celebrated among the ancients, is a problem in geography of the island that is yet unsolved. It is commonly supposed to be Taprobane, the modern island of Ceylon; but the dimensions of it as laid down by ancient geographers, render this supposition doubtful, and there are some who rather believe it to be the modern Sumatra. The ancients had also some obscure knowledge of the peninsula of Malacca, which they called the Golden Chersonesus, and they seem to have examined the gulf formed by that land, which is now the gulf of Cochin China, or commonly called the gulf of Tonkin. It is somewhat extraordinary that they do not seem to have been acquainted\nquainted with Java, Borneo, and that numerous group of islands which form, in that quarter, the greatest Archipelago in the world. It is equally singular that the Maldives had escaped the observation of these navigators. This seems to prove that they never ventured out into the open sea, but kept close along the shore. Ptolemy indeed says, that his island of Taprobana was surrounded with many hundreds of smaller islands, to some of which he gives names; but all this is involved in impenetrable obscurity.\n\nOf Africa, the ancients knew only those parts which lay along the coast, and to a very small distance inland, if we except Egypt, with which they were well acquainted, at least as far as the cataracts of the Nile, and a little beyond them, as far as the island of Mero\u00eb, towards the 20th degree of north latitude. Their knowledge of the coasts of Africa on the side of the Red sea, extended no farther than the shores of that sea, except that part which was dependent on Egypt; the interior of the country being inhabited by ferocious and untractable people. They were still less acquainted with the countries which lay beyond the strait, and Ptolemy appears to have given no credit to the navigators who were said to have sailed round that part of the world, for he has left the continent of Africa imperfectly described.\n\nStrabo and Pomponius Mela were, however, decidedly of opinion that Africa was a peninsula, and that it was joined to the rest of the continent only by that narrow neck of land which is now called the isthmus of Suez. The ancients seem to have had no knowledge of that large and beautiful island of Madagascar, unless we suppose that Ptolemy had some imperfect acquaintance with it, under the name of the island Menuthius. The coast of Africa upon the Mediterranean sea, was once covered with towns, dependent on the Roman empire, flourishing and polished, while it presents at present nothing but a nest of pirates, whom the jealousy of the great commercial nations supports, to the disgrace and prejudice of civilized states. Proceeding from the straits of Gadez or Gibraltar, they had become acquainted with the coast as far as a cape which they called Hesperion-Keras, probably the modern Cape de Verd, or the cape that lies a little to the west of it, though in the maps of Ptolemy it is thrown a little back inland. The Fortunate islands, or the Hesperides, at present the Canaries, better known by fame than in reality, seem to have been the boundaries of ancient geography to the west, as the Seres and Sin\u00e6 were to the east. It appears, however, that the Cape de Verd islands were not entirely unknown to the ancients, and they are probably the same with what were then called the Gorgades or Gorgones, which were supposed to be two days sail to the west of Hesperion-Keras.\n\n\"There is little doubt (says Mr Pattefon) concerning the names by which most of the principal countries of Europe were known to the ancients; nor is there any difficulty in disposing of the chief nations, which ancient writers have enumerated in the south-west part of Asia or on the African coast of the Mediterranean; but with the north and north-east parts of Europe, about two thirds of Asia towards the same quarters, and nearly the same proportion of Africa towards the south, they appear to have been wholly unacquainted. Of America they did not even suspect the existence; and if it ever happened, as some writers have imagined, that Phoenician merchant ships were driven by storms across the Atlantic to the American shores, it does not appear that any of them returned from thence to report the discovery.\n\n\"The names of provinces, subdivisions, and petty tribes, mentioned by ancient authors, in those countries which were the chief scenes of Roman, Grecian, or Israelitish transactions, are almost as numerous as in a modern map of the same countries; and the situations of many of them can be very nearly assigned; but the limits of each, or indeed of the states or nations to which they belonged, can, in very few instances, be precisely fixed. Thus the southern boundaries of the Sarmatia in Europe, cannot be ascertained within a degree at the nearest; and in France, neither the limits of the people called the Belgae, Celt\u00e6, and Aquitanii; nor those of the Roman divisions, viz. Belgica, Lugdunensis, Aquitania, Narbonensis, and the Province, can be laid down, in many places, but by a hasty conjecture. The same observation may be justly applied to the Tarconensis, Lufitania, and Betica of Spain; to the Cauci, Catti, Suevi, &c. of Germany; and, above all, to the Britannia prima et secunda, and other divisions of the Roman government in Britain: of which not only the Atlas, Part limits, but the situations are still in dispute.\"\n\nDuring the middle ages geography, as well as most other arts and sciences, seems rather to have gone back-of the middle ages than advanced. The weaknesses of the Roman emperors, the relaxation of military discipline, the boundless passion for luxury and pleasure, and the continual incursions of the barbarous nations, while they contributed to hasten the fall of the western empire, also accelerated the ruin of the arts. It seems as if these destructive hordes of barbarians, the Goths, the Huns, and the Vandals, had enveloped the whole world in one profound and universal ignorance. This darkness, which overspread the whole of Europe, did not permit geography to make any advances for a very considerable time. There were indeed some navigators who investigated countries that were still little known, but they were so ignorant, that they afford us very little new light. There was one named Cosmas, who made a voyage to India, which procured him the name of Indo-Pleustes, and who gave an account of his voyage under the title of Sacred Geography. This man was so egregiously ignorant, as to believe that he had discovered that the earth was a plane, and that the diversity of the seas, and the inequality of the days and nights, were owing to a very high mountain situated to the north, behind which the sun set to a greater or lesser depth.\n\nThe voyages of the Arabians to the East Indies (see the history of Commerce), contributed to throw light on the farther light on that extensive part of the globe. Conquerors of the countries on the Red sea, and enthusiastic propagators of their religion, they carried their arms as far as the extremity of India. We see them in the 9th century extending to China; and Renaudot has published two of their narrations, in which we can trace with tolerable accuracy, the places visited by their authors. The island of Serendib, so celebrated in their tales, is certainly the modern Ceylon; for dib or dit, in the Malay language, signifies island; so that Serendib, signifies the island of Seren or Selan. Farther, these relations\nrelations do not give us as favourable an idea of the Chinese as we derive from their own history; on the contrary, if we may believe these Arabian travellers, this people were, even at that time, in a state not very civilized.\n\nWe are now arrived at the modern period of our history, during which the most important discoveries have been made, and our knowledge of the habitable globe more than doubled. The discoveries and improvements during this period are so numerous, that it will be impossible to give here any thing more than a chronological view of the most remarkable, referring for a detailed account of them to the geographical and historical articles in this work.\n\nThe tale for voyages of discovery began in Europe soon after the revival of literature in the 15th century, just before the commencement of which, namely, in the reign of Henry III. king of Spain, about the year 1395, the Canary islands were more fully surveyed than at any former period.\n\n1415. Prince Henry III. son of John king of Portugal, sailed round the coast of Africa.\n\n1417. The Canary islands were subdued by Bethancourt, nephew of the admiral of France.\n\n1420. The island of Madeira was examined by John Gonfalvo and Trist\u00e1n Vaz, two Portuguese.\n\n1446. Cape de Verd was discovered by Dennis Fernandez.\n\n1487. The Cape of Good Hope was discovered by Bartholomew Diaz. The discovery of this cape led the way to that of the new world. This great event, which gave a new flight to the genius of mankind, is one of the most important in the history of geography. A particular account of this discovery will be found under the article AMERICA. The following are the dates of the principal geographical discoveries which have taken place between that of Columbus, and the voyages of our celebrated navigator Cook.\n\n1496. Florida, by Sebastian Cabot, an Englishman.\n\n1498. The Indies, by Vasco da Gama.\n\n1499. The river of Amazons, by Yanez Pin\u00e7on.\n\n1500. Brazil, by \u00c1lvaro Cabral, a Portuguese.\n\n1504. Newfoundland, by some Normans.\n\n1518. Mexico, by Ferdinand Cortes.\n\n1519. The straits of Magellan, South sea, and Philippine islands, by Ferdinand Magellan.\n\n1525. Canada, by Jean Verrazzan, a Florentine, sent by Francis I. of France.\u2014Peru, by F. Pizarro of Spain.\n\n1527. New Guinea, by \u00c1lvaro de Salvedra.\n\n1534. Chili, by Diego Almagro.\n\n1535. California, by Ferdinand Cortes.\n\n1567. The islands of Solomon, by \u00c1lvaro de Mendoza.\n\n1618. New Holland, by Zechariah.\n\n1642. Van Dieman's land, by Abel Janzen Tasman.\n\n1643. Browne's land.\n\n1654. New Zealand.\n\n1678. Louisiana, by Robert Cavelier de La Salle, governor of Frontenac.\n\n1700. New Britain, by Dampier, an Englishman.\n\n1739. Cape Circumcision, contested between the French and English. Said by Montucla to be discovered by two French vessels.\n\n1767. The island of Tahiti, by Wallis, an Englishman.\n\n1778. The Sandwich islands, by Cook.\n\nWithin this period there are reckoned 25 voyages round the world, viz. those of Magellan, Drake, Cavendish, Noort, Spilburg, Lemaire, L'Hermite, Cleveypington, Carreri, Shelvack, Dampier, Cowley, Woodesround the Rogers, Le Gentil, Anfon, Wallis, Roggevein, Bougainville, Sarville, Dixon, three voyages of Cook, La Peyrouse, Marchand, Vancouver, and Pages.\n\nWithin these few years, very considerable light has been thrown on the state of our geographical knowledge, by several valuable voyages and travels that have lately appeared. The discoveries that have been successively made in the great South sea, and in other parts of the world, especially the extensive island of New Holland, are now so fully established, as to add considerably to the certainty of our geographical knowledge; and the voyages of Cook, La Peyrouse, and Vancouver, have afforded us more exact surveys of the coasts of these countries than we could, some years ago, have dared to hope for. The accounts of the late embassies to China, Tibet and Ava, afford many authentic materials for a modern system of geography, the place of which must have been supplied by more remote and doubtful information. From the latter of these accounts we are become familiarly acquainted with an empire (that of the Birmans), which a short time ago was scarcely known (see ASIA, 81\u2013152.) Our knowledge of Hindostan and the neighbouring countries has been greatly extended by the researches of the Asiatic Society, and some other late works; while our acquaintance with the interior of Africa has been rendered less imperfect by the exertions of the African Society, and by the travels of Park, Brown, and Barrow; and the northern boundaries of America, even as far as the sea which appears to surround the northern extremity of that vast continent, have been more fully disclosed by the journeys of Hearne and Mackenzie.\n\nThe late voyage of Turnbull, however insignificant it may be in other respects, has at least the merit of enlarging our knowledge of the manners and political transactions of the South sea islanders, and of introducing to our acquaintance, in the person of Tamahama, the chief of Owhyhee, a sovereign, who, in ambition and desire of improvement, bids fair to vie with Peter the Great; and to transform a nation of savages, to a civilized people.\n\nWith all the advantages which geography has lately received, the science is still far from being perfect; and facts of geography, the exclamation which D'Anville is said to have made in his old age, \"Ah! mes amis, il y a bien d'erreurs dans la g\u00e9ographie\"\u2014\"Ah! my friends, there are a great many errors in geography,\" may still be applied with considerable justice. Many points in the science have been but very lately ascertained. Thus, the extent of the Mediterranean sea was almost unknown at the beginning of the 17th century, although it is now almost as exactly ascertained as that of any country in Europe. In a book published by Gemma Frisius, de orbis divisione, in 1530, we find the difference of longitude between Cairo in Egypt and Toledo in Spain stated at 53\u00b0 instead of 35\u00b0, and other measures of extent are proportionally erroneous. Not many years ago there was an uncertainty with respect to the extremity of the Black sea and the Caspian, to the amount of 3\u00b0 or 4\u00b0; and\nand so lately as the year 1769, the longitude of Gibraltar and of Cadiz was not known within half a degree.\n\nMany parts of the geography of Europe are still very defective; Spain and Portugal have been but imperfectly explored, and European Turkey is still less known. It may appear extraordinary that we have yet no correct chart of the British channel, though we are assured by Major Rennell that this is the case; and it has been proved by the trigonometrical surveys of Britain that have yet been published, that there are many gross errors in our best county maps. We have had occasion to remark that geography has sometimes been retrogressive, and there cannot be a greater proof of the truth of the observation, than that in a map of the Shetland islands, published not long ago, by Preston, they are represented as too large by one third, both in length and breadth, and their relative positions are very inaccurate, though in the maps of the same islands published before the year 1750, they are laid down with much greater accuracy, as appears from surveys made by order of the late king of France, and from the maps published by Captain Donnelly, and at Copenhagen, in the year 1787.\n\nIn Asia we are imperfectly acquainted with Tibet, and some other central regions; and even Persia, Arabia, and Asiatic Turkey, are but little known. Of Australasia, or New Holland, and New Guinea, almost nothing is known except the coasts, and a great part of them towards the south has been but imperfectly explored. Of Polynesia, or the numerous islands in the South Pacific ocean, we are also very ignorant; and in the Pacific ocean, particularly towards the south pole, many discoveries probably remain to be made.\n\nOur ignorance of the central parts of Africa is notorious, and the improvement of our geographical knowledge in that quarter has, for some years, been a favourite object. It may admit of doubt, however, whether this object will be speedily attained, as the obstacles to investigation in those inhospitable tracts, seem nearly insurmountable by human prudence and courage. Even the shores of Africa have not been completely surveyed, especially those towards the south and east.\n\nAmerica has of late been much more fully explored than at any former period: but still the western parts of North America, and the central and southern regions of South America, are very little known; and the Spanish settlements towards the north are scarcely known, except to their own inhabitants.\n\nThe science of geography will probably be never perfectly understood, as, besides the numerous obstacles which oppose the progress of the traveller, it is scarcely possible that exact trigonometrical surveys of every place and country, the only certain method of ascertaining their exact situations and relative positions, can be made.\n\nPolitical geography must ever remain the most uncertain part of the science. New changes are perpetually taking place in the relations of neighbouring states, according as ambition, tyranny, or commercial convenience dictates. Territory is transferred, by cession or by conquest, from one nation to another. Whoever will compare the relations of the European states, as they appear in the present maps, and in those published half a century ago, will scarcely recognize the countries to be the same. The great divisions indeed remain as before, but the boundaries of most of them are entirely changed. A number of independent states, and in one instance, a large kingdom, have been swallowed up by the unjustifiable ambition of their more powerful neighbours, and their names may be blotted from the map of Europe. The republics of Holland, of Switzerland, of Venice, are no more: the kingdoms of Poland and Sardinia have ceased to exist; the successor of St Peter, who once gave laws to princes, and governed Europe with unbounded sway, is now a wretched exile, and his dominions are doomed to increase the already overgrown power of despotic upstarts. Whether the present generation of emperors and kings, erected by the mighty Napoleon, will remain as long as did the states on whose ruins they have been raised, or are rather ephemeral productions, doomed to perish at the setting of that sun which now gives them life and vigour, is a question which future experience alone can determine.\n\nThe limits prescribed to this article do not permit us to enter on a critical examination, or even a characteristic sketch, of the geographical works that have appeared in the modern period of the history of the science; and a bare enumeration of names would be equally tiresome and uninteresting. Some of the best modern works will be mentioned in the sequel; at present we shall conclude this Part in the words of an able judge of the present state of the science.\n\n\"The Spaniards and Italians (says Mr Pinkerton) have been dormant in this science; the French works of La Croix and others are too brief; while the German compilations of Buching, Fabri, Ebeling, &c., are of a most tremendous prolixity, arranged in the most tattlefs manner, and exceeding in dry names, and trifling details, even the minutest of our gazetteers. A description of Europe in 14 quarto volumes, may well be contrasted with Strabo's description of the world in one volume: and geography seems to be that branch of science, in which the ancients have established a more classical reputation than the moderns. Every great literary monument may be said to be erected by compilation, from the time of Herodotus to that of Gibbon, and from the age of Homer to that of Shakespeare; but in the use of the materials there is a wide difference between Strabo, Arrian, Ptolemy, Pausanias, Mela, Pliny, and other celebrated ancient names, and modern general geographers; all of whom, except d'Anville, seem under graduates in literature, without the distinguished talents or reputation, which have accompanied almost every other literary exertion. Yet it may safely be affirmed, that a production of real value in universal geography requires a wider extent of various knowledge than any other literary department, as embracing topics of the most multifarious description. There is, however, one name, that of d'Anville, peculiarly and justly eminent in this science; but his reputation is chiefly derived from his maps, and from his illustrations of various parts of ancient geography. In special departments Goffelin, and other foreigners, have also been recently distinguished; nor is it necessary to remind the reader of the great merit of Rennell and Vincent in our own country.\"\n\nPART Geography, p. 8.\nPART II. PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF GEOGRAPHY.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Surface, and General Divisions of the Earth.\n\nIT has been supposed, by the less enlightened part of mankind in all ages, that the surface of the earth is nearly a plane, bounded on all sides by the sky. It was shewn, however, in the article Astronomy, (No. 269\u2014272) that the earth is of a spherical figure, and an account was there given of the manner in which the true form of it was determined. Independently of the considerations there detailed, the spherical figure of the earth may be inferred, in a popular view, from the following facts.\n\n1. When we stand on the sea-shore, while the sea is perfectly calm, we easily perceive that the surface of the water is not quite plain, but convex or rounded; and if we are on one side of a broad river or arm of the sea, as the firth of Forth, and with our eyes near the water, look towards the opposite coast, we shall plainly see the water elevated between our eyes and the opposite shore, so as to prevent our seeing the land near the edge of the water.\n\n2. When we observe a ship leaving the shore, and going out to sea, we first lose sight of the hull, then of the sails and lower rigging, and lastly of the upper part of the masts. Again, when a ship is approaching the shore, the first part of her that is seen from the land is the topmast, then the sails and rigging appear, and lastly the hull comes gradually into view. These appearances can arise only from the ship's sailing on a convex surface; as, if the surface of the sea was plain, a ship on its first appearance would be visible, though very small, in all its parts at the same time, or rather the hull would first appear, as being most distinguishable; and, in going out of sight, it would in the same manner disappear at once, or the hull would be the last part of which we should lose sight.\n\n3. Many navigators sent on voyages of discovery, have, by keeping the same course, at length arrived at the port from which they set out, having literally sailed round the globe. This could not happen if the sea were a plain.\n\n4. When we travel to a considerable distance, in a direction due north or due south, a number of new stars successively appear in the heavens, in the quarter to which we are travelling; while many of those in the opposite quarter gradually and successively disappear, and are seen no more till we return in a contrary direction.\n\n5. In an eclipse of the moon, which has been shewn (Astronomy, No. 199) to be owing to the obscuration of the moon's surface by the shadow of the earth, the boundary of the obscured part of the moon is always circular. Now, it is evident that no body, which is not spherical, can, in all situations, cast a circular shadow.\n\nThe diameter of the earth is generally computed at 7958 miles, though Mr Vince makes it 7930, nearer the medium derived from a comparison of the polar with the equatorial axis. Taking this last, therefore, as the mean diameter, the circumference will be = 24,912 miles, and consequently the extent of the surfaces will be = 197,552,160 miles, of which it is computed that at least two-thirds are covered with water.\n\nIn the above computation no account is taken of the mountains and other eminences on the surface of the globe; for, although these are of considerable consequence in a geographical point of view, as they constitute the most natural and remarkable boundaries of countries, and by their influence on the soil and climate of the different regions, contribute in a great degree to form those shades of distinction which diversify the inhabitants of the several quarters of the earth, they are, however, too trifling, when compared with the diameter of so great a body, to make any sensible error in the calculation.\n\nThe surface of the earth is exceedingly diversified, almost everywhere rising into hills and mountains, or of the sinking into valleys; and plains of any great extent are extremely rare. Among the most extensive plains, are the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa, the internal part of European Russia, and a tract of considerable extent in the late kingdom of Poland, now called Prussian Poland. But the most remarkable extent of level ground, is the vast platform of Tibet in Asia, which forms an immense table, supported by mountains running in every direction, and is the most elevated tract of level country on the globe. The chief elevations or mountains that occur, with their elevation, &c. will be mentioned under Geology. The greatest concavities of the globe are those which are occupied by the waters of the sea, and of these by far the largest forms the bed of the Pacific ocean, which stretching from the eastern shores of New Holland to the western coast of America, covers nearly half the globe. The concavity next in size and importance, is that which forms the bed of the Atlantic ocean, extending between the new and the old worlds; and a third concavity is filled by the Indian ocean. Smaller collections of water, though still large enough to receive the name of oceans, fill up the remaining concavities, and take the names of Arctic and Antarctic seas.\n\nSmaller collections of water that communicate freely with the oceans, are called seas, (vid. A; fig. 1), and of these the principal are the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Black sea, and the White sea. These seas sometimes take their names from the country near which they flow; as the Irish sea, and the German ocean. Some large bodies of water, which appear to have no immediate connexion with the great body of waters, being everywhere surrounded by land, are yet called seas; as the Caspian sea.\n\nA part of the sea running up within the land, so as to form a hollow, if it be large, is called a bay or gulf; as the bay of Biscay, gulf of Mexico: if small, a creek, road, or haven.\n\nWhen two large bodies of water communicate by narrow pats between two adjacent lands, this pat is called\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples called a strait or straits (C, fig. 1.) as the straits of Gibraltar, the straits of Dover, of Babelmandel, &c. The water usually flows through a strait with considerable force and velocity, forming what is called a current, and frequently this current always flows in the same direction. Thus, in the straits of Gibraltar there is a constant current from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, though the surface of the latter never seems to be elevated beyond its usual level. There is always a current round Cape Finisterre and Cape Ortegal, setting into the bay of Biscay, and it has been discovered by Major Rennell, that this current is continued in a direction N. W. by W. from the coast of France to the westward of Ireland and the Scilly islands. Hence he draws this useful practical instruction for navigators who are entering the English channel from the Atlantic, viz. that they should keep no higher latitude than 48\u00b0 45', lest they should be carried by the current upon the rocks of Scilly. For want of this necessary precaution, it is said that many ships have been lost on these rocks.\n\nA body of fresh water, entirely surrounded by land, is called a lake, loch, or lough (as D, fig. 1.), with the exception of the sea above mentioned; as the lake of Geneva, Lake Ontario, Lake Champlain, Loch Lomond, &c.\n\nThis term, or its synonyms, loch or lough, is sometimes applied to what is properly a gulf or inlet of the sea, as Loch Fyne in Scotland, and Lough Swilly in Ireland.\n\nA considerable stream of water rising inland, and running towards the sea, is called a river; a smaller stream of the same kind is called a rivulet or brook. Vid. E, fig. 1.\n\nThe great extent of land which forms the rest of the globe, is divided into innumerable bodies, some of which are very large, but the majority extremely small. There are three very extensive tracts of country, which may all be denominated continents, though only two of them have hitherto been distinguished by that appellation. The most considerable of these continents is what has been called the old world, comprising Europe, Asia, and Africa. The second comprehends North and South America, or what has been denominated the new world, and is little inferior in extent to the former. The third great division forms the country called New Holland.\n\nA body of land entirely surrounded by water is called an island, (vid. a, fig. 1.) as Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, Madagascar, &c. According to the strict meaning of this definition, the large divisions just mentioned are islands; for it is almost certainly ascertained, that the continent of North America is everywhere bounded by the sea, and it has long ceased to be doubtful that New Holland is in the same circumstances, and it is generally called the largest island in the word. But perhaps it would be better to confine the term to those numberless smaller islands that appear above the surface of the waters. When a number of smaller islands are situated near each other, the whole assemblage is commonly called a group of islands, as b, b. The large assemblages of islands that have been discovered in the South Pacific ocean, have lately been comprehended under the name of Polynesia, constituting a sixth division of the whole earth; the other five being Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and the islands of New Holland and New Guinea, under the name of Australasia.\n\nA body of land that is almost entirely surrounded by water is called a peninsula, as c, fig. 1.; as the peninsula of Malacca, the Morea, or Grecian Peloponnesus, Peninsula, &c. Indeed the continent of Africa may be considered as a vast peninsula, being united to Asia only by the small isthmus of Suez.\n\nThe narrow neck of land which joins a peninsula to the main land, or which connects two tracts of country together, is called an isthmus, as d. The most remarkable isthmuses are the isthmus of Darien, connecting the continents of North and South America, and the isthmus of Suez, joining Africa to Asia.\n\nA narrow tract of land stretching far out into the sea, being united to the main land by an isthmus, is called a promontory, and its extremity next the sea, is called a cape; as ef, fig. 1. The most remarkable capes are the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern extremity of Africa; Cape Horn at the southern extremity of South America; the North Cape at the northern extremity of Europe; and Cape Talmara, at the northern extremity of Asia.\n\nIt may afflit the memory of the young geographer, to compare together the above divisions of land and water. We may remark that the large bodies of land, called continents, correspond to the extensive tracts of water called oceans; that islands are analogous to lakes; peninsulas to seas or gulfs; isthmuses to straits; promontories to creeks, &c.\n\nThe inhabited parts of the earth are calculated to occupy a space of 38,092,569 square miles, of which the four quarters into which the globe is usually divided are supposed to have the following proportions:\n\n| Continent   | Square Miles |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Europe      | 4,456,065    |\n| Asia        | 10,768,823   |\n| Africa      | 9,654,807    |\n| America     | 1,411,874    |\n\nThe whole population of the earth has been computed at 700,500,000 souls; and of these\n\n| Continent   | Population   |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Asia        | 500,000,000  |\n| Europe      | 150,000,000  |\n| Africa      | 30,000,000   |\n| America     | 20,000,000   |\n| and Australasia and Polynesia, &c. | 500,000 |\n\nHence the proportional number of inhabitants to every square mile in each quarter is as follows:\n\n| Region | Number per Square Mile |\n|--------|------------------------|\n| Asia   | 46                     |\n| Europe | 34                     |\n| Africa | 3                      |\n| America| 3 to every two square miles |\n\nCHAP. II. Of the Construction and Use of the Globes.\n\nSect. I. Description and Use of the Terrestrial Globes.\n\nFor the purpose of representing more accurately the Nature of the globe which we inhabit, geographers have long had recourse to spherical balls, on the face of which are drawn the various divisions of the earth, and which are fitted up with such an apparatus, as enables us to illustrate and explain the phenomena produced by the motions...\nPrinciples and Practice.\n\nCircles on the globes.\n\nAxis and poles.\n\nEquator or equinoctial.\n\nMeridians.\n\n(b) The meridians are properly only semicircles, reaching from pole to pole, and of these there are twenty-four.\n\n(c) In Geography, as in other sciences, there are two methods of conveying instruction. One is, to lay down the principles of the science first, and afterwards apply these to the practice of it; the other method is, to combine the principles and practice in one view. The former is usually considered as the more scientific, but we are inclined to think that the latter is often to be preferred, as being less dry and tedious, especially to a general reader. We have here, therefore, chosen to explain the nature of latitude and longitude, and the problems respecting them, before completing the description of the globe. We shall proceed in the same manner, uniting as far as possible, the principles and practice in one view. Making, therefore the terrestrial globe our text book, we shall thence explain the principles of geography, rather than detail these in a separate section, and afterwards illustrate them by the globe.\nPrinciples north latitudes, because the places lie in the northern hemisphere. Let there be two other places, WV, in the southern hemisphere; the latitude of W will be measured by the degrees of the arc intercepted between W and a; and the latitude of V by the arc intercepted between V and m; and these will be called south latitudes. Further, let the circle e, e, d, v, G, be drawn parallel to the equator; this circle is called a parallel of latitude, and as it does not pass through the centre, it is evidently less than the equator, or it is a small circle. Now, all the arcs, such as R, e, a, G, &c., intercepted between the parallel and the equator, must be equal, since the circle is parallel to the equator; and hence every point in this parallel, or every place on the earth through which it is supposed to pass, has the same latitude.\n\nLatitude is the same all over the earth, being constantly measured from the equator to the poles.\n\nThe longitude of a place is measured by the degrees of an arc of the equator, intercepted between some particular meridian, and the meridian passing through the place. Thus, suppose G to represent the particular meridian, and m to represent the place whose longitude is required; the longitude of m is measured by the arc ma of the equator, intercepted between a, the point where the meridian of G meets the equator, and m the point of the equator where it is cut by the meridian of the place m. The particular meridian from which we begin to reckon the degrees of longitude is called the prime or first meridian, and it is different in different countries.\n\nThe method of estimating the distances of places by longitudes and latitudes, is of considerable antiquity, and was employed by Eratosthenes, who first introduced a regular parallel of latitude, which began at the straits of Gibraltar, passed eastward though the island of Rhodes to the mountains of India; all the intermediate places through which it passed being carefully noted. Soon after drawing this parallel through Rhodes, which was long considered with a degree of preference, Eratosthenes undertook to trace a meridian, passing through Rhodes and Alexandria, as far as Syene and Mero\u00eb. Pythias of Marcellus, according to Strabo, considering the island of Thule as the most western point of the then known world, began to count the longitude from thence, while Marius of Tyre placed their first meridian at the Fortunate islands, or the Canaries; but they did not determine which was the westernmost of these islands, and consequently which ought to serve as a first meridian. Among the Arabians, Alfragran, Albategnus, Nafir Eddin, and Ulug Beg, also reckoned from the Fortunate islands; but Abudefduf began to reckon his longitude from a meridian 10\u00b0 to the eastward of that of Ptolemy, probably because it passed through the western extremity of Africa, where, according to him, were situated the pillars of Hercules; or because it passed through Cadiz, which was at that time rendered famous by the conquests of the Moors in Spain.\n\nWhen the Azores were discovered by the Portuguese in 1448, some geographers made use of the island of Terceira as their first meridian. Other geographers, as Blaeu, father and son, placed the first meridian at the Peak of Tenerife, a mountain so far elevated above the sea, that it may be easily known by navigators; while others have made the island of St Philip, one of the Cape de Verds, the first meridian, because they conceived this to be the place where the magnetic needle had no variation. For a long time it was customary to reckon the longitude in most countries from the island of Ferro, one of the Canary islands; but it is now customary for each nation to reckon the longitude, either from the metropolis of the country, or from the national observatory situated near it. Thus in France, Paris is the first meridian, and in Great Britain, the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. As in several good maps, the island of Ferro is still used as a first meridian, it may be proper to remark, that the observatory at Greenwich lies 17\u00b0 45' to the east of Ferro. Hence it is very easy to reduce the longitude of Ferro to that of Greenwich; for if the longitude required be east, we have only to subtract 17\u00b0 45' from the longitude of Ferro, and the remainder is the longitude east from London; on the other hand, if the place be west from Ferro, we obtain the longitude west from London by adding to that of Ferro 17\u00b0 45'. If the place lies between Ferro and London, its longitude from London will be obtained by subtracting its longitude east from Ferro from 17\u00b0 45'. It is evident that by the reverse of this method, we may reduce the longitude from London to that of Ferro.\n\nIn the diagram referred to above, if G represent the observatory of Greenwich, a will be the point from which we begin to reckon the degrees of longitude, and all places situated to the east of a, such as R, m, will have east longitude, while those situated to the west, as n, will have west longitude. In reckoning the longitude, we sometimes number the degrees only as far as 180\u00b0, but at other times they are numbered all round the equator from the point a; for instance, 180\u00b0 till we come to a again; hence reckoning in the direction a, R, m, we should say that every place was in so many degrees east longitude, while if we reckoned in the direction n, E, we should say that all the places had so many degrees west longitude all round the equator. To accommodate the globes to both these modes of reckoning the longitude, the equator is usually divided both ways, in a continued series from 0 at the first meridian to 360\u00b0.\n\nIt is evident, that as the parallels of latitude become smaller as they approach the poles, the arcs of their parallels intercepted between the same two meridians will be also smaller as we proceed from the equator to the poles, though in fact they consist of the same absolute number of degrees. Hence it will be easy to see that a degree of longitude must be smaller towards the poles than at the equator, and must become gradually smaller and smaller till we arrive at the poles, where it will be equal to nothing. Thus the arc G v contains the same number of degrees as the arc a, m, though the former arc is much smaller than the latter. As a degree of longitude is therefore different at every degree of latitude, it becomes necessary to ascertain the relative proportion between the two; and for this purpose the following table has been constructed, which shews the absolute measure of a degree of longitude in geographical miles and parts of a mile for every degree of latitude, taking the degree of longitude at the equator, equal to 60 geographical miles.\n### Table I.

In the second of the above tables, a degree of longitude at the equator is estimated at 69.2 English miles, or about 69\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The length of a degree in miles is usually estimated at 69\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), but this is too much. Hence, to reduce degrees of latitude, and those of longitude near the equator, to English miles, it is necessary to multiply them by 69.2, or, if great accuracy is not required, by 70.\n\n**Problem I. To find the latitude and longitude of a given place.**\n\nBring the place below the graduated edge of the **brazen meridian**, and the degree of the meridian that lies immediately over the place is its **latitude**. Observe where the meridian cuts the equator, and that degree will be the **longitude** of the place.\n\n**Example.** To find the latitude and longitude of Edinburgh.\u2014Bringing Edinburgh below the meridian, we find over it nearly the 56th degree of north latitude (55\u00b0 58'), and the point where the meridian cuts the equator is nearly 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (3\u00b0 12' W. Long.) degrees west from London.\n\n**N. B.** The longitude and latitude of places cannot be ascertained exactly by the globes, as they are not calculated to show the fractional parts of a degree; but they may be found with sufficient correctness for ordinary purposes.\n\n**Corollary I.** The difference of latitude and longitude\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples of latitude between two places is found by subtracting the less from the greater, if they lie the same way, i.e. north or south, east or west; or by adding the two together, if they lie in a different direction.\n\nCor. 2. Those places that have the same latitude with any given place are found, by bringing the given place to the meridian, and observing what places pass under the same degree, while the globe is turned round.\n\nCor. 3. Those places which have the same longitude with a given place, are found by bringing the place to the meridian, and observing what other places lie under the graduated edge, while the globe is at rest.\n\nProblem II. The latitude and longitude of a place being given, to find the place itself on the globe.\n\nTurn the globe till the given longitude comes under the brazen meridian; then mark the given latitude on the meridian, and immediately below it is the place required.\n\nExample. What place is situated in 48\u00b0 23' N. Lat. and 4\u00b0 29' E. Long. from Greenwich? Ans. Brest in France.\n\nAs the sun, in his apparent motion round the earth, measures a great circle in about 24 hours, or in one hour passes over \\( \\frac{1}{24} \\)th of such circle, or 15\u00b0; it is evident that all places which lie 15\u00b0 west of any meridian, must have noon or any other time of the day, an hour later than those situated under that meridian; and that all places which lie 15\u00b0 east of any meridian, must have the same times of the day an hour sooner. Hence, because the meridians drawn on the globe make a difference of an hour each in the time of places, they are sometimes called hour-circles; and the longitude of places is sometimes reckoned in time as well as in degrees.\n\nDegrees of longitude are reduced to hours and minutes, and v. v., by allowing an hour for every 15\u00b0, and four minutes for every degree.\n\nThough the meridians on the globe are sometimes called horary circles, this name is generally confined to a small brass circle, which is adapted to one or each pole, and graduated into twice twelve hours; so that an index fixed to the axis, or the meridian, points out the several hours of day and night as the globe revolves.\n\nIn globes of the old construction the hour circles are fixed on the outside of the meridian, but this prevents the meridian from being moved quite round, which is required in some problems.\n\nMr Joseph Harris, formerly assay-master of the mint, contrived an ingenious method of remedying this inconvenience. He placed two horary circles between the meridian and the globe, one at each pole, and they were fixed tightly between two brass rollers, placed about the axis, so that when the globe was turned, they were carried round with it, while the edge of the brass meridian served as an index to cut the horary divisions.\n\nA globe, thus furnished, serves universally and readily for performing problems in both northern and southern latitudes; and also in places near the equator; whereas, in globes of the old construction, the axis and horary circle prevent the brass meridian from being moved quite round in the horizon.\n\nThe construction of the hour circles was rendered principles somewhat more simple by Mr G. Wright of London. In his globes, there are engraved two hour circles, one at each pole, on the map of the globe, each circle being divided into a double set of 12 hours, as in the usual hour circles; but here the hours are numbered both to the right and left. (See fig. 4.) The hour hand, or index, is placed below the brass meridian, in such a way that it may be moved at pleasure to any required part of the circle, and remain there sufficiently steady during the revolution of the globe on its axis, being entirely independent of the pole. In this manner the motion of the globe round its axis, carrying the hour circle, the time is pointed out by the stationary index.\n\nIn the globes constructed by the late Mr George Adams, the equator is made to answer the purpose of an hour circle, by means of a semicircular wire placed in its plane, (see Q F, fig. 5,) and carrying two indices F, one on the eastern, the other on the western, side of the brass meridian. The method of using these indices will be shown presently. In these globes the equator is also marked with twice 12 hours, which increase from east to west, the hours to the west of the first 12 being afternoon hours.\n\nProblem III. The hours at any place being given, to find what hour it is at any other place.\n\na, By the ordinary globes.\n\nBring the place at which the hour is given to the meridian, and set the index of the hour circle to the given hour. Then turn the globe till the other place comes under the meridian, and the index will now point to the hour required.\n\nN. B. Where there is no index, the edge of the meridian will in both cases point out the hour.\n\nb, By Adams's globes.\n\nThe steps are here the reverse of the former. Bring the place at which the time is required to the brass meridian, and set the index to the given hour. Then turn the globe till the other place comes below the meridian, and the index will show the time required.\n\nN. B. In the ordinary globes, where the hour circle is usually marked with two sets of figures, it is proper, in performing this problem, to make use of that set which increases towards the right hand, observing that whichever XII. is fixed on for noon, the hours to the right or east of this are hours P. M. and those to the left or west are hours A. M. On Adams's globes the contrary of this takes place, from the hours being marked on the equator. They increase from east to west, and, of course, those to the east of XII. are morning hours, and those to the west of it afternoon hours.\n\nExample 1. When it is noon at London, what hour is it in the Society files? Ans: Two A. M.\n\nEx. 2. When it is 3 P. M. at Edinburgh, what hour is it at Delhi in Hindoostan? Ans: Thirty minutes past eight P. M.\n**Problem IV. Having the hour at any place given, to find all those places where it is noon.**\n\n*a.* By the ordinary globes.\n\nBring the given place to the meridian, and set the index to the given hour. Then turn the globe till the index point to 12 at noon, and the places then under the meridian are those required.\n\n*b.* By Adams's globes.\n\nBring the given place to the meridian, and set the index to 12 at noon. Then turn the globe till the index shall point to the given hour; and all the places then under the meridian have noon at that time.\n\nEx. 1. It is now 30 min. past 10 A.M. at Edinburgh; In what places is it noon? Ans. Near Stockholm; at Dantzig, Breslaw, Prenburg, Vienna, Polega, Ragula, Tarento, and the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nEx. It is now midnight at London; Where is it noon? Ans. In the north-east parts of Asia, in the middle of Fox isles; at the Friendly isles (nearly), and at the east cape of New Zealand.\n\nFrom the different situation of places with respect to latitude and longitude, the inhabitants of these places received from the ancients denominations that are still retained.\n\nThus, those places which have the same longitude, or are situated under the same meridian, but are in opposite latitudes, the one lying as many degrees to the north of the equator as the other lies to the south of it, are said to be antaei to each other. From this definition it is evident, that those places situated under the equator have no antaei.\n\nThe appearances arising from the changes of the heavenly bodies are different in the opposite places. Thus, 1. The days of the one are equal to the nights of the other, and vice versa; but they have noon, midnight, and all the other hours at the same time. 2. They have contrary seasons at the same time: when it is summer at one place it is winter at the other, and so of spring and autumn. 3. The stars that never set at one place, never rise at the other, and vice versa.\n\nAgain, those places that have the same latitude, or are under the same parallel, but are in opposite longitudes, i.e., lie under opposite arcs of the same meridional circle, or 180\u00b0 from each other, are said to be perioci to each other. Those places which may be situated at the poles, have evidently no perioci.\n\nThe celestial appearances to the perioci are as follow:\n\n1. The length of the day or night is the same to both places; but the hours, though distinguished by the same numbers, are contrary; noon at the one being midnight at the other; and any hour in the forenoon at the one being the same of the afternoon to the other.\n\n2. Both places have the same seasons of the year at the same time.\n\n3. The same stars that never rise or set to one place, also never rise or set to the other.\n\n4. The heavenly bodies rise in the same point of the horizon at both places, and continue for the same interval above or below it.\n\nLastly, those places which are situated directly opposite to each other, by a distance equal to the diameter of the earth, are said to be antipodes to each other. If we conceive a line through the centre of the earth, and terminated in two points of its surface, these extreme points are antipodes to each other. Thus, the city of Lima in Peru is nearly the antipodes to Siam in the East Indies; and Pekin in China has for its antipodes Buenos Ayres in South America. These places are always in opposite longitudes, and (except under the equator) in opposite latitudes.\n\nThe celestial appearances to the antipodes are these. 1. The hours are contrary, as to the perioci. 2. The days of the one are of the same length with the nights of the other; hence the longest day to one is the shortest to the other, and vice versa. 3. They have contrary seasons at the same time. 4. Those stars which, at one place are always above the horizon, are, to the other, always below it. 5. When the heavenly bodies are rising at one place, they are setting at its antipodes, and vice versa. For various opinions respecting the antipodes, see the article Antipodes.\n\nThe antipodes of any place are the perioci to the antaei of that place; and the antaei to their perioci. This will account for the method presently described of finding the antipodes on the globe.\n\n**Problem V. To find the antaei to any given place.**\n\nBring the given place to the meridian, and thus ascertain its latitude. Then count from the equator towards the opposite pole as many degrees as are equal to the latitude of the place; and the point where this reckoning ends is the place required.\n\nEx. 1. Where are the antaei to the Cape of Good Hope? Ans. At Malta nearly.\n\nEx. 2. What people are the antaei to the inhabitants of Quebec in North America? Ans. The inhabitants of Patagonia in South America.\n\n**Problem VI. To find the perioci of any given place.**\n\nBring the given place to the brazen meridian, and set the horary index to the upper XII. Then turn the globe till the index point to the lower XII. The place which is then below the meridian in the same latitude with that of the given place, is the situation required.\n\nEx. 1. Where are situated the perioci of Newcastle upon Tyne? Ans. In the Alcouski or Fox islands.\n\nEx. 2. Required the perioci to California in North America. Ans. Near the mouth of the river Indus.\n\n**Problem VII. To find the antipodes to any given place.**\n\nFind the antaei of the given place (by Problem V.), and then find the perioci of the latter (by Problem VI.). This last is the place required.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to find the antipodes of London. Ans. The latitude of London is 51\u00b0 31' N. the antaei to this, or 51\u00b0 31' S. on the prime meridian, is in the fourth Atlantic ocean; the perioci to this is in 180\u00b0 W. Long. and 51\u00b0 31' S. Lat. a little to the south of the islands of New Zealand. The inhabitants of the southern island of New Zealand are therefore the nearest antipodes to London.\n\nSeveral other circles besides those which we have mentioned are described on the artificial globe, and are supposed to be drawn on the earth. There we shall now proceed to describe, and explain their geographical uses.\nThe Ecliptic (Astronomy, No. 43.) is a great circle drawn on the globe, crossing the equator obliquely in two points, called the equinoctial points. (Astronomy, No. 44.) This circle extends on each side of the equator to the latitude of $23^\\circ 28'$, and is divided into 12 great parts corresponding to the 12 signs of the zodiac (see Astronomy, No. 52.), and marked with their characters, and each sign is subdivided into 30 degrees.\n\nThe ecliptic has also its poles, which are two points that are distant $90^\\circ$ every way from the circle on each side. As the ecliptic declines from the equator $23^\\circ 28'$, its poles are consequently distant from those of the equator, or of the globe, by the same measure. This circle properly belongs to the celestial globe, but as it is extremely useful in performing many geographical problems, it is always drawn on both globes, and requires to be noticed here, since it determines the position of several of the circles which we are about to mention.\n\nThrough these two points of the ecliptic, where it is at the greatest distance from the equator, there are drawn on the globes two circles parallel to the equator, called tropics. That in the northern hemisphere is called the Tropic of Cancer, as it passes through the sign Cancer; and, for a similar reason, that which is in the southern hemisphere is called the Tropic of Capricorn. The two points through which they are drawn are called solstitial points. The imaginary line which corresponds to the tropic of Cancer on the earth passes from near Mount Atlas on the western coast of Africa, past Syene in Ethiopia; thence, over the Red Sea, it passes to Mount Sinai, by Mecca the city of Mahomet, across Arabia Felix to the extremity of Persia, the East Indies, China, over the Pacific ocean to Mexico, and the island of Cuba. The tropic of Capricorn takes a much less interesting course, passing through the country of the Hottentots, across Brazil, to Paraguay and Peru.\n\nIf the poles of the ecliptic be supposed to revolve about the poles of the earth, they will describe two circles parallel to the equator, and $23^\\circ 28'$ distant from it. Two such circles are drawn on the globes, and are called Polar Circles, that in the north being called the Arctic Polar Circle, or merely the Arctic Circle, while that in the south is called the Antarctic Polar Circle, or Antarctic Circle.\n\nBoth the tropics and the polar circles are marked on the globes by dotted lines, to distinguish them from the other parallels.\n\nThe meridional circles that pass through the equinoctial and solstitial points are called Colures; the former being called the Equinoctial and the latter the Solstitial Colure.\n\nFor an account of the variety of day and night in different parts of the globe, see Astronomy, Part II., ch. i. sect. 2.\n\nBy means of the tropics and polar circles, the earth is supposed to be divided into five spaces, to which the ancients gave the name of Zones, or Belts. Thus the space included between the two tropics was called the Torrid Zone, because it was supposed to be so much heated or roasted by the vertical sun, which there prevails, as to be uninhabitable. The ancient terms are still occasionally used, but the countries between the tropics are now more commonly called the Intratropical Regions. The two spaces included between each tropic and its corresponding polar circle were called Temperate Zones, and were distinguished according to their position into Northern and Southern Temperate Zones. Lastly, the spaces between the polar circles and the poles were called the northern and southern Frigid Zones, and were supposed uninhabitable from excessive cold. These last are usually denominated the Polar Regions.\n\nThe countries lying between the tropics are the greater part of Africa, the southern parts of Arabia, the eastern and western peninsulas of India; all those clusters of islands lying between the southern continent of Asia and New Holland, called the Sunda, Molucca, Philippine, Pelew, Ladrones, and Carolina islands; the northern half of New Holland, New Guinea, New Britain; most of the groups of islands in the Pacific ocean, as the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Friendly and Society isles, the Sandwich and Navigators isles; the West India islands; the greater part of South America; the Cape de Verd islands, and those of St Helena, Ascension, St Matthew, and St Thomas. See the map of the world in Plate CCXXXVI, or the plain chart in Plate CCXXXVII.\n\nAll places situated between the tropics have the sun vertical twice in the year, at noon; but the time of the year when this happens is different in the different latitudes; at the equator, the sun is vertical when he is in the equinoctial points, or when he has no declination. The inhabitants of the other intratropical regions have the sun vertical when his declination is equal to their latitude, and on the same side of the equator. Thus, the inhabitants of New Caledonia, about $20^\\circ$ S. Lat. have the sun vertical when his declination is $20^\\circ$ S. To illustrate this, it will be sufficient to observe that, as the ecliptic is that circle in the heavens in which the sun is supposed to move, the sun's rays are perpendicular successively to every point of the earth which lies below that point of the ecliptic in which the sun happens to be, and he will therefore be vertical to all the places through which the ecliptic (continued to the earth) passes successively.\n\nThe inhabitants of the torrid zone have their shadows Amphitrites, at noon day sometimes to the south, i.e., when the sun's declination is north, and sometimes to the north, i.e., when the sun's declination is south. They were therefore called by the ancients Amphitrites, from \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af, about, and \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac, shadow. See AMPHITRITES and ASCIUS.\n\nIn the north temperate zone are situated the whole of Europe except Lapland; Barbary, and part of Egypt, in the temple of Africa; nearly the whole continent of Asia; a great part of North America; the Azores, and the Canary and Madeira islands.\n\nIn the south temperate zone lie the southern part of Africa, the southern half of New Holland, New Zealand, and the southern part of South America.\n\nIn the temperate zones the sun is never vertical, and the length of the days and nights differs much more than in the torrid zone.\n\nThe inhabitants of these regions have their shadows Heterofices, at noon always in the same direction; those in the north temperate zone having them directed to the north.\nPrinciples north, and those in the southern zone, towards the south. They were hence called by the ancients Heteroclit. See Heteroclit.\n\nThe countries that are situated in the northern frigid zone, are Lapland, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, the northern parts of Asia and America, and part of Greenland.\n\nNo land has yet been discovered within the fourth polar circle, though it was long supposed that a large continent was situated there, which was called Terra Australis Incognita. Our celebrated navigator Cook made many attempts to penetrate the icy fields which abound in these seas, in search of this imaginary continent, but without success, he having penetrated no farther than 72\u00b0. See Cook's Discoveries, No. 49. and 71.\n\nWithin the polar circles the sun does not always rise or set every 24 hours as in the other zones; but for a certain number of days in summer he never sets, and for a certain number of days in winter he never rises; the number of days during which the sun is present or absent increasing from the polar circles to the poles, so that at the poles he never sets for six months, nor rises during a like period.\n\nWhen the sun continues above the horizon more than 24 hours, the inhabitants of the polar regions have their shadows cast all around them; and hence they have been called Periclit. See Periclit.\n\nThe ancients did not employ regular parallels of latitude, but they divided the spaces between the equator and the poles into small zones corresponding to the length of the longest day in each division. To these subdivisions they gave the name of climates, the situation and extent of which they determined in the following manner. As the day at the equator is exactly 12 hours throughout the year, but the longest day increases as we approach the poles, the ancients made the first climate to end at that latitude where the longest day was 12\u00bd hours, which by observation they found to be in the latitude of 8\u00b0 25\u2032. The second climate extended to latitude 16\u00b0 25\u2032, where the longest day is 13 hours, and thus a new climate extended, so as to divide the whole tract between the equator and the poles into 24 climates, in each of which the longest day was longer by half an hour than in that nearer the equator. The space between the polar circles and the poles they divided into six climates, in each of which the length of the longest day increased by a month, till at the poles it was six months long. Hence, the 24 climates between the equator and the polar circles are called Hour Climates; and the six between the polar circles and the poles are called Month Climates. For further particulars respecting this ancient division of the globe, and a table of the climates by Ricciolus, see Climate. As the table given under that article is calculated only for the middle of each climate, and neither mentions the breadth of each, nor is extended to all the climates, we shall here subjoin one in which are given the latitude at which each climate terminates, its breadth in degrees, and the length of the longest day at the parallel terminating each.\n\n### Hour Climates\n\n| Climates | Latitude | Breadth | Longest Days |\n|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| I        | 8\u00b0 25\u2032   | 8\u00b0 25\u2032  | 12h 30m      |\n| II       | 16\u00b0 25\u2032  | 8       | 13           |\n| III      | 23\u00b0 30\u2032  | 7       | 13 30        |\n| IV       | 30\u00b0 25\u2032  | 6       | 14           |\n| V        | 36\u00b0 28\u2032  | 6       | 14 30        |\n| VI       | 41\u00b0 22\u2032  | 4       | 15           |\n| VII      | 45\u00b0 29\u2032  | 4       | 15 30        |\n| VIII     | 49\u00b0 1    | 3       | 16           |\n| IX       | 52\u00b0      | 2       | 16 30        |\n| X        | 54\u00b0 27\u2032  | 2       | 17           |\n| XI       | 56\u00b0 37\u2032  | 2       | 17 30        |\n| XII      | 58\u00b0 29\u2032  | 1       | 18           |\n| XIII     | 59\u00b0 38\u2032  | 1       | 18 30        |\n| XIV      | 61\u00b0 18\u2032  | 1       | 19           |\n| XV       | 62\u00b0 25\u2032  | 1       | 19 30        |\n| XVI      | 63\u00b0 22\u2032  | 0       | 20           |\n| XVII     | 64\u00b0      | 0       | 20 30        |\n| XVIII    | 64\u00b0 49\u2032  | 0       | 21           |\n| XIX      | 65\u00b0 21\u2032  | 0       | 21 30        |\n| XX       | 65\u00b0 45\u2032  | 0       | 22           |\n| XXI      | 66\u00b0      | 0       | 22 30        |\n| XXII     | 66\u00b0 20\u2032  | 0       | 23           |\n| XXIII    | 66\u00b0 28\u2032  | 0       | 23 30        |\n| XXIV     | 66\u00b0 31\u2032  | 0       | 24           |\n\n### Month Climates\n\n| Climates | Latitude | Breadth | Longest Day |\n|----------|----------|---------|-------------|\n| I        | 69\u00b0 21\u2032  | 50\u2032     | 1 month     |\n| II       | 69\u00b0 48\u2032  | 2\u00b0 27\u2032  | 2           |\n| III      | 73\u00b0 37\u2032  | 3       | 4           |\n| IV       | 78\u00b0 30\u2032  | 5       | 4           |\n| V        | 84\u00b0 5     | 5       | 5           |\n| VI       | 90\u00b0      | 5       | 6           |\n\nAs the division of the globe into climates, though places in now almost diffused, is of service in shewing the length of the longest day in different countries, we shall here enumerate the principal places in each northern climate, these being best known and most interesting.\n\nI.

Unknown.\n\nThe only parts of the terrestrial globe that we have yet to describe and illustrate are the Quadrant of Altitude, and the Wooden Horizon; and there it is necessary to explain, before we proceed to consider the remaining problems performed with this globe.\n\nThe Quadrant of Altitude is a thin flexible slip of brass, graduated into 90\u00b0, and made to fix on any part of the brazen meridian by means of a nut and screw. Round this nut it moves on a pivot, and by its flexibility may be applied close to the surface of the globe. The quadrant of altitude is used to measure the distances of places from each other on the terrestrial globe, and to ascertain the altitudes of the sun, stars, &c., on the celestial globe.\n\nTo measure the distance between two places on the globe, nothing more is required than to stretch the graduated edge of the quadrant between them, and mark the number of degrees intercepted. These reduced to geographical, or to English miles (by No. 63,) give the absolute distance between the places. It is most convenient to bring one of the places to the zenith, which may be done by rectifying the globe for the latitude of that place as immediately to be explained, and then to stretch the quadrant to the other place, the distance marked, subtracted from 90\u00b0, gives the true distance in degrees. If the distance required be greater than 90\u00b0, it is proper to rectify the globe for the antipodes of the given places, and add the distance observed to 90\u00b0: the sum is the distance required.\n\nIt has been very generally stated that the bearing of one of the places from the other may be found by observing, on the wooden horizon, in what point of the compass the quadrant of altitude thus fixed in the zenith, cuts the horizon. This is considered by Mr Patteson as a mistake: \"For (says he) supposing one of the places to lie due east of the other, they are in the same parallel of latitude, and consequently it is impossible that the prime vertical of either of them (that is, a circle cutting the east and west points of the horizon, should pass through the other, unless they both lay under the equator. A line shewing the bearings of places is called a rhumb line. The lines of north and south on the globe, being meridians, and those of east and west, being parallels of latitude, are consequently circles; but all the remaining rhumbs are a kind of spiral lines.\"\n\nThe globes are supported by a wooden frame ending above in a broad flat margin, on which is pasted a paper marked with several graduated circles. This broad margin is called the wooden horizon, and represents the rational horizon of the earth, or the limit between the visible and the invisible hemispheres. On the paper with which the wooden horizon is covered, are drawn four concentric circles. The innermost of these is divided into 360 degrees, divided into four quadrants. The second circle is marked with the points of the compass, i.e., the four cardinal points, east, west, north, and south, (11) each being subdivided into eight parts or rhumbs, (see Compass.) The circle next to that just mentioned contains the twelve signs of the zodiac, distinguished by their proper names and characters; and\n\n(D) The cardinal points of the compass are thus determined. The two points in which the meridian of any place when produced so as to pass through the nearest pole, cuts the horizon, (using this in an astronomical sense, see Astronomy,) are the north and south points; the former being that point where the meridian first cuts the horizon in the northern hemisphere, and the latter, that where it first meets the horizon in the southern hemisphere. Again, the two points where a great circle, passing through the zenith at right angles with the meridian, (and\nPrinciples and each sign is divided into 30 degrees. The last circle shows the months and days corresponding to each sign.\n\nThis wooden ring can represent the rational horizon of any place marked on the terrestrial globe only, when that place is situated in the zenith; and the method of bringing the place into this situation is called rectifying the globe.\n\n**Problem VIII. To rectify the globe according to the latitude of any place.**\n\nFind the latitude of the place, (by Problem I.) and see whether it be north or south. Then elevate the pole of the globe which is in the same hemisphere with the latitude, as far above the wooden horizon as is equal to the latitude; bring the given place to the brazen meridian, and it will be in the zenith.\n\n**Example.** To rectify the globe for the latitude of Edinburgh. The latitude of Edinburgh is $55^\\circ 58'$ N., therefore raise the north pole $55^\\circ 58'$ above the horizon, and bring Edinburgh below the brass meridian.\n\nIt is for the purpose of more easily rectifying the globe, that one half of the brazen meridian is graduated from the poles to the equator; as, where this is not done, it is necessary to take the complement of the latitude, or the difference between it and $90^\\circ$, which in some cases requires a calculation.\n\nThe place being brought below the meridian, when the pole is elevated to the proper degree, it is evidently in the zenith, or $90^\\circ$ distant every way from the horizon. Thus, in the above example, if we count the degrees from that part of the meridian below which Edinburgh is situated, we shall find that they amount to $90^\\circ$ each way; for counting from Edinburgh along the meridian to the north pole, we have $34^\\circ 2'$; which added to $55^\\circ 58'$ the elevation of the poles gives $90^\\circ$ on that side. Again, counting from the same point of the meridian towards the southern part of the horizon, we have $55^\\circ 58'$, as far as the equator, and $34^\\circ 2'$ from thence to the horizon, making, as before, $90^\\circ$, and as the graduated edge of the meridian is $90^\\circ$ both from the eastern and western side of the horizon, Edinburgh, in this situation of the globe, is in the zenith.\n\nWhen either of the poles of the globe is thus elevated above the horizon, so as not to be in the zenith, the globe is said to be in the position of an oblique sphere, in which the equator and all its parallels are unequally divided by the horizon. This is the most common situation of the earth, or it is the situation which it has with respect to all its inhabitants, except those at the equator and the poles. To the inhabitants of an oblique sphere the pole of their hemisphere is elevated above the horizon as many degrees as are equal to their latitude, and the opposite pole is depressed as much below the horizon, so that the stars only at the former are seen; the sun and all the heavenly bodies rise and set obliquely, the seasons are variable, and the days and nights unequal. This position of the sphere is represented at fig. 6, where the equator EQ, and the parallels cut the horizon HO obliquely, and the axis PS is inclined to it. Hence this position is called oblique.\n\nIf the globe is placed in such a position that any point of the equator is in the zenith, it is said to be in the position of a right or direct sphere, because the equator and its parallels are vertical, or over the horizon at right angles. This position is seen at fig. 7, where the axis PS is in the plane of the horizon, and the equator EQ is in a plane perpendicular to it. The inhabitants of such a sphere, which are the inhabitants of the earth below the line, have no elevation of the poles, and consequently no latitude; they can see the stars at both poles; all the stars rise, culminate, and set to them; and the sun always moves in a curve at right angles to their horizon, and is an equal number of hours above and below it, making the days and nights always equal.\n\nIf the globe be so placed that one of the poles is in the zenith, and consequently the other in the nadir, it sphere, is in the position of a parallel sphere; so called because the equator EQ (fig. 8) coincides with the horizon, and the parallels are of course parallel to it; while all the meridians cut the horizon at right angles. The inhabitants of a sphere, in this position, have the greatest possible latitude; the stars, which are situated in the hemisphere to which the inhabitants belong, never set, but describe circles all around; while those of the contrary hemisphere never rise: the sun is above the horizon for six months, during which it is day, and is, below the horizon for an equal interval, when it is night.\n\nThe wooden horizon is a necessary part of the apparatus of both globes; but it has been shewn, that in the terrestrial globe, it can represent the rational horizon of a place, only when the globe is rectified for the latitude of that place. In the celestial globe, it represents the rational horizon in all positions.\n\nIn Adams's globes there is a thin brass semicircle NHS (fig. 5,) that is moveable about the poles, and has a small thin circle N sliding on it. This semicircle is graduated into two quadrants, the degrees of which are marked both ways from the equator to the poles in the terrestrial globe: this semicircle represents a moveable meridian; and the small sliding circle, which is marked with a few of the points of the compass, is called a visible horizon, the use of which will appear presently.\n\nBefore we proceed to the remaining problems on the terrestrial globe, it will be proper to take notice of some geographical principles that are connected with the horizon.\n\nIt is evident, that the extent of the sensible horizon of an observer depends on the height of his eye above the level surface of the earth. An eye placed on the surface of the earth sees scarcely anything around it; but if it is elevated above that surface, it sees farther in proportion to its elevation, provided always that its view is not obstructed by intervening objects. Thus, in an extensive plain, the eye can see farther, if elevated to\n\ncalled the prime vertical) cuts the horizon, are the east and west points; the former being on the left hand of a person facing the sun at noonday, while the latter is on his right hand.\nPrinciples to a proper height, than it can from the same height in a town or among hills; and, at sea, where the surface is perfectly equal, the view is in proportion to the height of the eye. It becomes an interesting problem to ascertain the extent of the visible horizon, or the distance to which a person can see at any given height of the eye; as, when this is known, we can calculate pretty accurately the distance of an object seen from such a height, as land seen from the topmast of a ship at sea.\n\nFor solving this problem, it must be remarked, that the distance of an observer from the boundary of the horizon, or from a distant object, is different when measured along the surface of the earth, and when measured in a direct line. To illustrate this, let HDN (fig. 9.) represent a section of the earth, of which C is the centre, and let D be the situation of an observer, whose eye is elevated to B. The lines BA, BE, tangents to the curve at H and E, represent the limit of the visible horizon, or the radii of the circle circumferring vision. If the eye were elevated still higher, as to G, it is evident, that the extent of the visible horizon will be increased, being now represented by the tangent GF. The length of the tangent BA, or GF, is easily found by plane trigonometry (E).\n\nIt was remarked above, that the visible horizon is most distinct at sea, from the absence of those objects which obstruct vision on land. Hence the sensible horizon is sometimes called the horizon of the sea, and this may be observed by looking through the sights of a quadrant at the most distant part of the sea. In making this observation, the visual rays BA, or GF, by reason of the spherical surface of the sea, always extend a little below the true sensible horizon SS, and consequently below the rational horizon HN, which is parallel to it. Hence the quadrant shows the depression of the horizon of the sea lower than it really is; and it is obvious from the figure, that the higher the eye is situated, the greater must be this depression. Thus, the depression, when the eye is at G, marked by GF, is evidently much greater than that marked by BE, when the eye is at B. The depression of the horizon of the sea is not always the same, though there be no variation in the height of the eye; but the difference in this case is very small, amounting only to a few seconds, and is owing to a difference of the degree of refraction in the atmosphere. Were there no refraction, the visual ray would be BE (when the eye is at B), and E would be the most distant point; but, by reason of the refraction, a point on the surface of the earth beyond E, as F, may be seen by an eye situated no higher than B; and if the refraction were still greater, a still more distant point might be observed.\n\nIt will be necessary here to anticipate a few remarks respecting the difference between the apparent and true levels; a subject that will be more fully discussed under Levelling. Two or more places are on a true level, when they are equally distant from the centre of the earth, and one place is higher than another, or above the true level, when it is farther from the centre of the earth. A line that is equally distant in all its points from the centre, is called the line of true level, and it is evident that this line must be curved; and either make part of the earth's surface, or be concentrical with it. Thus the line DAO, which has all its points, D, A, O, equally distant from the centre C, is the line of true level. But the line of sight DMP, as given by the operation of a level, is a straight line, which is a tangent to the earth's surface at D, always rising higher above the true line of level, according as it extends to a greater distance. This straight line is called the line of apparent level. Thus MA is the height of the apparent level above the true at the distance DA, and OP is the excess of the apparent above the true level, at the distance DO.\n\nThe following table was constructed by Cassini, for the purpose of shewing the excess of the apparent above the true level at various distances from the point of observation. It consists of three columns, in the first of which the distance of the observed object from the place of observation is given, from one second to 60 minutes, or a degree. In the second is given the length of the arc measured on a great circle of the earth, that corresponds to the observed distance, in feet and inches; and in the third is given the height of the apparent above the true level in feet and inches, corresponding to each observed and real distance of the object.\n\n(Vol. IX. Part II.)\n\n(e) In the right-angled triangle ACB (fig. 9.), the length of CB is given, supposing the height of the eye BD to be 6 feet; for adding 6 feet to 19,943,400 feet, the length of the semidiameter of the earth, we have 19,943,406 feet for the length of BC. Then, making the hypotenuse CB radius, we shall have, as radius to the sine of the angle BCA, so is CB to BA; and this will be nearly the same as the arc DA. Again, without finding the quantity of the angle at C, BA may be found, by considering that BA\u00b2 is equal to the difference of the squares of CB and CA, i.e. \\(BA^2 = CB^2 - CA^2 = (CB + CA)(CB - CA) = CB + CA\\) into BD; and hence \\(BA = \\sqrt{(CB + CA) \\times BD}\\).\n\nTo illustrate the last in numbers, we have CB = 19,943,406 feet, and CA = 19,943,400 feet. Then, to find BA, we have \\(19,943,406 + 19,943,400 = 39,886,806 \\times 19,943,406 - 19,943,400 = 239,320,836\\); whence \\(BA = \\sqrt{239,320,836} = 15,470\\) feet nearly, or about three miles.\n\nThe distance, to which a person can see, is found to vary as the square root of the altitude of the eye. To find a general expression for this quantity,\n\nlet \\(a\\) be the altitude of the eye in feet,\n\\(d\\) the distance at that altitude in miles;\n\nthen we have \\(\\sqrt{a} : \\sqrt{a} = 3 : \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{6}} \\times \\sqrt{a} = 1.2247 \\times \\sqrt{a}\\). Hence, we deduce this general rule: Multiply the square root of the height of the eye in feet by 1.2247, and the product will be the distance to which we can see from\n| Seconds | Feet | Inch. | Inch. |\n|---------|------|------|-------|\n| 1       | 101  | 6.8  |       |\n| 2       | 203  | 1.6  |       |\n| 3       | 304  | 8.4  |       |\n| 4       | 406  | 3.2  |       |\n| 5       | 507  | 10.0 | 0.074 |\n| 6       | 609  | 4.8  |       |\n| 7       | 710  | 11.6 |       |\n| 8       | 812  | 6.4  |       |\n| 9       | 914  | 1.2  |       |\n| 10      | 1015 | 8.0  | 0.296 |\n| 11      | 1117 | 2.8  |       |\n| 12      | 1218 | 9.6  |       |\n| 13      | 1320 | 4.4  |       |\n| 14      | 1421 | 11.2 |       |\n| 15      | 1523 | 6.0  |       |\n| 16      | 1625 | 0.8  |       |\n| 17      | 1726 | 7.6  |       |\n| 18      | 1828 | 2.4  |       |\n| 19      | 1929 | 9.2  |       |\n| 20      | 2031 | 4.0  | 1.186 |\n| 21      | 2132 | 10.8 |       |\n| 22      | 2234 | 5.6  |       |\n| 23      | 2336 | 0.4  |       |\n| 24      | 2437 | 7.2  |       |\n| 25      | 2539 | 2.0  |       |\n| 26      | 2640 | 8.8  |       |\n| 27      | 2742 | 3.6  |       |\n| 28      | 2843 | 10.4 |       |\n| 29      | 2945 | 5.2  |       |\n| 30      | 3047 | 0.0  | 2.670 |\n| 31      | 3148 | 6.8  |       |\n| 32      | 3250 | 1.6  |       |\n| 33      | 3351 | 8.4  |       |\n| 34      | 3453 | 3.2  |       |\n| 35      | 3554 | 10.0 |       |\n| 36      | 3656 | 4.8  |       |\n| 37      | 3757 | 11.6 |       |\n| 38      | 3859 | 6.4  |       |\n| 39      | 3961 | 1.2  |       |\n| 40      | 4062 | 8.0  |       |\n| 41      | 4164 | 2.8  |       |\n| 42      | 4265 | 9.6  |       |\n| 43      | 4367 | 4.4  |       |\n| 44      | 4468 | 11.2 |       |\n| 45      | 4570 | 6.0  |       |\n| 46      | 4672 | 0.8  |       |\n| 47      | 4773 | 7.6  |       |\n| 48      | 4875 | 2.4  |       |\n| 49      | 4976 | 9.2  |       |\n| 50      | 5078 | 4.0  | 7.409 |\n| 51      | 5179 | 10.8 |       |\n| 52      | 5281 | 5.6  |       |\n| 53      | 5383 | 0.4  |       |\n| 54      | 5484 | 7.2  |       |\n| 55      | 5586 | 2.0  |       |\n| 56      | 5687 | 8.8  |       |\n| 57      | 5789 | 3.6  |       |\n| 58      | 5890 | 10.4 |       |\n| 59      | 5992 | 5.2  |       |\n| 60      | 6094 | 0.0  | 10.680|\n\n| Minutes | Feet | Inch. |\n|---------|------|-------|\n| 1       | 6094 | 0     |\n| 2       | 12188| 6.580 |\n| 3       | 18282| 11.853|\n| 4       | 24376| 18.12 |\n| 5       | 30470| 19.932|\n| 6       | 36564| 11.412|\n| 7       | 42658| 5.436 |\n| 8       | 48752| 9.384 |\n| 9       | 54846| 9.876 |\n| 10      | 60940| 7.728 |\n| 11      | 67034| 2.940 |\n| 12      | 73128| 7.512 |\n| 13      | 79222| 9.444 |\n| 14      | 85316| 8.736 |\n| 15      | 91410| 4.320 |\n| 16      | 97504| 9.264 |\n| 17      | 103598| 11.568|\n| 18      | 109692| 11.232|\n| 19      | 115786| 7.188 |\n| 20      | 121880| 0.504 |\n| 21      | 127974| 4.248 |\n| 22      | 134068| 5.352 |\n| 23      | 140162| 10.224|\n| 24      | 146256| 6.084 |\n| 25      | 152350| 11.232|\n| 26      | 158444| 1.776 |\n| 27      | 164538| 1.680 |\n| 28      | 170632| 10.944|\n| 29      | 176726| 5.168 |\n| 30      | 182820| 8.484 |\n| 31      | 188914| 8.828 |\n| 32      | 195008| 8.532 |\n| 33      | 201102| 3.528 |\n| 34      | 207196| 7.884 |\n| 35      | 213290| 9.600 |\n| 36      | 219384| 8.676 |\n| 37      | 225478| 5.112 |\n| 38      | 231572| 10.908|\n| 39      | 237666| 2.064 |\n| 40      | 243760| 1.764 |\n| 41      | 249854| 11.388|\n| 42      | 255948| 10.452|\n| 43      | 262042| 9.084 |\n| 44      | 268136| 0.108 |\n| 45      | 274230| 11.424|\n| 46      | 280324| 7.932 |\n| 47      | 286418| 0.000 |\n| 48      | 292512| 2.328 |\n| 49      | 298606| 2.016 |\n| 50      | 304700| 6.792 |\n| 51      | 310794| 5.472 |\n| 52      | 316888| 9.240 |\n| 53      | 322982| 10.368|\n| 54      | 329076| 8.836 |\n| 55      | 335170| 4.704 |\n| 56      | 341264| 9.912 |\n| 57      | 347358| 0.480 |\n| 58      | 353452| 0.408 |\n| 59      | 359546| 8.628 |\n| 60      | 365640| 2.208 |\n\nFrom that height in miles. Example. Let the height of the eye be 49 feet. Multiply the square root of 49 or 7 by 1,2247, and we have 8.5729 or about 8\u00bd miles for the distance to which the eye can see at the height of 49 feet.\nThe above table will answer several useful purposes.\n\nIn the first place, the height of the apparent level above the true may be found by it at any distance, from one second to one degree, or 6975 miles. Thus, at the distance of 32\u00b0\u2014about 35 miles, we have 182820 feet for the length of the arc of a great circle on the earth, and corresponding to this we have 797 feet 8 inches 484 parts for the excess of the apparent level above the true. 2. The extent of the visible horizon corresponding to any height of the eye, may be found from the table by observation. The femidiameter of the horizon does not sensibly differ from an arc of a great circle on the earth, containing as many minutes and seconds as are equal to the angle of depression observed, and the number of feet contained in such an arc may be found in the table. Thus, if the depression, as observed by observation, be 40\u00b0, its femidiameter is also about 40\u00b0, and the length of the arc corresponding to it is 243,760 feet.\n\nThe following table, also taken from Cassini, shews the different depressions of the horizon of the sea at different heights of the eye, both by observation and calculation; with the difference betwixt the two occasioned by refraction.\n\n| Feet | Inches | The height of the eye above the surface of the sea. | The depression of the horizon of the sea. |\n|------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|      |        | Feet    | Inches | by observation | by calculation |\n| 1157 | 6.9    | 32      | 30     |                |                |\n|      |        | 36      | 18     |                |                |\n|      |        | Difference by refraction | 3 48 |\n\n| 775  | 2.3    | 27      | 0      | by observation | by calculation |\n|      |        | 29      | 36     |                |                |\n|      |        | Difference by refraction | 2 36 |\n\n| 571  | 11.0   | 24      | 0      | by observation | by calculation |\n|      |        | 25      | 25     |                |                |\n|      |        | Difference by refraction | 1 25 |\n\n| 387  | 3.4    | 19      | 45     | by observation | by calculation |\n|      |        | 20      | 54     |                |                |\n|      |        | Difference by refraction | 1 9 |\n\n| 288  | 4.3    | 15      | 0      | by observation | by calculation |\n|      |        | 17      | 1      |                |                |\n|      |        | Difference by refraction | 2 1 |\n\nFrom the above, it is easy to deduce the method of computing the distance of any object seen in the horizon from a certain height. Thus, suppose a man at the mast-head, 130 feet above the water, sees land or a ship just coming in sight. We know, that, at this height, an eye can see 14 miles, consequently the object seen will be about 14 miles or about five leagues distant. If the object is within the horizon, or nearer the place of observation, its distance may be calculated pretty exactly, by descending from the mast-head till the object just comes to the horizon; measuring the height at which this takes place, and thence computing the distance.\n\nIn the above table, the depression, as estimated by calculation, is greater than that by observation in every case except the last, in which the latter is greater by two seconds than the former; but this difference was too small to be discovered by the instrument that Cassini employed.\n\nRefraction lessens the angle of depression, by raising the objects observed; but as this refraction is itself variable, the depression and extent of the horizon also vary. We are informed by Cassini, that even in the finest weather he observed the refraction to differ at the same hour of different days, and at different hours of the same day. The truth of this observation may be easily ascertained by looking through a telescope furnished with cross hairs, and fixed in such a position that some highly elevated object, as the weathercock of a steeple, may be seen through it; for, on observing the weathercock at different times of the day, it will be seen sometimes on the centre of the object-glass; sometimes above, and sometimes below it. A similar experiment may also be made with plane sights fixed on a cross-staff. It has long been observed, that the top of a distant hill may sometimes, when the refraction is very great, be distinctly seen from a situation from which, at other times, when the refraction is much less, it is not discernible, even though the sky be very clear.\n\nMany of the following problems may seem to belong to the celestial rather than the terrestrial globe; but as they may be solved equally well by means of both, and as persons not uncommonly possess a terrestrial globe without its usual companion, we shall throw as many problems as possible under this head.\n\n**Problem IX. To find the sun's place in the ecliptic for any given time.**\n\nFind the day of the month in the calendar on the wooden horizon; and opposite to it, in the adjoining circle, will be found the sign and degree in which the sun\nPrinciples sun is on the given day. Then look for the same sign and degree in the circle of the ecliptic drawn on the globe, and that is the sun's place at noon for the given time.\n\nEx. 1. What is the sun's place on the 4th of June? Ans. In $13^\\circ 57'$ of the sign Gemini.\n\nEx. 2. Required the sun's place for the first day of every calendar month?\n\n| Month    | Sun's Place |\n|----------|-------------|\n| January  | $19^\\circ 11' 23''$ |\n| February | $22^\\circ 12' 35''$ |\n| March    | $25^\\circ 11' 9''$ |\n| April    | $28^\\circ 11' 56''$ |\n| May      | $31^\\circ 11' 14''$ |\n| June     | $1^\\circ 11' 3''$ |\n| July     | $4^\\circ 9' 42''$ |\n| August   | $7^\\circ 9' 18''$ |\n| September| $10^\\circ 9' 9''$ |\n| October  | $13^\\circ 8' 27''$ |\n| November | $16^\\circ 9' 16''$ |\n| December | $19^\\circ 9' 33''$ |\n\n**Problem X. To find the sun's declination for any given time.**\n\nFind the sun's place for the given day by Prob. X. and bring it to the brazen meridian. The degree marked on the meridian immediately over the place is the declination required.\n\nEx. Required the sun's declination for 18th March? The sun's place for the given day is $25^\\circ 7'$ of $\\lambda$, and this being brought to the meridian, will be immediately below $3^\\circ 54'$ S. which is therefore the declination required.\n\nFrom the above example, it is evident that the method of finding the declination of the sun corresponds to that of finding the latitude of a place on the globe, given in Problem I. the sun's declination being measured in the same way by an arc of the meridian intercepted between the equator and the sun's place in the ecliptic ($\\theta$).\n\n**Problem XI. To rectify the globe for the sun's place and the day of the month.**\n\nFind the sun's declination for the given day, by Problem XI.; then elevate the pole that is in the same hemisphere with the degree of declination, as many degrees as are equal to the declination.\n\nEx. Rectify the globe for the sun's place on the 6th October? Ans. The sun's declination on that day is $5^\\circ$ S. therefore the south pole must be elevated $5^\\circ$ above the horizon.\n\nRectifying the globe for the sun's declination corresponds to the rectifying it for the latitude of a given place. See No. 88.\n\n**Problem XII. To find the time of the sun's rising and setting at a given place, for any given day.**\n\nRectify the globe for the declination on the given day, and bring the given place to the meridian, and set the index of the hour circle at XII. Turn the globe, till the given place come to the eastern edge of the horizon, and the time of sunrise will be shewn by the position of the index. Then turn the globe till the given place come to the western part of the horizon, and the position of the index will point out the time of sunset.\n\nTo perform the same problem by Adams's globes.\n\nRectify the globe for the declination, bring the given place to the meridian, and set the horary index at 12 as before; then turn the globe towards the west, till the given place reach the western edge of the horizon, and the index will point to the time of sunrise. The time of sunset will be known, in like manner, by bringing the place to the eastern side of the horizon.\n\nIf the hour circle in the ordinary globes has a double row of figures, the sun's rising and setting may be found at the same time; for if the place be brought to the eastern part of the horizon, the time of sunrise will be shewn by the index, in that circle where the hours increase towards the east; and the time cut by the index in the circle where the hours increase towards the west, will show the time of sunset.\n\nEx. 1. Required the time of the sun's rising and setting at London, on the 29th August? Ans. The sun rises at nine minutes after five, and sets nine minutes before seven.\n\nEx. 2. Required the time of sunrise and sunset at Edinburgh on the 1st of June? Ans. For sunrise, 27 minutes after three; for sunset, 33 minutes after eight.\n\n**Corollary.** From this problem we may easily find the length of the day and night for any given time; for, having found by the globe the time of sunrise and sunset, the double of the latter is the length of the day, and the double of the former the length of the night.\n\n**Problem XIII. To find the sun's meridian altitude on any given day, at a given place.**\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude of the given place, by Problem VIII.; find the sun's place on the given day by Problem IX. and bring it to the brazen meridian. Then fix the quadrant of altitude in the zenith, or over the given place, and bring it over the sun's place; and the degree of the quadrant lying over the sun's place will shew the meridian altitude.\n\nIf the globe has no quadrant of altitude, the sun's meridian altitude may be found by counting the number of degrees on the meridian, between the horizon and the sun's place.\n\nEx. Required the sun's meridian altitude at Edinburgh on the 21st of June? Ans. $50^\\circ 30'$, or the greatest possible, this being the summer solstice.\n\n**Corollary.** It may be known whether the sun's meridian altitude be north or south, by the following observations. When the sun's declination and the latitude of the place are of different names, i.e. the one north and the other south, the meridian altitude is of the same name with the declination. If the declination and latitude be both north or both south, the altitude is of the same name with the declination, if the latter be the greater; but, otherwise, the altitude is of an opposite name.\n\n**Problem XIV. Having the latitude of the place and the day of the month given, to find the sun's altitude for any given hour.**\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude; find the sun's place, and bring it to the meridian, and set the horary index\n\n(f) For a table of the sun's declination corresponding to his true place, see Vol. III. p. 170.\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples index to noon; turn the globe till the index point to the given hour, then fix the quadrant of altitude in the zenith, and bring its graduated edge over the sun's place, and the degree cut by the sun's place will be the altitude required.\n\nEx. What will be the sun's altitude at 10 o'clock A.M. on the 30th of November at Edinburgh? Ans: 8\u00b0 50'.\n\nProblem XV. Having the sun's meridian altitude given at any place, to find the latitude of the place.\n\nBring the sun's place for the given day to the meridian, and move the globe in the horizon till the distance between the sun's place and the northern or southern edge of the horizon, (according as the case may require,) be equal to the given altitude. The degree of elevation of the pole will shew the latitude required.\n\nEx. The sun's meridian altitude observed at a certain place on 5th August is 74\u00b0 24' N. What is the latitude of the place? Ans: 1\u00b0 36' N.\n\nProblem XVI. The latitude of the place and the day of the month being given, to find when the sun is due east or due west.\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude of the place, bring the sun's place to the meridian, and set the index to XII. Fix the quadrant of altitude in the zenith, and if the sun's declination be of the same name with the latitude, bring the graduated edge of the quadrant to the eastern side of the horizon; but if the declination is of a different name from the latitude, bring the quadrant to the western part of the horizon. Turn the globe till the sun's place in the ecliptic come below the edge of the quadrant, and the index will point to the hour when the sun is due east. Subtract this from XII. and the remainder shews the time when the sun is due west.\n\nEx. At what hours is the sun due east and west at the summer and winter solstice at Greenwich? Ans: At the summer solstice he is due east at 20 minutes past seven, and due west at 20 minutes before five. At the winter solstice he is due east at 20 minutes before five, and due west at 20 minutes past seven.\n\nCorollary. When the declination and latitude are of the same name, the sun is due east after rising; but when the declination and latitude are of different names, he is due east before rising. As it is not convenient to observe on the globe when the sun is due east before rising, or while he is under the horizon, it is better to bring the opposite point of the ecliptic due west, and then the index shews the time when he is due east.\n\nProblem XVII. Having a place in the torrid zone given, to find on what two days of the year the sun is vertical at that place.\n\nFind the latitude of the given place, and keeping that in view, turn the globe round, noting the two points at the ecliptic that pass below the degree of latitude. Find in the calendar circle of the horizon the days corresponding to those points of the ecliptic; and these are the days on which the sun is vertical at the given place.\n\nEx. 1. On what days is the sun vertical at St Helena, in latitude 15\u00b0 55' S.? Ans: On 6th February and 6th November.\n\nEx. 2. Required the days on which the sun is vertical at Tobago, in latitude 11\u00b0 29' N.? Ans: On April 19. and August 23.\n\nProblem XVIII. To find those places in the torrid zone where the sun is vertical on a given day.\n\nFind the sun's place for the given day, and bring it to the brazen meridian; then turn the globe, and note all the places which pass under that point of the meridian: these will be the places to which the sun is vertical on the given day.\n\nEx. 1. In what places is the sun vertical at the summer solstice? Ans: At Canton in China, at Calcutta in Bengal, at Mecca in Arabia, and at the Havana.\n\nEx. 2. To what places is the sun vertical on the 16th of May and 29th of July? Ans: At Bombay, Pegu, in the northern part of Manilla, in the middle of the Ladrones islands, at Owhyhee, Mexico, in Hispaniola, and at Tombuctoo in the central parts of Africa.\n\nProblem XIX. Having the day and hour at any given place, to find where the sun is then vertical.\n\nFind the sun's declination by Problem XI. and the places where it is noon at the given time, by Problem III.; then any of those places where it is noon, whose latitude is the same as the sun's declination, will have the sun vertical at the given time.\n\nEx. On the 1st of August at Edinburgh, it being 35 minutes past four, P.M. it is required to find where the sun is vertical? Ans: The sun's declination on that day is 18\u00b0 14' N. and the place where it is noon at the given time, that lies nearest in latitude to the declination, is Kingston in Jamaica: this, therefore, is the place required.\n\nProblem XX. A place in the northern frigid zone being given, to find when the sun begins to appear above the horizon, and when to disappear; as also the length of the longest day and night.\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude, and bring the ascending signs of the zodiac (see Astronomy, No 52) to the southern part of the horizon; observe what degree of the ecliptic is intercepted by that point of the horizon, and in the calendar circle find the day of the month answering to that degree. That will shew the time of the sun's first appearance above the horizon at the given place, and this is the end of the longest night in that latitude. Then bring the descending signs to the same part of the horizon, and observe the day which answers to the degree of the ecliptic intercepted; this will shew the time of the sun's disappearance, or the beginning of the longest night. Now bring the ascending signs to the northern part of the horizon, and observe the degree of the ecliptic, and the corresponding day as before, which will give the time when the sun begins to shine continually, or the beginning of the longest day. Again, bring the descending signs to the same point, and thus will be given the time when the sun ceases to shine continually, or the end of the longest day.\n\nEx. At what time does the sun begin to appear above...\nabove the horizon at North Cape in Lapland, the latitude of which is 72\u00b0 N.? When does he disappear, and how long is he entirely absent during the longest night? \n\nAns. He begins to appear on the 26th of January, and entirely disappears on the 16th of November; he is therefore absent for 71 days.\n\nCor. From the sun's first appearance at the end of the longest night to the beginning of the longest day, and from the end of the longest day to the sun's total disappearance at the beginning of the longest night, he rises and sets every day.\n\nProblem XXI. To find in what part of the northern frigid zone the sun begins to shine continually on a given day.\n\nFind the sun's declination for the given day, and subtract this from 90\u00b0, the remainder will show the latitude required.\n\nNote.\u2014The given day must be between the 21st of March and the 21st of June, as at no other time does the sun begin to shine continually in the northern frigid zone.\n\nEx. Required the latitude in which the sun begins to shine without setting on the 1st of June? Ans. The sun's declination for that day is 22\u00b0 N. and this subtracted from 90\u00b0 leaves 68\u00b0 N. the latitude required.\n\nProblem XXII. The length of the longest day in any place being given, to find the latitude of that place.\n\nBring the first degree of Cancer to the meridian, and set the horary index at noon. Then turn the globe towards the west, till the index point to the hour of sunset, or half of the length of the given day; raise or depress the pole, till the sun's place in the ecliptic is exactly in the western edge of the horizon. The elevation thus obtained will be equal to the required latitude.\n\nIn Adam's globes, after bringing the first degree of Cancer to the meridian, and setting the index to noon, the globe must be turned towards the west, till the index shows the time of sunset, and the sun's place must be brought to the eastern side of the horizon.\n\nEx. In what latitude is the longest day 18 hours long? Ans. In latitude 58\u00b0 30' N.\n\nBy this problem the limits of the hour climates may be pretty nearly ascertained.\n\nProblem XXIII. To find the latitudes of those places in the frigid zone where the sun is continually above the horizon for a given number of days.\n\nCount from the first degree of Cancer towards the nearest equinoctial point, as many degrees as is equal to half the given number of days; bring the point thus obtained below the meridian, and note the degree of the meridian which it intersects. This subtracted from 90\u00b0 will leave a remainder that is nearly equal to the latitude of the place.\n\nEx. In what latitude does the sun never set during 76 days? Ans. In latitude 71\u00b0 30', or very near the southern part of Nova Zembla.\n\nNote.\u2014This problem cannot be performed accurately by the globe; for as the sun requires 365 days five hours to move through the whole 360\u00b0 of the ecliptic, he does not advance quite a degree in 24 hours.\n\nBy this problem the limits of the month climates may be pretty nearly ascertained.\n\nProblem XXIV. The hour and day being given at any place, to find in what places the sun is rising, and in what he is setting; where it is noon, and where midnight.\n\nFind by Problem XIX. the place to which the sun is vertical at the given time; rectify the globe for the latitude of that place, and bring the place below the meridian. In this position of the globe all those places that lie within the western edge of the horizon will have the sun rising, and all those which are in the eastern edge of the horizon will have it setting. Again, to those places which lie under the upper semicircle of the brazen meridian, it will be noon; and to those which lie below the lower semicircle, it will be midnight.\n\nEx. Suppose it to be four o'clock P.M. on the 4th of June at London; where is the sun at that time rising, and where is he setting; to what places is it noon, and to what midnight? Ans. The north-eastern part of Siberia, Kamtchatka, the most western of the Sandwich islands, and the most eastern of the Society islands, are within the western edge of the horizon, and consequently to these the sun is rising. At Tobolsk, in the Caspian sea, in the desert of Arabia, in the middle of the Red sea, in Abyssinia, in the central parts of Africa, and in the country of the Hottentots, the sun will be setting, as these places lie within the eastern edge of the horizon. New Britain, the islands of Martinique and Trinidad, and the middle part of South America, which lie below the upper semicircle of the meridian, have noon; and China, Tartary, the eastern part of China, the Philippine islands, and the western part of New Holland, which are situated below the under edge of the semicircle, have midnight.\n\nAs the remaining problems on the terrestrial globe chiefly respect the continuance of twilight, it is proper, before we proceed, to make a few remarks on this subject. For the explanation of the term, see Crepusculum and Twilight.\n\nThe Crepusculum, or Twilight, it is supposed, usually begins and ends when the sun is about 18\u00b0 below the horizon; for then the stars of the 6th magnitude disappear in the morning, and appear in the evening. It is of longer duration in the solstices than in the equinoxes, and longer in an oblique sphere than in a right one; because in those cases the sun, by the obliquity of his path, is longer in ascending through 18\u00b0 of latitude.\n\nTwilight is occasioned by the sun's rays refracted in our atmosphere, and reflected from the particles of it to the eye. For let A (fig. 10.) be the place of an observer on the earth ADL, AB the sensible horizon, meeting in B the circle CBM bounding that part of the atmosphere which is capable of refracting and reflecting light to the eye. It is plain that when the sun is under this horizon, no direct rays can come to the eye at A; but the sun being in the refracted line CG, the particle C will be illuminated by the direct rays of the sun; and that particle may reflect those rays to A, where they enter the eye of the spectator. And thus the sun's light illuminating an innumerable multitude of particles, may be all reflected to the spectator at A.\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples and Practice.\n\nA. From B draw BD touching the circle ADL in D, and let the sun be at S in the line AD; then the ray SB will be reflected into the situation BA, and will enter the eye, because from a principle in optics the angle of incidence DRC is equal to the angle of reflection ABE. See Optics. This ray SB, or BA, will therefore be the first that reaches the eye at dawn in the morning, and the last that falls on the eye at night, when twilight ceases, because as the sun gets lower down, the particles of the air at B will no longer be illuminated.\n\nThe depth of the sun below the horizon at the beginning of the morning or end of the evening twilight, is determined by observing the moment when the air first begins to shine in the morning, or ceases to shine in the evening; then finding the sun's place for that time, and hence the time till his rising in the horizon, or after his disappearance below. This depth of the sun below the horizon has been variously stated by different astronomers, but it is now generally estimated at 18\u00b0. Accordingly in Mr Adams's globes there is a circular wire fixed 18\u00b0 below the horizon, to represent the limits of the crepuscular (see PWY, fig. 5.)\n\nAs the cause of twilight is not constant, its limits must continually vary; for if the exhalations in the atmosphere be more copious or more extensive than usual, the morning twilight will begin sooner, and that of the evening last longer than ordinary; as the more copious the exhalations, the more rays will be reflected from them, and consequently the more they will shine, and again, the higher they are, the sooner they will be illuminated by the sun. From this circumstance the evening twilight is commonly longer than the morning, at the same time, and in the same place. The refraction is also greater according as the air is more dense, and not only is the brightness of the atmosphere variable, but the same takes place in its height above the earth; therefore, the twilight is longest in hot weather, and in hot countries, all other things being equal. The chief differences, however, arise from the different situations of places on the earth, or from the difference of the sun's place in the heavens. Thus, the twilight is longest when the earth is the position of a parallel sphere, and shortest in that of a right sphere (see No. 90): and in an oblique sphere, the twilight continues longer at any place, in proportion as that place is nearer to either of the poles; a circumstance which affords considerable relief to the inhabitants of the northern countries in their long winter nights. Twilight continues longest in all places of north latitude, when the sun is in the tropic of Cancer, and to those in south latitude when he is in the tropic of Capricorn. The time of the shortest twilight also varies in different latitudes: thus, in England, the shortest twilight is about the beginning of October and of March, when the sun is in 23\u00b0 and 23\u00b0; hence, when the difference between the sun's declination and the depth of the equator is less than 18\u00b0, so that the sun does not descend more than 18\u00b0 below the horizon, the twilight will continue through the whole night, as happens in Britain from the 22d of May to the 22d of July.\n\nIn the latitude of 40\u00b0 N., twilight continues for the whole night, only on the 21st of June, or the time of the summer solstice; but at all places further to the north it continues for a certain number of days before and after the summer solstice.\n\nNear the north pole there is continual twilight from the 22d of September, the time of the sun's permanent absence, to the 12th of November. It then ceases till about the 30th of January, when it again appears, and continues till the 21st of March, the time of the sun's permanent appearance. Hence the inhabitants of those places nearest the pole, though they never see the sun for nearly six months, have, however, the benefit of twilight for above the half of that time, and are entirely excluded from the sun's light little more than 12 weeks, during five of which the moon is constantly above the horizon.\n\nWere it not for the gradual change from light to shades of darkness, and vice versa, which is the consequence of twilight, much inconvenience would arise. A sudden change from the darkness of midnight to the full splendor of the sun, and the reverse, would injure the sight, and would, in many cases, be productive of much danger to travellers, who would be overtaken by utter darkness before they had time to prepare for its approach.\n\nProblem XXV. To find where it is twilight at any given time.\n\nFind where the sun is vertical at the given time, and rectify the globe for the latitude of that place. Observe what places are within the limits of twilight, or not quite 18\u00b0 below the horizon. To those which are situated within the western zone, between the horizon and the parallel of 18\u00b0, it will be twilight in the morning; and those which are in the eastern zone will have twilight in the evening.\n\nThis problem may be more conveniently performed by rectifying the globe for the antipodes of the place which has the sun then vertical, and observing what places are situated in the zone formed above the horizon, between it and a parallel circle of 18\u00b0.\n\nEx. It is required to find where it is twilight on the 4th of June, when it is three o'clock, P.M., at London.\n\nAns. Kamtschatka, the Sandwich islands, and the Marquesas, have twilight in the morning; and the inhabitants of Madagascar, of Tibet, and the eastern part of Persia, have twilight in the evening.\n\nProblem XXVI. To find the duration of twilight at a given place on any given day.\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude of the place; find the sun's place for the given day by Problem X. and bring it below the meridian, and let the horary index to XII. Turn the globe till the sun's place be just within the circle that marks the limit of twilight, and the index will show the beginning of twilight. Subtract the time of the beginning of twilight from the time of sunrise at the given place (found by Problem XII.) and the remainder will show the duration of twilight at the given place.\n\nNote.\u2014The above rule will answer both for the ordinary globes, and for those of Adams, except that in the latter the sun's place must be brought below the western part of the horizon. A more convenient way in both globes will be, to bring that point of the ecliptic which is opposite to the sun's place, 18\u00b0 above the\nthe western horizon, and the index will then shew the beginning of twilight.\n\nEx. How long will twilight continue at London on the following days: March 2d; September 25th; and December 26? Ans. On the 2d of March it will continue one hour and fifty minutes; on the 25th of September two hours; and on the 26th of December, two hours ten minutes (G).\n\nPROBLEM XXVII. To shew the cause of day and night by the globe.\n\nIt will have appeared, from the consideration of the cause of day and night given under the article ASTRONOMY, that only that half of the earth which is opposite to the sun, is illuminated by his rays, while that which is turned from him is involved in darkness. As the earth revolves on its axis from west to east, in the space of 24 hours, every place on the earth in the course of that time alternately enjoys the light of the sun, and is deprived of it.\n\nTo illustrate this by the globe, rectify the globe for the sun's declination, so as to place the sun in the zenith, and the horizon will represent the boundary between light and darkness; that hemisphere which is above the horizon being illuminated by the sun's rays, and that which is below the horizon being derived of light. If now a patch is put on the globe, so as to represent any place, and if the globe be made to revolve from west to east; when the place is brought to the western edge of the horizon, the sun will appear to the inhabitants of that place to be rising in the east, though, in fact, the appearance arises from the place itself coming beyond the limit of darkness. As the globe continues to turn, the place rises towards the meridian, and this produces the appearance as if the sun were advancing towards the meridian in a contrary direction. When the place comes below the meridian, it is noon to that place, and the sun appears to have attained its greatest height.\n\nAs the place proceeds towards the east, it gradually recedes from the meridian, and the sun appears descending in the west. When it reaches the eastern edge of the horizon, and is proceeding below the boundary of light and darkness, the sun appears to be setting; and during the whole time that the place is moving below the horizon, the sun will not appear till the place once more rises in the west.\n\nPROBLEM XXVIII. To find at what places an eclipse of the moon is visible at any given time.\n\nFind the place to which the sun is vertical at the given time, and rectify the globe for the latitude of that place. As the moon is opposite to the sun, which illuminates the superior hemisphere of the globe, the eclipse of the moon will be visible to all the places that lie below the horizon.\n\nAs the places below the horizon are not easily examined, this problem may be more conveniently performed by rectifying the globe for the antipodes of the place to which the sun is vertical at the given time, rather than for the place itself; as in this latter position of the globe the moon being in opposition to the sun, will be vertical to the place below the zenith, and its eclipse will be visible at all the places now above the horizon.\n\nEx. 1. On the 4th of January 1806, at 55 minutes past 11 P.M., reckoning the time at Greenwich, there was an eclipse of the moon. It is required to find those places to which the eclipse was visible? Ans. Through the greatest part of Africa, in some part of Europe, in Asia, South America, and a great part of North America.\n\nEx. 2. On the 10th of May 1808, when it is eight o'clock A.M. at Greenwich, the moon will be totally eclipsed. In what places will the eclipse be visible? Ans. In most parts of America; in the islands of the Pacific ocean, and on the eastern coast of New Holland.\n\nSECT. II. Of the Use of the Celestial Globe.\n\nThe celestial globe, with respect to the circles that are described on it, and the apparatus with which it is furnished, scarcely differs from the terrestrial globe, which has been so fully described in the preceding section. The surface of the celestial globe is made to represent all the stars that are commonly visible to the naked eye, arranged under their constellations, and bounded by the figures which have been given to these constellations by the early astronomers. (See fig. 5.) In Adams's celestial globe the moveable semicircle (No. 91.) turning round the poles represents a circle of declination, and the small circle on it, an artificial sun or planet.\n\nBoth the globes are often furnished with a mariner's compass, which is usually placed in the lower part of the frame.\n\nIt must here be remarked, that the representation of the heavens on the celestial globe, though probably much more accurate than that of the earth on the terrestrial, is not so natural as the latter; for, in viewing the stars on the external surface of a globe, the spectator sees them in an opposite position to that in which he observes them in the heavens, so that to form a just conception of their exact situation, he must suppose his eye to be seated in the centre of the globe. Hence, if a large hollow hemisphere were made of glass, and if the stars in the corresponding hemisphere of the firmament were painted in transparent colours on its surface; an eye situated in the centre of such a hemisphere\n\n(c) If we have the latitude of a place, and the sun's declination given, we may find the beginning of the morning and the end of the evening twilight by calculation. Thus, in the oblique-angled spherical triangle ZPN (fig. 11,) we have given ZP the co-latitude; PN the co-declination, and ZN = 108\u00b0 being the sum of 90\u00b0 the quadrant, and 18\u00b0 the depression at the extremity of twilight. Then by spherical trigonometry we may calculate the triangle ZPN, the hour angle from noon, and this reduced to time, at the rate of 15\u00b0 per hour, gives the time from noon to the beginning or end of twilight. For the mode of calculation, see SPHERICS.\nThe great use of the celestial globe is to perform a variety of problems with respect to the stars, and the motions of the heavenly bodies through the space which they occupy.\n\n**Problem I. To place the celestial globe in such a situation as that it shall exhibit an accurate representation of the face of the heavens at any given place, and at any given time.**\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude of the place, as in Problem VIII. of the terrestrial globe, or by setting the pole of the celestial globe pointing to the pole of the earth, by means of the compass that is usually annexed to the globes; find the sun's place in the ecliptic; bring this to the meridian, and set the horary index at noon. Again, make the globe turn on its axis till the index point to the given time, and in this position the globe will exactly represent the face of the heavens, corresponding to the given time and place; every constellation and star in the heavens answering in position to those on the globe. Hence, by examining the globe, it will immediately be seen what stars are above or below the horizon, which are on the eastern and western parts of the heavens, which have just risen above the horizon, and which are about to sink below it.\n\nAs this problem will be found extremely useful to the student of astronomy, we shall here quote the example given in illustration of it by Messrs Bruce of Newcastle.\n\n\"Required the situation of the stars for the latitude of Newcastle, on October 6th, at eight o'clock in the evening?\"\n\n\"In our present survey of the heavens, we shall commence at the north point of the horizon, and proceed round eastward; noticing the different constellations, and the relative situation of the principal stars in these constellations.\n\n\"The first star which strikes the eye of the observer, in the north-east part of the heavens, is Capella, in the constellation Auriga, or the Wagoner: It is of the first magnitude, of the altitude of 25\u00b0, or nearly the fourth part of the distance from the horizon to the zenith. There are two stars of the second magnitude, which form with Capella a triangle:\u2014The star which forms the short side of the triangle is in the right shoulder of Auriga, and is marked \u03b2; it lies at the distance of about 8\u00b0 from Capella, further to the north; its altitude is 18\u00b0.\u2014The star forming the longer side of the triangle is in the Bull's northern horn; its distance from Capella is more than 26\u00b0; its altitude not more than 5\u00b0, and azimuth N. E. There are three stars of the fourth magnitude, a little to the south of Capella, that bear the name of the Kid.\n\n\"If a line be drawn through the two stars that form the upper side of the triangle, and continued to the horizon, it will point out Castor, \u03b1, in Gemini just rising, azimuth E. N. E.: it is between the first and second magnitude. The other stars in this constellation have not yet risen.\n\n\"A line drawn between Castor and Capella, and continued higher in the heavens, will point out Perseus, in which there are three stars, one of the second magnitude, \u03b1, named Algenib, and two of the third magnitude, one on each side of Algenib, at the distance of about 5\u00b0: they form a line a little curved on the side next Auriga. The altitude of Algenib is 37\u00b0; azimuth N. E. by E.\n\n\"A little to the south of Perseus is the Head of Medusa, which Perseus is holding in his hand. Besides two or three small stars, it contains one of the second, and one of the third magnitude. The name of the brightest is Algol; altitude 33\u00b0; azimuth E. N. E. Algol is only 10\u00b0 distant from Algenib.\n\n\"Directly below the Head of Medusa, about 14\u00b0 above the horizon, are the Pleiades or seven stars: They are seated in the shoulder of Taurus, and are so easily known, that no description is necessary. Aldebaran, a star of the first magnitude, which forms the eye of Taurus, is just rising; azimuth E. N. E. A vertical circle drawn through Algol will point to it. There are two stars of the third magnitude, and several smaller very near Aldebaran, which form with it a triangle. The whole cluster is called the Hyades.\n\n\"A line drawn from Aldebaran through Algol, and continued to the zenith, will direct to Cassiopeia. This contains five stars of the third magnitude, besides several of the fourth: it is in form something like the letter Y, or, as some think, an inverted chair. It is situated above Perseus, within 30\u00b0 of the zenith. The altitude of the brightest star, \u03b1, called Schedar, is 60\u00b0; azimuth, E. N. E.\n\n\"Below Cassiopeia and west of Perseus is Andromeda, which contains three stars of the second magnitude. A line from Algenib, parallel to the horizon towards the south, will pass very near these three stars; and, as they are all of the same magnitude, and placed nearly at the same distance of 15\u00b0 from each other, they may easily be known. The name of the star nearest Perseus, and which is in the foot of Andromeda, marked \u03b3, is Almaak: its altitude is 49\u00b0; azimuth E. N. E. The name of \u03b2, in the girdle, is Mirach: its altitude 44\u00b0; azimuth E. The altitude of \u03b1, in the head of Andromeda, is 46\u00b0; azimuth E. S. E.\n\n\"About 18\u00b0 below Mirach are two stars in Aries, not more than 5\u00b0 distant from each other, forming with Mirach an isosceles triangle: the most eastern star, \u03b1, is of the second magnitude; the other, \u03b2, of the third, attended by a smaller star, marked \u03b3, of the fourth magnitude. A line drawn from Mirach, perpendicular to the horizon, will pass between the two, and besides, will point to a star of the second magnitude, directly E. not above 3\u00b0 from the horizon.\n\n\"This star is the first of Cetus, marked \u03b1, and is of the second magnitude: it is named Menkar. A line drawn from Capella through the Pleiades will also point to it. Cetus is a large constellation, and contains eight stars of the third magnitude; they all lie to the west of Menkar; \u03b2, a star in the tail, is more than 40\u00b0 distant from it. The azimuth of \u03b2 is S. E. by E.; altitude nearly the same as Menkar.\n\n\"The constellation Piscis is situated next to Aries; it contains one star of the third magnitude, marked \u03b1: its altitude is 10\u00b0; azimuth E. by S. It is distant from Menkar 15\u00b0. A line drawn from Almaak, through \u03b1 in Aries, will point to it.\n\n\"If we return again to \u03b1, in the head of Andromeda, we shall find three other stars nearer the meridian, which,\nwith it, form a square. These stars are in Pegasus, and are placed at the distance of 15\u00b0 from each other; they are all of the second magnitude. The two stars forming the western side of the square are called\u2014the upper one Scheat, which is marked \u03b2, and which is in the thigh of Pegasus; the under one Markab, which is marked \u03b1, and which is in the wing; the lowest star in the eastern side of the square is in the tip of the wing, and is marked \u03b3. The altitude of Scheat is 35\u00b0; azimuth S. E. \u00bc E. Altitude of Markab, 43\u00b0; azimuth S. E. by S \u00bd E.\n\n\"A line drawn through \u03b3 and \u03b2 (the diagonal in the square of Pegasus) and continued to the meridian, will point out Cygnus, a remarkable constellation in the form of a large cross, in which there is a star of the second magnitude, named Deneb, or Aridied; it is marked \u03b1, and is almost directly upon the meridian at the altitude of 86\u00b0. Cygnus contains six stars of the third magnitude. The constellation Cepheus, which contains no remarkable stars, is situated between Cygnus and the north pole.\n\n\"Below Pegasus, and nearer the meridian, is Aquarius, containing four stars of the third magnitude. A line drawn from \u03b1 in Andromeda, through Markab, will point to \u03b1 in Aquarius. Its altitude is 32\u00b0; azimuth S. S. E.\n\n\"A bright star of the first magnitude named Fomalhaut, in Piscis Australis, is then upon the horizon; azimuth S. S. E.\n\n\"Delphinus is a small constellation, situated about 30\u00b0 below Cygnus upon the meridian; it contains five stars of the third magnitude, four of them being placed close together, and forming the figure of a rhombus or lozenge. A line drawn through the two under stars of the square will point to it. Its altitude is about 50\u00b0.\n\n\"A little to the west of Delphinus, but not quite so high, is Aquila, containing one very bright star of the first magnitude, named Atair: It may very easily be known from having a star on each side of it of the third magnitude, forming a straight line. The length of the line is only about 5\u00b0; altitude of Atair 40\u00b0; azimuth S. S. W.\n\n\"Considerably above Atair, and a little to the W. of Cygnus, is Lyra, containing a star of the first magnitude, one of the most brilliant in the firmament. It is called Lyra or Vega, and is 35\u00b0 to the N. W. of Atair; altitude 65\u00b0; azimuth W. S. W. Lyra, Atair, and Ariadne, form a large triangle.\n\n\"We come now to notice three constellations, which occupy a large space in the western side of the heavens: these are Hercules immediately below Lyra; Serpentarius between Hercules and the horizon, extending a little more towards the south; and Bo\u00f6tes, reaching from the horizon W. N. W. to the altitude of 45\u00b0.\n\n\"Hercules contains eight stars of the third magnitude; the star in the head, \u03b1, named Ras Algethi, is within 5\u00b0 of \u03b1 in the head of Serpentarius. This last is a star of the second magnitude, and is named Ras Alhague: its altitude is 30\u00b0; azimuth, S. W. by W. \u00bc W. A line drawn from Lyra, perpendicular to the horizon, will pass between these two stars. The other stars in Hercules extend towards the zenith, and those in Serpentarius towards the horizon.\n\n\"The constellation Bo\u00f6tes may easily be known from the brilliancy of Arcturus, a star of the first magnitude, and supposed to be the nearest to our system of any in the northern hemisphere: it is within 10\u00b0 of the horizon; azimuth W. N. W. Bo\u00f6tes also contains seven stars of the third magnitude, mostly situated higher in the heavens than Arcturus. The star immediately above Arcturus is called Mezen Mirach, and is marked s. The star in the left shoulder, \u03b4, named Seginus, forms with Mirach and Arcturus a straight-line.\n\n\"Between Serpentarius and Bo\u00f6tes is Serpens, containing one star of the second magnitude, and eight of the third: \u03b1 in Serpens is nearly at the same distance from the horizon, as Arcturus; azimuth W.\n\n\"Above Serpens, and a little to the east of Bo\u00f6tes, is the Northern Crown, containing one star of the second magnitude, named Gemma, and several of the third, which have the appearance of a semicircle. A line drawn from Lyra to Arcturus will pass through this constellation.\n\n\"We come now to Ursa Major, a constellation containing one star of the first, three of the second, and seven of the third magnitude. It may easily be distinguished by those seven stars, which, from their resemblance to a wagon, are called Charles's Wain. The four stars in the form of a long square, are the four wheels of the wagon; the three stars in the tail of the Bear, are the three horses, which appear fixed to one of the wheels. The two hind wheels, \u03b1 named Dubhe, and \u03b2, are called the pointers, from their always pointing nearly to the north pole. Hence the pole star may be known. The altitude of Dubhe is 30\u00b0; azimuth N. by W. \u00bc W. The distance between the two pointers is 5\u00b0; the distance between the pole star and Dubhe, the upper pointer, is 30\u00b0.\n\n\"Ursa Minor, besides the pole star of the second magnitude, situated in the tail, contains three of the third, and three of the fourth magnitude. These form some resemblance to the figure of Charles's Wain inverted, and may easily be traced.\n\n\"Draco, containing four stars of the second and seven of the third magnitude, spreads itself in the heavens near Ursa Minor: the four stars in the head are in the form of a rhombus or lozenge: the tail is between the pole star and Charles's Wain.\n\n\"Besides these constellations, there are a number of others, which, as they contain no remarkable stars, we have not described; an enumeration of these will suffice. The Lynx, between Ursa Major and Auriga; Camelopardalis, between Ursa Major and Cassiopeia; Musca, and the Greater and Lesser Triangles between Aries and Perseus, Aculeus, close to the head of Pegasus; Sagittarius setting in the south-west; Antinous and Sobieski's Shield below Aquila; the Fox and Goose between Aquila and Cygnus; the Greyhounds and Berenice's Hair between Bo\u00f6tes and Ursa Major, and Leo Minor below Ursa Major.\"\n\n* Bruce's Introduction in describing the method of performing the problems to Geography on the celestial globe, will be found explained in the article Astronomy, or under their proper heads in the general alphabet of this work. See Ascension, Azimuth, Declination, &c.\n\nProblem\nPart II.\n\n**Problem II. To find the right ascension and declination of any given star.**\n\nBring the given star below the brazen meridian, and mark the degree of the meridian under which it lies. That degree shows the declination of the star, and the degree of the equator cut by the meridian gives the star's right ascension.\n\nThe right ascension of a star may also be found by placing the globe in the position of a right sphere, and then bringing the star to the eastern part of the horizon; for that point of the equator which comes to the horizon at the same time with the star, marks its right ascension. See Astronomy, No. 249, 250.\n\nEx. 1. What is the right ascension and declination of the star Sirius? Ans. Its right ascension is 99\u00b0, and its declination 16\u00b0 27' S.\n\nEx. 2. Required the right ascension and declination of Aldebaran, or the star in the Bull's Eye, marked \u03b1. Ans. Its right ascension is 66\u00b0, and its declination 16\u00b0 5' N.\n\n**Problem III. Having the right ascension and declination of a star given, to find the star on the globe.**\n\nBring that degree of the equator which marks the right ascension below the brazen meridian, and counting along the meridian towards the north or south, as far as the degree of declination, the required star will be there found.\n\nEx. 1. The right ascension of a certain star is 162\u00b0 15' and its declination is 57\u00b0 27' N.; what is the name of the star? Ans. The lower pointer of Ursa major, marked \u03b2.\n\nEx. 2. The right ascension of Arcturus is 211\u00b0 30', and its declination is 20\u00b0 13' N.; it is required to find it on the globe.\n\nThis problem is extremely useful in discovering the names and relative situations of the different stars.\n\n**Problem IV. To find the latitude and longitude of a given star.**\n\nBring the solstitial colure (see No. 75) below the brazen meridian, and there fix the quadrant of altitude over that pole of the ecliptic which is in the same hemisphere with the given star. Then, keeping the globe steady, bring the graduated edge of the quadrant over the given star, and the degree of the quadrant cut by the star, counted from the ecliptic, marks its latitude, and the degree of the ecliptic that is cut by the quadrant is the longitude of the given star (ii). See Astronomy, No. 252, 253.\n\nEx. 1. What is the latitude and longitude of Arcturus? Ans. Lat. 31\u00b0 N. Long. Libra 20\u00b0.\n\nEx. 2. What is the latitude and longitude of Capella? Ans. Lat. 23\u00b0 N. Long. Gemini 18\u00b0 30'.\n\n**Problem V. Having the day of the month given, to find at what hour any star comes below the meridian.**\n\nFind the sun's place, and bring it to the meridian, and set the horary index to XII.; turn the globe till the given star come below the meridian, and the index will point out the hour.\n\nTo know whether the hour is in the forenoon or afternoon, it is necessary to observe, that if the star be to the east of the sun, it will reach the meridian later than the sun, but if it be to the west of that luminary, it will come to the meridian sooner: hence, in the former case, the hour will be P. M. and in the latter A. M.\n\nEx. 1. At what hour does Sirius come to the meridian on the 9th of February? Ans. At 7 minutes past 9 P. M.\n\nEx. 2. Required the hour when Castor passes the meridian on the same day. Ans. At 52 minutes past 9 P. M.\n\n**Problem VI. Having any star given, and a given hour, to find on what day the star will come to the meridian at a given hour.**\n\nBring the given star below the meridian, and set the horary index to the given hour. Make the globe revolve till the index come to twelve at noon; and the day of the month which corresponds to the degree of the ecliptic then below the meridian, found in the calendar circle of the wooden horizon, will be the day required.\n\nEx. 1. On what day does Algenib, the first star of Perseus, come to the meridian at midnight? Ans. On the 13th of November.\n\nEx. 2. On what day does Arcturus come to the meridian at 9 o'clock P. M.? Ans. On the 10th of June.\n\n**Problem VII. Having the latitude, the day of the month, and the hour of the night given, to find the altitude and azimuth of any given star.**\n\nRectify the globe for the given latitude; bring the sun's place below the meridian, and set the horary index at XII.; then turn the globe till the index point at the given hour. Fix the quadrant of altitude at 90\u00b0 from the horizon, that is, in the zenith, and bring its graduated edge over the place of the star: the degree of the quadrant intercepted between the horizon and the star is the altitude required; and the distance between the foot of the quadrant and the nearest part of the horizon, will be the azimuth.\n\nIt is evident that this problem on the celestial globe is exactly similar to Problem XIII. on the terrestrial globe, for finding the altitude of the sun.\n\nEx. 1. What will be the altitude and azimuth of Cor Hydr\u00e6 on the 21st of December at London, at 4 o'clock A. M.? Ans. The altitude 30\u00b0, the azimuth S. 14\u00b0 W.\n\nEx. 2. Suppose an observer at the Cape of Good Hope, on the 21st of June at midnight; required the altitude and azimuth of Arcturus to him? Ans. Altitude 12\u00b0, azimuth N. 55\u00b0 W.\n\n**Problem VIII. Having given the azimuth of any given star, and the day of the month in a given latitude; to find the hour of the night, and altitude of the star.**\n\nRectify the globe as in the last problem; fix the quadrant of altitude in the zenith, and bring it to the given azimuth. Turn the globe till the star comes be-\n\n---\n\n(ii) It must be remembered that the longitude of the heavenly bodies is not estimated in degrees and minutes like their right ascension, but in signs, degrees, and minutes, as the sun's place is reckoned.\nPrinciples how the graduated edge of the quadrant, when the\nand horary index will point out the hour, and the altitude\nof the star will be seen by the quadrant.\n\nEx. Suppose the azimuth of Dubhe to be N. 23\u00b0 W.\nat London on the 1st of September; it is required to\nfind the altitude of the star, and the hour of the night?\nAns. The altitude of Dubhe at that time is 31\u00b0, and\nthe hour is 9 o'clock P.M.\n\nProblem IX. The latitude of the place, the altitude of\na star, and the day of the month, being given; to find\nthe azimuth and the hour of the night.\n\nRectify the globe as before, and having fixed the\nquadrant of altitude in the zenith, turn the globe and\nquadrant of altitude till the latter comes over the star\nat the given degree of altitude. In this position the in-\ndex will show the time of night, and the position of the\nquadrant at the horizon will show the azimuth of the\nstar.\n\nIn the same way the hour of the night and the\nazimuth of the sun may be found, by fixing a patch on\nthe globe in the sun's place, and bringing it to the\nquadrant as directed for the star.\n\nAs the sun and stars have the same altitude twice in\nthe day, it is proper to know whether they are to be\neast or west of the meridian; or whether the hour re-\nquired be in the evening or the morning.\n\nEx. At Edinburgh, on the 25th of December, in\nthe forenoon, when the sun's altitude is 7\u00b0 20', require\nthe hour and the sun's azimuth? Ans. It is 10\no'clock A.M., and the sun's azimuth is S. 27\u00b0 30' E.\n\nProblem X. Having the azimuth of the sun or a star,\nthe latitude of the place, and the hour of the day given;\nto find the altitude and day of the month.\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude of the place, fix\nthe quadrant in the zenith, and bring its edge under\nthe given azimuth. Bring the sun's place or the star\nto the edge of the quadrant, and set the index at the\ngiven hour. The degree marked in the quadrant will\nshow the altitude; and if the globe be turned till the\nindex points to twelve at noon, the day of the month,\nanswering to that degree of the ecliptic which is in-\ntersected by the brazen meridian, is the day required.\n\nEx. The azimuth of the star \u03b1 in the Northern Crown\nwas observed at London at 9 o'clock P.M. to be S. 89\u00b0\nW.; required the altitude and day of the month?\nAns. Altitude 38\u00b0; day of the month 1st of September.\n\nProblem XI. Having observed two stars to have the\nsame azimuth; to find the hour of the night.\n\nRectify the globe as before; turn the globe and\nmove the quadrant till the edge of the latter comes over\nboth stars, and the horary index in this position of the\nglobe will give the hour required.\n\nThe following is a simple and easy method of finding\nwhen two stars have the same azimuth. Hold a small\nline with a plummet at its lower extremity between the\neye and the two stars, and if both stars fall within the\nline, they have the same azimuth. The same may be\ndone by observing when any two stars pass behind the\nperpendicular edge of a wall at the same time.\n\nEx. Vega and Altair were observed to have the same\nazimuth at London on the 11th of May; required the\nhour of the night? Ans. 15 minutes past 2 A.M.\n\nThis problem may be applied to the regulating of clocks and watches, by reducing apparent to real time, as\nexplained under Astronomy.\n\nProblem XII. To find the rising, setting, and cul-\nminating of any star or planet, its continuance above\nthe horizon, its oblique ascension and declination, and\nits eastern and western amplitude; the place and day\nbeing given.\n\nRectify the globe as in the foregoing problems; bring\nthe given star or the given planet (finding its place in\nan ephemeris for the given day, and marking it by a\npatch on the globe), to the eastern part of the horizon,\nand the index of the hour circle will point out the time\nof rising: the degree of the equator that comes to the\nhorizon with the given star or planet, marks its oblique\nascension, and the eastern amplitude is shown by the di-\nstance of the star or planet from the eastern part of the\nhorizon.\n\nBring the star or planet to the meridian, and the in-\ndex will point to the time of its culminating.\n\nMove the globe till the star or planet come to the\nwestern part of the horizon, and the time of its setting,\nits oblique declination, and its western amplitude, may be\nfound in the same manner as directed above; for its\nrising, oblique ascension, and eastern amplitude, the\nnumber of hours passed over by the index, while the star\nor planet is moving from east to west, will show the time\nof its continuance above the horizon.\n\nEx. 1. Required the above circumstances with respect\nto Sirius on the 14th of March at London. Ans. It\nrises at 24 minutes past two P.M.; comes to the meri-\ndian, or culminates, at 57 minutes past five P.M.; and sets\nat half-past eleven P.M. Hence it remains above the\nhorizon nine hours and five minutes. Its oblique ascen-\nsion is 120\u00b0 47', its oblique declination 77\u00b0 17', and its\namplitude 27\u00b0 S.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to find the situation of the seve-\nral planets on the 19th of January 1866. Ans. Mer-\ncury is about 22\u00b0 to the west of the sun, and rises fourth-\neast by east, at 20 minutes before seven A.M. Venus\nis an evening star, and sets about half past eight. Mars\nis a very little to the east of the sun, and rises and sets\nso near the same time with the sun, that he cannot be\nseen. Jupiter is a morning star, and rises about six\no'clock. Saturn is a little to the east of the star Spica\nVirginis, and rises about half an hour after midnight.\nHerschel is very near Saturn, and rises about the same\ntime.\n\nProblem XIII. To find those stars which never rise, and\nthose which never set, in a given latitude.\n\nRectify the globe for the latitude of the place; then,\nholding a black lead pencil so as to touch the surface of\nthe globe at the northern point of the horizon, turn\nthe globe, so that the pencil may describe a circle:\nall the stars which are between this circle and the ele-\nvated pole, never set. Again, holding the pencil at\nthe southern point of the horizon, turn the globe so as\nto describe another circle there, and all the stars that\nare between that circle and the pole, below the horizon,\nnever rise.\n\nIf the place is in southern latitude, the stars that ne-\nver set are found by describing a circle at the southern\npoint.\npoint of the horizon, and those that never rise by a similar circle at the northern point (1).\n\nThroughout almost the whole year, the moon rises later every succeeding day, by above three quarters of an hour; but at a considerable distance from the equator, as in the latitude of Britain, France, and some other countries, a remarkable anomaly takes place in the moon's motion about the time of harvest. At this season, when the moon is about full, she rises for several nights successively at about 17 minutes only later than on the preceding day. This is attended with considerable advantage, for as the moon rises before twilight is well ended, the light is as it were prolonged, and thus an opportunity given to the industrious farmer to continue longer in the field, for the purpose of gathering in the fruits of the earth. From the advantage derived from the full moon at the season of harvest, it has been called the harvest moon. The following problem has been contrived for the purpose of illustrating the phenomenon by means of the globe.\n\n**Problem XIV.**\n\nRectify the globe for any considerable northern latitude, suppose that of London. As the angle which the moon's orbit makes with the ecliptic is but small, we may suppose, without any considerable error, her orbit to be represented by the ecliptic. In September the sun is in the beginning of \u2648, so that the moon, when full, being in opposition to the sun, must be in or near the beginning of \u2648. Put a patch, therefore, in the globe at the first point of \u2648 in the ecliptic; and as the moon's mean motion is about 13\u00b0 in a day, put another patch on the ecliptic 13\u00b0 beyond the former, and it will point out the moon's place the night after it is full. A third and fourth patch, put at the distance of 13\u00b0 further on, will show the moon's place on the second and third nights after full, &c. Now, bring the first patch to the horizon, and observe the hour pointed out by the index; turn the globe till the second patch comes to the horizon, and it will appear by the index that there are only 17 minutes between the time of the first patch rising, and that of the second. This small difference in the motion of the moon evidently arises from the small angle which her orbit makes with the horizon. The remaining patches will come to the horizon with a little greater difference of time, and this difference will gradually increase as the moon advances in the ecliptic; but for the first week after the full moon at harvest the difference will not be more than two hours. If patches be continued on to the first point in \u2648, it will be found that the time of their rising, or coming to the horizon, will increase considerably till the last will be above 1\u00bc hour later in coming to the horizon, because that point of the ecliptic makes the greatest angle with the horizon.\n\nThe point of the ecliptic, which makes the least angle with the horizon at rising, makes the greatest angle at setting; and, consequently, when the difference is least at the time of rising, it is greatest at the time of setting.\n\n**Problem XV. To explain the equation of time by the globe.**\n\nThe difference between apparent time and mean or equal time, has been explained in Astronomy, from N\u00b0 50 to 60; and the method of computing the equation of time is also there described.\n\nTo explain the equation of time on the globe, make, with a black lead pencil, marks all round the equator and ecliptic, beginning with \u2648, at equal distances from each other, suppose about 15\u00b0. Then, on turning the globe, it will be seen that all the marks on the first quadrant of the ecliptic, reckoning from \u2648 to \u264e, come to the brazen meridian sooner than the corresponding marks on the first quadrant of the equator. Now, as the former marks represent time as measured by the sun, or a dial, and the latter represent it as measured by an accurate clock, it will be evident, that through the first quarter the dial is faster than the clock.\n\nStill turning the globe, it will be seen that the marks on the second quarter of the ecliptic, reckoning from \u264e to \u264f, come to the meridian later than the corresponding marks of the equator; consequently in this quarter the sun or the dial is slower than the clock. By moving the globe round, and marking the approach of the dots in the third quadrant, it will be seen that, as in the first, the dial now precedes the clock, and in the fourth quadrant, that it is behind it, according to the explanation given in Astronomy.\n\n**Sect. III. Of the Construction of Globes.**\n\nThe construction of globes is of considerable importance; as, in performing the problems in which they are employed, very much depends on the accuracy with which they have been constructed. We shall herefore describe pretty minutely the methods in which the artists of Britain and France make their globes.\n\nThere are certain general circumstances which are attended to in the construction of every globe.\n\nThere is first provided a wooden axis, somewhat less than the intended diameter of the globe, and to the extremities of this axis, which is the basis of the whole succeeding structure, there are fixed two metallic wires, to serve as poles. Now, two hemispherical caps formed on a wooden mould or clock, are applied in the axis. These caps are composed of pasteboard, or folds of paper laid one over another on the mould, till they are of the thickness of a crown piece; and after the whole has stood to dry, and has become a solid body, an incision is made with a sharp knife along the middle, and the two caps are thus flipped off the mould. These caps are now to be applied on the poles of the axis, as they were before on those of the mould; and to fix them\n\n---\n\n(1) This problem may be performed without the globe, by the following method. Find the latitude of the place in a table, and subtract it from 90\u00b0; the remainder will be the complement of the latitude. Then, if the declination of the given star be of the same name with the co-latitude, and exceed it in quantity, it will never rise; if it be of a contrary name, and exceed it, it will never rise.\nthem firmly on the axis, the two edges are sewed together with packthread.\n\nWhen the rudiments of the globe are thus laid, the artist proceeds to strengthen the work, and make the surface smooth and equal. For this purpose, the two poles are fixed in a metallic semicircle, of the proposed size; and a composition made of whitening, mixed with water and glue, heated, melted, and incorporated together, is daubed all over the paper surface. While the plaster is applied, the globe is turned round in the semicircle, the edge of which pares away all the matter that is superfluous and exceeds the proper dimensions, and spreads the rest over those parts that require it. After this operation the ball stands to dry, and when it is thoroughly dried, it is again put in the semicircle, and fresh plaster applied to it; and thus they continue to apply composition and dry the ball alternately, till the surface accurately touches the semicircle in every point, when it becomes perfectly firm, smooth, and equal.\n\nWhen the ball of the globe is thus finished, the map containing a delineation of the surface of the earth, is to be pasted on the globe. For this purpose, the map is engraved in several gores or gulfs, so that when these are accurately joined together on the spherical surface, they may cover every part of the ball, without overlapping each other. The greatest nicety is required in forming these engraved gulfs, as well in the accuracy of the engraving, as in the choice and shape of the paper employed. The method of describing the gores or gulfs, usually employed by the British artists, is as follows:\n\n1. From the given diameter of the globe there is found a right line AB (fig. 12.), equal to the circumference of a great circle corresponding to that diameter; and this line is divided into 12 equal parts.\n\n2. Through the several points of division, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., with a distance equal to ten of the divisions, arches are described crossing each other as in D and E; and these figures are pasted on the globe, so as when joined together to cover its whole surface.\n\n3. Each part of the line AB is divided into 30 equal parts, so that the whole line, which may represent the equator, is divided into 360\u00b0.\n\n4. From the points D and E, which represent the poles, with a distance = 23\u00b0 27', there are described arches ab, ab, (fig. 13.) which form twelfth parts of the polar circles.\n\n5. In a similar manner about the same poles D and E, with a distance = 66\u00b0 33', reckoned from the equator, there are described other arches, cd, cd, which are the twelfth parts of the tropics.\n\n6. In forming the celestial globe, through the point of the equator marked e (fig. 13.) representing the right ascension of a given star, and through the two poles D and E, there is drawn an arch of a circle; and if the complement of the declination from the pole D be taken in the compasses, and an arch be described, intersecting the former in the point i, this point i will be the place of the given star.\n\n7. In this way all the stars of each constellation are laid down, and the circumscribing outline of the constellation is drawn as figured in the tables of Bayer, Flamsteed, &c.\n\n8. In the same manner are determined the declinations and right ascensions of every degree of the ecliptic, d, g.\n\nThe above is the method described by Mr Chambers, of laying down or delineating the gores of a celestial globe. Those of the terrestrial globe are delineated in much the same manner, only that every place is laid down on the gores, according to its longitude and latitude, determined by the intersection of circles; and then the outline of the coasts, boundaries of countries, &c., are added, like the figures of the constellations above mentioned.\n\n9. When the surface of the globe has been thus projected on a plane, the gulfs are to be engraved on copper, to save the trouble of making a new projection for every globe.\n\n10. In the mean time, a ball of paper, plaster, or the like, of the intended diameter of the globe, is prepared in the manner above described, and by means of a semicircle and style, great circles are drawn on its surface, so as to divide it into a number of equal parts, corresponding to the number of gulfs; and subdividing each of these according to the other lines and divisions of the globe. When the ball is thus prepared, the gulfs are to be accurately cut from the printed engraving, and pasted on the ball.\n\nWhen the papers have been thus pasted on, and suffered to dry, nothing remains but to colour and illuminate the globe, and to cover it with a thin layer of the finest varnish, that it may be the better resist dust and moisture. The ball of the globe is now finished, and is to be hung in a strong brazen meridian, furnished with hour circles and a quadrant of altitude, and fitted into a strong wooden horizon.\n\nThe method employed by the French artists in projecting the gulfs of globes, is thus described by M. La Lande.\n\n\"To form celestial and terrestrial globes, it is necessary to engrave gores, which are a sort of projection or development of the globe. The length PC (fig. 14.) of the axis of the curve, is equal to a fourth part of the circumference of the intended globe; the intervals of the parallels on the axis PC are all equal; the radii of the circles KDI, which represent the parallels, are equal to the co-tangents of the latitudes, and the arches of each, such as KI, are nearly equal to the number of degrees that correspond to the breadth of the gore (usually 30\u00b0), multiplied by the sine of the latitude; thus, there will be found no difficulty in tracing them; but the principal difficulty proceeds from the change which those parts of the gores undergo, when they are glued upon the globe; as, in order to adjust them to the space which they ought to occupy, it is necessary to make the paper less on the sides than in the middle, because the sides are too long.\n\n\"The method employed by artists for engraving these gores, is thus described by Bion (Ufage des Globes, tom. iii.), and by Robert de Vaugondy in the seventh volume of the Encyclop\u00e9die, and this method is sufficient for practical purposes.\n\n\"Draw on the paper a line AC, equal to the chord of 15\u00b0, to make the half breadth of the gore; and a perpendicular PC, equal to three times the chord of 30\u00b0, to make the half length; for these papers, the dimensions of which will be equal to the chords, become equal to the arcs themselves when they are pasted on the globe. Divide the height CP into nine parts, if the parallels are to be drawn in every 10\u00b0; divide also the quadrant BE into nine equal parts; through each division...\"\nGlobes are made of various sizes, from a diameter of three inches, to that of as many feet; but their most usual diameter is that of 18 inches, which are sufficiently large for most of the purposes for which globes are employed. Some large globes were made about 100 years ago, in France, by P. Coronelli, a Franciscan monk, which were in considerable reputation. They were engraved, and the plates are still to be seen at Paris, at the house of M. Defos, in the Rue St Jacques. There are some large globes at Cambridge, which were drawn by the hand; but the largest globes of which we have any account, are those which were made for the late unfortunate Louis XVI. and were kept in the palace of Marly. They were 12 feet in diameter, and we believe, are still existing at Paris, where they occupy four entire rooms, each of them being partly in an upper room, and partly in that below it, the floor of the upper room forming the horizon.\n\nThe account which we have given of the method of constructing globes, will be useful to those who purchase these instruments; but to assist them still further, we shall subjoin the following practical rules for the choice of globes.\n\n1. The papers should be well and neatly pasted on the globes, which may be known by the lines and circles meeting exactly, and continuing all the way even and whole; the circles not breaking into several arches, nor the papers either coming short, or lapping over one another.\n\n2. The colours should be transparent, and not laid too thick upon the globe, to hide the names of the places.\n\n3. The globe should hang evenly between the brazen meridian and the wooden horizon, not inclining either to the one side or the other.\n\n4. The globe should move as close to the horizon and the meridian as it conveniently may, otherwise there will be too much trouble to find against what part of the globe any degree of the meridian or horizon is.\n\n5. The equinoctial line should be even with the horizon all round, when the north or south pole is elevated 90\u00b0 above the horizon.\n\n6. The equinoctial line should cut the horizon in the east and west points, in all the elevations of the pole from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\n\n7. The degree of the brazen meridian marked 0\u00b0 should be exactly over the equinoctial line of the globe.\n\n8. Exactly half of the brazen meridian should be above the horizon, which may be known by bringing any of the decimal divisions on the meridian to the north point of the horizon, and finding their complement to 90\u00b0 on the south point.\n\n9. When the quadrant of altitude is placed as far from the equator, or the brazen meridian, as the pole is elevated above the horizon, the beginning of the degrees of the quadrant should reach just to the plane surface of the horizon.\n\n10. When the index of the hour circle passes from one...\none hour to another, 15 degrees of the equator must pass under the graduated edge of the brazen meridian.\n\nThe wooden horizon should be made substantial and strong; it being generally observed, that, in most globes, the horizon is the first part that fails, on account of its having been made too slight.\n\nIn using a globe, the eastern side of the horizon should be kept towards the observer, (unless in particular problems which require a different position;) and that side may be known by the word east on the horizon. In this position the observer will have the graduated side of the meridian towards him, and the quadrant of altitude directly before him; and the globe will be exactly divided into two equal parts by the graduated side of the meridian.\n\nIn performing some problems, it will be necessary to turn about the whole globe and horizon, in order to look at the west side; but this turning will be apt to disturb the ball, so as to shift away that degree of the globe which was before set to the horizon or meridian. This inconvenience may be avoided by thrusting the feather end of a quill between the ball of the globe and the brazen meridian, and thus, without injuring the surface of the globe, it will be kept from turning in the meridian, while the whole is moved round, so as to examine the western side.\n\nWe have already mentioned some improvements which have been made on the globes, for the purpose of remedying the defect in the old construction, of placing the hour circles on the outside of the brazen meridian. Some other improvements and modifications have been contrived by various artists; but of these we shall only mention those of Mr Senex, Mr B. Martin, Mr Smeaton, and Mr Adams.\n\nMr John Senex, F.R.S. invented a contrivance for remedying these defects, by fixing the poles of the diurnal motion to two shoulders or arms of bras, at the distance of $23\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 from the poles of the ecliptic. These shoulders are strongly fastened at the other end to an iron axis, which passes through the poles of the ecliptic, and is made to move round with a very stiff motion; so that when it is adjusted to any point of the ecliptic which the equator is made to intersect, the diurnal motion of the globe on its axis will not disturb it. When it is to be adjusted for any particular time, either past or future, one of the brazen shoulders is brought under the meridian, and held fast to it with one hand, while the globe is turned about with the other; so that the point of the ecliptic which the equator is to intersect may pass under the 0 degree of the brazen meridian; then holding a pencil to that point, and turning the globe about, it will describe the equator according to its position at the time required; and transferring the pencil to $23\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 and $66\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 degrees on the brazen meridian, the tropics and polar circles will be so described for the same time. By this contrivance, the celestial globe may be so adjusted, as to exhibit not only the rising and setting of the stars in all ages and in all latitudes, but likewise the other phenomena that depend upon the motion of the diurnal round the annual axis. Senex's celestial globes, especially the two greatest, of 27 and 28 inches in diameter, have been constructed upon this principle; so that by means of a nut and screw, the pole of the equator is made to revolve about the pole of the ecliptic.\n\nTo represent the above appearances in the most natural and easy manner, Mr B. Martin applied to the contrivance of Mr Senex a moveable equinoctial and solstitial colure, a moveable equinoctial circle, and a moveable ecliptic; all so connected together as to represent those imaginary circles in the heavens for any age of the world.\n\nIn order to the performance of the problems which improve relate to the altitudes and azimuths of celestial objects, Mr Smeaton, F.R.S. has made some improvements applicable to the celestial globe; and to give some idea of the construction, they may be described as follows:\n\nInstead of a thin flexible strip of brass, which generally accompanies the quadrant of altitude, Mr Smeaton substitutes an arch or a circle of the same radius, breadth, and substance, as the brass meridian, divided into degrees, &c. similar to the divisions of that circle, and which, on account of its strength, is not liable to be bent out of the plane of a vertical circle, as is usual with the common quadrant put to globes. That end of this circular arch at which the division begins, rests on the horizon, being filed off square to fit and rest steadily on it throughout its whole breadth; and the upper end of the arch is firmly attached, by means of an arm, to a vertical socket, in such a manner that when the lower end of the arch rests on the horizon, the lower end of this socket shall rest on the upper end of the brass meridian, directly over the zenith of the globe. This socket is fitted to and ground with a steel spindle of the length, so that it will turn freely on it without shaking; and the steel spindle has an apparatus attached to its lower end, by which it can be fastened in a vertical position to the brass meridian, with its centre directly over the zenith point of the globe. The spindle being fixed firmly in this position, and the socket which is attached to the circular arch put on it, and so adjusted that the lower end of the arch just rests on and fits close to the horizon; it is evident that the altitude of any object above the horizon will be shewn by the degree which it intersects on this arch, and its azimuth by that end of the arch which rests on the horizon.\n\nBesides this improvement, Mr Smeaton proposes that, instead of fixing the hour index, as is usually done, on one end of the axis, it be placed in such a manner that its upper surface may move in the plane of the hour circle rather than above it. To effect this, he directs the extremity of the index to be filed off so as to form a circular arc, of the same radius with the inner edge of the hour circle, to which it is made to fit exactly, and a fine line is drawn in the middle of its upper surface, to point out the hour, instead of the tapering point usually employed. By this contrivance, if the hour circle be made four inches in diameter, the time may be shewn to half a minute. For a more particular account of Mr Smeaton's improvements, we refer the reader to the 79th volume of the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nAnother improvement of the celestial globe, by which it is better adapted to astronomical purposes, is described in the article ASTRONOMY, Vol. III. p. 178.\n\nBesides the modifications in the construction of globes, Adams's introduced by Mr Adams, and which have been already improved.\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples and Practice.\n\nready described, there are some others which we must briefly mention, respecting principally the placing the globe in an inclined position, and fitting it with a moveable or floating meridian and horizon.\n\nThe globes constructed after this manner do not hang in a frame like the ordinary globes, but are fixed on a pedestal, and supported by an axis which is inclined $66^\\circ$ to the ecliptic, and is of course always parallel to the axis of the earth, supposing the orbit of this planet to be parallel to the ecliptic. On the pedestal below the globe is a graduated circle, marked with the signs and degrees of the ecliptic; and adjoining to this is a circle of months and days, answering to every degree of the ecliptic; and within this is a third circle shewing the sun's declination for every day of the month. There is a moveable arm on the pedestal, which being set to the day of the month, immediately points out the sun's place and declination.\n\nRound the globe there is a circle representing the horizon of any place, and at right angles to this is fixed a semicircle, serving for a general meridian. The middle point of this semicircle serves to represent the situation of any inhabitant on the earth; for this purpose there is fixed a steel pin over the middle point of this semicircle.\n\nMr Adams alleges that only one supposition is necessary for performing every problem with this globe, namely, that a spherical luminous body will enlighten one half of a spherical opaque body, and consequently that a circle at right angles with the central solar ray, and dividing the globe in half, will be a terminator shewing the boundary of light and darkness for any given day. For this purpose, at the end of the moveable arm, opposite to the sun, there is a pillar, from the top of which projects a piece carrying a circle that surrounds the globe, dividing it into equal portions, and separating the illuminated from the dark parts; and $18^\\circ$ behind this there is another circle parallel to it, representing the limit of twilight.\n\nThere are two plates below the globe, which are turned by the diurnal revolution of the globe, each of them being divided into twice 12 hours, and on the outside being marked with the degrees of longitude corresponding to every hour; so that these circles give at sight the hour of the day at any two places on the globe, and the corresponding difference of longitude.\n\nThe celestial globe is mounted in a similar manner, except that it is fixed on the axis, and the ecliptic exactly coincides with the sun's apparent path from the earth.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Armillary Sphere.\n\nIf a machine be constructed that is composed only of the circles of the sphere, and made so as to revolve like a globe, a great many of the most useful problems relating to the heavenly bodies may be solved by it. An instrument of this kind is called an armillary sphere, and of these there are various forms. One of the most convenient is that contrived by the late Mr James Ferguson, and is thus described in his Lectures. It is represented at fig. 16.\n\nThe exterior parts of this machine are a compasses of brass rings, which represent the principal circles of the heaven, viz. 1. The equinoctial AA, which is divided into 360 degrees, (beginning at its intersection with the ecliptic in Aries) for shewing the sun's right ascension in degrees; and also into 24 hours, for shewing his right ascension in time. 2. The ecliptic BB, which is divided into 12 signs, and each sign into 30 degrees, and also into the months and days of the year, in such a manner, that the degrees or points of the ecliptic in which the sun is on any given day, stands over that day in the circle of months. 3. The tropic of Cancer CC, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Cancer in e; and the tropic of Capricorn DD, touching the ecliptic at the beginning of Capricorn in f; each $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees from the equinoctial circle. 4. The Arctic circle E, and the Antarctic circle F, each $23\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees from their respective poles at N and S. 5. The equinoctial colure GG, passing through the south and north poles of the heaven at N and S, and through the equinoctial points Aries and Libra, in the ecliptic. 6. The solstitial colure HH, passing through the poles of the heaven, and through the solstitial points Cancer and Capricorn, in the ecliptic. Each quarter of the former of these colures is divided into 90 degrees, from the equinoctial to the poles of the world, for shewing the declination of the sun, moon, and stars; and each quarter of the latter, from the ecliptic at e and f, to its poles b and d, for shewing the latitudes of the stars.\n\nIn the north pole of the ecliptic is a nut b, to which is fixed one end of a quadrantal wire, and to the other end a small pin Y, which is carried round the ecliptic BB, by turning the nut: and in the south pole of the ecliptic is a pin at d, on which is another quadrantal wire, with a small moon Z upon it, which may be moved round by hand; but there is a particular contrivance for causing the moon to move in an orbit which crosses the ecliptic at an angle of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ degrees, in two opposite points called the moon's nodes; and also for shifting these points backward in the ecliptic, as the moon's nodes shift in the heaven.\n\nWithin these circular rings is a small terrestrial globe I, fixed on the axis KK, which extends from the north and south poles of the globe at n and s, to those of the celestial sphere at N and S. On this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian LL, which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, and then turned round with the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated the same way as the brass meridian of a common globe, and its use is much the same. To this globe is fitted the moveable horizon MM, so as to turn upon two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe, and entering the globe at opposite points of its equator, which is a moveable brass ring let into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian LL. The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compasses, for shewing the amplitude of the sun and moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian LL, passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe; but here, if the globe be turned round, the horizon and the meridian turn with it. At the fourth pole\n\n---\n\n*Adams's Lectures, vol. iv. p. 195.*\nof the sphere is a circle of 24 hours, fixed to the rings, and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle, if the globe be turned round its axis.\n\nThe whole fabric is supported on a pedestal N, and may be elevated or depressed upon the joint O, to any number of degrees from 0 to 90, by means of the arc P, which is fixed into the strong brass arm Q, and slides in the upright piece R, in which is a screw at r, to fix it at any proper elevation.\n\nIn the box T are two wheels and two pinions, whose axes come out at V and U; either of which may be turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turned backward, the terrestrial globe, with its horizon and celestial meridian, keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from west, by south, to east; and bring the same points of the horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies come when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; shewing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour index goes round its hour circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour circle goes round below the index.\n\nAnd so, by this construction, the machine is equally fitted to shew either the real motion of the earth, or the apparent motion of the heaven.\n\nTo rectify the sphere for use, first slacken the screw r in the upright stem R, and taking hold of the arm Q, move it up or down until the given degree of latitude for any place be at the side of the stem R; and then the axis of the sphere will be properly elevated, so as to stand parallel to the axis of the world, if the machine be set north and south by a small compass; this done, count the latitude from the north pole upon the celestial meridian LL, downwards towards the north notch of the horizon, and set the horizon to that latitude; then turn the nut b until the sun Y comes to the given day of the year in the ecliptic, and the sun will be at its proper place for that day: find the place of the moon's ascending node, and also the place of the moon, by an Ephemeris, and set them right accordingly: lastly, turn the winch W, until either the sun comes to the meridian LL, or until the meridian comes to the sun (according as you want the sphere or the earth to move), and set the hour index to the XII marked noon, and the whole machine will be rectified. Then turn the winch, and observe when the sun or moon rise and set in the horizon, and the hour index will shew the times thereof for the given day.\n\nThose who have made themselves acquainted with the use of the globes, as described in the first and second sections of this chapter, will be at no loss to perform many problems respecting the motions of the heavenly bodies by means of this sphere.\n\nDr Long, some years ago, constructed an armillary sphere of glass, in Pembroke hall at Cambridge. It was 18 feet in diameter, and could contain below it more than 30 persons, fitting in such a manner without\n\nin the sphere, as to view from its centre the representation of the heavens drawn in its concavity. The lower part of the sphere, or that part which is not visible in the latitude of Britain, is wanting; and the whole apparatus is so contrived, that it may be turned round with as little exertion as is requisite to wind up a common jack. Dr Long has given a description of this sphere, accompanied with a figure, in his Astronomy.\n\nThe invention of the armillary sphere is thought by La Lande to be as ancient as that of astronomy itself. It has been attributed to Atlas, to Hercules, to Anaximander, and Mufius; while others have supposed that it originated in Egypt. The sphere of Archimedes, which became so celebrated, appears to have been something like that of Dr Long, as it was certainly composed of a globe of glass, which, besides containing the circles of the sphere, served as a planetarium, and represented the motions of the planets. Claudian has celebrated it in some beautiful lines. See Archimedes.\n\nA combination of the armillary sphere with a planetarium was constructed by the late Mr George Adams, and is figured in Plate XIII. fig. 1. of his Astronomical and Geographical Essays.\n\nChap. III. Of the Construction and Use of Maps and Charts.\n\nSect. I. Description of Maps and Charts.\n\nIt has been seen, that the surface of the earth may be delineated, in the most accurate manner, on the surface of maps and charts. This mode of delineation, however, can be employed only for the purpose of representing the general form and relative proportions of countries on a very confined scale; and is, besides, from its bulk and figure, not well suited to many of the purposes of the geographer. To obviate these inconveniences, recourse has been had to maps and charts, or delineations of the earth's surface on a plane; where the form and boundaries of the several countries, and the objects most remarkable in each, whether by sea or land, are represented according to the rules of perspective, so as to preserve the remembrance that they are parts of a spherical surface. In this way, the several countries or districts of the earth may be represented on a larger scale, and delineations of this kind admit of more easy reference.\n\nIn maps, the circles of the sphere, and the boundaries of the countries within them, are drawn as they would appear to an eye situated in some point of the sphere, or at a considerable distance above it. In maps of any considerable extent of country, the meridians and parallels of latitude are circular lines, but, if the map represents only a small district, as a province or county, those circles become so large, that they may, without any considerable error, be represented by straight lines. In charts, which are also called hydrographical maps, as they are representations rather of the water than land, the meridians and parallels are usually represented by straight lines, crossing each other at right angles, as in the smaller maps; and, in particular parts, there are drawn lines diverging from several points, in the direction of the points of the compass, in order to mark...\nthe bearings of particular places. In maps, the inland face of the country is chiefly regarded in the delineation; but in charts, which are designed for the purpose of navigation, the internal face of the land is left nearly blank, and only the sea-coast, with the principal objects on it, such as churches, light-houses, beacons, &c., are accurately delineated; while particular care is taken to mark the rocks, shoals, and quicksands in the sea, that may endanger the safety of vessels; the depths or foundings of the principal bays and harbours, and the direction of the winds, where these are stationary or peculiarly prevalent. Another distinction of maps and charts is, that in the former, the sea-coast is shaded on the side next the land, while, in the latter, it is shaded towards the sea.\n\nIn maps the upper side represents the north, the lower side the south; that on the right hand the east, and that on the left hand the west. All the margins of the map are graduated; the upper and lower showing the degrees of longitude, and the right and left margins the degrees of latitude. (See fig. 1, to which the reader must refer in going over the following description). If the map is on a small scale, only every ten degrees of longitude or latitude are marked on the margin; but, if the map is drawn on a large scale, every degree is numbered, and sometimes every half degree is marked with the number 30 in smaller figures. The space included between every ten degrees in small maps, or between every two degrees in those on a larger scale, is usually divided into ten spaces, which are alternately left blank, and marked with parallel lines, to denote the subdivisions of single degrees or minutes. Through every ten degrees of latitude a line is drawn, representing a parallel of latitude; and through every ten degrees of longitude, or at smaller intervals in each, where the size of the map will admit of it, there are drawn lines representing meridians. In some maps these lines are continued from side to side, or from top to bottom, across both sea and land; but in other maps, they are sometimes only drawn across the sea. The first meridian, however, and the principal circles of the sphere, as the equator, tropics, &c., should always be drawn directly across the map. In most maps, it is marked on the margins, whether the longitude is east or west, and the latitude north or south; but, if this is not marked, it may easily be known, by observing towards what part of the map the degrees increase. If the degrees of latitude increase from the lower to the upper part of the map, the country delineated lies in north latitude; but if they increase from above downwards, it lies in south latitude. Again, if the degrees of longitude increase towards the right, the countries are in east longitude; but if towards the left, they are in west longitude.\n\nThe principal objects that diversify the face of the country delineated in the map, such as rivers, mountains, forests, lakes, roads, cities, towns, forts, &c., are marked in such a manner, as that they may be most easily distinguished. A river is denoted by a black crooked line, drawn very fine towards the source or head of the river, and gradually becoming broader as it approaches towards the mouth; and the lesser rivers, or rivulets, which unite their waters with those of the principal stream, are denoted by similar lines appearing to branch off from the first.\n\nMountains are represented by the figures of little hills; and if these figures are placed in a row, they denote a ridge of mountains running across the land. If a mountain is a volcano, it is denoted in the map by the appearance of smoke issuing from its summit. Woods or forests are represented by a number of little trees or shrubs, placed in a group. Lakes are denoted by a circumscribed spot shaded with dark lines, and bays or estuaries by a more regular spot of the same kind, more lightly shaded, or, where the map is coloured, painted of a light green. Roads are represented in a map by two straight lines drawn parallel to each other, for the principal roads, or by a single straight line for the lesser or cross roads. Cities are denoted by a large house, or the figure of a church with the steeple in the middle; and if the city is the metropolis of the country, this is denoted by a white circular space in the middle of the house or church. Small towns are usually represented by circles; and where a small church with the steeple at one end occurs, it denotes a parish. Where the map is on a large scale, or represents only a small district, the towns are denoted by a group of small houses, or more commonly by a number of small shaded spots on each side of the road. A fort, castle, or fortified town, is denoted by a semicircular space surrounded by an angular edge representing battlements. The shoals upon the coast are represented by small dots; the depth of water in bays and harbours by figures, denoting the number of fathoms, among which is sometimes drawn the figure of an anchor, to show that in that place there is good anchorage for ships.\n\nThe boundaries or limits that divide countries from each other are distinguished in maps by dotted lines drawn round each country or district, in such a direction as to show its proper form. Where the map is coloured, the countries or districts are distinguished from each other by the side of the boundary next each being shaded by a different colour from that of the adjoining. Thus, in a map of Europe, the boundary of France may be shaded green, that of Spain red, that of Italy yellow, that of Germany blue, &c. In one corner of the map there is usually drawn a scale divided into a number of equal parts, by which the number of miles or leagues from one part of the map to another may be measured. Sometimes the parts into which the scale is divided are used to denote geographical miles, of 60 to a degree; but more commonly they correspond to the miles in use in the country where the map is made, as, in Britain, to British statute miles of 69\u00bd to a degree.\n\nTo mark more distinctly the bearings of different parts of the map, there is usually added in some blank space a circle with four radii, marking the four cardinal points of the compass; the north point being distinguished by the figure of a fleur de lis, and the east point by a cross.\n\nTill of late, the only distinction between the land and water in maps and charts, was afforded by the shading of the sea coast, as mentioned above. In this way, however, the eye cannot easily and expeditiously distinguish the form and extent of the land; and, where the shading is carried much beyond the boundary of the coast, as is often done, especially in engraving small islands, the land is made to appear much larger than it really is.\n\nThe ingenious Mr Wilson Lowry having lately contrived an instrument for engraving parallel straight lines, in a much more clear and commodious way\nthan could be done by the common graver, it occurred to Mr Pinkerton, while preparing his Modern Geography, that this invention might be applied with advantage to the improvement of maps. A set of maps was, accordingly engraved by Mr Lowry for Pinkerton's Geography, in which the water was marked by dark parallel lines to discriminate it from the land. These lines are drawn horizontally; and Mr Pinkerton proposed that, in engraving charts, the land should be marked with similar lines drawn in a perpendicular direction, while the water should be left blank. This improvement has since been adopted by other constructors of maps and charts, and bids fair to be generally used. The effect is pleasing; and the progress of instruction will be greatly facilitated by the new method, as the extent and bearings of the several countries are seen, as it were, with a glance of the eye. In many of these maps which we have seen, however, the lines are drawn too strongly, which renders the sea so dark, that the names of islands and places on the sea coast can with difficulty be perused. As the line of coast in these maps is strongly marked, the parallel lines denoting the sea should be engraved in a light and soft style; and in this way Mr Lowry's first specimens are executed.\n\nSect. II. Of the Construction of Maps and Charts.\n\nThe construction of maps consists in making a projection of the surface of the globe on the plane of some one of its circles, supposing the eye to be placed in some particular point. The describing of these projections depends on the principles of perspective, and the projection of the sphere. The general principles will be explained under those articles, but the particular mode of drawing maps properly forms a part of the present treatise.\n\nThe methods of constructing maps vary according to the size or scale of the map, and to the projection employed in constructing it.\n\nThere are three projections employed in constructing maps, the orthographic, the stereographic, and the globular. In the orthographic projection the eye is supposed to view the part of the globe to be projected, from an infinite distance. In this projection the parts about the middle of the map are very well represented, but those towards the margin are too much contracted.\n\nIn the stereographic projection, the eye is supposed to be situated in the surface of the globe to be represented, and looking towards the opposite surface. This is the method usually employed in constructing most maps, especially maps of the world, or hemispheres.\n\nIn constructing a map of the world, as well as most partial maps, the part of the sphere to be represented is supposed to be in the position of a right sphere (see No. 92). In this mode of projection, the hemisphere to be represented is supposed to be delineated on the plane of that meridian by which it is bounded, in the same manner as its concave surface, conceiving the sphere to be transparent, would appear to an eye placed in the opposite hemisphere, where the equator crosses a meridian; that is, 90\u00b0 distant from that which forms the plane of the projection. In a delineation of this kind, the meridians and parallels of latitude are represented by arches of circles, except the equator and the central meridian, which are straight lines; and each parallel or meridian forms an arc of a greater circle, in proportion as it approaches nearer to the centre of the map.\n\nBy either of these projections only half the globe can be represented in one projection; but in the map of the world, the two hemispheres are usually drawn on the plane of the same circle, adjacent to each other. By Mercator's projection, usually employed for charts, and to be described presently, the whole globe may be represented in one projection, but much distorted.\n\nIf the projection of a map of the world be formed on the plane of a meridian, the two projections will represent the eastern and western hemispheres of the globe.\n\nWhen the projection is made on the plane of the equator, in the situation of a parallel sphere, the projections represent the northern and southern hemispheres, which appear as their concave surface would be seen by an eye placed at the opposite pole. In this way the meridians become straight lines diverging from the same centre, and the parallels are circles having the same common centre.\n\nThe following is the method of constructing a map of the world, on the plane of a meridian, according to the globular projection. (See fig. 17).\n\nAbout the centre C, with any radius as CB, describe Globular a circle, representing the meridian that is to form the projection plane of the hemisphere. Draw the diameters NS, of a map of the world, and AB, crossing each other at right angles, and the former of these will be the central meridian, and the latter the equator. Divide each semidiameter into nine equal parts, and divide each quadrant of the circle also into nine equal parts, each of which will be equal to 11\u00b0. If the scale of the map be sufficiently large, each of these may again be divided into ten equal parts or degrees. The next object is to describe the meridians passing through every 10\u00b0 of the equator. Suppose we are to draw the meridian of 80\u00b0 west of Greenwich. We have here three points given, the two poles and the point 80\u00b0 on the equator, and it is easy to describe a circle that shall pass through these three points. This arch will be the meridian. The method of drawing a circle through any three points is, in this case, as follows. About the centre S, with the radius SC, describe a circular arch, as XX; and about the centre N, with the same radius, describe the arch ZZ; then about the centre 80\u00b0, with the same distance, describe arches 1, 1, 2, 2, crossing the former, and draw lines from 2 to 1 on each side of AB, crossing each other, and AB produced, in D. D is the centre of the circular arc, representing the meridian of 80\u00b0 west from Greenwich; and with the same radius the meridian of 140\u00b0 west longitude may be drawn. All the other meridians are to be drawn in a similar manner, by describing a circular arch through three points N, S, and the required degree. (See Geometry.)\n\nFor describing the parallels, suppose that of 60\u00b0 N. Lat.; about the centre O, with any radius, describe the circle FGH, and about the points 60\u00b0, 60\u00b0, in the primitive circle, with the same distance, describe the arcs cc, dd, cutting the circle FGH; through the points of intersection draw straight lines, and the point where these lines meet in NS produced, as in I, is the centre of the arch that will represent the parallel of 60\u00b0. The other parallels are drawn in a similar manner, observing that the first circle, such as FGH, must have for its centre that point in the central meridian through which the parallel is to be drawn. Fig. 18. represents this projection.\nIf the map is very large, and the paper on which it is to be drawn does not admit of so many circles, the centres of the meridians and parallels are more easily found in the following manner. Having divided the semi-diameters and quadrants, each into 9 equal parts, find, from a scale of equal parts, the length of the half chord of each arc, and the versed sine of half the same arc; then add together the square of the half chord, and the square of the versed sine, and divide the sum by the versed sine; the quotient is equal to the diameter, and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of this to the radius of the circle required. In this manner the radii of all the meridians and parallels may be found.\n\nAs, in drawing maps on a large scale, compasses of an ordinary size will not answer for describing the circular arcs, it is convenient to have some other mechanical contrivance for this purpose; and it is found that a thin flexible ruler of tough wood, called a bow, may be bent as to form a curve, very nearly circular, that will pass through the three points that are to determine the meridian or parallel. In this way the circles on maps on a large scale are usually drawn by engravers and students of geography; and where the circle is of very large radius, the method is sufficiently accurate; but it ought by no means to be employed where compasses of a proper size can be procured, or conveniently used.\n\nThe following is the method given by Dr Hutton, for describing a globular projection of the earth on the plane of the equator. For the north or south hemispheres draw AQBE, for the equinoctial (fig. 19.), dividing it into the four quadrants EA, AQ, QB, and BE; and each quadrant into 9 equal parts, representing each 10\u00b0 of longitude; and then from the points of division, draw lines to the centre C, for the circles of longitude. Divide any circle of longitude, as the first meridian EC, into 9 equal parts, and through these points describe circles from the centre C, for the parallels of latitude, numbering them as in the figure. In this method equal spaces on the earth are represented by equal spaces on the map, as nearly as any projection will bear; for a spherical surface can in no way be represented exactly upon a plane. Then the several countries of the world, seas, islands, sea-coasts, towns, &c. are to be entered in the map, according to their latitudes and longitudes.\n\nTo draw a Map of any particular Country.\n\nThere are three methods of doing this.\n\n1st. For this purpose its extent must be known as to latitude and longitude; as suppose Spain, lying between the north latitudes 36\u00b0 and 44\u00b0, and extending from 10\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 of longitude, so that its extent from north to south is 8\u00b0, and from east to west 13\u00b0.\n\nDraw the line AB for a meridian passing through the middle of the country (fig. 20.), on which let off 8\u00b0 from B to A, taken from any convenient scale; A being the north and B the south point. Through A and B draw the perpendiculars CD, EF, for the extreme parallels of latitude. Divide AB into eight parts, or degrees, through which draw the other parallels of latitude parallel to the former.\n\nFor the meridians, divide any degree in AB into 60 equal parts, or geographical miles. Then, because the length in each parallel decreases towards the pole, take the number of miles answering to the latitude of B, which is 43\u00b0 nearly, and set it from B, seven times to E, and fix times to F; so is EF divided into degrees. Again, from the same table take the number of miles of a degree in the latitude A, viz. 43\u00b0 nearly; which set off from A, seven times to C, and fix times to D. Then from the points of division in the line CD, to the corresponding points in the line EF, draw so many right lines for the meridians. Number the degrees of latitude up both sides of the map, and the degrees of longitude on the top and bottom. Also in some vacant place make a scale of miles, or of degrees, if the map represent a large part of the earth; to serve for finding the distances of places upon the map.\n\nThen make the proper divisions and subdivisions of the country; and having the latitudes and longitudes of the principal places, it will be easy to set them down in the map; for any town, &c. must be placed where the circles of its latitude and longitude intersect. For instance, Gibraltar, whose latitude is 36\u00b0 11', and longitude 12\u00b0 27', will be at G; and Madrid, whose latitude is 40\u00b0 10', and longitude 14\u00b0 44', will be at M. In the same manner the mouth of a river may be set down; but to describe the whole course of the river, the latitude and longitude of every turning, and of the towns and bridges by which it passes, must also be marked down. The same is necessary for woods, forests, mountains, lakes, castles, &c. The boundaries are described by setting down the remarkable places on the sea coast, and drawing a continued line through them all. This method is very proper for small countries.\n\n2nd Method. Maps of particular places are but portions of the globe, and may therefore be drawn in the same manner as the whole globe, either by the orthographic or stereographic projection of the sphere. But in partial maps a more easy method is as follows. Having drawn the meridian AB in the last figure, and divided it into equal parts as before, draw lines through all the points of division; put them together to AB, to represent the parallels of latitude. Then to divide these, set off the degrees in each parallel; diminish after the manner directed for the two extreme parallels CD and EF, and through all the corresponding points draw the meridians, which will be curved lines; these were right lines in the last method, because only the extreme parallels were divided according to the table. This method is proper for a large tract, as Europe, &c. in which case the parallels and meridians need be drawn only through every 5\u00b0 or 10\u00b0. This method is much used in drawing maps, as all the parts are nearly of their due magnitude, except being a little distorted towards the outside, from the oblique intersection of the meridians and parallels.\n\n3rd Method. Draw PB of a convenient length, for a meridian; divide it into nine equal parts, and through the points of division, describe as many circles for the parallels of latitude, from the centre P, which represents the pole. Suppose AB (fig. 21.) the height of the map; then CD will be the parallel passing through the greatest latitude, and EF will represent the equator. Divide the equator EF into 9 equal parts of the same size as those in AB, both ways beginning AR; divide\nPrinciples divide also all the parallels into the same number of equal parts, but lesser, in proportion to the numbers for the several latitudes, as directed in the last method for the rectilineal parallels. Then through all the corresponding divisions draw curved lines, which will represent the meridians, the extreme meridians being EC and FD. Lastly, Number the degrees of latitude and longitude, and place a scale of equal parts, either in miles or degrees, for measuring distances.\n\nWhen the place of which a map is to be made is but small, as when a county is to be delineated, the meridians will be so nearly parallel to one another, and the whole will differ so little from a plane, that the map may be laid down in a much more easy manner than what is given above. It will be here sufficient to measure the distances of places in miles, and note them down in a plane rectangular manner. The method of delineating such partial maps is the province of the surveyor. See Surveying.\n\nMercator's projection is chiefly confined to charts for the purposes of navigation. In this projection the meridians, parallels, and rhumbs, are all straight lines; but instead of the degrees of longitude being everywhere equal to those of latitude, as is the case in plain charts, the degrees of latitude are increased as we approach towards either pole, being made to those of longitude in the proportion of radius to the sine of the distance from the pole, or cosine of the latitude, or, what is the same thing, in the ratio of the secant of the latitude to radius. Hence all the parallel circles are represented by equal and parallel straight lines, and all the meridians are parallel lines also; but these increase indefinitely towards the poles.\n\nFrom this proportional increase of the degrees of the meridian, it is evident that the length of an arc of the meridian beginning at the equator, is proportional to the sum of all the secants of the latitude; or that the increased meridian bears the same proportion to its true arc as the sum of all the secants of the latitude to as many times the radius. The increased meridian is also analogous to a scale of the logarithmic tangents, though this is not at first very evident. It is not certain by whom this analogy was first discovered, but the discovery appears to have been made by accident. It was first published and introduced into the practice of navigation by Mr Henry Bond, by whom this property is mentioned in an edition of Norwood's Epitome of Navigation, printed about 1645. This analogy, though it had been found true by actual measurement, was not accurately demonstrated. Nicholas Mercator offered to disclose, for a sum of money, a method which he had discovered for demonstrating it; but this was not accepted, and the demonstration was, we believe, never disclosed. See Nicholas Mercator. About two years after, however, the demonstration was again discovered, and published by James Gregory.\n\nThe meridian line in Mercator's chart is a scale of logarithmic tangents of the half colatitudes. The differences of longitude on any rhumb, are the logarithms of the same tangents, but of a different species; those species being to each other as the tangents of the angles made with the meridian. Hence any scale of logarithmic tangents is a table of the differences of longitude, to several latitudes, upon some one determinate rhumb; and therefore as the tangent of the angle of such a rhumb is to the tangent of any other rhumb, so is the difference of the logarithms of any two tangents, to the difference of longitude on the proposed rhumb, intercepted between the two latitudes, of whose half complements the logarithmic tangents were taken.\n\nIt was the great study of our predecessors to contrive such a chart in plano, with straight lines, on which all or any parts of the world might be truly let down, according to their longitudes and latitudes, bearings, and distances. A method for this purpose was hinted at by Ptolemy, near 2000 years since, and a general map in such an idea, was made by Mercator: but the principles were not demonstrated, and a ready way thrown of describing the chart, till Wright explained how to enlarge the meridian line by the continual addition of secants, so that all degrees of longitude might be proportional to those of latitude, as on the globe; which renders this chart, in several respects, far more convenient for the navigator's use, than the globe itself, and which will truly shew the course and distance from place to place, in all cases of sailing.\n\nFor further particulars respecting the construction, and for the use of charts, see Navigation.\n\nIn choosing maps, it is proper to examine particularly whether the curved lines of those that ought to have the meridians and parallels arches of circles be truly circular. If the map is composed of more than one sheet, the sheets should be so joined together as that the corresponding meridional lines and parallels be each in one continued line. The colours in painted maps, as was observed with respect to globes, should be fine and transparent, and not laid on too thickly.\n\nMaps folded for the pocket answer very well for travelling, in so far as they point out the relative situation of places; but, owing to the intervals at which the parts are pasted on the canvas, the distances between places cannot be ascertained with any degree of accuracy.\n\nSect. III. Of the Use of Maps.\n\nMaps are of great utility in the study of geography and history; and if they are accurately drawn, many of the problems that are usually performed on the globes, may be solved mechanically by means of maps.\n\nIn consulting a map, it is not sufficient to find out in it the name of the place of which you desire to know the situation, although this is frequently all at which the consultor of a map aims: it is, besides, proper for the student to inform himself respecting the relative position of the place, with regard to its vicinity to other places; its bearings and distance from the principal places in the same or neighbouring districts; whether it is near the sea shore, and is near a convenient harbour; whether it be seated on some principal river, and on what side of the river; whether it is in the neighbourhood of a considerable canal; whether it be near a lake, mountain, forest, &c. and many other little particulars that will readily suggest themselves to an attentive reader.\n\nThe problems that are usually performed by means of maps, are the following.\n\nProblem I. To find the latitude and longitude of any given place.\n\nIn maps on a large scale, or where the meridians and parallels of latitude are straight lines, the latitude of the place\nPart II.\n\nProblem III. The latitude of a place being given; to find all those places on the same map that have the same latitude.\n\nIf a parallel of latitude happen to be drawn on the map through the given place, this problem is easily solved, by tracing along the parallel, and seeing what other places it passes through. If a parallel is not drawn through the given place, take with a pair of compasses the distance of the place from the nearest parallel; then keeping one foot on the parallel, and the other in such a position as to describe a line parallel to the parallel of latitude, move the compasses, and all the places over which the point that is not on the parallel passes, have the same latitude with the given place.\n\nThis method will not succeed in maps on which a large tract of country is delineated on a small scale.\n\nProblem IV. Given the longitude of a place; to find on the map all those places that have the same longitude.\n\nFind the longitude of the given place, and if a meridian passes through it, observe all the places that lie under this meridian; or, if a meridian does not pass through the place, find by the compasses, as in the last problem, those places that are situated at the same parallel distance with the given place from the nearest meridian. These places have nearly the same longitude with the given place.\n\nProblem V. To find the anteci of a given place.\n\nFind the latitude and longitude of the place by Problem I, and find another place of the same longitude, whose latitude is equal to that of the former, but in a contrary direction. The inhabitants of this latter place are the anteci to the latter.\n\nEx. Suppose a ship to be in the Indian ocean, in Lat. 13\u00b0 S. and long. 80\u00b0 E., it is required to find the anteci to her present situation? Ans. The place which has nearly the same longitude, and an equal latitude in a contrary direction, viz. 13\u00b0 N., is Madras.\n\nProblem VI. To find the peri\u00e6ci of a given place.\n\nFind the longitude of the given place, and subtract it from 180\u00b0; the remainder will be the longitude in an opposite direction of the peri\u00e6ci. Then find a place having an equal longitude with this last, and having the same latitude with that of the given place: this latter is the situation required.\n\nEx. It is required to find the peri\u00e6ci to the inhabitants of the gulf of Siam. Ans. The longitude of Siam is 106\u00b0 50' E., which, subtracted from 180\u00b0, leaves 74\u00b0 10' W. Now, the place that has this longitude, and the same latitude with Siam, viz. about 14\u00b0 N., is the isthmus of Darien.\n\nProblem VII. To find the antipodes of a given place.\n\nThis problem is solved on maps in the same manner as on the globe.\n\nProblem VIII. Having the hour at any place given; to find what hour it is in any part of the world.\n\nFind the difference of longitude between the two places, and reduce this to its equal value in time, by\nAdd this value to the given hour, if the place where the time is required be to the eastward of the given place, and the sum is the time required. If the place at which the time is required lie to the westward of the given place, subtract the difference of longitude in time from the given hour, and the difference is the time sought.\n\nNote.\u2014If, after adding, the sum is found greater than 12, 12 must be cancelled, and the hours must be changed from A.M. to P.M. and vice versa; and if, on subtracting, the difference in time between the two places happens to be greater than the given hour, 12 must be added to the given hour, and the hours changed as before mentioned.\n\nEx. Suppose it to be at present 9 A.M. at Lisbon, what time of the day is it at Pekin in China? Ans. The difference of longitude between Pekin and Lisbon is 12\u00b0 33', which reduced to time gives 8 hours 22 minutes; and since Pekin lies to the east of Lisbon, this must be added to 9, the given hour, giving a sum of 17 hours, 22 minutes; but as this is greater than 12, we must take 12 away, and the difference, 5 hours 22 minutes, changed from morning to afternoon hours, is the time required. It is therefore 22 minutes past five P.M. at Pekin.\n\nProblem IX. To find those places in the torrid zone to which the sun is vertical on any given day.\n\nFind in an ephemeris, or nautical almanack, the sun's declination for the given day; then observe, in the map of the world, all those places which lie under that parallel of latitude, which is the same with the declination, and these will be the places required.\n\nEx. It is required to find at what places the sun will be vertical on the 20th of March and 23rd of September? Ans. The sun's declination on the 20th of March, is 19\u00b0 S. and on the 23rd of September 6\u00b0 N. Now the principal places that lie near the parallel of 19\u00b0 S. and 6\u00b0 N. are the island of St Thomas, the middle part of the islands of Sumatra and Borneo; the Galapagos islands, and Quito in South America.\n\nThe Analemma, or Orthographic Projection delineated in Plate CCXXXV, will solve many of the most curious problems, and with the affluence of maps will be almost equivalent to a terrestrial globe. The parallel lines drawn on this figure represent the degrees of the sun's declination from the equator, whether north or south, amounting to 23\u00b0 nearly. On these lines are marked the months and days which correspond to such and such declinations. The size of the figure does not admit of having every day of the year inserted; but by making allowance for the intermediate days, in proportion to the rest, the declination may be guessed at with tolerable exactness. The elliptical lines are designed to show the hour of sunrise or sunsetting before or after six o'clock. As 60 minutes make an hour of time, a fourth part of the space between each of the hour-lines will represent 15 minutes; which the eye can readily guess at, and which is as great exactness as can be expected from any mechanical invention, or as is necessary to answer any common purpose. The circles drawn round the centre at the distance of 11\u00bd each, show the point of the compass on which the sun rises and sets, and on what point the twilight begins and ends.\n\nIn order to make use of this analemma, it is only necessary to consider, that, when the latitude of the place and the sun's declination are both north or both south, the sun rises before six o'clock, between the east and the elevated pole; that is, towards the north, if the latitude and declination are north; or towards the south, if the latitude and declination are south. Let us now suppose it is required to find the time of the sun's rising and setting, the length of the days and nights, the time when the twilight begins and ends, and what point of the horizon the sun rises and sets on, for the Lizard point in England, Frankfort in Germany, or Abbeville in France, on the 30th of April. The latitude of these places by the maps will be found nearly 50\u00b0 N. Place the moveable index so that its point may touch 50\u00b0 on the quadrant of north latitude in the figure; then observe where its edge cuts the parallel line on which April 30th is written. From this reckon the hour-lines towards the centre, and you will find that the parallel line is cut by the index nearly at the distance of one hour and 15 minutes. So the sun rises at one hour 15 minutes before six, or 45 minutes after four in the morning, and sets 15 minutes after seven in the evening. The length of the day is 14 hours 30 minutes. Observe how far the intersection of the edge of the index with the parallel of April 30th is distant from any of the concentric circles, which you will find to be a little beyond that marked two points of the compass, and this shows that on the 30th of April the sun rises two points and somewhat more from the east towards the north, or a little to the northward of east-north-east, and sets a little to the northward of west-north-west. To find the beginning and ending of the twilight, take from the graduated arch of the circle 17\u00bd degrees with a pair of compasses; move one foot of the compasses extended to this distance along the parallel of April 30th, till the other just touches the edge of the index, which must still point at 50. The place where the other foot rests on the parallel of April 30th, then denotes the number of hours before six at which the twilight begins. This is somewhat more than three hours and a half, which shows that the twilight then begins soon after two in the morning, and likewise that it begins to appear near five points from the east towards the north. The uses of this analemma may be varied in a great number of ways; but the example just now given will be sufficient for the ingenious reader.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Origin and Progress of Maps.\n\nThe first map of which we have any certain record, Origin of is that of Anaximander, about 560 years before the maps. Christian era. This is mentioned by Strabo, book i. and is supposed to be that referred to by Hipparchus, under the name of the ancient map.\n\nIt has been alleged, that Sesostris, king of Egypt, on his return from his boasted expedition, after having traversed great part of the earth, recorded his march in maps, of which he gave copies, not only to the Egyptians, but to the Scythians, to the great admiration of both people. This is the relation of Eutocius; but M. Montucla considers it as a very improbable story, * Montucla, and thinks that the invention of maps cannot be dated Hift de prior to Anaximander *. Some have supposed that the Mathemat Jews laid down the holy land in a map, when they dif- tom. iv. tributed p. 589.\nAn Analemma, showing the time of Sun rising & Sun setting, the length of the Days & Nights, and the point of the Compass on which the Sun rises & sets, for every Degree of Latitude, and for every Degree of the Sun's North & South declination.\n\nFor this Scale the North Latitude of the Place is to be found.\n\nHours of Sunrising after Six in North Latitude.\n\nHours of Sunrising before Six in North Latitude.\n\nSept. 21, Mar. 22,\nSept. 26, Mar. 13,\nOct. 5, Mar. 7,\nOct. 10, Feb. 20,\nOct. 15, Feb. 22,\nOct. 22, Feb. 15,\nNov. 2, Feb. 11,\nNov. 9, Jan. 24,\nNov. 20, Jan. 12,\nDec. 21,\n\nFeb. 21, July 24,\nFeb. 26, July 19,\nMar. 26, Sep. 22,\nMar. 30, Aug. 18,\nApr. 22, Aug. 10,\nApr. 15, Aug. 26,\nApr. 8, Sep. 27,\nApr. 1, Sep. 9,\nMar. 26, Sep. 22,\nMar. 30, Aug. 18,\n\nN Pole\n\nS Pole\n\nR. Bell, Prin. W. A. Sculptor fecit.\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples tributed the different portions to the nine tribes at Shiloh; a supposition which is derived from Joshua's account, that they were sent to walk through the land, and that they described it in seven parts in a book. Josephus also relates, that when Joshua sent people from the different tribes to measure the land of promise, he sent with them men well skilled in geometry. All this, however, is no proof that these persons drew a sketch of the country, according to our idea of a map; but probably only wrote down, for the satisfaction of their employers, the extent, boundaries, and general characteristics of the divisions of the land.\n\nHerodotus has given a minute description of a map constructed by Artafergos, tyrant of Miletus, an abridgement of which will serve to give some notion of the maps of those times. It was drawn upon brass or copper, and seems to have been merely an itinerary containing the route through the countries which were to be traversed in a march which Artaragos proposed to Cleomenes, king of Sparta, for the purpose of attacking the king of Perilla at Sufa, that he might thus assist in restoring the Ionians to their liberty. The rivers Halys, Euphrates, and Tigris, which, according to Herodotus, must have been crossed in that expedition, were laid down in this map; and it contained one straight line, called the royal road or highway, which comprehended all the stations or places of encampment, from Sardis, the beginning of the route, to Sufa, a distance of 13,500 stadia, or 1687\u00bd Roman miles of 5000 feet each. The number of encampments in this whole route was 111.\n\nPtolemy of Alexandria, the celebrated geographer mentioned in No. 21, constructed maps to illustrate his description of places, and these are the first that have regular meridians and parallels, the better to define and determine the situation of places. Ptolemy acknowledges that his maps, with the addition of some improvements of his own, the principal of which was certainly the introduction of meridians and parallels, were copied from previous maps made by Marius Tyrius, &c. They are, however, often very inaccurate.\n\nAccording to Athenaeus, a work which seems to have contained maps, was written by Baetion, under the title of Alexander's march; and a work on the same subject is mentioned as the production of Amyntus. We are informed by Pliny, that this Baetion was one of the surveyors of Alexander's marches; and he quotes the exact number of miles of these marches, according to Baetion's mensuration, and confirms their authenticity by the letters of Alexander. Pliny also remarks, that a copy of this conqueror's surveys was given by Zenobius, his treasurer, to the geographer Patrocles, who was admiral of the fleets of Seleucus and Antiochus.\n\nAmong the most celebrated of the ancient maps, are the Peutingerian tables, so called, because published by Peutinger of Augsburg. These tables contain an itinerary of the whole Roman empire; all places except seas, wood, and deserts, being laid down according to their measured distances, though without any mention of latitude, longitude, or bearing. A particular description of this monument of antiquity is given in the 18th volume of the History of the Academy of Inscriptions, and in the History of the Academy of Sciences for 1761, from which M. Montucla has drawn up the following account. The map of Peutinger, as it is in the original in the imperial library, is exactly one French foot in height, and 20 feet eight inches in length, according to measures taken by Buache, from a copy of the splendid edition given by Scheele in 1753. It comprehends the whole extent of the Roman empire, from Constantinople to the ocean, and from the shores of Africa to the northern parts of Gaul; but the table which it affords of this vast extent of country is by no means calculated to give us an idea of its figure, since the 35\u00b0 of longitude which it comprehends, occupy 20 feet 8 inches, while the 13\u00b0 of latitude are comprised within the space of one foot; thus the countries represented are so disfigured, that the Mediterranean appears only like a broad river, and all the countries are distorted, towards the north and south, that they cannot be recognised.\n\nMost of those who have seen this ancient map, have considered it as the rude and bungling work of a man little conversant with geography, and still less so with mathematics; but Edmund Brutz considers the distortion of this map as similar to what we see in some pieces of perspective, and that it ought to be examined from some certain near point in order to perceive the objects in their natural proportion.\n\nBuache supposed long ago, that this map was constructed with more scientific skill than it appears to be at the first glance; and that the apparent irregularities which we observe in it, might have been introduced designedly, for the purpose of deriving greater advantages as to what was intended for the principal object. In fact, as the Roman routes extended almost entirely from east to west, they paid more attention to the measures in this direction than those between north and south; and the map in this way might have had the greater convenience of being more easily rolled up, and consequently more portable.\n\nThus far Buache hazarded no more than conjecture; but a labour undertaken by him with a very different view, led him to the true design of the map of Peutinger. He had been tracing a scale of climates, and of the length of the days and nights, for the purpose of attaching it to small maps of the different countries of Europe. As the space occupied by the scale was pretty much extended in height, but had very little breadth, he formed the idea of drawing a kind of map upon two scales, one pretty much extended for the latitudes, and the other very much contracted for the longitudes, preserving the hollows of the coasts and boundaries of each state. As this disposition of his map strangely disfigured the countries which it was intended to represent, he was led to imagine that this map might be the reverse of that of Peutinger. This was sufficient to engage him to construct another map upon the same principle; but in which the scale of longitudes was much greater than that of the latitudes. He then saw that he had been right in his supposition, and that the map which he had last constructed had a considerable resemblance to that of Peutinger. This latter is in fact only a plain chart, constructed upon two scales, of which that of the longitudes is very great, and that of the latitudes much smaller.\n\nOne difficulty alone arose. By supposing that he observed in this map a custom at present established among geographers, of representing the meridians by lines drawn perpendicular to the base of the chart, and the parallels...\nPrinciples parallels to the equator by straight lines drawn parallel to this same base, Buache found a considerable error. The bottom of the gulf of Venice and Rome did not then appear, as they ought to do, under the same meridian. He soon, however, saw the solution of this difficulty. The method of drawing the meridians parallel to the sides of the chart, is a matter of pure agreement, and had probably not been observed in the map of which we are speaking. The ancient Roman geographers having considered that Italy was naturally divided by the Apennines, according to its length, into two parts that were nearly equal, had therefore delineated the length of Italy from Trent to the end of the peninsula, parallel to the lower margin of the map, and had afterwards arranged the other parts which the map was to contain, conformably to this disposition; and as the length of Italy is not in a direction parallel to the equator, it would happen necessarily that the meridians and parallels, if they had been drawn on this map, would have been parallel neither to the sides nor to the lower margins of the map, and that the vertical line passing through Rome must intersect the gulf of Venice at about the middle; but this line is not a meridian.\n\nThus, this map is not so rude a work as has been imagined, but has been entirely constructed according to rule; and it even appears that the author had employed pretty good materials in its compilation, as the positions are laid down in a manner that differs little from modern observations.\n\nFrom the time of Ptolemy till about the 14th century, no new maps were published; and the first maps of any esteem among the moderns were constructed by Mercator, to whom we are indebted for the projection according to which marine charts are constructed. Mercator was followed by Ortelius, who undertook to construct a new set of maps with the modern divisions of countries and names of places, for want of which the maps of Ptolemy were become almost useless. After Mercator and Ortelius, many others published maps, which were chiefly copied from those above mentioned, till about the middle of the 17th century, when Blaeu published his large atlas, or Cosmographie blaviane, in which is a pretty accurate description of the earth, the sea, and the heavens, comprised in 12 folio volumes. About the same time an atlas in two folio volumes was published in France by M. Sanfon, the maps of which are in general very correct, containing many improvements of the travellers of those times. The maps of Blaeu and Sanfon were copied with little variation both in England, France, and Holland, till from later observations De Lille, Robert, Wall, &c., published still more accurate and copious sets of maps.\n\nThe works of recent travellers and navigators have considerably improved the construction and accuracy of our maps and charts; but there is still much to be done, especially with respect to trigonometrical surveys, before any high degree of correctness can be acquired. Among the latest maps and charts, those constructed by Mr Arrowmith are in the greatest estimation.\n\nAs a collection of good and accurate maps is of the greatest importance in the study of geography and history, we shall here subjoin a list of some of the best modern maps that have been published.\n\nThose maps which may be collected for the purpose of forming an atlas, have been arranged under three heads, according to their size, or the extent of their scale. 1st, Those which consist of more than five sheets, such as De Bouge's map of Europe in 50 half sheets, and Cassini's map of France in 183 sheets. 2ndly, Those from five to four sheets, to which also belong several maps of kingdoms.

Specimens of a similar nature occur in the western islands of Scotland. There is also a species of porphyry nearly allied to hornblende.\n\nThe two varieties last mentioned are rich in metallic ores; in the former there being formed ores of silver, copper, iron, lead, and antimony; and, in the latter, sparry iron ore, native sulphuret of iron, galena, black blende, and ores of bismuth.\n\nA stone of a porphyritic nature is described by Werner under the name of Schiffose porphyry, and is considered by Kirwan as the same with the horn slate of Charpentier. It is found among the primitive rocks of Altai, and on the borders of the lake of Baikal, in which latter place it is mixed with granite and hornblende. It is also found in Siberia, and in Bohemia. Sauflure found it near Pfaffensprung, intercepted between strata of gneiss.\n\nSect. XII. Puddingstone and Breccia.\n\nThe distinction between these two stony matters was mentioned in note c: they are both sufficiently common, consisting of different materials. The breccia usually lies in bodies, almost at the top of the other primitive strata, with some of which it sometimes alternates. Stratified breccias, consisting of fragments of flints and jasper, cemented by hardened clay, are frequently found in Siberia, and sometimes alternate strata of breccia, porphyry, jasper, and other primary compounds, compose a considerable part of mountains. Some mountains in the north of Scotland contain masses of breccia, composed of fragments of red granite, micaceous schistus, and quartz, in a bale of sandstone. Mount Scaramba contains strata of this kind, surmounted by a rock of white quartz. Similar appearances take place at Cromarty, at Murray frith, and two or three miles to the south of Aberdeen; but in many of these instances the breccia must be considered as secondary. Much of the northern coast of Scotland abounds with breccia.\n\nPuddingstone is also extremely common. A mountain of it is found in Siberia, near the rivulet of Tula, being composed of fragments of jasper, chalcedony, aigue marine, and cornelian, cemented by a quartzose matter. Immense heaps, and even a mountain of puddingstone, are found at Meilenheim, in the palatinate. Puddingstone is found in considerable abundance in passing from Loch Ness to Oban, in Scotland, and between Inverness and Dunolla. Large detached rocks of puddingstone were seen by Pallas in the village of Temirdiki, in the Crimea. Some of these masses are seven or eight fathoms long, lying one above another.\n\nSect. XIII. Sienite.\n\nThis name has been introduced by Werner, to denote a primary rock, essentially composed of grains of feldspar and hornblende, intimately blended together, in which the hornblende is generally most predominant. He first called it greenstone, but afterwards gave it the name of sienite, as he supposed it similar to a stone described by Pliny, as found at Syene in Upper Egypt, where it was dug in great quantities, and from thence carried to Rome, for the purpose of building public edifices.\n\nSienite sometimes contains a few grains of quartz and mica; but these seem to be accidental, and are always in very small quantity. This stone is not commonly stratified.\n\nSienite usually overlays most of the other primary rocks, and has often a bed of breccia interposed between it and the inferior strata. It is very commonly found repaying on porphyry.\n\nIt is found in Saxony, in the environs of Dresden, at Meilen in Thuringia; in Hungary, and in general in almost all primitive chains of mountains, especially in the Alps. It is doubtless the same which Sauflure found in the summit of Mont Blanc, and which he calls granitelle.\n\nMetallic veins are not unfrequently found in sienite. At Scharfenberg, veins of silver and lead are found init; and it is said, that the veins of Strontian in Argyleshire run in a similar rock.\n\nSect. XIV. Primitive or Granular Limestone.\n\nIt was long doubted whether limestone was ever to be found unmixed with organic remains, or primitive limestone, but the observations of late mineralogists and geologists have fully proved, that primitive limestone exists in considerable quantity. This stone is of a granular structure, and of a whitish gray colour, though frequently of a dark iron gray, or reddish brown. It is sometimes scaly or lamellar; at others nearly compact, and is now and then found to have a splintery fracture. It is generally unmixied with other primary compounds; but sometimes particles of mica, quartz, hornblende, &c., occur in it.\n\nThis stone is always found alternating with the primitive strata, especially with gneiss, micaceous, and argillaceous schistus. It sometimes forms whole mountains, as in Stiria, Carinthia, and Carniola, in Switzerland and in the Pyrenees, being often found seven or eight thousand feet high. Three mountains in Switzerland, all exceeding 10,000 feet in height, are chiefly composed of it. In these situations it commonly forms immense blocks, without any regular dip or direction; but it is sometimes stratified, as at Altenberg near the lake of Neuenberg. It is sometimes interposed between sienite and hornblende slate. One of the most singular mountains of granular limestone is that of Filabres in Spain, consisting of a block of white marble three miles in circumference, and 2000 feet high, without any mixture of other earths or stones, and with scarcely any fissure.\n\nA considerable part of Mont Perdu in the Pyrenees is composed of alternate vertical bands of granite, porphyry, limestone, hornblende, and petrolium.\n\nGranular limestone is found in various parts of Britain, especially in the north of Scotland. One of the most remarkable examples of it occurs in the island of May.\nArrange- Islay; the central part of which is formed of a compactment, &c., of the Ma- bed of it of considerable extent. See fig. 4. d. It also terials of the Earth. occurs in some other of the Western Isles.\n\nPrimitive limestone often contains veins of metallic ore, especially those of galena, magnetic iron ore, blende, and pyrites.\n\nSect. XV. Primitive Trap.\n\nTrap is a name that was long ago given by the Swedish mineralogists, to distinguish certain stones that are of a compact texture, and a dark colour, composing part of several mountains. The word originally signifies a flatcafe, and was given to mountains containing this stone, because their strata retire one behind the other like the steps of a flatcafe. But as many rocks of a very different kind, both in their nature and formation, have received the common name of trap, considerable confusion arose among mineralogists, with respect to what particular stones should receive this appellation. Most of the French mineralogists, as Sauvire, Dolo- mieu and Saintfond make trap to signify a primitive rock, but they do not always mean the same rock. Other mineralogists, especially the Germans, understand by the name of trap, certain secondary rocks, and especially what are commonly called basalts.\n\nWerner comprehends under the name of trap, several series of rocks, which are principally characterized by their containing hornblende, which is found almost pure in those which he considers as the most ancient, or what generally lie the lowest; and it degenerates gradually into the succeeding strata into a kind of blackish, ferruginous, hardened clay. He distinguishes three series or formations of traps; primitive traps, transition or intermediate traps, and stratiform or floetz traps. We shall here consider the first of these.\n\nPrimitive trap is almost wholly composed of hornblende, though it is sometimes mixed with feldspar, or more rarely with mica and some other substances. Under this general description Werner comprehends four stony substances; hornblende and hornblende slate, which we have already noticed in Section IX. primitive greenstone, and schistose greenstone.\n\nPrimitive greenstone is a mixture of hornblende and feldspar; under this there are several varieties, according as its texture is more or less granular, or compact. 1. Common greenstone, in which the hornblende and feldspar are intimately blended, is granular, and bears considerable resemblance to sienite, in which the hornblende is predominant. 2. A second variety has smaller grains, in which are imbedded crystals of feldspar, being of a structure between the granular and porphyritic. 3. A third variety has the grains of hornblende and feldspar extremely small, so as to be scarcely distinguishable. This stone loses its granular appearance, and becomes entirely porphyritic. 4. Lastly, when the mass becomes quite homogeneous, and of a complete green colour, it forms what was once called green porphyry, and constitutes the fourth variety.\n\nSchistose greenstone is composed of compact feldspar, hornblende, and a little mica, of which the hornblende and feldspar are nearly in equal quantity, and it now and then contains a little quartz. Its structure is schistose.\n\nWe have been thus particular in describing what Werner understands by primitive trap, as whatever may be thought of his theoretical opinions, his talent for mineralogical distinctions and characters cannot be called in question.\n\nDr Kirwan has given a long section on the distinguishing characters of trap, and its relation to basalt, &c., in his Geological Effays. He thinks that there might be formed a natural series of stones of a trap nature, taking in not only the composition but also the texture, grain, and specific gravity, as something of this kind has been conceived and done by Werner.\n\nPrimitive trap is often found in vast strata in the Where midst of gneiss, and veins of it running through gneiss, found have been found in Knobldorf in Silesia, and in Bohemia. It is also sometimes found in granite, and it is found passing through granite and micaceous schistus in the Western Isles of Scotland. Saintfond found it alternating with granite, near St Malo; and Charpentier, with gneiss. It sometimes forms entire mountains; as in the territory of Deux Ponts; and in Norway it is found reposing on granite. It sometimes alternates with argillaceous schistus, as at Leidenburgh.\n\nPrimitive trap frequently contains metals, especially the ores of iron and copper.\n\nSect. XVI. Topaz Rock.\n\nThis stone is composed of quartz, felspar, topaz, and lithomarga (a kind of hardened clay), the three former substances constituting small layers or plates alternating with each other. It sometimes contains cavities or geodes, lined on the inside with crystals of quartz and topazes. The texture of this stone is between the schistose and the granular; that is, it is composed of plates or laminae; but these laminae are of a granular structure.\n\nTopaz rock is very rare. It forms part of a mountain near Averbach, in the metallic mountains of Saxony; but no metallic matter has hitherto been discovered in it.\n\nSect. XVII. Siliceous Schistus.\n\nSiliceous schistus, or flinty slate, is the kiefelchiefer Silicous of Werner; but there seems some dispute between his disciples, whether it be a primitive or a secondary rock; on which account we have placed it last in the former series. Brochant does the same; but Mr Jameson, in his sketch of the Wernerian geognosy, places it among the transition formations, or those which immediately succeed the primitive. It is thus described by Mr Jameson. Its colour is bluish gray; it is internally dull; its fracture in the great is imperfectly flat; in the small, large splintering, passing into flat conchoidal; its fragments are indeterminately angular, and pretty sharp edged; it is strongly translucent on the edges; it is Dumfries, hard and brittle, difficultly frangible, and not particularly heavy.\n\nAn entire mountain formed of this stone is found in Lufatia, in which there are no petrifications. It is also found in the Alps, interposed between gneiss and hornstone. Schlendgenberg, a mountain in Saxony, is for the most part composed of it, mixed with hornblende and feldspar. Kirwan considers it as the same substance.\nB. Secondary Compounds.\n\nThe substances which we are now to notice are distinguished from those which we have been describing, in containing more or less the remains of organized beings. As the inferior strata of these secondary compounds usually contain fewer organic remains than those above them, they are sometimes subdivided into two orders, one of which is considered to be intermediate between the primary and secondary strata. This is Werner's classification, of which we shall give an account in the next chapter.\n\nSect. XVIII. Secondary Limestone.\n\nUnder this title we shall comprehend what Werner calls transition limestone, floet limestone, and limestone. Secondary limestone is a calcareous mass, sometimes granular, and sometimes compact, the former approaching to primitive limestone. Its fracture is scaly, and it is sometimes semitransparent. In colour it is very various, sometimes red, or rather blackish, with white veins, consisting of calcareous spar. It is often of a grayish cast. It sometimes forms vast blocks, without any appearance of stratification; at other times it is evidently stratified. It abounds with remains of marine animals, and often contains nodules of agate, and other similar stones.\n\nA variety of calcareous stone is described by mineralogists under the name of fine limestone. It is either compact, flat, or porous, and is said in general to contain no petrifications, though some found in the mountain of Kinneccula contains many. It is considered by Kirwan as primeval limestone, impregnated with petroleum.\n\nLimestone is sometimes found in oviform balls, commonly containing a grain of sand in them.\n\nThere is a variety of limestone that is very porous, and abounds in remains of vegetable matter, as impressions of leaves, &c.\n\nSecondary limestone is very abundant in most parts of the world, forming a considerable part of many mountains, and being often the principal stratum to a considerable depth below the surface. The mountain Iberg, in the Hartz, is composed of vast masses of it, irregularly rifted; and mountains of a similar kind are found in Siberia and in the Vivarais. In some of those mountains vast caverns have been formed. Secondary limestone mountains always repose on some primitive stone; thus, in Siberia their base consists of granite, porphyry or hornblende; in Saxony, of granite, or granular limestone, and sometimes of argillaceous schistus; in Switzerland, these mountains repose on argillaceous schistus or gneiss, or sometimes on calcareous puddingstone. In the Crimea, there is an immense extent of secondary limestone, between Roslof and Perekop, which is minutely described by Pallas. Great part of the summit of Mount Perdu, the highest of the Pyrenees, is composed of secondary limestone, arranged in nearly vertical strata, and so full of the remains of marine animals as in some places to appear as if composed of nothing else. Here it seems to repose on granular limestone.\n\nThe base of Mount Ingleborough in Westmoreland, which is near 30 miles in circuit, consists entirely of limestone, containing vast quantities of sea shells. This stone also forms the principal inferior strata through the greater part of Derbyshire, being arranged in beds of various degrees of thickness, from a few inches to about 200 fathoms in some places, not having been perforated; and abounding with shells, and other marine remains.\n\nIt is found in many quarries in Scotland distinctly stratified. Mr Jameson notices quarries of limestone at Clofeburn, and Barjarg, and at Kellhead in Dumfriesshire.\n\nSecondary limestone often contains metallic veins, especially in Derbyshire, where it abounds with galena, found in it, blende, sulphur pyrites, and copper pyrites. Sulphur is also sometimes found in it. Kirwan remarks, that in the rest of Europe limestone is seldom metalliferous.\n\nThe stone commonly called alabafter, employed in Alabaster making statues and ornaments, is properly a carbonated lime, nearly allied to marble; though it is usually supposed to be a variety of gypsum or plaster stone. There is a gypseous alabafter that will be noticed presently.\n\nCalcareous alabafter is not often white (though as white as alabafter is a common proverb), but generally tinctured with iron of a yellow, brown, or reddish cast. It is semiflaccid, and usually so soft as to be scratched by the nail.\n\nIt is commonly found in blocks, in marble quarries, as in the island of Paros, and in several parts of Italy, particularly in the territory of Volterra in Tuscany, in Malta, &c. A variety is found in the form of stalactites of a conical or cylindrical form.\n\nSect. XIX. Gray Wacke.\n\nGray wacke is a stone composed of fragments of gray quartz and argillaceous schistus, cemented by an argil wacke described, laceous matter similar to the schistus, varying in size, from that of a hen's egg, till they are so minute as to be no longer visible. It sometimes contains a matter similar to siliceous schistus.\n\nThere is a variety of this stone, called by Werner gray wacke flate, which is a simple flat stone, which bears a considerable resemblance to argillaceous schistus. From this, however, it is to be distinguished, according to Mr Jameson, by the following characters.\n\n\"It has seldom a greenish or light yellowish gray colour, as is the case with primitive flate, but is usually ash and smoke gray. It does not show the filvery continuous lustre of primitive clay flate, but is rather glimmering, which originates from intermixed scales of mica. Quartz scarcely occurs in it in layers, but usually traverses it in the form of veins. Further we do not find crystals of feldspar, schorl, talc, chlorite flate, or magnetic iron stone are to be observed in it. It contains petrifactions, particularly those varieties that border on gray wacke. It alternates with gray wacke.\"\n\nThese stones are distinctly stratified, but the direction...\nof their strata is not parallel to that of the other rocks on which they lie. They are very commonly found covering limestone, especially at the foot of mountains.\n\nGray wacke is found in Erzgebirge, at Braunsdorf, Riesberg, and Averbach, in Vogtland, in Transylvania, on the banks of the Rhine, in Lahntal, and some other places in Germany. It is also found in Britain; and Mr Jameson notices it among the minerals of Dumfriesshire, where the gray wacke slate is found near Moffat, in the vicinity of Langholm, in the higher parts of the valley of Esk, and behind Burnswark. The strata found in these places yield a very good slate, nearly free from mechanical mixture, and well adapted to the roofing of houses.\n\nThis species of stone is rich in metals; the greater part of the veins of lead and silver in the Hartz, especially those of Clausthal and Zellerfeld, are in gray wacke. In Transylvania, in Vorpath, it contains even rich mines of gold. The gray wacke strata on the banks of the Rhine are also traversed by some metallic veins, but those of Saxony contain nothing but blind coal.\n\n**Sect. XX. Secondary Trap.**\n\nSeveral varieties of trap occur among the secondary strata, and must be here enumerated. They all consist principally of greenstone, or that mixture of hornblende and feldspar, which constitutes the primitive traps, noticed in Section XV. But in the traps we are now to mention, the mixture is much more intimate, the grains considerably finer, and the mass appears homogeneous. We shall here notice only three principal varieties; the amygdaloid or toadstone, the globular trap, and the greenstone, called by the Wernersians transition greenstone.\n\n1. Amygdaloid, called in Derbyshire toadstone, and sometimes cat dirt, appears to consist of hornblende slate in a state of decomposition, and appears very similar to a kind of wacke, of a very fine grain. It is of a blackish colour, and very hard, and often contains a number of bladder holes, which are sometimes entirely empty, at others are partially or wholly filled with spar.\n\nIt runs in immense solid beds, without any appearance of stratification or fissure, of unequal thickness, having been seen from 6 feet to 600 thick. It commonly alternates with the strata of secondary limestone, as in Derbyshire, and sometimes seems to penetrate the inferior stratum of limestone to a very considerable depth. It contains no metallic veins, and it is said entirely to intercept those which it passes in the limestone strata. Saintfond affirms that lead ore is sometimes found in cat dirt; but he seems to have been deceived by the vagueness of the term, as the miners of Derbyshire give the same name to a greenish variety of limestone, which is sometimes traversed by veins of lead ore.\n\n2. Globular trap. This is a schistose greenstone, partially decomposed, and also resembles a fine-grained wacke; but it appears in the form of large balls, composed of concentric layers, with a hard nucleus. It is found at Altenzulze in Vogtland, and some other places. It sometimes contains veins of copper and iron.\n\n3. Greenstone. This is almost entirely composed of feldspar, usually of a pale flesh-red colour, having sometimes imbedded in it grains of grayish quartz, scales of iron, blackish mica, and crystals of pale flesh-coloured feldspar. This rock may be confounded with porphyry, or with feldspar; but is generally considered as different from both. Mr Jameson found it in beds from three to twelve feet thick on the upper side of the Sufanna vein in the valley of Leadhills, and in the mountain between Wamphray and Eildonmuir.\n\n**Sect. XXI. Sandstone, or Grit.**\n\nThese terms, like many others which we meet with in sandstone-mineralogy, are very vague and indefinite, and are used to denote three or four kinds of stone; a calcareous, an argillaceous, and a siliceous sandstone. We shall here consider only two of them, the argillaceous and the siliceous.\n\n1. Argillaceous sandstone. This is the sandstein Argillaceus of Werner, and the argillaceous grit of the ordinary sand-miners. It is composed of grains of quartz, and some times of siliceous schists; more rarely of feldspar. These grains are of various sizes, and are cemented in an argillaceous matter, commonly containing iron; whence this stone is sometimes called ferruginous sandstone. From the coarseness or fineness of the grains, it receives the names of coarse and fine sandstone. There is a very coarse kind found in Derbyshire, containing a considerable quantity of quartz pebbles.\n\nThis species of sandstone is found in immense beds, sometimes above 100 yards thick.\n\nIt is very distinctly stratified, and is commonly divided by fissures, into the shape of parallelopipeds. It sometimes alternates with layers of compact limestone, and often lies above a stone which we are immediately to mention, flase or flaser.\n\nSandstone is sometimes formed into globular concretions, composed of concentric lamellae.\n\nSandstone is one of the most abundant products of nature, occurring in almost every country. In Britain, it forms the uppermost stratum in many parts of Derbyshire; and in the isle of Arran there is an immense separate mass of it, forming what is called the cock. In the same island it is found in Glenranza, repaying on Min. of the secondary limestone.\n\nThe globular concretions of sandstone are uncommon. Mr Jameson observed them in the isle of Skye, near the harbour of Portree; and Reuss observed the same in Bohemia.\n\nThis species of sandstone usually contains many petrifications, but is generally not very abundant in metals; it however sometimes contains veins of cobalt.\n\n2. Siliceous sandstone. This is a stone of a similar siliceous nature with the last, except that the cementing mass is sandstone, all of a siliceous nature. It is found in the ports of Domica and Campara, in the isle of Arbe, and on the coast of Dalmatia, where it contains petrifications. The hill of Platiburg consists of sandstone, with a chalcedony cement. Some fine specimens of siliceous sandstone are found in Salisbury Craigs at Edinburgh, containing shells which have assumed the nature of chalcedony. It does not appear to contain metals.\n\n**Sect. XXII. Gypsum, or Plasterstone.**\n\nThis is native sulphate of lime, and it appears in several forms. Six varieties are usually enumerated; common\n\n1. Common gypsum is a compact, granulated stone, commonly of a grayish colour, and mixed with impurities, containing a considerable quantity of carbonate of lime. Its texture is seldom laminated, but it appears like coarse loaf sugar. This kind is very abundant, many hills being entirely formed of it. Of these the most remarkable are the plasterhills in the neighbourhood of Paris, those in the canton of Bern in Switzerland, and others among the Alps. Hills of gypsum occur also in Spain and Poland; near the White Sea; in Asia, where they are mostly in horizontal strata; in the north Archipelago, between Asia and America. Sandstone found a mountain in Switzerland composed of gypsum, sand, and clay*. This kind sometimes contains petrifications, and often abounds with the imprints of animal and vegetable matters; some very curious examples of which will be mentioned in a future section. It contains few metals, although copper is sometimes found in it, as are rock-salt and sulphur.\n\n2. Lenticular gypsum is a curious variety, which seems peculiar to Montmartre near Paris. In one of the banks in this mountain, specimens of it are found containing little lenticular bodies, distinct and disseminated through the stony matter, so as to form a great part of its mass. A specimen of this kind is figured by Patrin, in his natural history of minerals.\n\n3. The crystallized gypsum is also found chiefly in the environs of Paris, in crystals that are decadal, or sometimes like a rhomboidal octaedron, with the pyramids truncated near the base.\n\n4. Fibrous gypsum, composed of short brittle threads diploed in bundles, is found in Derbyshire, and near Riom in Auvergne. A very beautiful variety of a silky feel, and reticulated texture, is described by Patrin, as found in Poland, in the salt mines of Wielitkis; in Russia, near the junction of the river Oka with the Wolga; in Spain; and in China.\n\nA variety of gypsum with the appearance of vegetation is found in caverns near the baths at Matlock in Derbyshire. A beautiful specimen of it is figured by Patrin*.\n\n5. Gypsum is sometimes found hanging from the sides and roof of caverns in the form of stalactites, a transverse section of which shows their internal structure to be radiated. This variety is commonly called schelet\u2020.\n\n6. Gypseous alabaster is very similar to true alabaster, except that it does not, like that, effervesce with acids, and is in general not so strong. It is found in great abundance in Derbyshire in large masses, filling up cavities in argillaceous grit. It never forms a stratum, but is generally attended with gravel, red clay, and shells. Mr Mawe represents the lower portions as being very strong and compact, so as to form columns and pilasters\u2020. This kind is also found in Franche Comt\u00e9, and on the Marne about six leagues from Paris at Lagney.\n\nThough from the ordinary form or situation of gypsum, and the organic remains so commonly found in it, there can be no doubt of its being in most cases a secondary rock; yet from its having been found mixed with mica in St Gothard, it is enumerated by some among the primary compounds.\n\nSECT. XXIII. Fluor Spar.\n\nThis beautiful substance, which is native fluor of Fluor spar lime, is found either in large unformed masses or blocks, dished, or crystallized in cubes or octaedrons. It is of different colours; but the most prevailing varieties are that in parallel zones or bands of green, blue, yellow, and white; and that in which a white ground is veined with a reddish brown. Some specimens are so shaded as to represent a geographical map; but these are very rare. It is so soft as to be easily turned in a lathe into those vases and other ornaments which are so commonly seen on chimney-pieces.\n\nFluor spar is found in several countries of Europe, but especially in France and Britain. According to found Patrin, there are mines of it in the primitive mountains of Gyromagny, in the Voiges, in the neighbourhood of Langeac in Auvergne, and at Forez near Ambierle, that are inexhaustible\u00a7. It is also found in the Hifa Nat. mountain of Pilat not far from Lyons; among the de Miner. rocks that skirt the valley of Chamouni in the Alps; in the Altaichian mountains of Asia; and in Greenland.\n\nThe most productive mines of this substance in Britain are in a mountain near Caffleton in Derbyshire. Here there are two mines producing the beautiful compact fluor, called Blue John, which is found in pipe veins running in various directions. The fluor commonly rests upon limestone, and it frequently has this stone for a nucleus, round which it appears to have crystallized. Frequently, however, the centre is hollow. In several parts of the mine the fluor is found in detached masses, in caves filled with clay and loose adventitious matter, having the appearance as if it had been broken off from the limestone on which it had been formed; for every piece, in one part or other, seems as if it had adhered to something, and been broken off.\n\nSome of the pieces of fluor are a foot thick, and have four or five different veins or zones; such large pieces are however very rare, and in general they are only three or four inches thick*.\n\nSaintfond, who has given an interesting account of Mineral. the curiosities near Caffleton, says, that fluor spar would be the most beautiful substance in nature, if it were but a little harder.\n\nIt is also found in Northumberland, in a vein among the granite mountains of Aberdeenhire\u2020, and in one of the Shetland isles, in a vein of basalt\u2021.\n\nFluor appears in some cases to be primitive. Thus it is found forming whole strata in the mountains of the forest of Thuringia, and in a vein of quartz in Upper Hungary.\n\nSECT. XXIV. Chalk.\n\nChalk is too well known to require a description. It is not always white, but is frequently coloured. It is disposed in horizontal beds that are often many yards in thickness, and which always repose on layers of other calcareous stone of a harder structure. These beds are often of considerable extent, and very common-ly\nChap. I.\n\nNearly allied to this is what the miners call rubble stone, which is a common variety of slate found in familiar situations with flate; but often very rich in metallic ores, especially iron, galena, bismuth, and cobalt. It also abounds with petrifications. It is sometimes found in primitive rocks.\n\nSECT. XXVI. Marl.\n\nMarl is a substance chiefly composed of sand, clay, and calcareous matter, which is found in many places, and forms one of the most valuable natural manures used in agriculture. This is also found of various degrees of hardness, from a soft powder to a stony consistence, in which last state it forms what Kirwan calls marlstone. In colour it is usually of a reddish white, sometimes verging upon red, and it is not unfrequently found of a yellowish brown or blackish cast. Marl is usually disposed in considerable beds of various degrees of thickness, in valleys and other low lands, especially among the coal strata. Indurated marl occurs in the coal strata of Mid Lothian*, and it is also found in Dumfriesshire, in the island of Islay. Powdery marl is seen in Skye.\n\nStony marl, or marlstone, is found in Bavaria, alternating with sand and sandstone. Hills of it occur in Carniola, Carinthia, and the Venetian territory. It is also found between strata of limestone and argillaceous schistus.\n\nSECT. XXVII. Argillaceous Ironstone.\n\nThis is sometimes called metal stone, and is very common in the coal countries. It is very heavy and compact, and of various colours, from a dark brown to a blood red; the latter forms the hematites or bloodstone, one of the richest iron ores. It often contains in its spherical balls like iron bullets. It is disposed in strata alternating with indurated clay, flate clay, marl, or sandstone, seldom far below the surface. It seldom forms very extensive beds, but is often confined to particular spots.\n\nIronstone is found in great abundance in Cumberland, and in most parts of Scotland. It may be seen in the cliffs all along the coast of Fife, from Dysart to St Andrews.\n\nSECT. XXVIII. Wacke and Basalt.\n\nWe have already spoken of several stones under the whinstone name of traps, that are found both among primitive and secondary compounds. The two substances which we are now to notice are nearly allied to the traps, and have been classified with them under the general name of whinstone. This is a favourite term among the mineralogists of Scotland, of whom Sir James Hall employs it as a generic name to denote trap, basalt, wacke, grunstein, and porphyry.* The term is convenient, but Professor Jameison and others of the Wernerian school object to it as too vague and indefinite.\n\nWacke, or wacken, differs from trap only in being more compact and of a finer grain. It is heavy and very hard, so as often to strike fire with steel; it is dull and opaque, and breaks with an even fracture. Its colour is usually a reddish brown or gray of various shades,\n\n---\n\n* Pallad's Travels, vol. ii. p. 84.\n\n\u2020 Slate.\nArrange- shades, and sometimes it has a greenish cast. It has usually an earthy smell, when breathed on. It is sometimes highly impregnated with iron, and often contains crystals of hornblende, and very commonly those of hexagonal black mica.\n\nIt often forms a considerable part of mountains, either in vast blocks, as in the hill on which Edinburgh castle stands, or in strata lying above limestone or sandstone, or alternating with them. A great part of the Calton-hill, of Salisbury craigs, and Arthur's seat at Edinburgh, is composed of strata of this kind; and similar appearances take place in the bed of the water of Leith near the town, and in the cliffs on the coast of Fife, especially at St Andrews. To the eye of the volcanic Saintfond, all these beds appeared to be lava. We are disposed to think, with Mr Playfair, that the curious influence of alternate strata of basalt (as Saintfond calls it) and limestone, near Villeneuve de Berg, described and figured by that author, affords an example of whinstone alternating with limestone, such as are seen in Scotland. Several varieties of wacke are found in the hills near Edinburgh, and are described by Dr Townson. Mr Jameon observed wacke alternating with porphyry in Skye.\n\nBasalt has a finer grain, and is more compact than even wacke, and is the most dense of all the whins or traps. It is found either in large blocks, covering the other strata, sometimes in the form of tables, or in regular prismatic columns, either straight or bended. We have already treated so fully of the nature, properties, and chief habitats of basalt (see Basaltes), that little remains to be added here.\n\nIt is principally distinguished from wacke, where it is not in regular prisms, by very rarely containing crystals of mica, which are so common in the latter.\n\nSaintfond in his splendid work Sur les Volcans \u00e9teints du Vivarais, &c., has figured some examples of basaltic pillars which rival those of Staffa and the Giants Causeway. A more romantic situation is scarcely to be conceived than that drawn in his eleventh plate, of a village placed in the front of a bold hill covered with bundles of small pillars lying in every direction, and having detached perpendicular columns standing at each end, with a large cave directly behind the houses. Large masses of basalt are seen in the north of Shetland, standing insulated, and assuming a very grotesque appearance. Mr Jameon describes one of these in the isle of Jura, that forms a natural arch. We remember seeing two curious insulated rocks on the shore at the foot of Kinkeld braes at St Andrews, but do not recollect whether they are of a basaltic nature.\n\nSeveral other substances, as sand, gravel, peat, &c., might here be noticed, but their structure and situation are too well known to render a particular notice necessary.\n\nMany of the stones which we have described among the primitive rocks, are also sometimes found among the secondary strata, as argillaceous schistus, hornstone, hornblende, jasper, and especially puddingstone; but they are not so important as to require a second examination.\n\nBefore we conclude this general account of the materials which compose our globe, we must briefly notice two of the most valuable mineral productions, viz. rock salt and coal, and must say something of fossils and petrifications.\n\nSect. XXIX. Rock Salt.\n\nRock salt or sal gem, (the Reinsal of the Germans) is the purest muriate of soda that is found in nature, it being much less impregnated with foreign matters than what is procured from sea water. It is very hard, and generally very transparent, being sometimes as clear as crystal. It is usually white, but often yellowish, blue, red, or violet, and now and then it is quite opaque. This salt forms in the bowels of the earth horizontal beds or banks, more or less thick, from a few inches to many hundred fathoms; and sometimes extending several miles round. It commonly alternates with clay or gypsum. The beds are sometimes without any break for a great extent. It is generally found a few fathoms below the surface, and in some places is found continued to the depth of 1000 feet.\n\nIt is found in some mountains; and in Algiers, near where the lake called Mark, there is a mountain almost wholly composed of it. The famous salt mine of Wielitka in Austrian Poland, about eight miles to the south-east of Cracow, is in the northern extremity of a branch of the Carpathian mountains. The salt found here is of an iron gray colour, intermingled with white cubes; and sometimes large blocks of salt are found imbedded in marl. This famous mine has been worked ever since 1251, and it is pretended that its excavations extend more than a league from east to west. About five leagues to the south-east of Cra- cow are the salt mines of Bofchnia, the depth of which is nearly equal to those of Wielitka (1000 feet); but the salt procured from them is less pure. Mines of salt, in horizontal undulated beds, occur at Thorda in Muen, Transylvania, and in Upper Hungary. In the side of a mountain, about two leagues from Halle, on the banks of the Inn, to the north-east of Innspruck, rock salt is found imbedded in layers of a flat rock; but there is one part of the mountain in which there occurs an immense body of salt, without any mixture of rock, to which they pass by a gallery 260 toises in length, closed at the end with a locked door. This salt is very impure. There are three important salt mines in Spain; the first near Mingranella, in a mountainous tract, between Valencia and Castile, imbedded in layers of gypsum; the second in Spanish Navarre, in a ridge of hills composed of limestone and gypsum; and the third that of Cardona in Catalonia, about 16 leagues to the north-east of Barcelona, which is one of the most curious natural productions with which we are acquainted. It consists of an immense solid rock of salt, elevated 500 feet above the earth, and extending to a depth that has not been ascertained. It is without crevices or clefts, and has no appearance of strata, and is near a league in circuit. There is no plaster or gypsum found in the neighbourhood, and the salt rock is as high as any of the adjacent hills.\n\nRock salt is found in several places in England, particularly at Northwich in Cheshire, at Droitwich in Worcestershire, and near Welton in Staffordshire; but the mines in Northwich are the most productive. Salt mines, in this situation, were known to the Romans; but which.\nbut the principal mine that is at present wrought, was discovered in the beginning of last century. It forms immense quarries, extending over several acres, which, with their huge crystal pillars and glittering roof, present a most beautiful spectacle. The salt found here is of a dark-brown colour, like brown sugar-candy, and is so hard that it is blasted with gunpowder to get it from the mass. It is disposed in beds, alternating with beds of clay, gypsum, and flinty stone. Salt is procured at the greatest depth hitherto explored; and wherever a shaft is sunk in the neighbourhood, there is a certainty of finding salt.\n\nBesides these extensive mines, rock salt is found in the canton of Berne in Switzerland, in Siberia, in Arabia, in Tibet, and even in New Holland. It is also found in many parts of America, at a great height in the mountains, especially those of Peru.\n\nSect. XXX. Coal.\n\nWe have already, in the articles Coal and Coaly, treated of the nature of this substance, of the strata that are usually found connected with it (according to the phraseology of the miners), and of the method of procuring it from the pits; and, in Mineralogy, we shall give a particular account of the several varieties, and the distinguishing characters of each. A few observations respecting the principal collieries, with the appearance of the coal found in them, and the corresponding stratification, fall to be made in this place.\n\nThere are certain general circumstances that attend the depositions of coal in almost every place where it is found, and which we must mention before noticing the particular collieries. These are as follows:\n\n1. The beds in which coal is disposed, usually have their extremities near the surface of the ground, from which they bend obliquely downwards, the middle part of the bed being nearly horizontal, so that a vertical section of the bed nearly resembles the keel of a boat. This figure is well expressed in the first and third plates to Mr Jameson's Mineralogy of Dumfries. The lowest part of the bed is usually the thickest (o).\n\n2. A bed of coal is seldom found single; but, in general, several strata occur in the same place, of various thicknesses, the upper being usually very thin, and the lower very thick, with several stony strata between each two. Where there is only one bed, this is generally of very considerable thickness. At Whitehaven there are found at least 20 coal-strata below the surface; and at Li\u00e8ge, in France, there are no less than 60.\n\n3. The strata that separate the layers of coal are nearly the same in every colliery, and will be seen by referring to the table given under Coaly, and by those which will immediately be added. Those strata which are in immediate contact with the coal, are either whinstone, or more commonly an argillaceous flinty mass; and near this is sandstone, in layers that are separated by flinty clay, mixed with particles of coal.\n\n4. It is an observation which holds, almost without exception, that the flinty strata, and especially those next the coal, bear the impression of vegetables, and often of exotic or unknown plants.\n\nCoal, in a greater or less quantity, but of very different qualities, has been found in most countries, and where perhaps exists in all. It is found in France, Holland, Britain, Germany, Saxony, Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden; in China, Japan, and in New Holland; and much of it is worked in Virginia in America. But France and Britain may be considered as the favourite seats of this invaluable commodity, which may justly be put in competition with the treasures of Potofli and Peru.\n\nIt is stated by Buffon, that there are no fewer than 400 collieries worked in France; and yet Saintfond regrets that his countrymen are not so far advanced in the use of this mineral as the inhabitants of Britain. The most considerable coal mines in France, are those in the Lyonnais, at Forez, Burgundy, Auvergne, Languedoc, Franche Comt\u00e9, and Li\u00e8ge.\n\nThe mines in the Lyonnais, and those of Forez, are among the most important in France. They are situated in a valley, extending from the Rhone to the Loire, in a direction from north-east to south-west, between two chains of primitive mountains, and they occupy in length a space of six or seven leagues, from Rive-de-Gier to Firminy. In one part of the valley, in the neighbourhood of Saint-Etienne, the strata are nearly horizontal, and the medial thickness of the coal stratum is from three to five feet; and near the Loire there are from 15 to 25 of these. At Rive-de-Gier the strata are almost vertical, and their thickness is very unequal, being seldom less than three feet, and sometimes amounting to 40 or even 60. All the coal produced by these mines is of an excellent quality, and its quantity is immense. Patrin states, on the most undoubted authority, that there are in the neighbourhood of Rive-de-Gier, no less than 40 mines at work, which produced in one year 1,600,000 quintals of coal.\n\nThe next in importance are the coal mines of Li\u00e8ge. The beds of coal in that country have a direction from east to west; they commence about a league to the east of the town, and extend to about a league and a half to the west of it. Here, after meeting with some interruption, they extend for several leagues farther. Their breadth, from north to south, is about three-fourths of a league. At Verblos, which is to the north-west of the city, there are, according to Jars, more than 40 strata of coal, which are separated from each other by beds of different kinds of sandstone, of from 30 to 100 feet in thickness. Gemmete has counted 61 of these beds, placed one above another; and he is of opinion, that the lowest penetrates to the depth of 4000 feet perpendicular. Though these mines have been wrought from the 12th century, they have not yet reached to more than the twenty-first bed, at the depth of a little more than 1000 English feet.\n\n(d) Saintfond, in the section which he has of the coal strata at Newcastle, describes them as if they were convex towards the upper surface. (See p. 134, of vol. i. of the English Translation of his Travels in England, &c.) Surely this is a mistake.\nThe principal collieries of Britain are those of Newcastle and Whitehaven.\n\nNewcastle is surrounded by collieries to the distance of six or seven leagues, and may, perhaps, be considered as the richest coal district in the world. There are in several of the Newcastle mines not fewer than 16 beds of coal, two of which are considerably thicker than the rest, being each about a fathom in thickness. These are called the main coal, and are distinguished into the high main coal, and the low main coal, separated from each other by a considerable number of stony strata. Good coal, in sufficient quantity, is generally found at the depth of little more than 100 feet. The bed is five feet thick in some places, and less in others; but, in general, it is easily wrought, and large pieces are brought up. This last circumstance is of considerable advantage, as these pieces are most proper for chamber fires, and easily transported, which makes this kind of coal sell at a higher price. Where the bed of black and bituminous clay is penetrated, the coal is found adhering to it; but this is not always the case, for there are other mines in the neighbourhood where freestone is recovering, which, in the points of contact, is mixed with coal to the thickness of two or three inches; the latter running, as it were, in splinters into the stone, and having a lignaceous appearance, when attentively examined.\n\nAt Whitehaven, the beds of coal lie in a direction parallel to each other. Their inclination or dip is nearly to the west, and is from one yard in eight, to one in twelve. The strata are frequently interrupted by large fissures, or dykes, some of which remove the strata upwards or downwards, 120 feet. The course of these fissures is almost east and west. In a depth from the surface of 165 and a half fathoms, there are, in these collieries, seven large beds of coal, and 18 thin beds, which cannot, at present, be rendered profitable.\n\nThe strata superincumbent on the large beds of coal are, 1st bed, Blue slate. 2d, Gray freestone. 3d, Hard, white freestone. 4th, Blue slate, striated or speckled with freestone. 5th, Gray slate. 6th, Hard, white freestone.\n\nThe strata immediately beneath these large beds of coal, are from one and a half to six inches thick, and consists of a species of argillaceous earth, or shale. As this earth is of a very soft or friable nature, the weight of the superincumbent strata presses the pillar of coal through it. If the pillar descends a few inches, the roof not equally yielding at the same time, crushes, or breaks into small pieces. When, under these circumstances, the thickness of the bed does not exceed six feet, nor the depth 30 fathoms, the surface of the earth is sensibly affected.\n\nThere appear to be two principal belts of coal in this island, extending from the eastern to the western coast; one from Newcastle to Whitehaven; the other from the east coast of Scotland, across the vale of Forth and Clyde, to Ayrshire. Coal is indeed found in many other parts of the island; but the quantity is very trifling.\n\nThe familiarity of situation, and the similar nature of the coal at Whitehaven and Newcastle, would naturally lead us to infer, that the coal at both places is from the same seam. But this is placed beyond dispute, by a comparative examination of the strata in both situations. We shall here give two tabular views of the strata, one taken from Saintfond\u2019s Travels, and the other from Dr Joshua Dixon\u2019s account of the Whitehaven mines, in his literary life of Dr Brownrigg. Allowing for the different names given by different miners to the same substances, and Dr Dixon\u2019s greater minuteness, there is a wonderful similarity between the two tables.\n\n**Table I.

Duhamel the younger, was presented a few years since to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, who adjudged it the prize that had been offered for the best essay on the subject. An ample abstract of this memoir appeared in the Journal des Mines, No vii. In this paper is given a table of the number of veins, their direction and inclination, and the nature of the strata next the coal, and in the neighbourhood, in all the principal mines in Europe.\n\n**Sect. XXXI. Of Fossils and Petrifications.**\n\nThose organic remains of vegetable and animal matter which are found below the surface of the earth, mixed with the stony matters which are properly the component parts of the earth, are generally called fossils, or extraneous fossils. If they have entirely lost all traces of vegetable or animal matter, and have assumed a stony earthy nature, they are called petrifications.\n\nSome of these organic remains, particularly those of the vegetable kind, are found penetrated with a bituminous substance, so as to be rendered highly inflammable. One of the most curious circumstances attending these fossil bodies is, that they are very commonly natives of a different country from that in which they are found, or are the remains of species that are now no longer known.\n\nWe may properly divide these substances into those of the vegetable and those of the animal kingdom.\n\n1. Vegetable fossils. Almost every part of vegetables, the trunks, branches, leaves, and fruits, have been found in a fossil state, or impressions of some of them are seen in various mineral substances, especially in the flinty stone which accompanies coal.\n\nFig. 6 represents a curious example of this, that was found in the mines at Saint Etienne in France.\n\nA, is a fruit resembling that of coffee.\nB, is a portion of an unknown vegetable, apparently of the verticillate tribe.\nC, is a species of fern, which is very remarkable, as it is furnished with fructifications.\nD, is part of a plant with verticillate leaves, probably a species of gallium.\nE, is some exotic fruit.\n\nWhole trees are often found below the surface of the earth, especially in bogs and moorlands, sometimes retaining much of their vegetable nature, but more commonly either impregnated with bitumen or completely petrified. Subterranean trees are frequently dug up in the Isle of Anglesea; and in the Isle of Man there is a marsh six miles long and three broad, in which fir trees are found in great quantities; and though they are 18 or 20 feet below the surface, they appear as if standing firmly upon their roots. Subterranean trees, in various states, are frequently found in Ireland, especially in the neighbourhood of Lough Neagh. Much has been written on the subject of these petrifications of Lough Neagh, by Dr Boate, in his Natural History of Ireland; by Mr Molyneux, in the Philosophical Transactions, No clviii.; and Dr Barton in his Lectures on Natural Philosophy.\n\nSome of these trees are represented as of an immense size *. One of the most curious instances of vegetable fossils, is that related by Rammazzini, as seen by him at Modena in Italy. At the bottom of wells, that are dug there below stony masses, which appear to have been the foundation of a former city, at the depth of near 30 feet, they find heaps of wheat entire, fibbertrees, with their nuts, briars, &c. They find, likewise, every five feet, a layer of earth, alternating with branches and leaves of trees.\n\nAt the depth of 28 feet, or thereabouts, they find a chalk that cuts very easily. It is mixed with shells of several sorts, and makes a bed of about 11 feet. After this they find a bed of marly earth, of about two feet, mixed with rushes, leaves, and branches. After this bed comes another chalk bed, of nearly the same thickness with the former, which ends at the depth of 49 feet.\n\nThat is followed by another bed of marly earth like the former; after which comes a new chalk bed. These successive beds of marly earth and chalk are to be found in the same order, in whatever parts of the earth they dig. The auger sometimes finds great trees, which give the workmen much trouble. They see also sometimes at the bottom of these wells, great bones, coals, flints, and pieces of iron \u2020.\n\nThese vegetable fossils are generally of a flinty structure, being sometimes rough and sandy; at others so p. 223. hard and compact as to admit of a fine polish. Some beautiful specimens of petrified wood, of the appearance of agate, are to be seen in the cabinet of natural history. That of Billon at Paris contains two examples of this kind, which are figured at fig. 7 and 8. Fig. 7. is a transverse section of a piece of agatized wood, in which the lignous texture is most completely preserved. Fig. 8. is another more compact, and which has the additional singularity of containing several worms. The white oval spots are supposed to have been eggs, from which the worms had issued.\n\nAmong the bituminous vegetable fossils, none have attracted more attention than what is called bovey coal, a substance of an intermediate nature between wood and pitcoal, which is dug up in a common near Chudleigh in Devonshire. It is of a laminated texture, of a chocolate, or sometimes of a shining black colour, like deal boards that had been half charred. It burns heavily, and confines to light gray ashes. It is regularly stratified among beds of sand and clay, and the beds of coal are sometimes of considerable thickness. Mr Parkin-son has collected much information respecting the former and present state of this coal, in his entertaining work on fossils \u2021.\n\n2. Animal fossils. Fossils of animal matters are still more common than those of vegetables. Shells and bones are found in almost every bed of limestone, and in almost every country, at the bottom of the deepest valleys, and at the tops of very considerable mountains.\n\nIn the limestone strata in Derbyshire are found many of those fossils, which are called flor-flones and forew-flones, which appear to be the remains of marine animals called encriniti. These are described by Whitehurst, who has given figures of similar animals brought entire from the West Indies \u00a7. Fig. 9. represents one of these flones.\n\nThe Isle of Chereia in Dalmatia contains caverns chap. xvii., which are found prodigious quantities of fossil bones of oxen,\nArrangement, &c. of the Materials of the Earth.\n\nFossil shells are found on the Alps, on the top of Mount Cenis, on the Apennines, on the mountains of Genoa, and in most of the quarries of stone and marble in Italy; in most parts of Germany and Hungary, and indeed generally in all the elevated places in Europe. We also find them in the stones whereof the most ancient edifices of the Romans were constructed.\n\nIn Switzerland, Asia, and Africa, travellers have observed petrified fish, in many places; for instance, on the mountains of Calatrava, there is a bed of white laminated stone, and each lamina contains a great number and diversity of fishes; they are, for the most part, very flat, and extremely compressed, in the manner of fossil ferns; yet they are so well preserved, that the minute marks of their fins and scales are distinguishable, and every other part, whereby one species of fish is known from another.\n\nThere are likewise many echinoids and petrified fish between Iver and Cairo, and on all the hills and heights of Barbary, most of which exactly correspond with the like species taken in the Red sea.\n\nThe long chain of mountains which extend from east to west, from the lower part of Portugal to the most eastern parts of China, those which stretch collaterally to the north and south of them, together with the mountains of Africa and America, which are now known to us, all contain strata of earth and stone, full of shells.\n\nThe islands of Europe, Asia, and America, wherein Europeans have had occasion to dig, whether in mountains or plains, all furnish us with shells, and convince us that they have this particular in common with their adjacent continents.\n\nThe globoidea, or the teeth of sharks and other fishes, are found in the jaws, polished and worn smooth at the extremities, consequently must have been made use of during the animal's life; and in shells the very pearls are found, which the living animals of the same kind produce.\n\nIt is well known that the purpura and pholades have a long-pointed proboscis, which serves them as a kind of gimlet or drill, to pierce the shells of living fish, on whose flesh they feed. Now, shells thus pierced are found in the earth, which is another incontrovertible proof that they heretofore inclosed living fish, and that these fish inhabited places where the purpura and pholades preyed on them.\n\nIn Holland sea shells are found 100 feet below the surface; at Marly-la-Ville, five leagues from Paris, at 75; and in the Alps and Pyrenean mountains they are found under beds of stone of 100, nay even 1000 feet.\n\nShells are likewise found in the mountains of Spain, France, and England, in all the marble quarries of Flanders, in the mountains of Guelders, in all the hills round Paris, in those of Burgundy and Champagne; and, in short, in all places where the basis of the soil is neither freestone nor sandstone.\n\nBy shells we would be understood to mean, not only those which are merely tectaceous, but the relics of the crustaceous fishes also; and even all other marine productions; and we can venture to assert, that, in the generality of marbles, there is so great a quantity of marine productions, that they appear to surpass in bulk the matter whereby they are united.\n\nAmong the many influences of the multiplicity of oysters, there are few more extraordinary than that immense bed which M. de Beaumaris gives an account of, which contains 130,630,000 cubic fathoms. This vast mass of marine bodies is in Touraine in France, at upwards of 36 leagues from the sea. Some of these shells are found to entire, that their different species are very distinguishable.\n\nSome of the same species are found recent on the coast of Poitou, and others are known to be natives of more distant parts of the world. Among them are likewise blended some fragments of the more strong parts of sea plants, such as madriposes, fungi marini, &c. The canton of Touraine contains full nine square leagues in surface, and furnishes these fragments of shells wherever you dig.\n\nNear Reading in Berkshire, a continued body of oyster shells has been found: they lie in a stratum of greenish sand, about two feet in thickness, and extend over five or six acres of ground; they are covered by strata of sand and clay, upwards of 14 feet deep. Several whole oysters are found with both their valves or shells lying together, as oysters before they are opened; the shells are very brittle; and in digging them up, one of the valves will frequently drop from its fellow. Several are dug out entire; nay, some double oysters with their valves united.\n\nIn a quarry at the east end of Broughton in Lincolnshire, innumerable fragments of the shells of shell fish, of various sorts, are found under a stratum of stone imbedded in clay, with pieces of coral, and sometimes whole shell fish, with their natural shells and colours: some are most miserably cracked, bruised, and broken; others totally squeezed flat by the incumbent weight of earth.\n\nSharks teeth are dug up in the isle of Sheppey, retaining their natural colour, not petrified.\n\nThe teeth of sharks have likewise been taken out of a rock in Hindershelf park, near Malton in Yorkshire.\n\nIn the isle of Caldey, and elsewhere about Tenby in Pembrokeshire, marine fossils have been found in solid marble, on the face of the broken sea cliffs, 200 fathoms below the upper surface of the rocks. Nor were they only observed upon the face of these rocks, but even more or less throughout the whole mass or extent of them. This is manifest from divers rocks hewn down by workmen for making of lime, and other pieces casually fallen from the cliffs.\n\nThousands of fossil teeth, exactly answering to those of divers sorts of sea fish, have been found in quarries and gravel pits about Oxford.\n\nAt Tame in Oxfordshire, the belemnites, or thunderbolt stones, are found in a stratum of blue clay, which still retain their native flinty substance.\n\nThe belemnites, found in gravel pits, have suffered much, by their being rubbed against each other in the fluctuation of waters.\n\nThe nautili and belemnites are frequently found at Gorring near Oxford.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary collections of shells is Trans. vol. IV. p. 5.\nthat lately discovered by Ramond on the summit of Mont Perdu, the highest of the Pyrenees, where there are found vast quantities of sea shells and other marine fossils, and even skeletons of animals, in a fossil state.\n\nWhole skeletons of very large animals have been discovered in a fossil state. Those of elephants have been found buried in the plains of Siberia; and bones of the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the tapir, have been found in other places. A very large skeleton, nearly complete, of an immense animal, similar to the rhinoceros, is preserved in the cabinet of Madrid. It was dug up at Paraguay in South America, at the depth of 100 feet, in a sandy bed, on the banks of the river de la Plata. A description and engraving of it are given by Cuvier, in the Annals of the National Museum, No. 29. It appears to be at least 12 feet long, and the bones are of an immense size.\n\nA prodigious quantity of fossils, both of marine animals, and of quadrupeds, are found in the plaster hills of Montmartre near Paris. An account of these has lately appeared in several numbers of the Annals of the National Museum, by M. Lamarck, accompanied with the anatomical illustrations of Cuvier. These papers are extremely curious, and contain engravings of most of the fossils described, some of which are the remains of unknown animals. Our limits do not permit us to present our readers with even an abstract of these accounts. We shall therefore select only one example.\n\nFig. 10 represents a block of gypsum, on the surface of which is the skeleton of an animal resembling a moule, or, according to Cuvier, ose of the opossum tribe. The skeleton is nearly entire, and the head, the neck, the spine, the pelvis, one of the fore and hind legs, and part of the tail, are very distinct. There were two pieces of gypsum found together, which appear to have divided the skeleton between them. The animal seems to have been crushed or imbedded in its natural situation.\n\nWe have now enumerated the principal materials that compose the external crust of our earth, and have mentioned some of the most material circumstances respecting each. The metallic ores still remain to be considered, and they shall be noticed in describing metallic veins.\n\nCHAP. II. General Distribution of the Materials of the Earth.\n\nThe uppermost stratum of the earth, in low situations, is, for the most part, composed of sand or clay, or a mixture of these, forming beds that are either composed of the same mixture, or of alternate layers of the two substances. These beds vary in thickness, in different places; but, in the same place, they usually preserve nearly the same thickness for a considerable extent. Sometimes these beds of clay, sand, and earth, with shells, extend to the depth of some hundred feet. See the annexed table, i.

Of Mountains.\n\nThere are no objects on the surface of the earth which are so well calculated to excite the attention of mankind in general, and that of geologists in particular, as those stupendous elevated masses which we call mountains. The term mountain has in general been applied to those parts of the earth which are elevated to a very considerable height above the level surface; and a mountain is in common language distinguished from a hill only by its superior elevation. But as it is found necessary in a scientific point of view to render this distinction more accurate and precise, various geologists have given more correct definitions. By Pini and Mitterpacher every elevation whose declivity makes with the horizon an angle of at least $45^\\circ$, and whose perpendicular height is not less than one-fifth of the declivity is called a mountain. Werner distinguishes mountains according to their height, into high, middle-sized, and low. A high mountain according to him is that whose perpendicular height exceeds 6000 feet; when the height is not above 6000 nor below 3000 he calls it middle-sized; and when its height is below 3000 feet, he calls it low.\n\nMountains are either single or in groups; and these groups either consist of several mountains standing near each other so as to occupy nearly the centre of a certain space of ground, or they follow each other so as to form a ridge or chain running across a country, or along its shores. Sometimes these chains run in a longitudinal direction, as is the case with Mount Caucasus and the Uralian mountains in Asia, the Cordilleras in South America, &c., but often they run in a curvilinear direction like a crescent, as the Carpathian mountains, which separate Hungary from the rest of the Austrian territories. It has been supposed by some theoretic writers, that chains of mountains always run in nearly the same direction, which has been conceived to be from east to west; but this is by no means exact, as later observations have shewn that they assume different directions according to the form of the country where they are situated. Some writers have laid it down as a general rule, that chains of mountains always extend in a direction nearly parallel to the length of the country; but to this there are also many exceptions. Thus the Uralian mountains, the Carpathians, the Pyrenees, the Grampians in Scotland, and many others, run rather across the country. It often happens that mountains occupy nearly the central parts of a country; and the land generally slopes with a gentle declivity towards one side of the chain, while towards the other it is considerably steeper. This circumstance of one side of a chain of mountains being steeper than the other, has been lately extended to mountains and hills in general; and Dr Kirwan has written an excellent paper on the subject, from which we shall here extract the most important observations.\n\nThat one part of almost every high mountain or hill is steeper than another, could not have escaped the notice of any person who had traversed such mountains; but that nature in the formation of such declivities had any regard to different aspects or points of the compass, seems to have been first remarked by the celebrated Swedish geologist Mr Tilas, in the 2nd vol. of the Memoirs of Stockholm for 1760. Neither Varrenius, Luloph, nor Buffon in his natural history publications in 1748, have noticed this remarkable circumstance.\n\nThe observation of Tilas, however, relates only to the extreme ends, and not to the flanks of mountains; the steepness with respect to the former, he remarked that the steep side faces the declivity always faces that part of the country where the land lies lowest; and the gentler, that part of the country where the land lies highest; and that in the southern and eastern parts of Sweden they consequently face the east and south-east; and in the northern the west. The essential part of this observation extends therefore only to the general elevation or depression of the country, and not to the bearings of their declivities.\n\nThe discovery that the different declivities of the western flanks of mountains bear an invariable relation to their different aspects, seems to have been first published by Mr Bergman in his Physical Description of the Earth, of which the second edition appeared in 1773. He there remarked, that in mountains that extend from north to south, the western flank is the steepest, and the eastern the gentlest. And that in mountains which run east and west the southern declivity is the steepest, and the northern the gentlest. Vol. II. \u00a7 187.\n\nThis assertion he grounds on the observations related in his 1st vol. \u00a7 32, namely, that in Scandinavia, the Sieveberg mountains that run north and south, separating Sweden from Norway, the western or Norwegian sides are the steepest, and the eastern or Swedish, the most moderate; the verticality or steepness of the former being to that of the latter as 45 or 50 to 4 or 2.\n\nThat the Alps are steeper on their western and southern sides than on the eastern and northern.\n\nThat in America the Cordilleras are steeper on the western side, which faces the Pacific ocean, than on the eastern. But he does not notice a few exceptions to this rule in particular cases which will hereafter be mentioned.\n\nBuffon, in the first volume of his Epochs of Nature, published in 1778, p. 185, is the next who notices the general prevalence of this phenomenon, as far as relates to the eastern and western sides of the mountains that extend from north to south; but he is silent with respect to the north and south sides of the mountains that run from east to west; nay, he does not seem to have had a full comprehension of this phenomenon; for he considers it conjointly with the general dip of the regions in which these mountains exist. Thus he tells us, vol. i. p. 185, that in all continents the general declivity, taking it from the summit of mountains, is always more rapid on the western than on the eastern side; thus the summit of the chain of the Cordilleras is much nearer to the western shore than to the eastern; the chain which divides the whole length of Africa, from the Cape of Good Hope to the mountains of the Moon,\nMoon, is nearer, he says, to the western than to the eastern seas; of this, however, he must have been ignorant, as that tract of country is still unknown.\n\n\"The mountains which run from Cape Comorin through the peninsula of India are, he says, much nearer to the sea on the east than on the west; he probably meant the contrary, as the fact is evidently so, and so he states it in vol. ii. p. 295; the same he tells us may be observed in islands and peninsulas, and in mountains.\n\n\"This remarkable circumstance of mountains was notwithstanding so little noticed, that in 1792 the author of an excellent account of the territory of Carlsbad in Bohemia, tells us he had made an observation, which he had never met with in any physical description of the earth, namely, that the southern declivity of all mountains was much steeper than the northern, which he proves by instance the Erzgebirge of Saxony, the Pyrenees, the mountains of Switzerland, Savoy, Carinthia, Tyrol, Moravia, the Carpathian and Mount Haemus in Turkey. 2 Bergm. Journ. 1792. p. 385, in the note.\n\n\"Herman in his geology, published in 1787, p. 90, has at least partially mentioned this circumstance; for he says that the eastern declivities of all mountains are much gentler and more thickly covered with secondary strata, and to a greater height than the western flanks, which he instances in the Swedish and Norwegian mountains, the Alps, the Caucasian, the Appenine, and Ouralian mountains; but the declivities bearing a southern or northern aspect he does not mention.\n\n\"Lamethoric, in vol. iv. of his theory of the earth, of which the second edition appeared in 1797, a work which abounds in excellent observations, p. 381, produces numerous instances of the inequality of the eastern and western declivities, but scarcely any of the northern and southern, whose difference he does not seem to have noticed; but he makes a remark which I have not seen elsewhere, that the coasts of different countries present similar declivities.\n\n\"With regard to eastern and western aspects, he thinks that a different law has obtained in Africa from that which has been observed in other countries; for in that vast peninsula he imagines the eastern declivities of mountains are the steepest, and the western the gentlest. Of this, however, he adduces no other proof, but that the greatest rivers are found on the western side: this proof seems insufficient, as, if mountains be situated far in land, great rivers may flow indiscriminately from any side of them, and sometimes few rivers flow even from the side whose descent is most moderate; for instance, from the eastern side of the mountains of Syria. The Elbe and the Oder, two of the greatest rivers in Germany, take their course from the western sides, the first of the Bohemian and the other of the Moravian mountains, which yet are the steepest. Many originate from lakes, as the Shannon with us; many take such a winding course, that from a bare knowledge of the place of their disemboguement it is impossible to judge from what side of a mountain they issue, if from any; their course at most discovers the depression of the general level of the country.\n\n\"In 1798, the celebrated traveller and circumnavigator, John Reinhold Fosser, published a geological tract which merits so much more attention, as all the facts were either observed by himself, or related to him by the immediate observers. In this he states as a fact universally observed, that the south and south-east sides of almost every mountain are steep, but that the north and north-west sides are gently covered and connected with secondary strata, in which organic remains abound, which he illustrates by various instances, some of which have been already, and others will presently be mentioned.\n\n\"At present this fact attracts the greatest attention, being obviously connected with the original structure of the globe, and clearly proving that mountains are not merely fortuitous eruptions unconnected with transactions on the surface of the earth, as has of late been confidently advanced.\n\n\"I shall now state the principal observations relative to this object, that have been made in different parts of mountains of the world.\n\nIn Europe.\n\n1. The mountains that separate Sweden from Norway extend from north to south, their western sides are steep, and the eastern gentle. 1 Berg. Erde Beschreib. p. 157.\n\n2.

Dr Walker, professor of natural history at Edinburgh, observed that the coasts and hills of Scotland are steeper and higher on the western side than on the eastern. Jamelson's Mineralogy of Scotland, p. 3. However, Jamelson observed, that the south side of the island of Arran is the lowest, and the north side the highest, p. 51.\n\n4.

The southern declivity is to the northern as five to two. 2 Bergm. Journ. 1792, p. 384, and 385.\n\n7. The mountains which separate Silesia from Bohemia run nearly from east to west, yet are steeper on the northern or Silesian side than on the opposite Bohemian. Affennami Silesia, 335. Such branches as run from north-east to south-west, have their western covered with primordial strata, and consequently less steep.\n\n4 New Ross. p. 157.\n\n8. The Meissen in Hesse is steeper on the north and east sides, which face the Warra, than on the south and western. 1 Bergm. Journ. 1789, p. 272.\n\n9. The mountains of the Harz and Habichtswald are steep on the south, and gentle on the northern sides. Fosser, \u00a7 46.\n\n10.

The mountains of Syria, which run from north to south, skirting the Mediterranean, are said to be steeper on the western side, facing the Mediterranean. 4. La Metherie, p. 380.\n\nIn America.\n\n\"The Cordilleras run from north to south; their western flanks towards the Pacific are steep, their eastern descend gradually.\n\n\"In Guiana there is a chain of mountains that run from east to west; their southern flanks are steep, their northern gentle.

The following table shows the height of the principal mountains in the globe, chiefly according to this computation.\n\nIn this table the second column shows the height as estimated by the barometer, and the third the same by geometrical calculation. Where the numbers are placed in the middle of these two spaces, it denotes an uncertainty by what method the computation has been made.\n\nTable of the Heights of Mountains, according to the latest computations.\n\n| Mountains          | Height by Barom. | Height by Geometry |\n|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| **In Britain**     |                  |                   |\n| Ben Nevis          | 4350             |                   |\n| Whrin              | 4050             |                   |\n| Ben Lawers         | 4015             |                   |\n| Ingleborough       | 3987             |                   |\n| Do                 | 2377             | 2380              |\n| Ben More           | 3903             |                   |\n| Pennygent          | 3930             |                   |\n| Crofsfell          | 3839             |                   |\n| Skiddaw            | 3380             | 3530              |\n| Snowden            | 3456             |                   |\n| Mount Battock      | 3465             |                   |\n| Pendlehill         | 3411             | 3564              |\n| Schehallion        | 3324             |                   |\n| Helvellyn          | 3300             |                   |\n| Hartfell           | 3700             |                   |\n| Ben Wevis          | 3240             |                   |\n| Ben Lomond         | 3048             |                   |\n| Saddleback         | 3099             |                   |\n| Ben Ledy           |                  |                   |\n| **In Ireland**     |                  |                   |\n| Slieve Donard      | 3150             |                   |\n| Croagh Patrick     | 2666             |                   |\n| Nephin             | 2640             |                   |\n| Knock Meledown     | 2700             |                   |\n| Mangerton          | 2500             |                   |\n| Cumeragh           | 2160             |                   |\n| **In France**      |                  |                   |\n| Puy de Sanfi       | 6300             |                   |\n| Plomb de Cantal    | 6200             |                   |\n| Puy de Dome        | 5000             |                   |\n| **Pyrenees**       |                  |                   |\n| Mont Perdu         | 11,000           |                   |\n| Canigou            | 9,000            |                   |\n| **Alps**           |                  |                   |\n| Mont Blanc         | 15,662           |                   |\n| Schreckhorn        | 13,000+          |                   |\n| Finsteraar         | 12,000           |                   |\n| Mount Titlis       | 10,818           |                   |\n| Mont Rofa          | 15,000           |                   |\n| Mont Cenis         | 9,760            |                   |\n| **In the Tyrol**   |                  |                   |\n| Glockner           | 11,500 Fr.       |                   |\n| Ortele             | 13,000 Fr.       |                   |\n| Plaute Kogel       | 9,748 Fr.        |                   |\n| **Germany**        |                  |                   |\n| Stuben             | 4092             |                   |\n| Brenner            | 5109             |                   |\n| Lomnitz peak       | 8640             |                   |\n| Kefmark peak       | 8508             |                   |\n| Carpath            | 8343             |                   |\n| Krivan             |                  |                   |\n| **Sicily**         |                  |                   |\n| \u00c6tna               | 10,032           |                   |\n| **In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden** | | |\n| Swukku             | 9000             |                   |\n| Arekutan           | 6162             |                   |\n| Kinneulla          | 931              |                   |\n| R\u00f8stak             | 6000             |                   |\n\nTable\nThe course of mountains is that direction of their length in which they descend and grow lower; or if a river runs parallel to them, they are said to have their course in the direction of the stream of the river. The course of mountains is seldom uniform. It has been laid down as a general maxim by Buffon, that when there are two parallel chains of mountains, the salient angle of one of the chains always corresponds with the internal angle of the other; but later geologists have ascertained that this circumstance does not generally hold, except when a river runs between the two chains.\n\nIt generally happens, that one particular mountain, or chain of mountains, is composed of those stony materials which we have denominated primitive; while the rest is made up of the secondary compounds. The primitive substances occupy the base and central parts of the mountain, and often extend to its very summit; the secondary cover these, and are generally found on the flanks or sides of the mountain, though sometimes they cover the top of the mountain. In a chain of mountains there are commonly three, and often five parallel ridges, of which the central ridge is composed of primitive compounds, and those on each side of it, chiefly or entirely, of secondary compounds. Hence mountains are usually divided into primary or primeval, and secondary or epizoic; the latter term being given to the secondary mountains from their being replete with shells and other remains of animal beings. The secondary mountains are also sometimes divided into original and derivative, for a reason that will appear hereafter.\n\nThe primary mountains, besides their being in the centre, and destitute, or nearly so, of organic remains, may generally be distinguished by the ruggedness and angular appearances arising from the different nature and hardness of the substances of which they are composed; the quartz and harder granite resisting the attacks of the air and weather, while the other substances being softer, gradually decay, and leave the harder in the form of spines and angles. Where, however, the primitive compounds have been completely covered with secondary strata, these angular appearances seldom take place; and the mountain is only to be distinguished by its position and the structure of its internal parts. The secondary mountains generally have their tops rounded, and much smoother than those of the primary mountains.\n\nIn some cases a number of mountains appear united at their tops into an extensive plain or platform, from which they seem to diverge and branch in every direction. The most remarkable instance of this kind occurs in Tibet. (See Geography, No 41.)\n\nIt is difficult to acquire a knowledge of the interior structure of mountains. The greater part of them is hid from our view, and nature only exposes them in a few points by means of fissures, caverns, and intermediate valleys.\n\n\"The materials of which mountains consist are disposed either in irregular heaps, or piles variously intersected by rifts, or in beds, or strata separated from each other by rifts, often horizontal, or varying from that direction by an angle of from 5 to 40 degrees, and sometimes much more considerably, approaching even to a vertical position. The strata of mountains are most frequently in the direction of their declivity, yet sometimes their course is directly opposite, or countercurrent: the best manner of determining the angles of their course is by discovering that of their rifts. It chiefly depends on the unevenness of the fundamental ground that supports them. According to M. Saufler, most of the elevated granitic mountains in Switzerland are formed of immense vertical pyramidal laminae, parallel to each other, that is, piles somewhat inclining from the unequal distribution of their weight, a disposition that may well be expected from collateral crystallizations; but this disposition is not universal, for they have been found in Saxony, and in the Pyrenees, horizontally stratified; much less can it be said, that this vertical position is general, for the strata of gneiss are generally horizontal, and commonly very regular, discovering no traces of a violent shock. Mount Rosa, next to Mount Blanc, the highest in Europe, consists also of gneiss, which M. Saufler found horizontally stratified.\n\n\"Shangin, who lately (1786) travelled over the Altai-Chan mountains, being consulted by Pallas, whether he found any vertical layers or strata therein, answered, he had not; but that he found them perfectly horizontal on the banks of the river Tchary.\n\n\"Mountains of primitive limestone are frequently in irregular piles, but often also horizontally stratified. Siliceous schistus is also often horizontally stratified.\"\nMany argillites, particularly roof slates, are generally said to have nearly a vertical position; but Voight has shown that it is only their lamellae that are so situated; their horizontal seams, and their walls, discovering their true position; their verticality arising only from the drain of the water, and, consequently, their contraction in that direction; hence those that are most solicited, as they contract less, discover less verticality. Sometimes horizontal strata overlap on both sides. Sometimes they are flanked on both sides with vertical strata.\n\nMuch confusion prevails in the structure of the Pyrenees, and of the Grifon mountains, and those on the borders of the Baikal, and other great lakes.\n\nThe perturbed state of the strata often proceeds from the decomposition of internal beds of pyrites, to which water has had access; this appears to be the cause of the alterations observed in the mountain of Rabenberg, on the frontiers of Saxony. In this mountain a double direction of the strata of gneiss is observed; between both the strata are vertical, and a large intermediate space is filled with iron ore: but this mountain contains beds of pyrites and vast swallows; most probably then the pyrites swoll, uplifted the whole, and the dissolved iron flowed into the vacuity, from which the water afterwards drained off on the sides.\n\nIn secondary mountains, particularly the calcareous, the greatest disorder often prevails, though in general their stratification is horizontal.\n\nThe calcareous mountains of Savoy are often arched like a lambda, probably from the sinking of the intermediate strata, the intermediate remaining horizontal. Sometimes they assume the form of the letters Z, S, C, or of a disjointed OC, the convexities facing each other. So also in the Pyrenees, they sometimes overlap, from an unequal distribution in their original formation, and bend various ways. They assume a spiral form, or that of a horse-shoe placed horizontally.\n\nAccording to Lehman, most secondary strata present hollows or moulds, (as they are called,) from internal depression. But sometimes also elevations, from an original elevation in the fundamental stone.\n\nIn Scotland, all the secondary strata in the vicinity of primeval mountains, are nearly vertical; but at a greater distance they approach more to an horizontal direction.*\n\nWe shall now trace the course of the principal mountainous chains on the globe, and in accompanying us, the reader may have before him a good map of the world.\n\nM. Buache places the most elevated points of the great chains of mountains under the equatorial line: but, according to Pallas, the fullest and most continuous lands, and perhaps likewise the most elevated, are to be found at a distance from the equator, and towards the temperate zones. If, in fact, we survey the globe's surface, we shall not be able to perceive that chain of mountains, which running from east to west, and dividing the earth into two portions, ought again to meet. On the contrary, extensive plains seem to accompany the line through almost its whole extent. In Africa, the deserts of Nigritia and those of Upper Ethiopia, are on the one side of the line; and on the other are the sandy plains of Nicoceo, Cafraria, Monemugi, and Zanguebar. From the eastern shores of Africa to the Sunda islands, is a space of 1500 leagues of sea with almost no islands, except the Laccadive and Maldivian islands; most part of which have little elevation, and which run from north to south. From the Molucca islands and New Guinea, to the western borders of America, the sea occupies a space of 3000 leagues. Though Chimborazo and Pichincha in America, the two highest mountains which have been measured, are near and even under the line, yet from this no conclusion can be drawn; because on one side these mountains run in a direction not parallel to the equator; the Andes or Cordilleras attain a greater elevation as they remove from the equator towards the poles; and a vast plain is found exactly under the line, between the Oronooko and the river of the Amazons. Besides, the latter river, which takes its rise in the province of Lima about the 11th degree of south latitude, after crossing the whole of South America from west to east, falls into the ocean exactly under the equator. This shows that there is a descent for the space of 12 degrees or 300 leagues. From the mouth of the river of the Amazons, to the western shores of Africa, the sea forms another plain of more than 50 degrees.\n\nFrom the few certain facts and accurate observations which we have received from well informed travellers, we might almost affirm that the most elevated land on our globe is situated without the tropics in the northern and southern hemispheres. By examining the course of the great rivers, we in fact find that they are in general discharged into three great reservoirs, the one under the line, and the other two towards the poles. This, however, we do not mean to lay down as universally true; for it is allowed, that, besides the two elevated belts, the whole surface of the earth is covered with innumerable mountains, either detached from one another or in a continued chain. In America, the Oronooko and the river of the Amazons run towards the line, while the river St Lawrence runs towards the 50th degree of north latitude, and the river de la Plata towards the 40th degree of south latitude. We are still too little acquainted with Africa, which is almost all contained within the tropics, to form any accurate conclusions concerning this subject. Europe and Asia, which form only one great mass, appear to be divided by a more elevated belt, which extends from the most westerly shores of France to the most easterly of China, and to the island of Sagaleen or Anga-hata, following pretty nearly the 50th degree of north latitude. In the new continent, therefore, we may consider that chain where the Mississippi, the river St Lawrence, the Ohio, and the river de los Esfrehos, take their rise, as the most elevated situation in North America; whence the Mississippi flows towards the equator, the river St Lawrence towards the north-east, and the rest towards the north-west. In the old continent, the belt formerly mentioned, and to which we may assign about 10 degrees of breadth, may be reckoned from the 45th to the 55th degree of north latitude: for in Europe the Tagus, the Danube, the Dnieper, the Don, and the Volga, and in Asia the Indus, the Ganges, the Meran, the Maecon, the Hoang-ho, and the Yang-tse-Kiang, descending as it were from this elevation, fall into the great reservoir between the tropics; whilst towards the north...\nChap. II.\n\nGeneral Distribution of the Materials of the Earth.\n\nnorth the Rhine, the Elbe, the Oder, the Vistula, the Oby, the Jenisei, the Lena, the Indigirka, and the Kowyma, are discharged into the northern reservoir.\n\nJudging from those mountains the height of which has been calculated, and from the immense chains with which we are acquainted, we may infer that the highest mountains are to be found in this elevated belt. The Alps of Switzerland and Savoy extend through the 45th, the 46th, and the 47th degrees. Among them we find St Gothard, Furca, Bruning, Ruis, Whiggis, Scheideck, Gunggels, Galanda; and lastly, that branch of the Swiss Alps which reaches Tirol by the name of Arlenberg and Arula. In Savoy, we meet with Mont Blanc, the Peak of Argentiere, Cornero, Great and Little St Bernard, Great and Little Cenis, Coupeline, Servin, and that branch of the Savoyard Alps which proceeds towards Italy through the duchy of Aosta and Montferrat. In this vast heap of elevated peaks, Mount Blanc and St Gotthard are particularly distinguished. The Alps, leaving Switzerland and Savoy, and passing through Tirol and Carniola, traverse Salzburg, Styria, and Austria, and extend their branches through Moravia and Bohemia, as far as Poland and Prussia.\n\nBetween the 47th and 48th degrees, we meet with Grimming the highest mountain of Styria, and Priel which is the highest in Austria. Between the 46th and 47th degrees, the Bacher and the Reinischkogel, form two remarkable chains. The upper one, which traverses the counties of Tren\u010d\u00edn, Arrava, Scepus, and the Kreyna, separates Upper Hungary from Silesia, Little Poland, and Red Ruthenia; the inferior one traverses Upper Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and Transylvania, separates Lower Hungary from Turkey in Europe, and meets the upper chain behind Moldavia, on the confines of Little Tartary. In these mountains are situated the rich mines of Schenitz.\n\nTo form a general idea of the great height of this Alpine belt, it is necessary only to remark, that the greatest depth of the wells at Schenitz is 200 toises; and yet it appears, from the barometrical calculations of the learned M. Noda, that the greatest depth of these mines is 286 toises higher than the city of Vienna. The granite-argillaceous mountains of Schenitz, and of the whole of this metallic district, are inferior, however, to the Carpathian mountains. Mount Krvany in the county of Arrava, and the Carpathian mountains between Red Ruthenia and the Kreyna, appear by their great elevation to rule over the whole of the upper Alpine chain. In the inferior chain we likewise meet with mountains of an extraordinary height; among others, Mount Medvednik, which gives its name to a chain extending far into Bosnia; and Mount Hermon, celebrated even among the ancients. In short, this extensive chain reaches into Asia, and is there confounded with another chain no less famous, which, following exactly the 50th degree of latitude, runs through the whole of Asia. This chain of mountains is described by Dr Pallas in the work above mentioned; and we shall now trace its course in company with this intelligent observer.\n\nThis author places the head of the mountains of Oural, between the sources of the Yaik and the Bieiaia, about the 53rd degree of latitude, and the 47th of longitude. Here the European Alps, after having traversed Europe, and sent off various branches which we shall afterwards examine, lose their name, which is changed into that of the Uralic or Urallian mountains, and begin their course in Asia. This lofty chain, which separates Great Bulgaria from the deserts of Ichimka, proceeds through the country of the Eleuths, follows the course of the river Irtis, approaches the lake Telekaia, and afterwards forms a part of the same system of mountains with the Altaic chain. There they give rise to the Oby, the Irtis, and the Jenisei, which begin their course about the 50th degree of north latitude, and fall into the Frozen ocean.\n\nThe Altaic chain, after having embraced and united all the rivers which supply the Jenisei, is continued under the name of Saianer, without the smallest interruption, as far as the Baikal lake. The extension of this chain to the south forms that immense and elevated plain which is lost in Chinese Tartary, which may be compared with the only plains in Quito, and which is called Gobi or Chama. The Altai afterwards interposing between the source of the Tchikoi and of the rivers which supply the Amur or Sagaleen, rises towards the Lena, approaches the city Jakuck beyond the 60th degree of latitude, runs from that to the sea of Kamtchatka, turns round the Ochockoi and Pennisk gulfs, joins the great marine chain of the Kurile islands near Japan, and forms the steep shores of Kamtchatka, between the 55th and 60th degrees of latitude. After running in the same parallel, and giving rise to the Ohio, the Riviere Longue, the river St Lawrence, and the Mississippi, they are lost in Canada. From the eastern shores of America to the western shores of Europe, we find a vast interruption.\n\nThe European Alps produce three principal chains, which run towards the equator, and some smaller ones running towards the pole. The first southern chain is sent out through Dauphine; traverses Vivarais, Languedoc, Auvergne, Cevennes, and Languedoc; and, after joining the Pyrenees, enters Spain. There it divides into two or three ramifications, one of which runs through Navarre, Biscay, Aragon, Castile, Marche, and Sierra Morena, and extends into Portugal. The other, after traversing Andalusia and the kingdom of Granada, and there forming a number of mountains, again makes its appearance, beyond the straits of Gibraltar, in Africa, and coasts along its northern shores under the name of Mount Atlas.\n\nThe second principal chain of the Alps pales out through Savoy and Piedmont; spreads its roughnesses over the flates of Genoa and Parma; forms the belt of the Apennines; and after frequently changing its name, and dividing Italy into two parts, terminates in the kingdom of Naples and in Sicily, producing volcanoes in every part of its course. The third chain is sent off from Hungary, and scatters innumerable mountains over all Turkey in Europe, as far as the Morea and the Archipelago at the bottom of the Mediterranean sea. The northern branches, though smaller at first, are no less clearly defined; and some of them even extend their ramifications as far as the Frozen ocean. An Alpine branch, issuing from Savoy through the country of Gex, proceeds though Franche Comt\u00e9, Sunctgaw, Alface, the Palatinate, and Veterbia.\nAnother issue from the territory of Salzburg, passes along Bohemia, enters Poland, lends off a ramification into Prussia towards the deserts of Waldow, and after having passed through Russia is lost in the government of Archangel.\n\nThe Asiatic Alps send forth in like manner several branches both to the south and north. The Ouralic mountains, between the sources of the Bielaia and the Jaik, produce three principal branches; the first of which, including the Calpian sea in one of its divisions, enters Circassia through the government of Astracan, passes through Georgia under the name of Caucasus, lends a vast number of ramifications to the west into Asiatic Turkey, and there produces the mountains Tichilder, Ararat, Taurus, Arg\u00e9e, and many others in the three Arabias; while the other division, passing between the Calpian sea and the lake Aral, penetrates through Chorasan into Persia. The second branch, taking a more easterly direction, leaves the country of the Eleuths; reaches Little Bucharia; and forms the ramparts of Gog and Magog, and the celebrated mountains formerly known by the name of Caf, which M. Boilly has made the seat of the war between the Dives and the Peris*. It traverses the kingdoms of Casgar and Turkestan, enters through that of Lahor into the Mogul territory, and, after giving rise to the elevated desert of Chamo, forms the western peninsula of India. While these two branches run towards the south, the third branch of the Ouralic chain rises towards the north, following almost the 79th degree of longitude, and forms a natural boundary between Europe and Asia; without, however, bounding the immense empire of Russia. This chain, after coming opposite to Nova Zembla, divides into two considerable branches. The one, running to the north-east, passes along the Arctic shores; the other, proceeding towards the north-west, meets the northern European chain, traverses Scandinavia in the shape of a horseshoe, covers the low lands of Finland with rocks; and, as is observed by Dr Pallas, appears to be continued from the North Cape of Norway through the marine chain of Spitzbergen, scattering islands and shelves perhaps throughout the northern ocean, that, passing through the pole, it may join the northern and eastern points of Asia and North America.\n\nThe Ouralic, which in the country of the Mongols becomes the Altai chain, proceeds towards the equator. After forming the mountains and caverns wherein, as we are told, the ashes of the Mongol emperors of the race of Gengis-Kan are deposited, together with the vast plains of Chamo, consisting of arid land, and the frightful rocks and precipices of Tibet, which form the mysterious and desert retreats of the Grand Lama, it crosses the rivers Ava and Menan; contains in its subdivisions the kingdoms of Ava, Pegu, Laos, Tonquin, Cochinchina, and Siam; supports the peninsula of Malacca; and overspreads the Indian ocean with the isles of Sunda, the Moluccas, and the Philippines. From the borders of the Baikal lake and of the province of Selenginskoy, a branch is detached, which spreads over Chinese Tartary and China, is continued into Corea, and gives rise to the islets of Japan.\n\nThe great chain having extended to the north, near the city of Jakuck, upon the banks of the Lena, lends off one of its branches to the north-west, which passing between the two Tunguska, is lost in marshy grounds lying in the northern parts of the province of Jennifeitkoy. The same chain, after it has reached the eastern part of Asia, is lost in the icy regions of the north about Nos-Tichalatkhoy, or the Icy Promontory, and Cape Czuczczenskoy.\n\nIt will be more difficult, perhaps, to trace the elevated belt in the southern hemisphere beyond the tropic of Capricorn, than it has been to distinguish that towards the north. An immense extent of ocean seems to occupy the whole Antarctic part of the globe.\u2014The greatest south latitude of the old continent is not more than 34 degrees, and South America scarcely extends to the 55th degree. In vain has the enterprising Cook attempted to discover regions towards the pole: his progress was constantly interrupted by tremendous mountains and fields of ice. Beyond the 50th degree no land and no habitations are to be found. The islands of New Zealand are the farthest land in these desert seas; and yet the south cape of Taralo-Poemamoo extends only to the 48th degree: We do not mention Sandwich-land, which is situated in the 58th degree, because it is too small and too low. It must be recollected, however, that according to the declarations of travellers, the Cordilleras become higher as they advance southward to the straits of Magellan; and that Terra del Fuego, which lies in the latitude of 55\u00b0, is nothing but a mass of rocks of prodigious elevation. America, however, exhibits to our view elevated points, whence chains of mountains are distributed in different directions over the whole surface of the new continent. There must likewise be great reservoirs, where the most remarkable rivers take their rise, and from which they necessarily descend towards their mouths. In the southern hemisphere, this elevated belt is nearer the equator; and though it does not extend to the 50th degree, it is evidently to be met with, and may be accurately traced, between the 20th and 30th degrees. The high mountains of Tucuman and of Paraguay, which intersect South America about the 25th degree of latitude, may be considered as the American Alps. If we look into the map of the world, we shall be able to distinguish an elevated belt all along this parallel. In Africa, Monomotapa and Cafraria are covered with very high mountains, from which pretty large rivers descend. In the Pacific ocean, we find New Holland, New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, and the Friendly and the Society islands, under the same parallel. We may, therefore, with sufficient propriety, distinguish this parallel by the name of the Southern Alps, as we have already distinguished the elevated belt of the 50th degree of north latitude by that of the Northern Alps. In America, the Rio de la Plata, which after a course of 500 leagues falls into the ocean at the 35th degree of south latitude; the Pavana, which rises from the mountains of the Arap\u00e9s, and falls into the Plata at Corrient\u00e9; the great number of rivers which flow into that of the Amazonas, such as the Paraba, which receives in its course the tribute of more than 30 other rivers; the Madera, the Cuchirara, the Ucayal, &c., &c., all descend from these southern Alps. From these Alps likewise three considerable branches of mountains are detached, which\ngo by the common name of Andes or Cordilleras.\u2014The first branch, which extends towards the south, and passes out from Paraguay through Tucuman, separates Chili from those provinces and from Chinito, and is continued through Terra Magellanica as far as Terra del Fuego. The second branch, directing its course towards the equator, traverses Peru, in vain endeavouring to conceal treasures which the avarice of men has taught them to discover in its bowels; bounds the Spanish Millions; enters Terra Firme through Popayan; and unites South and North America by the Isthmus of Panama. The third division, issuing from Paraguay through Guaya and the territory of Saint Vincent, traverses Brazil, distributes ramifications into Portuguese, French, and Dutch Guiana, crosses the Orinoco, forms the mountains of Venezuela, and near Carthagena meets the second branch coming from Popayan.\n\nWe have already supposed, that the elevated belt of North America was situated about the 45th degree of north latitude; and there we imagined we recognized the continuation of the northern Alps of the old continent. This chain likewise feeds forth considerable branches on both sides. One of them is detached across the sources of the Mississippi, the Belle Riviere, and the Missouri, and at the entrance of New Mexico divides, in order to form California to the west, and the Appalachian mountains to the east. Thence proceeding through New Biscay, the audience of Guadalaxara, Old Mexico, and Guatemala, it meets at Panama the southern branch, which is part of the Alps of Paraguay. The second branch, following the course of the Mississippi, separates Louisiana from Virginia; serves as a bulwark to the United States of America; forms the Appalachian mountains in Carolina; and at last, traversing East Florida, encloses the gulf of Mexico with the Great and Little Antilles. In the north, we can trace the branches of the elevated belt; on one side observe them proceeding towards Canada, directing their course through Labrador to Hudson's Straits, and at length confounded with the rocks of Greenland, which are covered with eternal snow and ice. On the other side, we see them rising through the country of the Affinispeels and the Kullinos, as far as Michinipis and the northern Archipelago.\n\nIn tracing the course and direction of the British mountains, we shall begin with the central chain, which runs through the southern part of the island from north to south, commencing at Geltsdale, about 14 miles to the south-east of Carlisle, and ending at Land's End in Cornwall, or rather in the Scilly isles to the west of this. This chain passes from Geltsdale forest through the western districts of Durham and Yorkshire, forming the hills called Kelton Fell, Stanmore, Wildhill Fell, Wildbore Fell, Bow Fell, Home Fell, Bun Hill, &c. A little to the west of the chain stand several detached mountains, the principal of which is Skiddaw in Cumberland. Palling through Yorkshire we find Craven, Wharnside, Ingleborough, and Penygent; and on the east of Lancaster is Pendle. In this course there are several miles of coal and lead. The chain next proceeds through Derbyshire, and in this part of the ridge a great variety of valuable minerals are found, especially lead, copper, gypsum, fluor, barytic earths, mar-\n\ntial pyrites, iron ore, manganese, and several ores of zinc. About this point the ridge stretches a little into Cheshire, and seems to terminate; a central chain of somewhat less elevation may, however, still be traced, proceeding in a wavering direction towards Salisbury, and having three irregular branches, two to the east, and another running to the south-west into Cornwall. The first eastern branch proceeds towards Norfolk, and to this belong some considerable hills, especially those of Gog Magog in Cambridgeshire. The second branch passes into Kent, and diverges a little into Surrey and Hampshire. The continuation of this chain is afforded by the hills of Mendip, Polden, Ledgemoor, and Blackdown in Somersetshire; the Tores and Wilds of Dartmore in Devonshire, and the upland Downs of Cornwall. Malvern hills in Worcestershire deviate a little from the chain, but those of Cotswold in Gloucestershire appear to be a continuation of it. The principal mineral found in this ridge of mountains, after leaving Derbyshire, is the tin ore of Cornwall.\n\nWales contains many mountains, especially in its northern part, where Snowden is celebrated for its height and chalcedy fame. The top of this mountain is formed almost into a point, and commands an extensive view, not only of the neighbouring counties, but of part of Scotland and Ireland, and the isles of Mann and Anglesey. A line of mountains proceeds from Snowden along the western coast to Plinlimmon; and in this line lie Urrou Seth, Caeridris, and Moyln Vadian. A few hills of little elevation proceed towards Shropshire, among which the Wrekin is the most remarkable. Another small chain proceeds south towards Cardiff, but contains no hills of any eminence.\n\nLeaving England, and proceeding towards the north, Scotch we find the Cheviot Hills, so celebrated in the history of the border skirmishes. These form a regular ridge, running from south-west to north-east, where they join the hills of Galloway. In this part of Scotland there are several mountainous ridges running in various directions, generally north and south according to the course of the rivers; but there is, properly speaking, no uniform chain. Dumfriesshire contains several mountains, some of which are of a considerable height, especially Hartfell in Annandale, from which proceeds the celebrated chalybeate spring; Lowther near Leadhills; Blacklaw on the borders of Ayrshire; Etrick Pen, in Eskdale moor; Carnkinnon near Drumlanrigg; and Queensberry hill, which gives the title to the dukedom of that name. Proceeding towards the north, we find Pentland hills, a little to the south-west of Edinburgh, and the romantic hills of Arthur's seat and Salisbury Craigs, in the immediate vicinity of that city. On the eastern coast, before crossing the Forth, is North Berwick Law, which must be considered as closing the list of southern hills in Scotland. The principal part of these southern hills consists of calcareous earth, and argillaceous schistus; and except in those of Galloway, granite and other primitive rocks are very sparing. In the Lothian hills the calcareous strata are surmounted by vast blocks of trap, wacke, and basalt.\n\nOn the north of the Forth are the hills of Ochil, of little elevation, but celebrated for affording large quantities of agates and chalcedonies. The hills of Kinoul and Dunfinman in the eastern part of Perthshire, are generally considered the last of the lowland hills.\nThe principal northern chain of British mountains is that of the Grampian hills, extending from Loch Lomond to Stonehaven, and forming the southern boundary of the Highlands; and rising by a gradual transition from the Sidlaw hills on the east, the Carnapley hills on the west, and the Ochils in the middle. The principal mountains of this chain are Ben Lawers, Ben More, Schachallion, Ben Vorlich, Ben Lomond, and Ben Ledy. Near Ben Lawers is Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in Britain, and to the north-west of this near Fort Augustus, is the long hill of Corri Alltack. About 30 miles to the east of this is the high mountain of Cairngorm, famous for the specimens of quartzose stones found there. Numerous mountains lie in the second division of the Highlands, beyond Loch Linne, and Loch Nefs, especially on the western shore, which is crowded with hills. Few of these are considerable. To the west of Rossshire are several hills, among which Ben Chat, Ben Chalker, and Ben Golich are the most remarkable. More inland stands the high mountain of Ben Wevis, nearly equal to Ben Nevis. In most of these mountains the primitive rocks prevail, and granite is often very abundant. Few minerals, however, except iron ore, are found.\n\nIreland contains but few mountains, and none of any considerable importance. They generally form short lines, or appear in detached groups, one of the highest of which is that on the west and south of the lake of Killarney, in which is the mountain of Mangerton. A small line of hills called Sheeky mountains runs on the north-west of Bantry Bay, passing towards the east. To the northward of this stands Sligbegher and Nagles, and towards the east are the hills of Knockemdown. In the county of Leinster is a mountain of the same name, and to the south of Dublin are the Wicklow hills, from which there were lately such great expectations of golden treasure. In Ulster stand the mountains of Mourne, the highest of which, Donard, is said to be nearly the height of Mangerton. The most mountainous part of Ireland is the western peninsula of that island, towards which, in the county of Mayo, stands Nephin, one of the highest in the kingdom. On the south-east of Clewbay is the mountain of Croagh Patrick, also in the county of Mayo, which is the last Irish hill of any importance.\n\nWe cannot here with propriety enter on the theory of the formation of mountains. The hypothesis of the principal geological writers with respect to this subject, will be seen from the general view of the theories to be given in the next chapter. We may in this place only remark, that all the systems which have been constructed, to explain the formation of the primitive mountains, with respect to which there is the most dispute, may be reduced to three.\n\nIn the first of these, mountains are supposed to have been formed such as we now see them, except that they have suffered some degradations and modifications, from certain accidents posterior to their original formation, and that these mountains owed their elevation above the places which surround them, to one single accidental accumulation of more materials in one place than in another; an accumulation which might have taken place without that great precipitation which preceded and occasioned the consolidation of the crust of our globe.\n\nIn the second hypothesis, all the primitive mountains are supposed to have been raised by one cause, and in one certain manner; and the materials which compose them, to have been thrown out of their natural position. It is with respect to this raising or displacement that geologists have imagined so many different hypotheses.\n\nIn the third general theory, these mountains are supposed to have become pre-eminent from the accidental lowering or removal of the materials which originally surrounded them, whether this happened from the materials composing these mountainous situations having suffered no displacement, or that they had been themselves removed.\n\nM. Dolomieu is of opinion, that there are mountains whose situation and structure favour each of these three hypotheses.*\n\nSect. II. Of Dyker.\n\nWe have described dykes (No. 15.) to be those interruptions of the strata which are formed by perpendicular fissures filled with stony substances. As these stony matters are frequently of that kind called whinstone, these dykes are commonly called whin dykes, and the history of these is very important, as they form one of the principal subjects in the principal theories of the earth.\n\nDykes have received different denominations, descriptive, in some measure, of the nature of the substances of which they are composed; or of the seeming effects they have produced on the intersected horizontal strata. They are called basaltic veins, trap dykes, whin dykes; and in the coal countries of Scotland they are called gaws, from the idea that they have occasioned the separation of the coal, and contiguous strata, through which they run.\n\nThese dykes have been more attentively observed in coal countries, than where they occur elsewhere; because on the accurate knowledge of their course, inclination and thickness, depend, in a great measure, the judicious and successful operations of the miner, when his workings approach the dike, or render it necessary to cut through it to reach the strata of coal on the other side. But, though less attended to, they have been observed and traced in other places, where a great extent of the horizontal strata have been exposed in the beds of rivers, as in the bed of the Water of Leith, above St Bernard's Well, near Edinburgh, and on the sea shore, especially on the western coasts of Scotland, where the rocks are more abrupt and precipitous, and where the violence of the Atlantic ocean has removed part of the horizontal strata, and left the vertical strata remaining, like immense walls or dykes. Hence probably the origin of the name; and as they often consist of that species of stone called whinstone, this epithet has been added.\n\nThe course, however, of the greater number which course we have had the opportunity of examining, generally lies between the points of the compass S. and S. E., and N. and N. W. This is most frequently the course of the whin dykes of Illy and Jura; it is the course of a remarkable dyke which traverses the coal strata at the village of Stevenston, near Saltcoats, in Ayrshire; part of which is seen on the surface, not many hundred yards to the north of the west end of that village;\nChap. II.\n\nG E O L O G Y.\n\nGeneral Distribution of the Materials of the Earth.\n\nLage; and it is the course of two dykes, still more remarkable, in the island of Great Cumbrey, in the frith of Clyde.\n\nGeologists, who have treated this subject, do not seem to have marked, with much attention, the course of the dykes. They have mentioned in general terms, that they follow all directions. More extensive observation may probably show, that the most frequent directions of the principal dykes, is from north to south, or a few points deviation from that course. And if this be established, by a fuller and more accurate history of dykes, the analogy between them and metallic veins will be more complete; for it is observed of the latter, that the most powerful, that is, the most productive, run from north to south.\n\nDykes do not always run in a straight line. In their course they form certain flexuosity. But, in this winding course, the deviations are usually so small, as to have little effect on the general direction of the dyke, which, upon the whole, may be considered as nearly the same.\n\nThe continuity of dykes is sometimes interrupted, exactly in the same manner as frequently happens to the horizontal strata, and which, in technical language is termed a slip.\n\nIn the island of Islay we have observed two dykes of this description, the one on the south side of Lochindal, near the point of Laggan; the other on the shore of the south-east part of the island, a little to the south of the house of Ardmore. In both these dykes, the extent of the separation of the slip was just equal to the thickness of the dyke. The opposite sides were brought exactly into the same line.\n\nAfter this separation, these dykes, in so far as they could be traced, preserve the same thickness, course, and inclination as formerly.\n\nA very remarkable dyke has been discovered in the coal field, in the district of Boulogne in France. It runs in the form of a crescent from north to west.\n\nThe direction of dykes downwards is seldom perpendicular. This deviation from a line perpendicular to the horizon is called their inclination. The inclination of a dyke is usually denominated the hade or hading. See the article Coalery.\n\nThe inclination of different dykes, and even of the same dyke, is various, sometimes approaching to, and sometimes deviating from the perpendicular. The extent of dykes downwards, we believe, has not been ascertained with any degree of accuracy, and the termination of very few has yet been detected. The depth to which researches of this kind can be carried, is comparatively small. With all the ardour, ingenuity, and power of man, investigations to determine this point, will probably always be limited by the extent of his mining operations. The crescent-formed dyke just mentioned, which occurs in a coal-field in the district of Boulogne in France, which consists of a species of marble, found in several quarries in the vicinity, has been traced to the perpendicular depth of 600 feet, where it is succeeded by a schistus rock, which latter, with the same course and inclination, continues to intersect the horizontal strata.\n\nThe extent of dykes in length has not been accurately determined. Indeed, it must be extremely difficult to trace them with any degree of certainty. For those which are observed on the sea coast, where they are most conspicuous, soon disappear in the mountains, on the one hand, or on the other lose themselves in the sea. And, as the extent of the same coal field rarely exceeds a few miles, they have seldom been followed beyond its limits. In many cases, the change in the nature and arrangement of the strata, renders it almost impossible. Some, however, have been traced to a very great extent; one in particular, on the banks of the river Meuse in the Netherlands, has been followed in its direct course, to the distance of four leagues; and of this dyke it is observed, if pursued through all its windings, the extent is not less than six leagues.\n\nThe thickness of dykes is various. Sometimes they are observed no thicker than a few inches. From that they increase to one foot, six feet, and very often are found from 10 to 20 feet. There is one in the island of Islay, of the enormous thickness of 69 feet. This immense dyke accompanies a lead vein, about a foot thick, which is included between it and the limestone strata. In this mining field, two thin dykes, one of them 10 feet thick, have been discovered, crossing the metallic veins.\n\nIn going downwards, dykes are said to decrease in thickness. This is particularly observed of dykes of smaller magnitude. Of smaller dykes it is also said, that they diminish in thickness towards the extremities.\n\nIn one respect, some thin dykes are exactly analogous to metallic veins, in having branches, or in the miners phrase, strings going off and traversing the contiguous strata, and forming in the course they take, an acute angle with the principal dyke. A thin dyke of this description has been observed in the island of Jura, on the shore of the sound. The diverging branch terminated in a point among the horizontal strata, at the distance of a few feet from the great dyke, assuming altogether a wedge-like form.\n\nIf we include metallic veins in the account, the vertical strata may be said to be composed of every kind of mineral substance, but almost always different from the interlocked horizontal strata. By this last circumstance their occurrence is at once recognized. In general, the dykes that are found in Scotland, whether in the coal countries, or in the western coasts and islands, where they are so frequent, are of that species of stone which comes under the denomination of trap or whinstone. Dykes consisting of other species of stone, have also been found in Scotland. On the Mull of Kinloch, which forms the southern headland, at the entrance of Lochindaal, in Islay, we observed a small dyke of granite, crossing the headland, which is of granular quartz. There are some vertical strata of granite in the island of Icolmkill, of pitchstone in the island of Arran, and of serpentine at Portloch in Banffshire.\n\nBergman, in his Physical Geography, supposes that granite was never found to be a component part of vertical strata. What has been already mentioned proves the contrary. Granite dykes have also been discovered in other places. Bellon has observed dykes of this description on the great road between Limoges and Cahors in France, traversing horizontal strata of argillaceous schistus, a species of stone which has generally been considered of later formation than granite. These dykes, he observes, are from an inch to six\nfix feet in thickness, and the quartz, feldspar, and mica, are of larger size than are usually found in the granite of mountains. Dolomieu has made a similar observation, and considers it as a discriminative character, by which the granite of mountains and that found in vertical strata may be easily distinguished. But this is not always to be admitted as a characteristic mark of distinction. The granite dyke which has been already mentioned, crossing the granular quartz, on the Mull of Kinloch in Islay, is small grained, and others of this latter description have been observed in other places.\n\nThere is a very singular dyke on the coast of Ayrshire, between Weems bay and Largs, near the house of Kelly. It is about ten feet thick, traverses the horizontal strata, which consist of plumb-pudding rock, whose cement is sandstone of a red colour, from northeast to southwest, and crosses a larger dike of the whinstone of this country, nearly at right angles. This dike is composed of different materials. Part is of the common whinstone, and part of a plumb-pudding rock, cemented by the matter of the dyke; and these alternate with each other, both in the thickness of the dyke, and lengthwise. On one side, there are four feet thick of whinstone; immediately in contact with this there is plum-pudding stone three feet thick, and so on alternately, across the whole dyke. In tracing the dyke lengthwise across the whole line, there is found a few yards of whinstone, which is succeeded by a few yards of plum-pudding stone, and this is again succeeded by the whinstone.\n\nBut, for the general view which is here proposed, it is not requisite to give a full account of all the mineral substances which enter into the composition of vertical strata, or even a minute enumeration of all the varieties that are found in whin dykes.\n\nOne of the most singular circumstances respecting structure of whin dykes, which seems to have been entirely overlooked by geologists, still remains to be considered. This is the peculiar structure or arrangement of the parts of which they are composed. Of this peculiar arrangement it may be observed in general, that it is in all respects the reverse of what takes place in the horizontal strata.\n\nWhen the dyke is of small magnitude, it is pretty compact in all its parts; but if an attempt be made to break or separate any part of it, the fracture will be found to run most readily in the perpendicular direction. But when the dyke is of more considerable thickness, it usually forms several divisions, marked by perpendicular fissures, and there is often very great variety in the nature and qualities of the several divisions of the same dyke. The exterior division of one side sometimes, and sometimes the exterior division of both sides, are of a softer texture than the intermediate division; and often contain, in great proportion, specks of radiated zeolite and calcareous spar, while the middle divisions, as well as being harder, are also more homogeneous. In other cases, the reverse of this appears. The middle parts of the dyke are the softest and least compact, exhibiting the greatest variety of heterogeneous substances.\n\nSome whin dykes have a great tendency to assume, when broken, the prismatic form. This is the case with many, even of the most compact texture. In others, where the side of the dyke is exposed to view, and minutely examined, fissures may be traced, discovering the ends of pretty regular prisms. But in some dykes in the island of Jura, the prismatic columns are entirely separated, and lying loose, are four, five, or six-sided, jointed; the perpendicular fissures forming the joints, and in all respects similar to the perpendicular basaltic columns, except being in the horizontal position. In one of the dykes in the island of Jura, the columns are from 12 to 18 inches in diameter. In some others on the sea shore, near the house of Mr Campbell of Jura, and at the harbour of the small isles, in the same island, there are columns of the enormous size of 10 and 12 feet diameter.\n\nA dyke which traverses the basaltic strata of the Giants Causeway in the north of Ireland, exhibits still more remarkably this peculiarity of structure. The smallest masses detached from it assume the columnar form, and most of them are perfectly regular. The fracture invariably runs in the horizontal direction; the columns consequently lie in the same position, are three, four, five, and six-sided, and are generally of small size.\n\nSect. III. Of Metallic Veins.\n\nThe history of metallic veins, although far from being so full and satisfactory as could be wished, is more complete than that of whin dykes. The latter have excited no farther attention than as objects of curiosity to the geologist, or as singular facts in establishing a theory, and when they come in the way of the operations of the miner, to discover their connexion with the contiguous strata; while the wants and luxuries of man have roused ingenuity and exertion in exploring the former, on account of the precious and useful metals with which they are stored. Thus, the splendour and beauty of some metallic substances, and the utility of others, have made them in all ages be esteemed and valued by mankind; and consequently they have been the constant objects of pursuit and investigation. It is obvious that the beauty and utility of metals, on account of which they are so much valued and sought after, excite greater interest in procuring them; on the one hand, the researches and observations of the philosopher in furnishing the history and general principles, and, on the other, the immediate application of this knowledge, and of these principles, in the practice and operations of the miner.\n\nThe history of whin dykes is, in general, quite analogous to metallic veins; but, of the latter, from what has been stated, we can speak with more certainty and precision.\n\nThree different kinds of metallic veins have been described by geological writers; the perpendicular vein, the pipe vein, and the flat or dilated vein. We shall consider each of these in their order.\n\n1. Of the perpendicular vein.\u2014This kind of metallic perpendicular vein occurs most frequently. As may be expected, it has veins in various its course or direction, thickness, and inclination. Metallic veins are found running in every direction; but, in general, the most powerful veins, that is, the most productive, are observed to run from north to south, or at least a few points deviation from that course; and when any deviation happens, it is usually to the east of north, and to the west of south.\n\nThe course or direction of a vein is called in technical terms...\ncal language its bearing. The extent of a vein in the line of bearing, we believe, rarely exceeds the range of mountains in which it is discovered. This is the case with the principal vein at Leadhills. It is limited to the chain of mountains in which the operations are now carried on; and although the mines of Wanlockhead are not a mile distant, new veins appear with galena or lead ore, of quite a different quality, and all the accompanying minerals, whether forming part of the vein, or found in cavities, are also quite different from the lead ore and other minerals found in the veins at Leadhills.\n\nThe inclination of veins is various. Sometimes they are nearly perpendicular; sometimes they deviate considerably from a perpendicular line; sometimes the same vein in its course downward, inclines to one side; sometimes it is perpendicular, and sometimes it inclines to the other side. When the deviation from the perpendicular does not exceed 10\u00b0, the vein is still considered as a perpendicular or vertical vein. When a vein is inclined, the two sides which include the metallic substances are in very different positions, and have consequently received from the miners different names. That side which supports the metallic ore, or on which it seems to lean, is called the ledger side, or simply the ledger. The opposite side which covers the ore, or which overhangs it, is denominated the hanging side, or simply the hanger. From the inclination of the vein being varied in its course downwards, it must appear that the same sides, according as the inclination varies, must change their position and denomination. This will perhaps be more intelligible by the section at fig. 5, in which AA represents the vein; BB, CC, DD, EE, the strata intersected by it; 1. the hanger; 2. the ledger; 3. the hanger; and, 4. the ledger.\n\nThe thickness of veins, and indeed of the same vein, is also extremely various. Sometimes they are only a few inches thick. From this they increase to the thickness of several feet. The veins which were wrought at Leadhills, about seven years ago, were from two to six feet within the sides; but some years before that time the principal vein in those mines, by the addition of two strings or small veins, assumed the extraordinary thickness of 14 feet of pure ore. This unusual appearance, both on account of its richness and grandeur, excited so much attention and admiration, that the countess of Hopetoun undertook a journey to these inferior regions, not less than 150 fathoms below the surface of the earth, to witness the splendour and brilliancy of this subterranean apartment. The uncommon thickness and abundant riches of this vein are still talked of at Leadhills with enthusiasm. But a thicker vein was once wrought at Slangunog in Wales. Fifteen feet of clean ore were for some time dug out of this vein. The fire, however, far exceeded by the copper veins in the Parys mountain in Anglesea, which are described by Mr Pennant in his Welsh tour. The thickness of one of these veins is 21 feet, and of another 66 feet.\n\nThe broadest metallic vein, of which we have any account, is, we believe, that of the Ecton copper mine, in Derbyshire. In this mine there was worked, at one time, a heap of ore, of the astonishing extent of 70 yards from side to side.\n\nThe extent of veins downwards has in many cases been ascertained. To the regret and disappointment of the miner, they have been frequently intercepted and entirely cut off by the horizontal strata. The rich vein of lead ore at Slangunog in Wales, which we have already mentioned, was intercepted in this manner by a stratum of black schistus or sliver, the nature of which is not described by Williams, who states the fact. Their researches to recover their lost wealth, which were prosecuted for several years, proved altogether fruitless. p. 274. The smallest trace of this unusually productive vein was never afterwards discovered.\n\nTwo kinds of perpendicular mineral veins have been observed and described. In the one case the relative position of the strata which contain the metallic substances is exactly similar to that of the coal strata when they are intercepted by a whitish dyke. On one side of the vein the strata are elevated or depressed from their former plane. This is illustrated by fig. 5, where the letters BB, CC, DD, EE, mark the corresponding strata which have been deranged or displaced. In the other kind of vein the mineral substances containing the metallic ores are merely separated without any elevation or depression; for each side of the fissure fill remaining in its former plane, the opposite sides of the divided strata exactly correspond to each other. The mines at Strontian in Argyleshire are of this latter description.\n\nVeins of this kind have frequently smaller veins, or, as they are called in the language of the miners, strings, which run off at an acute angle, preserve their course for some distance, not, in general, very great, gradually diminish in thickness, and at last are entirely lost among the contiguous strata. At the place of junction the principal vein is always thicker, as has been already noticed with regard to the unusual thickness of the principal vein at Leadhills.\n\nTo this account of perpendicular veins we may add, that some veins are found crossing each other, and that white dykes have also been discovered intersecting metallic veins. Examples of the latter occur in the island of Ilay.\n\n2. Of the pipe vein.\u2014The perpendicular vein last described, intercepted or cut the strata across. What has been denominated the pipe vein is extremely limited in the line of bearing, but having the same inclination as the strata which include it. It may be considered as in some measure of a circular form, extremely irregular, and always following the course of the strata between which it is included, like the perpendicular veins; sometimes it dips downwards, it is enlarged; sometimes it is diminished, and sometimes it is so much contracted, that the including strata come into close contact. In a word, this kind of vein is subject to all the irregularities of the veins formerly described, only that its inclination is invariably the same with the accompanying strata.\n\n3. The flat or dilated vein.\u2014This kind of metallic vein, after what has been said with regard to other veins, will require but a short description. It is exactly similar to the pipe vein, only that it is more extended in the line of bearing. It is included between the horizontal strata; and therefore its inclination or dip must be the same as the including strata. A vein of this kind might with more propriety and accuracy be regarded as a metallic horizontal stratum, were it not...\nthat it is always found varying in its dimensions, and equally irregular as the perpendicular veins which intersect the horizontal strata.\n\nIt is almost needless to add, that the flat or horizontal veins are subject to the same derangement as the coal strata, when they are intersected by a thin dyke. The vein, along with the including strata, is either elevated or depressed, and the same thing takes place when they are traversed by a metallic vein.\n\nTo finish the sketch of the history of metallic veins, we have only to enumerate the different metallic ores that occur in them, and to mention the places where these are found in greatest abundance. In this enumeration we shall follow the arrangement of metals given by Brochant, in the second volume of his Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Min\u00e9ralogie.\n\nIn naming the several species, we shall adopt the nomenclature of Kirwan, adding the French and German synonyms to each. As it would far exceed our limits to give even a cursory description of the several species, we refer the reader for that to the article Min\u00e9ralogy in this work, or to the elementary treatises of Kirwan or Brochant, or the more extensive treatise of Ha\u00fcy.\n\nI. Platina\n\nHas been found hitherto only in its metallic or native state, and it has as yet only been met with in South America, especially at Choco in New Grenada. It is found in the sand of rivulets, and probably comes from the primitive mountains.\n\nII. Gold.\n\nNative gold.\u2014This is found principally in primitive mountains, sometimes in veins, and sometimes disseminated through the stony matter. The substances which most commonly accompany it are quartz, feldspar, calcareous spar, heavy spar, pyrites, red silver ore and vitreous silver ore, and galena. Gold is still more commonly met with in the sand washed from certain rivers. The countries where gold is chiefly found in rocky substances, are Hungary, Transylvania, Peru, Mexico, Siberia, and Sweden. It has also been found in France, near the town of Olifans, in the department of the Ille; but not in sufficient abundance to render the working of the mine profitable. Among the rivers whose sands furnish gold, we may enumerate the Rhine, the Danube, and the Aranofch in Transylvania.\n\nGold has been found in several parts of the British dominions, especially at Silloe in Bedfordshire, in the Wicklow hills in Ireland, and in the neighbourhood of Leadhills in Lanarkshire. It is said that a jeweller, who died lately in Dublin, often declared that gold, to the value of 30,000l., had passed through his hands, which was brought from the Wicklow hills. This mine is now in the hands of government, but we believe does not answer the expectation that was first formed as to its produce. General Dirom informs us, that in the reign of James V. of Scotland, 300 men were employed for several summers in washing the sand near Leadhills, for gold, of which they are said to have collected to the amount of 100,000l. sterling. It is said that pieces of gold, an ounce in weight, have been found at Leadhills, and that Lord Hopecum has a piece still larger in his possession.\n\nIII. Mercury.\n\nSpecies 1. Native Mercury, or Quicksilver. Le Mercure natif. Gedigen Queckf\u00fcller.\u2014This is found at Idria in the Austrian territories; at Almaden in Spain, at Stahlberg and Mochellandberg in the Palatinate, and a few other places.\n\nWe are told by Mr Jamefon, that a quantity of quicksilver was discovered some years ago in a peat moss, in the island of Ilay, and he thinks it probable that veins of it may be still found there.*\n\nSpecies 2. Natural Amalgama. L'Amalgame naturel. Vol. tif. Naturaliches Amalgam.\u2014This consists of mercury and silver, in very variable proportions. It is found at Saldberg in Sweden; at Rofleau in Hungary, and especially at Mochellandberg in the duchy of Deux Ponts, where it is found mixed with common ferruginous clay, and with other ores of mercury.\n\nSpecies 3. Mercury Mineralized by the Sulphuric and Muriatic Acids. Mercure Corne\u00e9 ou Muriat\u00e9. Queckf\u00fcller Hornzer.\u2014This species was discovered about 30 years ago, in the mines of Mochellandberg, and at Morefeld, in the duchy of Deux Ponts, by M. Woulfe, mixed with ferruginous clay, quartz, lithomarge, native quicksilver, and cinnabar. It has also been found at Almaden in Spain, and at Herowitz in Bohemia; but it is very rare.\n\nSpecies 4. Native Cinnabar. Le Cinnabre. Zinnober.\u2014This usually forms a gangue for the other ores of mercury. It occurs in the stratified mountains, pretty near the surface. This ore is found in a great many parts of Europe, especially at Almaden in Spain, Idria in the Austrian territories, at Mochellandberg, in Bohemia, in Saxony, in Hungary, in Transylvania, in the Palatinate, and in France; but in this last it is found but in small quantity.\n\nIV. Silver.\n\nSpecies 1. Native Silver.\u2014A particular variety of silver ores, this species, mixed with gold, is very rare. It is principally found in Congisberg in Norway, and Schlangenberg in Siberia. In the former of these places it is found disseminated through calcareous spar, fluor spar, and rock crystal, in a vein running through a rock of hornblende slate, and accompanied with blende, galena, and pyrites. That of Siberia is found distributed through a mass of heavy spar.\n\nCommon native silver is found in considerable quantity in Mexico and Peru. It is also met with in Siberia, Saxony, France, Sweden, Norway, in the Hartz, and in Bohemia. It is principally found in the primitive mountains, distributed through masses of heavy spar, quartz, calcareous spar, fluor spar, pyrites, blende, cobalt, galena, red silver ore, and vitreous silver ore.\n\nSilver has been found in several parts of Britain, especially near Alva in Scotland. It is confidently affirmed, that a mass of capillary silver, weighing 16 oz., was found in the lead mines at Garthoines in the isle of Ilay, mixed with galena \u2020.\n\nSpecies 2. Antimonated Native Silver. L'Argent Antimonial. Spiegglas Silber.\u2014This species has hitherto been only found in the mine at St Wenceslas at Altwolfach, and in the duchy of Wurtemberg, in a vein mixed with calcareous spar, heavy spar, native silver, and quartz.\nSpecies 3. Arseniated Native Silver. L'Argent Arsenical. Ars\u00e9nik Silber.\u2014This is also rare, having been found only at Andreasberg, in the Harz, and at Raffala in Spain. In the Harz it is mixed with native arsenic, red silver ore, galena, blende, and calcareous spar. Considerable quantities of silver, probably of this species of ore, are obtained from the lead ore of Leadhills.\n\nSpecies 4. Corneous Silver Ore, or Muriated Silver. L'Argent Corne ou Muri\u00e9. Horn Erz.\u2014This has been found in Peru, Mexico, Saxony, France, Siberia, and, as is affirmed, in Cornwall in England.\n\nSpecies 5. Sooty Silver Ore. L'Argent Noir. Silberschwarz.\u2014This is found in Saxony, France, and Hungary, mixed with other ores of silver, and sometimes with native silver.\n\nSpecies 6. Vitreous Silver Ore. L'Argent Vitreux. Silberglaferz.\u2014This is found in Bohemia, Saxony, Norway, Swabia, Siberia, and in Hungary, mixed with other silver ores, and usually accompanying calcareous spar, heavy spar, and fluor spar.\n\nSpecies 7. Red Silver Ore. L'Argent Rouge. Rothgittegerz.\u2014This is found in the Harz, Bohemia, Saxony, France, Swabia, and in Hungary, accompanying native arsenic, realgar, vitreous silver ore, galena, calcareous spar, and heavy spar.\n\nV. Copper.\n\nSpecies 1. Native Copper. This is met with in Siberia, the Uralian and Altai-chan mountains, Kamtschatka, Japan, Saxony, France, Sweden, Hungary, Palatinate, and near Redruth in Cornwall, in England. It usually accompanies other ores of copper, especially malachite and copper azure.\n\nSpecies 2. Vitreous Copper Ore. Le Cuivre Vitreux. Kupferglas.\u2014This is found in Siberia, Hungary, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Saxony, Silesia, Hesse, and in Cornwall.\n\nSpecies 3. Purple Copper Ore. La Mine de Cuivre Violette. Buntkupfererz.\u2014This is always found in the neighbourhood of other copper ores, especially with the species last mentioned, and with copper pyrites. It is found in Saxony, Bohemia, the Bannat in Transylvania, the Harz, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Hungary, Hesse, and in Derbyshire in England, especially in the famous Eton copper mine.\n\nSpecies 4. Yellow Pyrites, or Yellow Copper Ore. La Pyrite cuivreuse. Kupferkies.\u2014This is the most common species of copper ore, and is found both in primitive and secondary mountains, sometimes in beds, and sometimes in veins. It occurs most abundantly in Bohemia, Saxony, Hungary, Sweden, France, Spain, and especially in Britain, where it forms one of the principal varieties of copper ores, found in the famous Parys mine in the Isle of Anglesea.\n\nSpecies 5. White Copper Ore. La Mine de Cuivre Blanche. Wei\u00dfkupfererz.\u2014This species is very rare, but it has been found in Saxony in the mines of Freiberg, in Hesse, in W\u00fcrttemberg, and in Siberia, with other copper ores.\n\nSpecies 6. Gray Copper Ore. Le Cuivre Gris. Faulerz.\u2014This again is a very common species, and is found in all those countries that possess mines of copper.\n\nSpecies 7. Black Copper Ore. Le Cuivre Noir. Kupfer schwarz.\u2014This is found mixed with malachite and with green and blue copper ores in Saxony, Hungary, in the Bannat, in Silesia, in Norway, in Russia, in Swabia, in Sweden, and in Siberia. It also occurs in the Parys mine of Anglesea.\n\nSpecies 8. Florid Red Copper Ore. Mine de Cuivre Rouge. Roth-kupfererz.\u2014This usually accompanies native copper, malachite, and brown earthy iron ore. It is met with in Saxony, in the Bannat, in the Harz, in Norway, in Siberia, near Cologne, and in Cornwall.\n\nSpecies 9. Brick-red Copper Ore. Le Mine de Cuivre couleur de Brique. Ziegelerz.\u2014Found in similar situations with the preceding.\n\nSpecies 10. Blue Californian Copper Ore. L'Azur de Cuivre. Kupperlazur.\u2014Found in the Bannat, in Hesse, in Salzburg, in Poland, in Siberia, in Thuringia, and in the Tyrol. It is usually imbedded in clay marl, or in sandstone, not far below the surface of the earth.\n\nSpecies 11. Malachite.\u2014This is always found mixed with other copper ores, and occurs in most of the copper mines that have been enumerated.\n\nSpecies 12. Mountain Green. Le Vert de Cuivre. Kupfergoum.\u2014This commonly accompanies species 4, 6, 9, 10, and 11. It is found in Saxony, in the Harz, in Norway, Silesia, Siberia, Hungary, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Britain, as at Leadhills and in Derbyshire.\n\nSpecies 13. Olive Copper Ore. Mine de couleur Olive. Olivenzerz.\u2014This species is extremely rare. It has been found chiefly near Karrarach in Cornwall, where it is accompanied by species 11 and 12, and brown iron ore in a gangue of yellow lithomarge mixed with quartz. It is said to have been found also at Jonsbach near Rusteletadt in Silesia.\n\nVI. Iron.\n\nSpecies 1. Native Iron.\u2014This species is very uncommon; but it has been met with in several places, especially at Kammlorff and Eibenstock in Saxony, at Kranjnjarsk near Jenisei in Siberia, at Olumba near St Jago in South America, and Oulle near Grenoble in France. The two most remarkable specimens of native iron are those found in South America and in Siberia. The former of these forms a mass weighing at least 300 quintals, or 15 tons. It is soft and malleable, and in every respect like the purest iron. That of Siberia is a spheroidal mass, weighing about 14 quintals, resting on the surface of the earth, near the summit of a mountain. Its texture is cellular, and its cavities are filled with a transparent, greenish, vitreous matter. No mines or veins of iron are in the neighbourhood of either.\n\nSpecies 2. Martial Pyrites. Pyrite Martiale. Schwefelkies.\u2014This species is one of the most common ores of iron, and is found abundantly in every country where there are any other ores of iron. There are three varieties of it described by Brochant, which are less common, but they are also found in many places.\n\nSpecies 3. Magnetic Pyrites. La Pyrite Magn\u00e9tique. Magnetkies.\u2014This has been found only in primitive rocks, especially in micaceous schistus, accompanied by quartz, hornblende, &c., and usually lying in beds mixed with other pyrites, galena, and magnetic iron.\nSpecies 4. Magnetic Ironstone. Le Fer Magn\u00e9tique. Magnetischer Eifenstein.\u2014Of this there are three varieties, the common magnetic ore, which is very common in primitive mountains, especially those that are composed of gneiss and micaceous schistus. It is often in great abundance, forming large beds, or even whole mountains. It is found in greatest quantity in Saxony, Bohemia, Italy, Corsica, Silefia, Siberia, Norway, and especially in Sweden. The second variety, called fibrous magnetic ironstone, is uncommon, but is found at Bibsburg in Sweden. The third, which Kirwan calls magnetic sand, is found in the banks of some rivers, particularly of the Elbe, as also in Sweden and Italy.\n\nSpecies 5. Specular Iron-ore. Le Fer Sp\u00e9ciaire. Eifenglanz.\u2014This is found in many places, often in considerable quantity, especially in Saxony, Bohemia, France, Normandy, Prussia, Sweden, Siberia, Hungary, Corsica, and the island of Elba. It is generally found only in primitive mountains, sometimes in beds, sometimes in veins, accompanied with quartz, hornblende, martite pyrites, and magnetic iron ore.\n\nSpecies 6. Red Scaly Iron-ore. La Mine de Fer Rouge. Roth-Eisenstein.\u2014This is rather rare, but is found in several parts of Saxony, in the Hartz, in Nassau, in Thuringia and Hungary. Another variety of the same species, the compact red ironstone of Kirwan, is much more common, being found in Saxony, Bohemia, the Hartz, Hesse, Siberia, and in France, sometimes in veins, and sometimes in beds, commonly mixed with the two following species, and with argillaceous ironstone, quartz, hornblende, and calcareous spar.\n\nA third variety, the common hematites or bloodstone, which is one of the most productive iron ores, is always found accompanying the last variety, and is of course met with in most of the situations above enumerated. It is procured in abundance in several parts of England, as in Derbyshire, but more especially at Ulverston in Lancashire, where there is one perpendicular vein of it 30 yards wide, in a rock of limestone. Large quantities of it are carried to Carron, where it is melted with the common Carron ironstone.\n\nSpecies 7. Brown Iron ore. La Mine de Fer Brune. Braun-eisenstein.\u2014Of this there are several varieties, of which the compact brown ironstone, and the brown hematites, are very common; but the brown scaly iron ore is rather rare. The last is found at Kamldorf in Saxony, at Klauffel, in the Hartz, at Lauterick in the Palatinate, and at Naiala in the principality of Bareith.\n\nSpecies 8. Calcareous iron ore. Le Fer Spathique. Spathiger-eisenstein.\u2014This is found both in primary and secondary mountains, and there are few veins of iron which do not contain it in greater or less quantity.\n\nSpecies 9. Black Ironstone. La Mine de Fer Noire. Schwarz-eisenstein.\u2014This is found in the principality of Bareith, in the Hartz, Saxony, Hesse, and Palatinate.\n\nThe common argillaceous iron ore of Kirwan, is ranked by Brochant as a variety of this. It is very common in most iron countries, and much of it is found in Britain, especially in Colebrook-dale, Shropshire, and in Dean forest in Gloucestershire. The Carron ore is principally of this kind.\n\nSpecies 10. Lowland iron ore. La Mine de Fer de Gazon. Rasen-eisenstein.\u2014There are several varieties of this, all of which are found in low, humid situations, in very extensive beds, alternating with sandstone, clay, &c. This species is much more abundant in the north than in the south of Europe, especially in the duchy of Brandenburg, in Courland, Lithuania, Livonia, Prussia, Prussian Poland, and Lusatia.\n\nSpecies 11. Blue Martial Earth. Le Fer Terreux bleu. Blaue-eifererde.\u2014This is found imbedded in clay and similar earths, and often accompanies the last species. It occurs in Saxony, Silefia, Swabia, Bavaria, Poland, Siberia, and the Palatinate.\n\nSpecies 12. Green Martial Earth. Le Fer Terreux vert. Grun-eifererde.\u2014This species is uncommon, having been found only at Braunsdorf, and Schneeberg in Saxony, in veins, accompanying quartz and sulphur pyrites.\n\nSpecies 13. Emery. L'Emeril. Schmirgel.\u2014This is found in Saxony, distributed in a bed of hardened steatites, in sandstone. It is also found in Italy, Spain, Peru, the isle of Naxos in the Archipelago, where there is a cape called by the Italians, Capo Smiriglio, or the Emery Cape. It is often mixed with particles of magnetic iron ore, whence some have supposed the emery to be magnetic.\n\nVII. LEAD.\n\nSpecies 1. La Gal\u00e9ne Commune. Gemeiner-Blei glanz.\u2014This is the most common and abundant ore of lead, and is found both in primitive and secondary strata, in beds and veins, accompanied with quartz, fluor spar, calcareous spar, sparry iron ore, barytic earths, blende, pyrites, and several ores of silver. It is found in great abundance at Leadhills and at Wanlockhead in Dumfriesshire, in Derbyshire, Strontian in Scotland, and in the Mendip hills in Somersetshire. A variety of this, called compact galena, is found in the same situations, especially in Derbyshire. It has often been confounded with graphite, or plumbago.\n\nWerner enumerates nearly 20 formations, as he calls them, of galena, but Mr Jameson thinks the galena formation in Dumfriesshire is different from any of these.\n\nSpecies 2. Blue Lead Ore. La Mine de Plomb Bleue. Blau-blei-erz.\u2014This species has as yet been found only at Zichopau in Saxony, accompanying flor spar, barytic spar, white and black lead, and malachite.\n\nSpecies 3. Brown Lead Ore. La Mine de Plomb Brune. Braun-bleierz.\u2014This species is also very rare, but is found at the same place with the last, and also in Bohemia, Brittany and Hungary.\n\nSpecies 4. Black Lead Ore. La Mine de Plomb Noire. Schwarz-bleierz.\u2014This is found in Saxony, at Freyberg, at Zichopau, in Cumberland, in some parts of Scotland, in Poland, and Siberia.\n\nSpecies 5. White Lead Ore. La Mine de Plomb Blanche. Weiss-bleierz.\u2014This is not a very abundant species, but it is found in several lead mines, especially in Bohemia, Saxony, the Hartz, France, Siberia, Hungary Carinthia, and in some of the British lead mines, especially at Leadhills.\n\nSpecies 6. Green Lead Ore. Phosphorated lead ore of Kirwan. La Mine de Plomb Vert. Green-bleierz.\u2014This is found in veins, more commonly in the primitive mountains. It is met with in Bohemia, Saxony, Bavaria,\nSpecies 7. Red Lead Spar. Le Plomb Rouge. Rothes-bleierz.\u2014This is one of the rarest ores of lead, being as yet only found at Ekatharenburg in Siberia.\n\nSpecies 8. Yellow Lead Spar. Le Plomb jaune. Gelbes-bleierz.\u2014This has been known only for a few years. It has been found at Bleiberg in Carinthia, in a gangart of calcareous stone. It has also been found near Freyberg in Saxony, at Annaberg in Austria, and at Reczbanya in Hungary.\n\nSpecies 9. Native Vitriol of Lead. Le Vitriol de Plomb natif. Naturbisher-blei-vitriol.\u2014This is found in the ille of Anglesea, in a vein of brown iron ore, mixed with copper pyrites. It is also found at Leadhills in Scotland.\n\nSpecies 10. Earthly Lead Ore.\u2014Of this there are two varieties, the friable and the indurated. The former is found in Saxony, in Lorraine, in Poland, and Siberia, Bohemia, and Silezia. The latter is found in most lead mines. Mr Jameon notices two varieties of lead earth, which he calls white-lead earth, and friable lead earth, as met with at Leadhills.\n\nVIII. Tin.\n\nSpecies 1. Tin Pyrites. La Pyrite d'Etain, Zinnkies. This species is very rare, and is, we believe, found only in Cornwall, at Wheal rock, among copper pyrites.\n\nSpecies 2. Common Tinstone. La Pierre d'Etain, Zinnstein.\u2014This is found chiefly in primitive rocks, as in granite, gneiss, micaceous schistus, and porphyry, both in masses and veins. It is the common ore of Cornwall, and is found also in Saxony, Bohemia, and the East Indies.\n\nSpecies 3. Wood Tin Ore. L'Etain greret, Zinnerz.\u2014This is found in Cornwall, in the parishes of Columb, St Denis and Roach, accompanying the former.\n\nIX. Bismuth.\n\nSpecies 1. Native Bismuth.\u2014Bismuth is a very rare metal, but is most commonly found in its native state. It is usually in a gangart of quartz, calcareous spar, and barytic spar. It occurs in Bohemia, in Saxony, in the territory of Hanau, in Swabia, in Sweden, and in France, in the mines of Brittany.\n\nSpecies 2. Sulphurated Bismuth. La Gal\u00e8ne de Bismuth, Wismuth Glanz.\u2014This is very rare. It commonly accompanies the former, and is found at Joachimthal, in Bohemia, at Johann-Georgenstadt, Schwarzenberg, and Altenberg in Saxony, and at Ridderyttan in Sweden.\n\nSpecies 3. Bismuth Ochre. L'Ochre de Bismuth, Wismuth \u00d6kker.\u2014This is still more rare than the last, and is chiefly found near Schneeberg in Saxony, and at Joachimthal in Bohemia.\n\nX. Zinc.\n\nSpecies 1. Blende. This is sulphurated zinc, and is one of the most common ores of that metal. There are three varieties; the brown, the yellow, and the black. Of these the yellow is the most rare, and is found in Saxony, in Bohemia, in the Hartz, in Norway, Transylvania, and Hungary. The brown and the black are found in most of these places, and besides in France and England, especially in Derbyshire.\n\nSpecies 2. Calamine. La Calamine, Galmeil.\u2014Of this there are two varieties, compact and striated. Both occur only in particular stratiform rocks, often forming entire beds with indurated clay, and calcareous spar. The latter is usually found in the cavities of the former. Both occur in Bohemia, in Carinthia, and in most of the German lead mines. They are also found in Britain, especially at Leadhills, Wanlock-head, and in Derbyshire.\n\nXI. Antimony.\n\nSpecies 1. Native Antimony.\u2014This is very rare. It was discovered at Sahlberg in Sweden, in the year 1748, in a gangart of some calcareous stone, and it was also found some years ago at Allemont in France, accompanying other ores of antimony and of cobalt.\n\nSpecies 2. Sulphurated Antimony. L'Antimoine Gris. Grau-fpeis glas-erz.\u2014There are several varieties of this, as the compact sulphurated antimony, found at Braundorf in Saxony; at Goldgronach in the principality of Bareith; at Maguria in Hungary, and Auvergne in France; foliated sulphurated antimony, found at Braundorf and Goldgronach, and in the Hartz, and Transylvania; striated sulphurated antimony, found in Saxony, Hungary, France, Swabia, Tuscany, Sweden, the Hartz, Spain, and in England; plumose antimonial ore, found at Freyberg in Saxony, at Braundorf and Stahlberg, and at Chemnitz in Hungary.

Grau-braunstein-erz.\u2014There are several varieties of this, but they are all commonly found near each other, in veins or in masses, commonly in the primitive mountains.\n\nThey are found in considerable quantity in many mines in Saxony, Bohemia, Bavaria, and Hungary. They are also met with in France, and in several parts in Britain, as in Derbyshire, Leadhills, and Wansbeckhead; in the Mendip hills, and the isle of Jura.\n\nSpecies 2. Red Manganese ore. Le Manganefe rouge. Roth-Cronstein-erz. This is very rare, but is found at Katnick, Offenbanya, and especially at Nagyag in Transylvania, at which last place it is found in a gold mine.\n\nXV.

Of the most Remarkable Theories of the Earth.\n\nA late writer considers the proper object of a theory of the earth, to be the tracing the series of those revolutions which have taken place on the surface of the earth; to explain their causes, and thus to connect together all the indications of change that are found in the mineral kingdom. He justly observes, that the formation of such a theory requires an accurate and extensive examination of the phenomena of geology, and that it is inconsistent with any, but a very advanced state of the physical sciences. There is perhaps no research in those sciences more arduous than this; none where the subject is so complex, where the appearances are so diversified, or so widely scattered; and where the causes that have operated are so remote from the sphere of observation.\n\nWith such requisites, and under such difficulties, it is not surprising that so many who have aimed at constructing theories of the earth, have failed in the attempt. It certainly requires a prodigious accumulation of facts, together with a talent for observation, and for arrangement, which are seldom found united. We shall presently see how far those theories which have hitherto been framed to account for the changes that the earth has undergone, have been successful.\n\nIt is not, however, to be supposed, that a correct theory of the earth is impossible, though some may think it an arrogant, if not a presumptuous undertaking, to attempt explaining how the present state of the globe and the revolutions which it has undergone, were brought about. The time is perhaps not far distant when the present prevailing hypothesis will be improved into a rational, and so far as is consistent with the knowledge and acquirements of man, a perfect system.\n\nDr Kirwan has laid down certain laws of reasoning; which should be adhered to inviolably in investigations of this kind. The first is, that no effect should be attributed to a cause whose known properties are inadequate to its production. The second is, that no cause should be adduced, whose existence is not proved either by actual experience or approved testimony. Many natural phenomena have arisen or do arise, in times or places so distant, that well conditioned testimony concerning them cannot, without manifest absurdity, be rejected. Thus the inhabitants of the northern parts of Europe, who have never felt earthquakes, nor seen volcanoes, must nevertheless admit, from mere testimony, that the first have been, and that the second do actually exist. The third is, that no powers should be ascribed to an alleged cause, but those that it is known by actual observation to possess in appropriated circumstances.\n\nThe first who formed this amusement of earth-making into a system, was the celebrated Thomas Burnet; a Burnet, man of polite learning, and rapid imagination. His sacred theory, as he calls it, describing the changes which the earth has undergone, or shall hereafter undergo, is well known for the warmth with which it is imagined, and the weakness with which it is reasoned; for the elegance of its style, and the neatness of its philosophy. The earth, says he, before the deluge, was very differently formed from what it is at present; it was at first a fluid mass; a chaos composed of various substances, differing both in density and figure; those which were heaviest sunk to the centre, and formed in the middle of our globe a hard solid body; those of a lighter nature remained next; and the waters, which were lighter still, swam upon its surface, and covered the earth on every side. The air, and all those fluids which were lighter than water, floated upon this aloft, and in the same manner encompassed the globe; so that between the surrounding body of waters, and the circumambient air, there was formed a coat of oil, and other unctuous substances, lighter than water. However, as the air was still extremely impure, and must have carried up with it many of those earthly particles with which it once was intimately blended, it soon began to defecate, and to deposit these particles upon the oily surface already mentioned, which soon uniting, the earth and oil formed that crust which soon became an habitable surface, giving life to vegetation, and dwelling to animals.\n\nThis imaginary antediluvian abode was very different from what we see it at present. The earth was light and rich, and formed of a substance entirely adapted to the feeble state of incipient vegetation; it was a uniform plain, everywhere covered with verdure, without mountains, without seas, or the smallest inequalities. It had no difference of seasons, for its equator was in the plane of the ecliptic, or, in other words, it turned directly opposite to the sun, so that it enjoyed one perpetual and luxuriant spring. However, this delightful face of nature did not long continue in the same state; for, after a time, it began to crack and open in fissures; a circumstance which always succeeds when the sun exhales the moisture from rich or marshy situations. The crimes of mankind had been for some time preparing to draw down the wrath of heaven; and they at length induced the deity to defer repairing those breaches in nature. Thus the chasms of the earth every day became wider, and, at length, they penetrated to the great abysses of waters, and the whole earth in a manner fell in. Then ensued a total disorder in the uniform beauty of the first creation, the terraqueous surface being broken down; as it sunk, the waters gulped out in its place; the deluge became universal; all mankind, except eight persons, were destroyed, and their posterity condemned to toil upon the ruins of desolated nature.\n\nIt remains to mention the manner in which he removes the earth from this universal wreck; which would seem to be as difficult as even its first formation. Those great masses of earth falling into the abyss, drew down with them vast quantities of air; and by darting against each other, and breaking into small parts,\nby the violence of the shock, they at length left between them large cavities filled with nothing but air. These cavities naturally offered a bed to receive the influent waters; and in proportion as they filled, the face of the earth became once more visible. The higher parts of its broken surface, now become the tops of mountains, were the first that appeared; the plains soon after came forward, and at length the whole globe was delivered from the waters, except the places in the lowest situations; so that the ocean and the seas are still a part of the ancient abyss that have not had a place to return to. Islands and rocks are fragments of the earth's former crust; kingdoms and continents are larger masses of its broken substance; and all the inequalities that are to be found on the surface of the present earth, are owing to the accidental confusion into which both earth and waters were then thrown.\n\nSect. II. Theory of Woodward.\n\nThe next who attempted a theory of the earth was Mr. Woodward, who in his essay towards a natural history of the earth, endeavoured to give what he considered as a more rational account of its appearances than had been given by any preceding writer. He was indeed much better qualified for such an undertaking than any of his predecessors, as he was one of the most industrious naturalists of his time. Hence though his system must be considered as weak and untenable, his work contains many important facts relating to natural history.\n\nWoodward sets out by asserting that all terrestrial substances are disposed in beds of various natures, lying horizontally, one over the other, like the coats of an onion, and that they are replete with shells and other marine productions; these shells being found in the deepest cavities, and on the tops of the highest mountains. From these observations, which were warranted by the experience of naturalists at that time, but which we now know not to be universally correct, he proceeds to remark that these shells and extraneous fossils are not productions of the earth, but are all actual remains of those animals which they are known to resemble; that all the beds of the earth lie below each other in the order of their specific gravities, and that they are disposed as if they had been left in this situation by subduing waters. All this is affirmed with much earnestness, although many of the circumstances are contradicted by daily experience. Thus, we not unfrequently meet with layers of stone above the lightest foils, and find the heaviest earth below a stratum of hard stone. Woodward, however, having taken for granted, that all the strata of the earth are arranged in the order of their specific gravities, the lightest at the top, and the heaviest near the centre, he deduces as a natural consequence, that all the substances of which the earth is composed were once in an actual state of solution. This universal solution he conceives to have happened at the time of the flood. He supposes that at that time a body of water, which was then in the centre of the earth, uniting with that which was found on the surface, so far separated the terraqueous parts as to mix all together in one fluid mass; the contents of which afterwards sinking according to their respective gravities, produced the present appearances of the earth. Being aware, however, of an objection that fossil substances are not found dissolved, he exempts them from this universal dilution, and for that purpose, endeavours to show that the parts of animals have a stronger cohesion than those of minerals; and that, while even the hardest rocks may be dissolved, bones and shells may still continue entire.\n\nSect. III. Theory of Whiston.\n\nOf all the theories of the earth that have been formed, previous to those of Hutton and Werner, none Whiston's has been more applauded or more opposed than that of Whiston. Nor is this surprising; for this theory being supported with all the parade of mathematical calculation, confounded the ignorant, and produced the approbation of such as desired to be thought learned, since it implied a considerable knowledge of abstract science, even to be capable of comprehending what the writer aimed at. It is not easy to divest this theory of its mathematical garb, but the result of our philosopher's reasoning appears to be as follows.\n\nHe supposes the earth to have been originally a comet, and he considers the history of the creation, as given us in scripture, to have its commencement just when it was, by the hand of the Creator, more regularly placed as a planet in our solar system. Before that time, he supposes it to have been a globe without beauty or proportion; a world in disorder, subject to all the vicissitudes which comets endure; some of which have been found, at different times, a thousand times hotter than melted iron; at others, a thousand times colder than ice. These alternations of heat and cold, continually melting and freezing the surface of the earth, he supposes to have produced, to a certain depth, a chaos entirely resembling that described by the poets, surrounding the solid contents of the earth, which still continued unchanged in the midst, making a great burning globe of more than two thousand leagues in diameter. This surrounding chaos, however, was far from being solid: he compares it to a dense though fluid atmosphere, composed of substances mingled, agitated, and shocked against each other; and in this disorder he describes the earth to have been just at the eve of creation.\n\nBut upon its orbit being then changed, when it was more regularly wheeled round the sun, every thing took its proper place, every part of the surrounding fluid then fell into a situation, in proportion as it was light or heavy. The middle or central part, which always remained unchanged, still continued so, retaining a part of that heat which it received, in its primeval approaches towards the sun; which heat he calculates, may continue for about six thousand years. Next to this fell the heavier parts of the chaotic atmosphere, which serve to sustain the lighter; but as in defending they could not entirely be separated from many watery parts with which they were intimately mixed, they drew down a part of these also with them; and these could not mount again after the surface of the earth was consolidated; they therefore surrounded the heavy first descending parts, in the same manner as these surround the central globe. Thus, the entire body of the earth is composed internally of a great burning globe, next which is placed an heavy terraqueous substance that encloses\nTheories of passes it, round which also is circumfused a body of water. Upon this body of water, the crust of the earth on which we dwell is placed, so that, according to him, the globe is composed of a number of coats, or shells, one within the other, all of different densities. The body of the earth being thus formed, the air, which is the lightest substance of all, surrounded its surface, and the beams of the sun darting through, produced that light which, we are told, first obeyed the Creator's command.\n\nThe whole economy of the creation being thus adjusted, it only remained to account for the risings and depressions on the surface of the earth, with the other seeming irregularities of its present appearance. The hills and valleys are considered by him as formed by their pressing upon the internal fluid, which sustains the outward shell of earth with greater or less weight; those parts of the earth which are heaviest, sink into the subjacent fluid more deeply, and become valleys; those that are lighter, rise highest upon the earth's surface, and are called mountains.\n\nSuch was the face of nature before the deluge; the earth was then more fertile and populous than it is at present; the life of man and animals was extended to ten times its present duration; and all those advantages arose from the superior heat of the central globe, which ever since has been cooling. As its heat was then in full power, the genial principle was also much greater than at present; vegetation and animal increase were carried on with more vigour; and all nature seemed teeming with the seeds of life. But these physical advantages were only productive of moral evil; the warmth which invigorated the body, increased the passions and appetites of the mind; and as man became more powerful, he grew less innocent. It was found necessary to punish this depravity; and all living creatures were overwhelmed by the deluge in universal destruction.\n\nThis deluge, which simple believers are willing to ascribe to a miracle, philosophers have been long dubious to account for by natural causes. They have proved that the earth could never supply from any reservoir towards its centre, nor the atmosphere by any discharge from above, such a quantity of water as would cover the surface of the globe to a certain depth over the tops of our highest mountains. Where, therefore, was all this water to be found? Whiston has found enough, and more than a sufficiency, in the tail of a comet; for he seems to allot comets a very active part in the great operations of nature.\n\nHe calculates with great seeming precision, the year, the month, and the day of the week on which this comet (which has paid the earth some visits since, though at a kinder distance) involved our globe in its tail. The tail he supposed to be a vaporous fluid substance, exhaled from the body of the comet, by the extreme heat of the sun, and increasing in proportion as it approached that great luminary. It was in this that our globe was involved at the time of the deluge; and as the earth filled itself by its natural attraction, it drew to itself all the watery vapours which were in the comet's tail; and the internal waters being also at the same time let loose, in a very short space the tops of the highest mountains were laid under the deep.\n\nThe punishment of the deluge being thus completed and all the guilty destroyed, the earth, which had been broken by the eruption of the internal waters, was also enlarged by it; so that upon the comet's recedes, there was found room sufficient in the internal abyss for the recesses of the superfluous waters, whither they all retired, and left the earth uncovered, but in some respects changed, particularly in its figure, which, from being round, was now become oblate. In this universal wreck of nature Noah survived, by a variety of happy causes, to repeople the earth, and to give birth to a race of men flow in believing ill-imagined theories of the earth.\n\nSect. IV. Theory of Buffon.\n\nLess abstracted and more popular than the theory of Whiston, but equally fanciful and pompous, was the hypothesis of Buffon. This system, which was received with great admiration, depends principally on two facts which, though generally true, were by Buffon extended much too far.\n\nIt had been long observed, that such flinty or siliceous bodies as form a part of the composition of glass, are among the most abundant materials which compose the earth, and that many of them nearly resemble glass in colour, transparency, lustre, hardness, and specific gravity. As glass is produced by fusion in a strong heat, it was inferred by Buffon, that the flinty bodies found on the earth derived their origin from a similar fusion; and as no heat sufficient to produce so great an effect, could be found on our globe, the author has recourse to the sun as its source. He supposes the planets, and the earth among the number, to have originally formed a part of the body of the sun. In this situation a comet falling in on that great body, might have given it such a shock, and so shaken its whole frame, that some of its particles might have been driven off, like streaming sparks from red-hot iron; and each of these streams of fire, though very small in comparison of the sun, might have been large enough to form a planet much greater than our earth, or any other of the planetary system. In this manner the planets, together with the globe which we inhabit, might have been driven off from the body of the sun by impulsion; and in this way they would have continued to recede from it for ever, had they not been arrested by the superior power of attraction, exerted on them by the sun; and thus, by the combination of the centrifugal and centripetal forces, they were whirled round in the orbits which they now describe.\n\nAfter giving a number of reasons for the credibility, or at least possibility, of the foregoing supposition, the author concludes that it is evident, that the earth assumed its present figure when in a melted state. It is natural to think, says he, that the earth, when it issued from the sun, had no other form but that of a torrent of melted and inflamed matter; that this torrent, by the mutual attraction of its parts, took on a globular figure, which its diurnal motion changed into a spheroid; that, when the earth cooled, the vapours, which were expanded like the tail of a comet, gradually condensed, and fell down in the form of water upon the surface, depositing at the same time a flimsy substance mixed with sulphur and salts, part of which was carried by the motion of the waters into the perpendicular fissures of the strata, and produced...\nThus the interior parts of the globe were originally composed of vitrified matter, and probably they are so at present. Above this were placed those bodies which had been reduced by the heat to the smallest particles, as sand, which are only portions of glass, and above these pumice stones, and the scoriae of melted matter, from which were afterwards produced the several kinds of clay. The whole mass was covered with water to the depth of five or six hundred feet, arising from the condensation of the vapors when the earth began to cool. This water deposited a stratum of mud, mixed with all those substances which were capable of being sublimed, or exhaled by fire; and the air was formed of the most subtle vapors, which, from their small specific gravity, floated above the water.\n\nSuch was the condition of the earth, when the tides, the winds, and the heat of the sun, began to introduce changes on its surface. The diurnal motion of the earth, and that of the tides, elevated the waters in the equatorial regions, and necessarily transported thither great quantities of lime, clay, and sand; and by thus elevating those parts of the earth, they perhaps sunk those under the poles about two leagues, or a 23rd part of the whole; for the waters would easily reduce into powder pumice stones, and other spongy parts of the vitrified matter upon the surface; and by this means excavate some places and elevate others, which, in time, would produce islands and continents, and all those inequalities on the surface, which are more considerable towards the equator than towards the poles. The highest mountains lie between the tropics and the middle of the temperate zones, and the lowest from the polar circles towards the poles. Indeed, both the land and sea have most inequalities between the tropics, as is evident from the incredible number of islands peculiar to these regions.\n\nThe other circumstance which forms a principal part of the basis of this theory, is derived from the composition of sea shells. It is well known, that these shells consist chiefly of an earth like that which constitutes the principal part of limestone or marble; and it was hence inferred that, after a series of ages, these shells being broken down into minute particles, produced those immense masses of calcareous substances which are now found either in vast mountains, or in stratified plains, in almost every part of the earth.\n\nBuffon conceives very naturally, that the surface of the earth must, at the beginning, have been much less solid than it is at present, and consequently the same causes which at this day produce but slight changes, must then, on so yielding abode, have been attended with very considerable effects. There is, he thinks, every reason to suppose, that the earth was at that time covered with the waters of the sea; and that these waters were above the tops of our highest mountains, since, even in such elevated situations, we find shells and other marine productions in very great abundance. It appears also that the sea continued for a considerable time upon the face of the earth; for as these layers of shells are found so very frequently at such great depths, and in such prodigious quantities, it seems impossible for theories of such numbers to have been supported all alive at one time; so that they must have been brought there by successive depositions. These shells also are found in the bodies of the hardest rocks, where they could not have been deposited all at once, at the time of the deluge, or at any such instant revolution; since that would be to suppose, that all the rocks in which they are found were, at that instant, in a state of dilution, which would be absurd to assert. The sea, therefore, deposited them wherever they are now to be found, and that by slow and successive degrees.\n\n\"It will appear also, that the sea covered the whole earth, from the appearance of its layers, which lying regularly one above the other, seem all to resemble the sediment formed at different times by the ocean. Hence, by the irregular force of its waves and its currents, driving the bottom into sand-banks, mountains must have been gradually formed within this universal covering of waters; and these successively raising their heads above its surface, must, in time, have formed the highest ridges of mountains upon land, together with continents, islands, and low grounds, all in their turns. This opinion will receive additional weight by considering, that in those parts of the earth, where the power of the ocean is greatest, the inequalities on the surface of the earth are highest; the ocean's power is greatest at the equator, where its winds and tides are most constant; and in fact, the mountains at the equator are found to be higher than in any other parts of the world. (Vid. No 129.) The sea, therefore, has produced the principal changes in our earth; rivers, volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, and rain, having made but slight alterations, and only such as have affected the globe to very inconsiderable depths.\"\n\n\"In the formation of this theory, says Mr Kirwan, genius (I mean genius in its primitive sense, the sublime talent of fascinating invention, and not the energetic power of patient, profound, and fatiguing investigation,) unhappily prefixed. Yet dazzled by the splendid but delusive scenery, presented by an ardent imagination soaring to the source of light, and rending from its flaming orb the planetary mailes that surround it; then marking with daring and overweening confidence, fancied successive epochs of the consolidated fabric of the terraqueous globe; the public attention was long arrested by the magical representation, and the understanding nearly betrayed into a partial, if not a total, assent to it.\n\n\"This proud gigantic theory was, however, like another Goliath, soon demolished by a common flint or pebble, the very substance it sprung from. Common glass essentially contains an alkaline salt, to which alone it owes its fusibility; siliceous substances contain none, and are absolutely infusible when unassociated with any. Macquer found them infusible not only in furnaces, but in the still incomparably superior heat of inflamed oxygen. Hence the hypothesis grounded on the assumed identity of these substances and common glass, vanished like the unembodied visions of the night. With respect to limestone, the other pillar on which this theory rests, Cronstedt, Ferber, Born, Arduini, and Bergman, demonstrated the existence of numerous and immense mountains, in which not only no vestiges of shells could be traced, but whose internal structure of position\nTheories of position was incompatible with the supposition of an origin of the Earth, gination thence derived.\"\n\n* Kirwan's Geological Essay.\n\nSect. V. Theory of Whitehurst.\n\nThe first person who founded a theory of the earth on accurate and industrious observation was the late Mr. John Whitehurst, who, in an inquiry into the original state and formation of the earth, has advanced opinions which differ considerably from those of preceding naturalists, and in some measures resemble those which are at present in greatest repute.\n\nMr. Whitehurst sets out with stating his opinion, that the terraqueous globe, which we now inhabit, was originally in a fluid state, and this, not from any solvent principle or subsequent solution, but owing to the first assemblage of its component parts; whence he presumes that the earth had a beginning, and has not existed from eternity. He rests his proof of this original fluid state of the earth on its spheroidal form, which a fluid globe in its revolution would naturally acquire, but which could not easily be produced in a solid body. The fluidity of the earth and the infinite divisibility of matter, an opinion which generally prevailed at that time, prove, according to him, that the component parts of the elements were uniformly blended together, none being heavier or lighter than another; hence they compose a uniform mass of equal consistence throughout, from the surface to the centre, and consequently the new formed globe was not adapted to the support of animal or vegetable life. It would therefore be absurd to suppose, that organized bodies were created during the chaotic state of the earth; and there is a great presumption that mankind were not created till the earth was become suitable to the nature of their existence.\n\nThe component parts of the chaos were heterogeneous, and endowed with peculiar chemical affinities, whereby similar substances were disposed to unite and form select bodies of various denominations, and thus the chaos was progressively formed into a habitable world.\n\nThe first operation of nature which presents itself to our consideration is the production of the spheroidal figure of the earth, acquired from its diurnal rotation, and the laws of gravity, fluidity, and centrifugal force. When this form was once completed, the component parts began to act on each other according to their affinities: hence the particles of earth, air, and water, united to those of their own kind, and with their union commenced their specific gravities; and the uniform suspension which had hitherto prevailed throughout the whole of the chaotic mass, was destroyed.\n\nOn the component parts separating into homogeneous masses, those of the greatest density began to approach towards the centre of gravity, and those of the greatest levity ascended towards the surface. As the specific gravity of air is so much less than that of water, it is presumed that the former escaped from the general mass sooner than the latter, and formed an impure atmosphere surrounding the newly-formed globe. Water being next in levity, succeeded the air, and formed one vast ocean about the earth. In process of time these elements became perfectly pure, and fit for the preservation of animal and vegetable life.\n\nWhen the component parts of the chaos had been thus progressively separated, and collected into distinct Earth masses, the following consequences are supposed to have ensued. The solids could not uniformly subside from every part of the surface, and be equally covered by water; for, as the sun and moon were coeval with the chaos, in proportion as the separation of the solids and fluids increased, so, by the action of those bodies on the sea, the tides became greater, and removed the solids from place to place, without any order or regularity. Hence the sea became unequally deep; and those inequalities daily increasing, dry land gradually appeared, and divided the waters which had hitherto been universally diffused over the earth. The primitive islands being thus formed, gradually became firm and dry, and fit for the reception of animals and vegetables.\n\nThe atmosphere, the sea, and the land, being thus formed, Mr. Whitehurst proceeds to consider the order in which animal and vegetable bodies were severally created. He first supposes that, as the ocean became pure, and fit for animal life, before the formation of the primitive islands, fish were the first animals produced, and he supports this opinion by many ingenious arguments and facts. He observes, that in every instance upon record, the fragments of shell-fish are infinitely more numerous than the bones and teeth of fish. The latter, too, are but rarely deposited in any other matter than in beds of sand and gravel, and not in the solid substance of limestone, as the shells of fish generally are, even to the depth of many hundred yards, and dispersed throughout the whole extent of the secondary strata. Hence it is probable, that shell-fish were produced in prodigious quantities, sooner than any other kind of animal. The ocean being thus stocked with inhabitants, previous to the formation of the primitive islands, many of them became enveloped, and were buried in the mud by the action of the tides; and this would happen more, particularly to the shell-fish, as they were less able to extricate themselves. Since the remains of marine animals are thus imbedded at various depths in the earth, there is sufficient proof that these marine bodies were entombed at successive periods of time, and that they were likewise created before the primitive islands, and consequently before any terrestrial islands.\n\nThat the earth has, at different times, suffered very violent convulsions, producing extensive ruptures of its solid parts, may reasonably be concluded from the rugged and uncouth appearance of many of the mountainous parts of the world. We see rocks in some places torn asunder, or appearing as if cut with a saw, and we find, in various parts, substances both mineral and organized, which are not generally met with, except in very distant regions. Most of the irregularities of the earth's surface are attributed by Mr. Whitehurst to the general deluge. This would, in some instances, have the effect of reducing large masses of matter to a second state of solution; many eminences would be levelled, and some of the valleys would be filled up, while some parts which were before covered with water, might receive such an accession of matter as to fill up their cavities, and on the subfolding of the waters become a vast level plain. On the other hand, those elevated regions which were chiefly composed of the hardest stones, by having the lighter portions of earth washed away\nTheories of away from their basis, would appear considerably increased in height. Mr Whitehurst attributes the production of pit-coal also to the deluge, as it is difficult to account for the deposition of such a quantity of vegetable matter (supposing pit-coal to be of vegetable origin) below the surface of the earth, on any other hypothesis. The animal matters found in a fossil state, especially those remains of animals which are not now found upon the earth, can only be accounted for, on the supposition of a deluge.\n\nMr Whitehurst, however, is not content with attributing to the deluge most of the changes which have taken place on the surface of the earth, but he derives from the same source the curtailed longevity of man, and many of the evils incident to mankind. \"At that dreadful era,\" says he, \"and not before, the year became divided into summer and winter, spring and autumn, and the spontaneous products of the earth no longer sufficed the calls of human nature without art and labour; wherefore he who sowed would expect to reap, and he who built an hut for his protection, would naturally expect to enjoy the fruits of his own labour; necessity, therefore, was the parent of property, and property created a thousand imaginary wants, which its possessors endeavoured to gratify, and their example excited similar ideas in those who had it not, but nevertheless studiously endeavoured to gratify their artificial wants by unjustifiable means. Hence the necessity of laws, dominion, and subordination, which had no existence in the antediluvian world.\"\n\n\"To that great revolution in the natural world, we may therefore ascribe many of the evils incident to mankind; for experience shows, that men who are born in rude and savage climates are naturally of a ferocious disposition; and that a fertile soil, which leaves nothing to wish for, softens their manners, and inclines them to humanity.\"\n\nThe above is a general outline of Mr Whitehurst's theory, some parts of which are very ingenious, and are corroborated by observation, while others are not a little fanciful and improbable. In his supposition that the earth was originally in a fluid state, he agrees with most other theorists, as this is a circumstance which admits of little doubt; though, as Kirwan has shewn, it is not necessary to suppose that the whole mass of the earth was fluid, but only those parts of it which are near the surface. In his play of affinities, and consequent separation of the materials of the earth into homogeneous masses, Whitehurst has been followed by Dr Kirwan, who has framed a beautiful and ingenious speculation on the successive changes that took place from the action of the materials on each other.\n\nMr Whitehurst has been betrayed by his fondness for a favourite theory, into several errors respecting the stratification of the earth, which require to be mentioned. Thus, though the arrangement of the strata, especially where it has not been disturbed by some evident and violent cause, is extremely uniform; he has, however, extended this regularity farther than it really obtains. He tells us that the strata invariably follow each other, as if it were in an alphabetical order, or a series of numbers, whatever be their denomination. Not that they are alike in all the different regions of the earth, either in quality or in thickness, but that their order in each particular part, however they may differ in quality; yet they follow each other in regular succession, both as to thickness and quality, insomuch, that by knowing the incumbent stratum, together with the arrangement thereof in any particular part of the earth, we may come to a perfect knowledge of all the inferior beds, so far as they have been previously discovered in the adjacent country. With respect to the strata that accompany coal, some instances are apparently, but not really, contradictory to this rule.\n\nWe now know, however, that Mr Whitehurst's observations do not universally apply. In the old mines in the valley of Planen, in Saxony, the strata, though they are near each other, vary considerably in thickness, from that of a few inches to several feet, and the stratum of coal, in particular, varies from two to thirty-two feet. Again, in Mount Salive, the strata of coal, though in a calcareous mountain, vary considerably; and Mr Whitehurst himself informs us, that at Benfai moor, those strata which are in other places the lowest, are found at the surface. Even in Derbyshire, to which Mr Whitehurst's observations chiefly apply, we are informed that even when the arrangement is the same, the thickness of the strata varies considerably.\n\nSect. VI. Theory of Dr Hutton.\n\nThe next theory which we have to consider, is that proposed by Dr James Hutton, which has become so much the object of inquiry and debate, as to give name to one of the two principal sects into which geologists are now divided.\n\nThe leading principles of the Huttonian theory, as concisely laid down by one of its greatest admirers and supporters, are the following.\n\n1. The first circumstance which Dr Hutton has considered as a general fact is, that by far the greater part of the bodies which compose the exterior crust of our globe, bear the marks of being formed of the materials of mineral and organized bodies, of more ancient date. The spoils or the wreck of an older world are, he thinks, everywhere visible in the present, and though not found in every piece of rock, they are diffused so generally as to leave no doubt that the strata which now compose our continents are all formed out of strata more ancient than themselves.\n\n2. The present rocks, with the exception of such as are not stratified, having all existed in the form of loose materials collected at the bottom of the sea, must have been consolidated and converted into stone by virtue of some very powerful and general agent. The consolidating cause which he points out is subterranean heat, and the objections to this hypothesis have been attempted to be removed, by the introduction of a principle new and peculiar to himself. This principle is the compression which must have prevailed in that region where the consolidation of mineral substances was accomplished. Under the weight of a superincumbent ocean, heat, however intense, might be unable to volatilize any part of those substances which, at the surface, and under the lighter pressure of our atmosphere, it can entirely consume. The same pressure, by forcing those substances to remain united, which at the surface are easily separated, might occasion the fusion of some bodies which in our fires are only calcined.\n\n3. The\nThe third general circumstance which this theory is founded on is, that the stratified rocks, instead of being either horizontal or nearly so, as they no doubt were originally, are now found poling all degrees of elevation, and some of them were perpendicular to the horizon; to which we must add, that those strata which were once at the bottom of the sea are now raised up, many of them several thousand feet above its surface. From this, as well as from the inflexions, the breaking and separation of the strata, it is inferred, that they have been raised by the action of some expansive force placed under them. This force, which has burst in pieces the solid pavement on which the ocean rests, and has raised up rocks from the bottom of the sea into mountains, 15,000 feet above its surface, exceeds any which we feel actually exerted, but seems to come nearer to the cause of the volcano or the earthquake than to any other, of which the effects are directly observed. The immense disturbance, therefore, of the strata, is in this theory ascribed to heat acting with an expansive power, and elevating these rocks which it had before consolidated.\n\nAmong the marks of disturbance in which the mineral kingdom abounds, those great breaches among rocks, which are filled with materials different from the rock on either side, are among the most conspicuous. These are the veins, and comprehend not only the metallic veins, but also those of whinstone, of porphyry, and of granite, all of them substances more or less crystallized, and none of them containing the remains of organized bodies. These are of posterior formation to the strata which they intersect, and in general also they carry with them the marks of the violence with which they have come into their place, and of the disturbances which they have produced on the rocks already formed. The materials of all these veins, Dr Hutton concludes to have been melted by subterraneous heat, and, while in fusion, injected among the fissures and openings of rocks already formed, but thus disturbed, and moved from their original place.\n\nThis conclusion he extends to all the masses of whinstone, porphyry, and granite, which are interspersed among the strata, or raised up in pyramids, as they often appear to be, through the midst of them. Thus, in the fusion and injection of the unstratified rocks, we have the third and last great operation which subterraneous heat has performed on mineral substances.\n\nFrom this Dr Hutton proceeds to consider the changes to which mineral bodies are subject when raised into the atmosphere. Here he finds, without any exception, that they are all going to decay; that, from the shore of the sea to the top of the mountain, from the softest clay to the hardest quartz, all are wasting and undergoing a separation of their parts. The bodies thus resolved into their elements, whether chemical or mechanical, are carried down by the rivers to the sea, and are there redeposited. Nothing is exempted from this general law; among the highest mountains and the hardest rocks, its effects are most clearly discerned; and it is on the objects which appear the most durable and fixed, that the characters of revolution are most deeply imprinted.\n\nIt is not surprising that this theory should have met with many advocates among the more superficial observers of nature. The production of a man in whom genius, observation and industry were united, and who paffed a considerable part of a long life in chemical and geological researches, was calculated to dazzle the imagination by the grandeur of its design, and to captivate the judgement by its appearance of regularity and confidence. It has been considered as a peculiar excellence of this theory, that it ascribes to the phenomena of geology an order similar to that which exists in the provinces of nature with which we are best acquainted; that it produces seas and continents, not by accident, but by the operation of regular and uniform causes; that it makes the decay of one part subservient to the restoration of another, and that it gives stability to the whole, not by perpetuating individuals, but by reproducing them in succession.\n\nAn hypothesis with such pretensions could not fail of being minutely examined and severely criticized by the more enlightened part of geologists, and accordingly very serious objections have been made to it by Kirwan and others. We shall state a few of what appear to us to be the most convincing arguments against Dr Hutton's theory, referring those who wish to see a more detailed refutation of it to the geological writings of Kirwan, and A Comparative View of the Huttonian and Neptunian Theories.\n\nSome of the strongest arguments against this theory are drawn from the nature of caloric, and what we know of its action on other bodies. We know that caloric is of so diffusible a nature, that it is always communicated, from that body or set of bodies, in which it is most abundant, to that in which it is least so, till an equilibrium of temperature is produced. But Dr Hutton's theory supposes a subterraneous heat as constantly existing, capable of fusing the most obdurate rocks, and of raising them by its expansibility from the bottom of the ocean, and yet incapable of extending its influence through the superincumbent strata at all times, so as to fuse or evaporate superior bodies, and gradually expand itself, so as to acquire that equilibrium which is one of its natural effects. Again, supposing such a subterraneous heat to exist, it is surely extraordinary, that substances which we are incapable of fusing by the strongest heat that we can excite, even in the greatest state of division, should, by this subterraneous heat be so completely fused, and in such vast masses, as to have assumed the appearance under which they now present themselves. If the solar rays, in the utmost state of concentration, if a united stream of inflamed hydrogenous and oxygenous gases from the tube of a blow-pipe or gasometer, cannot melt the smallest visible portion of calcareous spar or rock crystal, how can we conceive that the immense mountains of limestone and of quartz which are met with in so many places could have been fused into a state of perfect fluidity? Or even if they could be fused, how is it possible that the carbonic acid of the limestone should not have been dissipated by so strong a heat? If we suppose with Dr Hutton, that this subterraneous heat acts with the affluence of immense pressure from the superincumbent strata and waters of the ocean, hence preventing the dissipation of volatile matters, still it should act uniformly, and should fuse all those bodies which come in its way, that are capable of fusion. Now, we know that feldspar, schorl, mica, and chlorite, are much more fusible than quartz, and of course, when a mass compounded of these comes under\nTheories of under the influence of this heat, all these more fusible substances should be melted as well as the quartz. But in some stones in which most of these ingredients meet, as in the granite of Portsoy, there is every reason to suppose that some of them have been in a fluid state, while the others were solid or less fluid, as crystals of the latter are imprinted on a bed of the former, viz., in the instance cited, crystals of feldspar in a mass of quartz. As it is certain, according to the advocates of the Huttonian theory, that at least the quartz was fluid when it was moulded on the feldspar, how happened it that this comparatively fusible stone was not also melted, and blended in one compact mass with the quartz? We also frequently find crystals of quartz penetrated by schorl and chlorite, which is a proof that the latter must have been hard while the former was in a fluid state. Hence it is evident that these appearances could not have been the effect of fusion by heat.\n\nAgain, we find seams of coal penetrated by thin laminae and crystals of quartz, an effect which, according to this theory, must have taken place while the quartz was in a state of fusion. But, in this case, the strata of flake above and below the coal should also have been fused (flakes being much more fusible than quartz, and thus the whole should have acquired a flaky texture; and besides in this intense heat, the coal should have been entirely charred and lost all its vegetable impurities.\n\nThe very existence of such a subterranean heat, that constantly maintains itself without fuel, ready to act on any emergency, when a quantity of the old world has been abraded and translated, sufficient to furnish the materials of a new one, is avowedly hypothetical, as we have no proof that it exists. Nay, we have direct proof, as far as rational induction can carry us, to the contrary. It was long ago observed, by Irving and Foster, that the heat of the sea diminishes in proportion to the depth to which we proceed in examining it, and the same has been more lately proved by Peron, by various trials in many different latitudes*. Now the contrary of this ought certainly to happen, (unless this subterranean heat is entirely unlike common heat) if there constantly existed in the bowels of the earth a heat capable of fusing quartz and limestone.\n\nThe structure of whin dykes, detailed in Section II. of last Chapter, affords additional arguments in opposition to the Huttonian theory.\n\nThe evidence which Dr Hutton has adduced to prove the subterranean eruption of dykes, is drawn from the apparent derangement of the horizontal strata at a place where they are intersected by a dyke, and the peculiar appearance of the coal in their immediate vicinity, which he supposes to be in a state of calcination, from having been in contact with the ejected matter of the dyke in fusion. Let us first attend to the effect of this eruption of a dyke, the apparent derangement of the strata; and let us consider for a moment, what must be the mechanical operation of a mass of this liquid matter bursting upwards through the coal strata. Suppose a coal field of a mile square in extent; suppose that the coal and concomitant strata are perfectly regular, having a moderate dip or inclination to the south; and suppose that this coal field is to be intersected by a dyke, ejected in a state of fusion from the bowels of the earth. Considering the nature of the strata which usually accompany coal, such as sandstone, lime-stone, ironstone, &c., which are very hard and compact, we must allow, that the resistance from such substances would be very great. In this previous state of circumstances, then, what would be the effect of the eruption of a dyke in the middle of the field, in a direction from north to south? Can it even be imagined, that this liquid mass in its progress upwards through the superincumbent strata to the surface of the earth, would merely destroy the continuity of these strata, and not in its irresistible course, carry along with it part of all the substances composing that strata through which it passed?\n\nBut farther, one of the most obvious consequences of such an eruption, would be the elevation of part of the whole range of the strata on both sides of the dyke, and the extent of this elevation will be in proportion to the power or thickness of the dyke; and not only is it natural to expect this elevation of the strata to a certain extent, but from the operation of an agent so tremendous and irresistible, that the whole strata should be broken, disjointed and confused. But does this statement correspond with the phenomena? From the history of dykes traversing coal strata, we know that it does not. On the contrary, the whole of the strata, in most cases, preserve the same thickness, the same parallelism, and the same inclination to the horizon on both sides of the dyke. It is true, the half mile of coal field, intersected by a dyke, as we have supposed above, will on one side of it be elevated or depressed. If the dyke, which runs north and south in its course upwards, inclines to the west, the western division will be elevated. But this is not a partial elevation only in the immediate vicinity of the dyke. It extends over the whole field on the west side of the dyke, and the strata continue fair and regular, in all respects corresponding to those from which they have been detached, till they are intersected by another dyke.\n\nFrom this reasoning, we think the conclusion fair and obvious, that dykes intersecting coal strata have not been formed by subterranean eruption, and therefore, that the elevation or depression of the strata is not owing to this cause. Dr Hutton's theory, in this respect, is opposed by the facts which it professes to explain, and consequently it is untenable.\n\nLet us now consider the argument drawn from the supposed calcination of the coal which has been in contact with the matter of the dyke in a state of fusion. Here Dr Hutton seems to have overstepped the bounds of his own theory, and lost sight of his own principles, which suppose, that all the strata and stony matters of which the globe is composed, have been consolidated by means of heat; that the exhibition of the common or ordinary phenomena of heat is not to be looked for in the grand processes of nature; because these operations have taken place at great depths in the bowels of the earth, or under immense pressure at the bottom of the sea; and this is the reason that coal, and lime strata, for instance, which have been subjected to this intense degree of heat discover no marks of calcination, the one being deprived of its carbonic acid, and the other of its bitumen. Now, granting this hypothetical argument to be well founded, what is the reason that the coal, which is in contact with a dyke, has undergone the processes of calcination, when this coal is at as great a depth in the bowels of the earth, under as immense pressure, and as much\nTheories of much excluded from atmospheric air, as any coal at its original formation. But all the coal in contact with a dyke, is not in this state. Clean coal is sometimes found in immediate contact; and, in many places, clean coal is also found intercepted between regular ranges of basaltic columns, and this coal discovers not the smallest mark of calcination. On the other hand, coal in this supposed state of calcination, has been frequently discovered, at a great distance from any dyke or basaltic substance whatever. Masses of this foul coal often occur, to the regret and disappointment of the miner, in the midst of liraia otherwise perfectly clean and regular. This last fact shows us, that we must look for the cause of this singular phenomenon elsewhere than in the circumstance of the coal having been in contact with a dyke while in fusion; for it appears that the effect does not always follow in the same circumstances, and that the same effect is produced in very different circumstances.\n\nThese observations are probably sufficient to show that the above argument in proof of the subterraneous eruption of dykes, is equally unsatisfactory in explaining the phenomena, and consequently equally untenable with the former. Both, therefore, must fall to the ground.\n\nThe wedge-like form of dykes might be adduced as another argument against their formation by subterraneous eruption; for it is not easy to conceive that a dyke in a state of fusion should, in its eruptive progress towards the surface of the earth, enlarge and become thicker.\n\nThe history of metallic veins furnishes us with stronger objections against Dr Hutton's theory. If, according to this theory, metallic veins have been formed by the substances they contain being ignited in a state of fusion from the bowels of the earth, it will naturally follow, that the veins thus formed might be traced to the greatest depths, and even to the subterraneous furnace from which they issued. But we know that the fact is quite otherwise. The termination of many veins downwards has been discovered. Even the most powerful and productive have been unexpectedly cut off by the horizontal strata, and no vestige of them could ever be traced. This was the case with the rich vein of lead ore at Stauingmog in Wales. It is the case also with many veins in their course downwards, to diminish gradually in form of a wedge, and then they are lost forever. Now, this certainly could never have happened, had they been formed by subterraneous eruption. Some trace of their progress, some mark of their course through the intersected strata, would still have remained. But no such indications, no such traces, are found. We must therefore conclude, that metallic veins have not been formed in this way, and that this theory, which appears to be so much at variance with facts, will not account in a satisfactory manner for their formation.\n\nThe masses of stone of the same species with the neighbouring superior strata, sometimes rounded and worn by the action of water, which are found at great depths in mineral veins, and organized substances, petrifications of vegetables and animals, present us with another objection to this theory, equally strong and infirmountable. These substances are the productions of the surface of the earth; and even supposing them to have existed in the bowels of the earth, it is inconceivable that they should have retained their primitive form after they were subjected to so high a temperature as is necessary to hold metals in a state of fusion.\n\nSect. VII. Theory of Werner.\n\nThe latest, and perhaps most celebrated, theory that Theory of has yet appeared, is that of Professor Werner of Frey-Wernerberg, with an account of which, and some observations on Mr Kirwan's opinions, we shall close this chapter.\n\nWe have said already, (No. 1.) that the subject of which we are now treating is called by Werner geognosy, and his pupils are commonly called geognaths.\n\nWerner is of opinion, that our knowledge is already sufficiently advanced to form a rational theory respecting the formation of the exterior crust of our globe; for he does not deny that we cannot reason with respect to what is below this, since we have no fact which can give us the least notion with respect to it. We are only certain that some part of our globe has been in a fluid state, as is proved by its spheroidal form. The crystalline form of granite and other rocky substances which constitute the base of that part of the earth with which we are acquainted, are, according to Werner, sufficient proofs that this part at least has been in a state of minute dissolution. Again, the stratified appearance of most mountains and rocks show that they are an accumulation of precipitates or sediments which have been deposited one over another. The numerous remains of marine animals which are found imbedded in many rocks, and of which some species are still found in our seas, allow us to believe that this solution was aqueous; that it was a vast ocean which has covered our globe to a very considerable height. The exterior part of the globe, then, has been entirely dissolved by the waters which surrounded it, and from this solution certain chemical precipitations took place, which have formed the crust that we now see.\n\nIn framing his theory, Werner professes to banish every thing that is hypothetical, and only to draw from general facts such immediate consequences as he believes it impossible not to deduce from them, and on these alone he founds his geognosy. The object of this theory, according to one of his disciples (the translator of his book on metallic veins), is to acquire a knowledge of the structure of the solid crust of the terraqueous globe, and the relative disposition of the materials which compose it; the means of doing this are to be derived from observation. Werner sets out with stating, that the chemical precipitates that took place from the chaotic fluid, did not form a regular surface, but that they collected here and there so as to produce the primitive mountains. These mountains he calls chaotic, because, says he, they have been formed during the period when the surface of the earth was a sort of chaos. After the retreat of the waters, these elevated parts were first discovered. They were exposed to the destructive action of the elements, and the shock of tides and torrents. The valleys were hollowed out, and the mountains acquired nearly the form in which we now see them.\n\nObservation has shown that the strata of which the earth is composed, may be divided into a certain number of congeries, each of which is composed of a certain\nTheories of minerals that are nearly the same in whatever part of the world the congeries is found. To these congeries Werner has given the name of formations, of which he distinguishes five kinds or classes, four universal, being found all over the globe, and two partial, found only in particular districts. These formations he has arranged according to the order in which he conceives them to have been produced, beginning with that formation which lies next the solid nucleus of the earth, and which may therefore be conceived to be the oldest, and ending with the most superficial, which is considered as the newest formation.\n\nThe first of these classes is called by Werner that of primitive formations, which consist of a number of formations lying above each other, being those which are supposed the oldest, as in these no organic remains have been discovered. The substances constituting this class are granite, gneiss, micaceous schistus, argillaceous schistus, primitive limestone, primitive trap, felsite, and porphyry. Of these the granite is the lowest, and therefore is considered as the oldest; and next this follow the others in the order in which we have enumerated them, except that the primitive limestone, and primitive trap, are found in an uncertain order, alternating with gneiss, argillaceous schistus, or micaceous schistus; and are therefore considered as subordinate to these formations.\n\nWhen the waters had subsided, and the summits of the primitive mountains had been uncovered, organized bodies were produced; and part of these being intercepted among the chemical precipitations which were still going on, and the mechanical precipitations which now began to take place, were carried with these to the flanks of the primitive mountains, and the valleys between them. Hence were produced a second series of formations, which are called by Werner transition formations, or rocks of transition, as he considered them to be deposited during the period when the earth was passing from an uninhabited to an inhabited state. Among these formations, however, the organic remains are but few. The substances composing this class, are transition limestone, gray wacke, gray wacke slate, transition trap, siliceous schistus. Of these the two last are subordinate, alternating with gray wacke and gray wacke slate.\n\nThe third formation is what Werner calls florets formation, or that, in which the beds or strata lie nearly horizontal, appearing as if they had been deposited from water. This formation comprehends most of what are usually called secondary strata. It is divided by Werner into three subformations, named from the variety or situation of the sandstone, which forms a principal part of each; as 1. Old red sandstone formation, composed of florets limestone, old red sandstone, and foliated gypsum. 2. Second sandstone formation, composed of sandstone, florets limestone, and fibrous gypsum.\n\n3. Third sandstone formation, composed of sandstone, limestone, and chalk, &c. Of these, as before, the first mentioned is the oldest, and in this, somewhere near the gypsum, there is usually found salt or sulphur. In this formation, organic remains are first seen in any great quantities.\n\nThe fourth formation is called independent coal formation, because in this coal is first found, and because it is not universally spread over the earth as the three preceding, but is collected in insulated masses, independent of each other. This is also divided into three, each successively more recent than the preceding. The first series of strata consist of slate clay, limestone, marl, soft sandstone, greenstone, argillaceous ironstone, shale, and coal; the second of indurated clay, marl, limestone, porphyritic stone, and coal; and the third of loose sandstone, conglomerate, (a variety of sandstone), slate clay, and coal.\n\nThe fifth is called florets trap formation, so called because the beds of which it is composed, consist of materials that are mostly of the nature of trap, or whitestone. The substances that compose this formation are gravel, sandstone, siliceous sandstone, clay, wacke, basalt, greenstone, schistose porphyry, pitchstone, and graystone. Coal is also found in this formation, somewhere among the beds of siliceous sandstone, clay, wacke, and basalt, to which it is therefore considered as subordinate.\n\nThe sixth and last formation is the alluvial formation, or that which has arisen from the action of lakes and rivers, washing down part of the older strata. This is divided into two series of strata; the first being those that have arisen from the action of lakes newly drained, comprehending marl, sand, clay, and coal; and the second, those which have been produced from the action of rivers, comprehending mud, ironstone, sand, peat, &c. This formation is the most recent of any, but, like the fourth, it is only partial.\n\nThe above is an outline of Werner's geognosy, which is considered as an improvement of what is called the Neptunian theory, or that which explains geological appearances by the action of water, in opposition to what is called the volcanic theory, or that which attributes these appearances to an igneous origin.\n\nOne of the principal objections to the Neptunian theory is drawn from the insolubility in water of many of the substances which compose our globe; but this theory of Werner's endearment to explain, by supposing that at the very commencement of their existence these substances were in that state of minute division which aqueous solutions require, but which no known existing quantity would be able to effect, after the substances had acquired their utmost consolidation, as it is well known, that a solid substance may be kept in solution, at least for a short time, in a less quantity of fluid than was originally requisite to dissolve it.\n\n(r) We may here notice Werner's opinion with respect to the formation and situation of basalt; as this is the only theory of importance respecting it, that has not been mentioned under the article Basaltes. \"I am perfectly convinced (says Werner in a late memoir) that all the varieties of basalt have been produced in the humid way, and that they are of a very recent formation; that they formerly composed a great bed of immense extent, covering both the primitive and secondary strata; that time has anew destroyed a considerable part, and has left only the basaltic eminences, which we now see.\" Vid. Yameon's Mineralogy of Dumfries, p. 184.\nA second objection is derived from the difficulty of supposing that these substances could have been consolidated below water, or that the water could completely shut up the pores of a body, to the entire exclusion of itself; so that had the mineral substances been consolidated as here supposed, the solvent ought either to remain within them in a liquid state, or, if evaporated, should have left the pores empty, and the body porous to water.\n\nMr Playfair argues strenuously against the notion of these substances being precipitated from the chaotic fluid, which has been ingeniously supported by Kirwan, who attributes the solution of all substances in the chaotic fluid to their being finely pulverized, or created in a state of the most minute division; and the solvent being then insufficient in quantity, he supposes that, on that account, the precipitation took place the more rapidly.\n\n\"If,\" says Mr Playfair, \"he means by this to say, that a precipitation without solution would take place the sooner, the more inadequate the menstruum was to dissolve the whole, the proposition may be true, but will be of no use to explain the crystallization of minerals, the very object he has in view; because to crystallization it is not a bare subsidence of particles suspended in a fluid, but it is a passage from chemical solution to non-solution, or insolubility, that is required.\n\n\"If on the other hand he means to say, that the solution actually took place more quickly, and was more immediately followed by precipitation, because the quantity of the menstruum was insufficient, this is to assert that the weaker the cause, the more instantaneous will be its effect.\"\n\nWerner's theory of dykes and veins requires a more particular consideration.\n\nThis theory supposes, that the spaces which are now occupied by vertical strata, or dykes, including also metallic veins, were originally fissures, formed by the operation of different causes.\n\n1. The unequal height and density of mountains, are considered as the most general causes of fissures. When the mountains were in a soft and humid state, that side which was least supported not only separated by its own weight, but the whole strata of the side gave way, and sunk below their former plain. This also seems to be the opinion of Sauflaire, with regard to the formation of fissures. It is not to be expected, that events of this kind should be of frequent occurrence, now that mountains have acquired sufficient firmness and stability to resist the force of gravity, operating in consequence of the inequality of weight and diversity of the materials of which they are composed. Instances, however, of the operation of such causes are not altogether wanting, even in modern times. After a season of excessive rains, in the year 1767, similar fissures were formed in mountains in Bohemia and Lusatia.\n\n2. When the waters covered the surface of the earth, the unequal weight of the mountains was supported by their pressure; but when the waters retreated, this pressure was removed, the equilibrium was destroyed, the unsupported side of the mountain separated and sunk; and in this manner a fissure was formed.\n\n3. The evaporation of the moisture, after the retreat of the waters, and the consequent diminution of bulk by contraction of the substances which enter into the composition of mountains, are also considered as the causes of fissures.\n\n4. Fissures, too, derive their origin from other local and accidental causes, and especially from earthquakes. In the year 1783, when Calabria was afflicted with this most dreadful of all calamities which visit the earth, mountains were separated, exhibiting fissures similar to those which are now occupied by vertical strata.\n\nThe second part of the theory is employed in proving that the empty spaces, occasioned by the operation of one or other of the causes which have been enumerated, were filled from above; that the different substances, of which the vertical strata are composed, were held in solution by the waters which covered the earth; and that they were precipitated, by different chemical agents, according to the order of chemical affinity, and deposited in the places which they now occupy. In support of the opinion, that these fissures were filled from above, Werner adduces facts of angular and rounded fragments of stones of various species, and organized bodies, as marine shells and vegetables, having been found in vertical strata, at the immense depth of 150 and 200 fathoms. It may be doubted, on good grounds, whether this theory, supported by all the ingenuity and experience of its author, will account, in a satisfactory manner, for that regularity of position and arrangement which are discovered in the vertical strata; for notwithstanding the seeming disorder which a superficial vein may exhibit, they are not less regular and uniform than the horizontal strata. And when our researches are extended beyond the narrow bounds within which they are at present limited, when we are better acquainted with their relative positions and connexions, this uniformity and regularity will become more conspicuous. It may be doubted whether the fortuitous operation of such causes as have been stated, be equal to the effect of the formation of the vertical strata, as they now appear.\n\nBut, supposing that fissures were produced by some of the causes which have been mentioned, few of these causes could operate till the retreat of the waters left the mountains uncovered. It was only then, that the mountains, by the inequality of height and density, being left unsupported, separated, and sunk from their former situation; it was then only that the process of evaporation could take place, succeeded by diminution of bulk and consequent contraction. In short, none of the causes which have been stated, could have any effect before the waters had retreated, excepting earthquakes; of the operation of which there is no proof previous to that period. The materials which compose the vertical strata, it is said, were formed by deposition from the waters which covered the mountains, holding them in solution. But before the fissures could be formed to receive these materials by precipitation and deposition, the waters had retired. A second deluge must therefore have happened, from the waters of which the various substances which enter into the composition of vertical strata have been deposited. This theory does not suppose to have taken place; and, without such a supposition, it seems to be attended with considerable difficulty. But another difficulty still remains. It does not appear how the peculiarity of structure,\nTheories of structure, which was mentioned in our account of whin dykes, Sect. II. of the last chapter, can be accounted for by the principles of this theory. If it be granted, that the horizontal strata were formed in the humid way, the materials of which they are composed must have been precipitated from the waters which held them in solution, by the laws of chemical affinity. But the vertical strata are supposed to have been formed in the same manner, and according to the same process. Now, this being the case, what is the reason that the vertical strata should exhibit a peculiarity of structure and arrangement, different from the horizontal strata? Some of the whin dykes which have been already described, are very remarkable for this singular structure, especially those which assume the form of prismatic columns. These columns are in the horizontal position, and, excepting the latter circumstance, these dykes, in every respect, resemble a bafalic stratum, in which the columns are perpendicular.\n\nMore arguments might be adduced in opposition to the theory of Werner; but we must hasten to conclude this chapter, with mentioning a few of Dr Kirwan's peculiar opinions.\n\nAmong these, the manner in which he accounts for the unequal declivities of the sides of mountains, forms one of the most conspicuous objects; and to this we shall principally confine ourselves, and shall give it in his own words, as extracted from his essay on the declivities of mountains, to which we were obliged in the first section of Chap. II.\n\n\"To assign the causes of this almost universal allotment of unequal declivities to opposite points, and why the greatest are directed to the west and south, and the gentlest, on the contrary, to the east and north, it is necessary to consider,\n\n1. That all mountains were formed while covered with water.\n\n2. That the earth was universally covered with water at two different eras, that of the creation, and that of the Noachian deluge.\n\n3. That in the first era we must distinguish two different periods, that which preceded the appearance of dry land, and that which succeeded the creation of fish, but before the sea had been reduced nearly to its present level. During the former, the primeval mountains were formed; and during the latter, most of the secondary mountains and strata were formed.\n\n4. That all mountains extend either from east to west, or from north to south, or in some intermediate direction between these cardinal points, which need not be particularly mentioned here, as the same species of reasoning must be applied to them, as to those to whose aspect they approach most.\n\nThese preliminary circumstances being noticed, we are next to observe that, during the first era, this vast mass of water moved in two general directions, at right angles with each other, the one from east to west, which needs not be proved, being the course of tides which still continue, but were in that ocean necessarily stronger and higher than at present; the other from north to south, the water tending to these vast abysses then formed in the vicinity of the south pole, as shown in my former essays. Before either motion could be propagated, a considerable time must have elapsed.\n\nNow the primeval mountains formed at the commencement of the first era, and before this double division of the waters took place, must have opposed a considerable obstacle to the motion of that fluid in the\u7f1dse that crossed that of the direction of these mountains. Thus the mountains that stretch from north to south must have opposed the motion of the waters from east to west; this opposition diminishing the motion of that fluid, disposed it to suffer the earthy particles with which in those early periods it must have been impregnated, to crystallize or be deposited on these eastern flanks, and particularly on those of the highest mountains, for over the lower it could easily pass; these depositions being incessantly repeated at heights gradually diminishing as the level of the waters gradually lowered, must have rendered the eastern declivities or descent, gentle, gradual, and moderate, while the western sides receiving no such accretions from depositions, must have remained steep and craggy.\n\nAgain, the primeval mountains that run from east to west, by opposing a similar resistance to the course of the waters from north to south, must have occasioned similar depositions on the northern flanks of these mountains, against which these waters impinged, and thus smoothed them.\n\nWhere mountains intersect each other in an oblique direction, the north-east side of one range being contiguous to the south-west flanks of another range, there the influx of adventitious particles on the north-east side of the one, must have frequently extended to the south-west side of the other, particularly if that influx were strong and copious; thus the Erzgebirge of Saxony, which run from west to east, have their north-east sides contiguous to the south-west side of the Riesengebirge that separate Silezia from Bohemia, and hence these latter are covered with the same beds of gneiss, &c., as the northern sides of the Saxons, and thereby are rendered smooth and gentle, comparatively to the opposite side, which, being sheltered, remains steep and abrupt, which explains the seventh observation.\n\nThe causes here assigned explain why the covering of adventitious strata on the highest mountains is generally thinnest at the greatest height, and thickest towards the foot of the mountain; for the bulk of the water that contained the adventitious particles being proportioned to its depth, and the mass of earthy particles with which it was charged being proportioned to the bulk of the water that contained them, it is plain, that as the height of water gradually decreased, the depositions from it on the higher parts of the mountains must have been less copious than on the lower, where they must have been often repeated.\n\nHence, 2. granite mountains, generally the most ancient, frequently have their northern or eastern sides covered with strata of gneiss or micaceous schistus, and this often with argillite or primeval sandstone, or limestone, these being either of somewhat later formation, or longer suspendible in water.\n\nHence, 3. different species of stone are often found at different heights of the same flank of a mountain, according as the water which conveyed these species, happened to be differently impregnated at different heights. During the first era its depositions formed the primitive stony masses; after which the creation of fish, limestone, sandstone, (puddingstone) and secondary argillites, in which piseine remains are found, were deposi-\nChap. IV. GEOLOGY.\n\nTheories of the Earth. But during the second era, that of the Noachian deluge, by reason of the violence and irregularity of its aggregation, the depositions were more miscellaneous, and are found at the greatest heights; yet in general they may well be distinguished by the remains of land animals, or of vegetables, or of both, which they present in their strata (or at least by the impressions of vegetables which they bear) as they must have been conveyed after the earth had been inhabited. But mountains regularly stratified bearing such remains, for instance the carboniferous, cannot be deemed to have been formed in a period so tumultuous. During this deluge the waters also held a different course, proceeding at first from south to north, and afterwards in both opposite directions, as shown in treating of that catastrophe in my second essay.\n\n\"Hence, and from various contingent local causes, as partial inundations, earthquakes, volcanoes, the erosion of rivers, the elation of strata, disintegration, the disruption of the lofty mounds by which many lakes were anciently hemmed in, several changes were produced in particular countries, that may at first sight appear, though in reality they are not, exceptions to the operations of the general causes already stated.\n\n\"Thus the mountains of Kamtschatka had their eastern flanks torn and rendered abrupt by the irruption of the general deluge, probably accompanied by earthquakes. And thus the Meissener had its east and north flanks undermined by the river Warze, as Werner has shown; thus the eighth and sixteenth observations are accounted for, as is the thirteenth, by the vast inundations so frequent in this country, (1. Pallas, p. 172), which undermined or corroded its east side, while the western were smoothed by the calcareous depositions from the numerous rivers in its vicinity.\n\n\"Hence, 4. we see why on different sides of lofty mountains different species of stones are found, as Pallas and Sauflure have observed, (2. Sauff. \u00a7 981.), a circumstance which Sauflure imagined almost inexplicable, but which Dolomieu has since happily explained, by shewing that the current which conveyed the calcareous substances to the northern, eastern, and north-eastern sides of the Alps, for instance, was stopped by the height of these mountains, and thus prevented from conveying them to the southern sides, and thus the north-eastern sides were rendered more gentle than the opposite, (3. New Roz. p. 423.), conformably to the theory here given.\n\n\"Hence, 5. where several lofty ridges run parallel to each other, it must frequently happen that the external should intercept the depositions that do not surround them, and thus leave the internal ridges steep on both sides.\n\n\"Hence, 6. low granitic or other primitive hills are frequently uncovered by adventitious strata on all sides, as at Phanet in the county of Donegal, or are covered on all sides; the impregnated waters either easily passing over them, or flagitating upon them, according to the greater or less rapidity of its course, and the obstructions it met with.\"\n\nDr Kirwan's theory of the formation of whin dykes, is as follows.\n\nHe supposes that the dyke existed in the spot where it is found previous to the formation of the horizontal strata; that, during the formation of the latter by deposition, their equal extension on each side of the dyke was obstructed by its height preventing the passage of quakes and the current of waters; that the strata on that side of the dyke which were first formed, occasioned a much more considerable pressure than on the side on which the strata of latter formation repose, and must have pulled the upper and more moveable extremity of the slip gradually towards the side on which there was least pressure; on that side it must therefore overhang: this pressure being of earlier date than on the opposite side, must have had a more considerable effect in depressing each particular stratum, and forcing their integrant particles into closer contact, than could have been produced in those of later formation; and consequently the strata must be lower. The ingenious author has added, with good reason, that he is not satisfied with this explanation. It is undoubtedly quite incompatible with the phenomena which it attempts to explain. For it has been already observed, that the coal and contiguous strata are, in every respect, the same on both sides of a dyke, to whatever distance they may have been elevated or depressed, which demonstrates clearly, that their formation must have been coeval. But, besides, the same derangement takes place in a slip where there is merely a solution of contiguity of the horizontal strata, one side being only elevated or depressed above or below the corresponding side from which it has been detached without having a vertical stratum or dyke interposed.\n\nChap. IV. Of Earthquakes and Volcanoes.\n\nIn the preceding chapters we have given a short account of the materials which constitute the globe of the earth; we have taken a view of the relative position and connexion which subsist among these materials, so far as they are known, and we have considered some of the changes which are supposed to have taken place in their arrangement and distribution, and some of the theories which have been proposed to account for these changes. We have hitherto contemplated nature in a state of seeming repose, conducting her operations by a gradual and silent process, and accomplishing the most beneficial and wonderful effects, unheeded and unobserved. We are now to take a view of those more terrible and sudden changes which are exhibited in the devastation and ruin which accompany the earthquake and the volcano\u2014changes awful in the contemplation, but dreadful and terrible in their tremendous effects.\n\nMany of the phenomena which accompany earthquakes and volcanoes, are common to both. Earthquakes are frequently the forerunners, and sometimes the attendants, of volcanic eruptions; but earthquakes have often existed, and their terrible effects have been feebly felt, where no volcano was ever known.\n\nIn the present chapter, we propose to consider the phenomena, history, and causes of earthquakes and volcanoes, which will form the subjects of the two following sections. In the first we shall treat of earthquakes, and in the second of volcanoes.\n\nSect. I. Of the Phenomena and History of Earthquakes.\n\nEarthquakes have been felt in most countries of the world. There are, however, particular places, which prevail.\nwhich seem to be more subject to this dreadful calamity than others; and this does not seem to depend on any local circumstances, with regard to particular regions of the earth. It may be observed in general, that earthquakes are more frequent within the tropics; but there are places within the torrid zone, which are more rarely visited by earthquakes than some of the more temperate, or even the colder regions of the earth. In the islands of the West Indies, and in some parts of the American continent which lie between the tropics, the earthquake is more frequently felt than in most other regions of the earth. But the northern shores of the Mediterranean, the kingdom of Portugal, and some other places without the tropics, have been often the scene of desolation, by the effects of the earthquake, than many of the islands and extensive continents within the torrid zone. From this circumstance in the history of earthquakes, it would appear that they are not limited to particular regions, on account of proximity to the equator or distance from it, on account of similar situation or extent of continent. Particular islands, however, and particular parts of continents, have undoubtedly been often visited by earthquakes than others. Of all the islands of the West Indies, Jamaica has most frequently experienced their dreadful effects. Indeed, scarcely a year passes, without several shocks of an earthquake being felt in that island. Mexico and Peru in South America, are more subject to earthquakes than the other regions of the American continent. Portugal has been often shaken to the very foundations, by terrible earthquakes, while Spain, immediately adjoining, or it may be said, including it, is comparatively, almost exempted from their effects. It has been observed, that earthquakes have been less destructive in Italy than in Sicily, which are in the immediate vicinity of each other, and are both volcanic countries.\n\nObservations on phenomena so awful and terrible, can scarcely be expected to be very numerous. The operation of the causes which produce them is too rapid, the effects are too sudden and unexpected, to be rendered the subject of accurate or attentive philosophical investigation; or, perhaps, we might acknowledge at once, that they are too extensive and too obscure for the powers of man. They are beyond the grasp of the human mind.\n\nIt has been already observed, that earthquakes are more frequent in volcanic countries than in any others. In these regions they are often dreaded and expected than in other places. Where a volcano exists, and when it has ceased to throw out flame and smoke for any long period, shocks of earthquakes begin to be dreaded. This has been very generally the case with the principal volcanoes of the world, the events of whose history have been recorded. An earthquake is often the forerunner of an eruption, and the very first warning of its approach.\n\nEarthquakes are often preceded by long droughts. The earthquake, however, does not immediately succeed the cessation of the drought, or the fall of rain. Some electrical appearances are observed to take place in the air, before the earthquake comes on. The aurora borealis is frequent and brilliant, and bright meteors are often seen darting from one region of the heavens to another, or from the atmosphere to the earth.\n\nBefore the shock comes on, the waters of the ocean appear to be unusually troubled; without the effect of wind, or any perceptible cause, it swells up with great noise. Fountains and springs are also greatly disturbed, and their waters are agitated, and become muddy. The air at the time of the shock has been observed to be remarkably calm and serene, but afterwards it becomes dark and cloudy.\n\nThe noise which accompanies the shock of an earthquake is sometimes like that of a number of carriages, driving along the pavement of a street with great rapidity. Sometimes it is like a rushing noise, similar to that of wind, and sometimes it resembles the explosions occasioned by the firing of artillery. The noise which accompanied the earthquake, which was pretty generally felt over Scotland about three years ago, we recollect, resembled that of a heavy person walking rapidly, and barefooted, through an adjoining room.\n\nThe effect of earthquakes on the surface of the earth is various. Sometimes it is instantaneously heaved up in a perpendicular direction, and sometimes assumes a kind of rolling motion, from side to side. Sometimes the shock commences with the perpendicular motion, and terminates with the other.\n\nGreat openings or fissures are made in the earth by the shock, and these in general throw out vast quantities of water, but sometimes smoke and flame are also emitted. Flame and smoke are often seen issuing through the surface of the earth, even where no chasm or fissure has been produced.\n\nThe effects of an earthquake on the ocean are not less terrible than those on land. The sea swells up to a great height; its waters sometimes seem to be entirely separated, and from the place of separation, currents of air, smoke, and flame are discharged. Similar effects have been observed to take place in lakes, ponds, and rivers. Their waters are thrown into great agitation, and are sometimes swollen up. Places in which there was a considerable body of water, have become dry land, and dry land has been converted into an extensive lake by the shock of an earthquake.\n\nThe most terrible earthquake that has yet visited the earth, has never been felt over its whole surface. Their effects, however, extend to very distant regions, from the centre or principal scene of desolation. The existence of an earthquake is indicated much more extensively by water than by land. Where its effects have not been at all perceived on dry land, the agitation produced on the waters in the ocean, or in lakes and rivers, has been often communicated to a very great distance.\n\nThe duration of the shock of an earthquake rarely exceeds a minute, and perhaps very few continue for near that length of time. But the shocks are sometimes repeated in rapid succession; and perhaps from the effect on the senses, and the dread and alarm which are thus occasioned, it is supposed that their duration is much longer than it really is.\n\nBut as no general account of the phenomena which accompany an earthquake, from the difficulty or scantiness of observation, can be complete, it will be rendered much more intelligible and interesting, if we enter a little\nlittle more into the detail of the history of particular earthquakes; and in the account of some of them which we propose to lay before our readers, it will be found that most of the appearances and effects which have been enumerated, were observed.\n\nThe first earthquake, the history of which we shall now detail, happened in Calabria, in the year 1638. This earthquake is rather to be considered as an exception to what was said with regard to their not taking place in the neighbourhood of a volcano, soon after an eruption. The volcanoes in that vicinity had experienced violent eruptions a very short time before. Five years before, there had been an eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and two years only had elapsed from the time that a similar event had befallen Aetna. This mountain, indeed, at the very time, threw out a great body of smoke, which seemed to cover the whole island, and entirely concealed the shores from view. The air over the sea at a little distance was calm and serene, and the surface of the water was perfectly smooth. Seemingly without any cause, it began to be slightly agitated, as happens to the surface of water in a heavy shower of rain. A dreadful noise succeeded, and the smell of sulphurous vapours was perceived. The noise, like the rattling of chariots, grew more frequent and loud, and the shock at last was terribly felt, when the earth was heaved up, or rolled in the form of waves.\n\nThis earthquake is particularly described by Kircher, the celebrated geographer. \"On the 24th of March, (says he), we departed in a small boat from the harbour of Messina in Sicily, and the same day arrived at the promontory of Pelorus. Our destination was for the city of Euphemia in Calabria, but unfavourable weather obliged us to remain at Pelorus three days. Weary at length with delay, we determined to proceed on our voyage, and although the sea seemed unusually agitated, yet it did not deter us from embarking. As we approached the gulf of Charybdis, the waters seemed whirled round with such violence, as to form a large hollow in the centre of the vortex. Turning my eyes to Mount Aetna, I saw it throw out huge volumes of smoke, which entirely covered the island. This awful appearance, with the dreadful noise, and the sulphurous smell which accompanied it, filled me with strong apprehensions that some terrible calamity was approaching. The sea itself exhibited a very unusual appearance, its agitation resembling that of the waters of a lake which is covered with bubbles in a violent shower of rain. My surprise was still increased by the calmness and serenity of the weather; not a breeze stirred, not a cloud obscured the face of the sky, which might be supposed to produce these dreadful commotions. I therefore warned my companion, that the unusual phenomena which we observed, were the forerunners of an earthquake. Soon after we stood in for the shore, and landed at Tropaea; but we had scarcely arrived at the Jesuits college in that city, when a horrid sound, which resembled the rattling wheels of an infinite number of chariots, driven furiously along, stunned our ears. Soon after a terrible shaking of the earth began; the ground on which we stood seemed to vibrate, as if we were in the scale of a balance, which continued waving. The motion soon grew more violent; I could no longer keep my legs, but was thrown prostrate upon the ground. After some time had elapsed, when I had recovered from the consternation; and finding that I was unhurt amidst the general crash, I resolved to make the best of my way to a place of safety, and running as fast as I could, I reached the shore. I soon found the boat in which I had landed, as well as my companions; and leaving this scene of desolation, we prosecuted our voyage along the coast. Next day we arrived at Rochetta, where we landed, although the earth still continued in violent commotion. But we had scarcely reached the inn when we were again obliged to return to the boat. In about half an hour we saw the greatest part of the town, as well as the inn where we had stopped, levelled with the ground, and most of the inhabitants buried in its ruins. As we proceeded onward, we landed at Lopezium, which is a castle about half way between Tropaea and Euphemia, to which we were bound; and here, wherever I looked, nothing but scenes of ruin and horror presented themselves. Towns and castles were levelled with the ground, and Stromboli at the distance of 60 miles threw out an immense body of flames, accompanied with a noise which could be distinctly heard. But our attention was quickly drawn from more remote to present danger. The rattling sound which immediately preceded an earthquake, again alarmed us; every moment it seemed to grow louder and louder, and to approach nearer the place on which we stood. A dreadful shaking of the earth now began, so that being unable to stand, my companions and I caught hold of whatever shrub was next us, to support ourselves. After some time the violent commotion ceased, and we stood up, and proposed to prosecute our voyage to Euphemia, which lay within sight, but in the meantime, while we were preparing ourselves, I turned my eyes towards the city, but could see nothing but a thick, black cloud, which seemed to rest on the place. This appeared an extraordinary circumstance, as the sky all round was calm and serene. We waited till the cloud passed away, and then turning to look for the city, it was totally sunk, and where it formerly stood, nothing remained but a dismal and putrid lake.\"\n\nIn the year 1693, an earthquake happened in Sicily, in which not only shook the whole island, but also reached Naples and Malta. Previous to the shock, a black cloud was seen hovering over the city of Catania, which was destroyed at this time. The sea began to be violently agitated; the shocks succeeded like the discharge of a great number of artillery; the motion of the earth was so violent, that no persons could keep their legs. Even those who lay on the ground were tossed from side to side, as on a rolling billow; high walls were razed from their foundations, and were thrown to the distance of several paces. Almost every building in the countries which it visited was thrown down; 54 cities and towns, besides a great number of villages, were either greatly damaged, or totally destroyed. Among those which we have already mentioned, was the city of Catania, one of the most ancient and flourishing in the kingdom. After the thick cloud which remained after the earthquake had dissipated, no remains of this magnificent city could be seen. Of 18,000 inhabitants, not fewer than 18,000 perished by this dreadful calamity.\n\nThe terrible earthquake which visited the island of Jamaica in 1692, affords us another example of almost in 1692, the whole of the phenomena which were enumerated\nas the forerunners or attendants of earthquakes. It was on the 7th of June, in that year, that this dreadful calamity, which in two minutes totally destroyed the town of Port Royal, on the south side of Jamaica, and at that time the capital of the island, took place.\n\nThe effect of the shock on the surface was immediately preceded by a hollow rattling noise, like that of thunder. The streets were heaved up like waves of the sea, and then instantly thrown down into deep pits. All the wells discharged their waters with prodigious agitation; the sea burst its bounds, and deluged a small part of the town which was not entirely overwhelmed. The fissures produced in the earth were so great, that one of the streets seemed twice as broad as formerly, and in some places the earth opened and closed again for some time. A great many of these openings were seen at once. In some of them, the houses and inhabitants, and every thing that was near, were swallowed up. Some persons were swallowed up in one of these chasms, and what will appear most extraordinary, and indeed almost incredible, were thrown out alive from another. Whole streets sunk in some, and from others an immense body of water was projected high into the air. Smells which were extremely offensive now succeeded; nothing but the distant noise of falling mountains was heard, and the sky, which before the shock was still and serene, assumed a dull red colour.\n\nThe effects of this earthquake were not limited to this spot. It was severely felt through the whole island, which in many places sustained very material damage. Indeed there were few houses which were not either injured or thrown down. In some places the inhabitants, houses, trees, and whole surface, were swallowed up in the same chasm; and what was formerly dry land was left a pool of water. The wells in almost every corner of the island, whatever was their depth, threw out their water with great violence. The rivers were either entirely stopped, or ceased to flow for 24 hours; and many of them formed to themselves new channels. At the distance of 12 miles from the sea, an immense body of water spouted out from a gap which was formed in the earth, and was projected to a great height in the air. Such was the violence of the shock, that many persons were thrown down on their faces, even in places where the surface of the ground remained unbroken. It was observed that the shock was most severely felt in the immediate vicinity of the mountains. Could this arise from the greater prelude, and consequently the greater resiliency, or was it because the force which produced these terrible effects existed near them?\n\nAfter the great shock which destroyed the town of Port Royal, the inhabitants who escaped went on board ships in the harbour, where many of them remained for two months, during which time the shocks were repeated, and were so frequent, that there were sometimes two or three in the course of an hour. These were still accompanied with the same rattling noise, like that of thunder, or like the rushing noise occasioned by a current of air in rapid motion. They were also attended with what are called brimstone blasts. These, it is probable, were sulphurous vapours which issued from the openings made by the earthquake. The atmosphere, however, seemed to be loaded with noxious vapours, for a very general sickness soon succeeded, which in a short time swept off not fewer than 3000 persons.\n\nBut of all the earthquakes, the history of which is on record, that which happened at Lisbon, in the year 1755, was by far the most extensive in its effects, and, from its recent occurrence, will probably be deemed the most interesting. In the year 1750, several shocks of earthquakes had been sensibly felt. The four following years were remarkable for excessive drought. The springs which formerly yielded abundance of water, were totally dried up and lost; the winds which chiefly prevailed were from the north and north-east. During this period also there were slight tremors of the earth; the seasons in 1755, were unusually wet, and the summer, as the consequence of this, proved unusually cold. But for the space of 40 days before the earthquake happened, the sky was more clear and serene. On the last day of October the face of the sun was considerably obscured, and a general gloom prevailed over the atmosphere. The day following (the 1st of November) a thick fog arose, but it was soon dissipated by the heat of the sun. Not a breath of wind was stirring; the sea was perfectly calm, and the heat of the weather was equal to that of June or July in this country. At 35 minutes after nine in the morning, without any previous warning, excepting the rattling noise resembling that of distant thunder, the earthquake came on with short, quick vibrations, and shook the very foundation of the city, so that many of the houses instantly fell. A pause, which was indeed just perceptible, succeeded, and the motion changed. The houses were then tossed from side to side, like the motion of a waggon driven violently over rugged stones. It was this second shock which laid great part of the city in ruin, and, as might be expected, great numbers of the inhabitants were destroyed at the same time. The whole duration of the earthquake did not exceed six minutes. When it began, some persons in a boat, at the distance of a mile from the city, and in deep water, thought the boat had struck on a rock, in consequence of the motion which was communicated to it. At the same time they perceived the houses falling on both sides of the river. The bed of the Tagus was in many places raised to the very surface of the water; ships were driven from their anchors or moorings, and were tossed about with great violence; and the persons on board did not for some time know whether they were afloat or aground. A large new pier with several hundreds of people upon it, sunk to an unfathomable depth, and not one of the dead bodies was ever found. The bar of the river was at one time seen dry from side to side; but suddenly the sea came rolling in like a mountain, and in one part of the river the water rose in an instant to the extraordinary height of 50 feet. At noon another shock happened; the walls of some houses that remained were seen to open from top to bottom, near a foot wide, and were afterwards so exactly closed, that scarcely any mark of the injury remained.\n\nBut what was the most singular circumstance attending this earthquake was, the prodigious extent to which its effects reached. At Colares, 20 miles from Lisbon, fell at Colares; and two miles from the sea, the weather was uncommonly warm for the season, on the last day of October. About four o'clock in the afternoon, a fog arose which, proceeding...\nproceeding from the sea, covered the valleys. This was an unusual occurrence at that season of the year; but soon after the wind shifting, the fog returned to the sea, collected over its surface, and became very thick and dark; and as the fog dispersed, the sea was violently agitated, and with great noise. On the first of November, at the dawn of day, the sky was fair and serene; about nine o'clock the sun was overclouded, and became dim. Half an hour after, the rattling noise-like that of chariots was heard; and this soon increased to such a degree, that it resembled the explosions of the largest artillery. The shock of an earthquake was immediately felt, and was quickly succeeded by a second and a third. In these shocks it was observed, that the walls of buildings moved from east to west. From some of the mountains flames were seen issuing, somewhat resembling the kindling of charcoal accompanied with a great deal of thick black smoke. The smoke which arose from one mountain was at the same time accompanied with noise, which increased with the quantity of smoke. When the place from which the smoke issued was afterwards examined, no signs of fire could be perceived.\n\nAt Oporto, near the mouth of the river Douro, the earthquake began at 40 minutes past nine. The sky was quite serene when the hollow rattling noise was heard, and it was immediately attended with a commotion of the earth. In the space of a minute or two, the river rose and fell five or six feet, and continued this motion for four hours. In some places it seemed to open, and discharge great quantities of air. The sea was also violently agitated, and indeed the agitation was so great, to the distance of a league beyond the bar, that it was supposed the discharge of air from that place must also have been very considerable.\n\nSt Ubes, a sea-port town twenty miles south of Lisbon, was entirely swallowed up by the repeated shocks of this earthquake, and the immense fury of the sea which was produced. Large masses of rock were detached from the promontory at the extremity of the town. This promontory consists of a chain of mountains composed of a very hard stone.\n\nThe same earthquake was felt in almost every part of Spain. The only places which escaped from its effects were the provinces of Arragon, Catalonia, and Valencia. At Ayamonte, which is near the place where the Guadiana falls into the bay of Cadiz, the earthquake was not felt till a little before ten o'clock. It was here also preceded by the hollow rattling noise. The shocks continued with intervals, for 14 or 15 minutes, and did very considerable damage. Scarcely half an hour had elapsed from the time that the commotion first began, when the sea, the river, and canals, rose violently over their banks, and laid every place near them under water. The sea rolled in huge mountains, and carried everything before it.\n\nThe earthquake began at Cadiz some minutes after nine in the morning, and lasted about five minutes. The water in the cisterns under ground was so much agitated, that it rose in the form of froth. About ten minutes after eleven, a huge wave was seen coming from the sea, at the distance of eight miles, which was supposed not to be less than 60 feet high, and burst upon the city. The water returned with the same violence with which it approached, and places which were deep at low water were left quite dry. Similar waves continued, but gradually lessening till the evening.\n\nThe earthquake was not felt at Gibraltar till after ten o'clock. There it began with a tremulous motion of the earth, which continued for about half a minute. A violent shock then followed; the tremulous motion again commenced, and continued for five or six seconds, and then succeeded a second shock, but less violent than the first. The whole time did not exceed two minutes; the earth had an undulating motion; some of the guns on the batteries were seen to rise, and others to sink. Many people, seized with sickness and giddiness, fell down. Some who were walking or riding, felt no shock, but were attacked with sickness; the sea had an extraordinary flux and reflux; it ebbed and flowed every 15 minutes; it rose six feet, and then fell suddenly too low, that a great many fish and small boats were left on the shore.\n\nThe shock was felt at Madrid nearly at the same time as at Gibraltar. It continued for five minutes, and the same sickness and giddiness prevailed. It was not felt by those who walked leisurely, or who were in carriages, and no accident happened excepting two persons who were killed by the fall of a stone cross from the porch of a church.\n\nMalaga, a sea-port town on the Mediterranean, experienced a violent shock; the bells were set a ringing in the steeples, and the water of the wells overflowed, and as suddenly retired. St Lucar, at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, suffered much from a similar shock, as well as from an inundation of the sea, which broke in, and did great damage. At Seville, 16 leagues above this, a number of houses was thrown down; the celebrated tower of the cathedral, called La Giralda, opened in the four sides; the waters were thrown into violent agitation, and the vessels in the river were driven on shore.\n\nIn Africa this earthquake was felt nearly as severely as in Europe. Great part of the city of Algiers was destroyed. This happened about ten in the morning. About the same time at Arzila, a town in the kingdom of Fez, the sea suddenly rose with such impetuosity, that it lifted up a vessel in the bay, and forced it on shore with such violence that it was broken to pieces. A boat was also found within land, at the distance of two mulek shots from the sea. At Fez and Mequinez, many houses were thrown down, and numbers of persons were buried in the ruins.\n\nMany people were destroyed at Morocco by the falling of houses. Eight leagues from the city the earth opened, and swallowed up a village with all its inhabitants, to the number of 8,000 or 10,000, as well as all their cattle. Soon after the earth closed, and they were seen no more. The town of Sallee also suffered greatly; a third part of the houses were thrown down; the waters rushed into the streets with great violence, and when they retired, they left behind them a large quantity of fish. The earthquake began at Tangier at ten in the morning; its whole duration was about ten or twelve minutes. The sea came up to the walls with great violence, and retired immediately with the same rapidity, leaving behind a great quantity of fish. This agitation of the water was repeated no less than 18 times, and continued till about six o'clock in the evening. It began at the same time at Tetuan, but its duration\nration was only about seven or eight minutes. Three of the shocks were so violent as to excite great apprehensions that the city would be destroyed. Similar effects were produced by the same earthquake at different places along the African shore of the Mediterranean.\n\nAt the town of Funchal in Madeira, the first shock of this earthquake was felt at 38 minutes past nine. It was preceded by the rattling noise, which seemed to be produced in the air; the shock, it was supposed, continued for more than a minute; the earth moved with a vibratory, undulating motion, and some of the vibrations increased greatly in force. The noise in the air which accompanied the shocks, lasted some seconds after the motion of the earth had ceased. At three quarters past eleven, the day being calm and serene, the sea retired suddenly, then, without the least noise, rose with a great swell, overflowed the shore, and entered the city. It rose 15 feet perpendicular above high-water mark. Having thus fluctuated four or five times, it at last subsided, and resumed its former stillness. In the northern part of the island, the inundation was still more violent. It first retired to the distance of 100 paces, and suddenly returning, overflowed the shore, broke down walls of magazines and storehouses, and left behind it great quantities of fish in the streets of a village. At this place the sea rose only once beyond the high-water mark, although it continued to fluctuate much longer before it entirely subsided than at Funchal.\n\nSuch were the effects of this earthquake, in those places where it was accompanied with considerable damage. It was, however, perceptibly felt to a great distance in every direction, either, by a slight motion of the earth, or by the agitation of the waters. At the island of Antigua the sea rose to such a height as had never been before known, and afterwards the water at the wharfs, which used to be six feet deep, was not more than two inches. About two in the afternoon, the sea ebbed and flowed at Barbadoes in a very unusual manner. It overflowed the wharfs, and rushed into the streets. This flux and reflux continued till 10 at night.\n\nShocks were distinctly felt in different parts of France, as at Bayonne, Bordeaux, and Lyons. The waters were also observed to be agitated in different places, as at Angoul\u00eame, and Havre de Grace, but with a less degree of violence than some which have been mentioned. At Angoul\u00eame, a subterraneous noise like thunder was heard, and soon after a torrent of water, mixed with red sand, was discharged from an opening in the earth. Most of the springs in the neighbourhood sunk, and continued dry for some time.\n\nThe effects of this earthquake were also very perceptible in many places of Germany. Throughout the duchy of Holstein, the waters were greatly agitated, particularly the Elbe and Trave. The water of a lake, called Libeck, in Brandenburg, ebbed and flowed six times in half an hour, and although the weather was then perfectly calm, this motion was accompanied with a great noise. A similar agitation took place in the waters of the lakes called Mupelgafft and Netzow, but here there was also emitted a most offensive smell.\n\nThe sea was greatly agitated round the island of Corsica, and many of the rivers of the island overflowed their banks. The same earthquake was felt in the city of Milan in Italy, and its neighbourhood. Turin in Savoy experienced a very smart shock.\n\nMany of the rivers of Switzerland became all at once muddy, although there had been no rain. The lake of Neufchatel rose to the height of two feet above its usual level, and continued at this height for a few hours. The waters of the lake of Zurich were also greatly agitated.\n\nThe commotion of the waters in Holland was still more remarkable. In the afternoon of the 1st of November, the waters of the Rhine at Alphen, between Leyden and Woerden, were so violently agitated, that the buoys were broken from their chains, large vessels parted from their cables, and smaller ones were thrown upon the dry land. At 11 in the forenoon at Amsterdam, when the air was perfectly calm, the waters in the canals were thrown into great commotion, so that boats broke loose from their moorings, chandeliers were observed to vibrate in the churches, although it is said no motion of the earth was perceptible. In the forenoon at Haarlem, not only the water in the rivers, canals, &c., but, it is asserted, smaller quantities of fluids contained in vessels, were greatly agitated, and sometimes dashed over the sides of the vessels. This continued for about four minutes. Between 10 and 11 in the forenoon, in some of the canals at Leyden, the waters rose suddenly, and produced very perceptible undulations.\n\nThe effects of this earthquake extended as far north as Norway and Sweden; many of the rivers and lakes in Norway were greatly agitated; shocks were felt in several of the provinces of Sweden, and commotions of the waters, with the rivers and lakes, especially in Dalecarlia, were observed. The river Dala suddenly overflowed its banks, and as suddenly retired; and at the same time, a lake which is a league distant from it, bubbled up with great violence. Several smart shocks were felt at Fahlun, a town in Dalecarlia.\n\nIn many places of Great Britain and Ireland, the agitation of the waters was very perceptible. At Eaton bridge in Kent, near a pond of an acre in extent, some persons heard a sudden noise, which they supposed was occasioned by something falling into the pond, for it was then a dead calm, and ran to the spot; where they saw the pond open in the middle, while the water dashed over a perpendicular bank two feet high. This motion was repeated several times, and still accompanied with a great noise.\n\nAt Cobham in Surrey, between 10 and 11 o'clock A.M., a person was watering a horse at a pond, the waters of which were derived from springs. At the moment the animal was drinking, the waters retired from his mouth, and left the bottom of the pond dry. It then returned with great violence, and when it retired, its progress was towards the south. About the same time at Bulbridge, in the same county, while the weather was remarkably calm, the waters of a canal 700 feet long and 58 broad, were greatly agitated, and this was accompanied with an unusual noise. The waters rose between two and three feet above the usual level, in the form of a heap or ridge, extending 30 yards in length. This ridge then heeled towards the north side, and flowed with great impetuosity over the grass walk; it then returned to the canal, again heaped up in the middle, and then heeled to the south side with\nEarthquake with still greater violence, flowing over the grass walk, quakes and leaving several feet at the bottom of the canal on the north side perfectly dry. These motions continued for 15 minutes, after which the waters returned their former tranquility. During the agitation of the waters, the sand and mud at the bottom were thrown up, and mixed with them.\n\nIn Suffolk, the water of a pond at Dunstable rose gradually for several minutes in the form of a pyramid, and then fell down like a water-lout. In other ponds in the same neighbourhood, the waters of which were less agitated, there was a smooth flux and reflux from the one extremity to the other.\n\nAt Earleycourt in Berkshire, about 11 o'clock, a person standing near a fish pond, felt a violent trembling of the earth, which continued for about a minute. He observed immediately after, the water move from the south to the north end of the pond, leaving the bottom of the south end quite dry, to the extent of six feet. It then returned, flowed at the south end, rose three feet up the bank, and immediately after returned to the north bank, where it rose to the same height. Between the flux and reflux the waters formed a ridge in the middle of the pond, 20 inches higher than the level on each side, and boiled up with great violence.\n\nSimilar phenomena were observed about half after ten, near Durham. A person was alarmed with a sudden rushing noise, which seemed to proceed from a pond. The water rose gradually up without any fluctuating motion, stood some inches higher than the usual level; it then subsided and swelled again, and continued in this manner rising and falling for the space of five or seven minutes, rising four or five times in a minute.\n\nThe effects of this earthquake in Derbyshire excited considerable alarm. At Buxton, between 11 and 12 o'clock, in a boathouse on the west side of a large body of water, called Pibble dam, which is supposed to cover not less than 30 acres of land, there was heard a sudden and terrible noise; a well of water proceeding from the south, rose two feet on the slope dam head at the north end. It then subsided, but immediately returned. The water continued thus agitated for 45 minutes, but became gradually less violent. At Eyam bridge in the Peak, an overseer of the lead mines, sitting in his room about 11 o'clock, felt a sudden shock, by which the chair on which he sat was suddenly raised, and some pieces of platter were broken off from the sides of the room. The commotion was so great that he thought the engine shaft had fallen together, and he ran out to see what was the matter, and found everything in safety. Some miners employed at the time in a drift 120 yards deep, were greatly alarmed first with one shock, and then with a second, which seemed to be so violent as to make the rocks grind upon one another. Three other shocks succeeded the two first at intervals of a few minutes, and became gradually weaker.\n\nA little after 10 o'clock in the morning, the water in a moat which surrounds Shireburn castle in Oxfordshire, exhibited a very unusual appearance. A thick fog prevailed, the air was perfectly still, and the surface of the water quite smooth. At one corner it was observed to flow towards the shore, and then again to retire; and this flux and reflux continued for some time quite regular. Every flux began slowly; but increased in its velocity till near its full height, when it rushed with great impetuosity; and having remained for a short time stationary, it then retired, at first slowly, but at last it sunk with great rapidity. What will appear most singular in this commotion of the water is, that it was limited to one part of the moat. At a different corner about 25 yards distant no motion could be perceived. But in that part of the moat directly opposite to the place where the motion of the water was first observed, the water rose towards the shore at the same time as at the other side. In a pond at a little distance the waters were agitated in a similar manner, but the risings and sinkings took place at different times from those in the moat.\n\nOn the evening of the same day, about three quarters after six, and about the time of two hours ebb of the tide, at White rock in Glamorganshire, a great body of water rushed up accompanied with great noise. It was in such quantity that it floated two vessels not less than 200 tons burden each, drove them from their moorings, and carried them across the river. The whole length of time of the rise and fall of this body of water did not exceed 10 minutes, so that it seemed to have burst from the earth at the spot where it appeared. It seems singular, if the account of it be correct, that on this spot the effects of the earthquake should be felt at the distance of seven or eight hours from the time it was felt in other parts of the island.\n\nThe waters of the lakes in Scotland were also greatly agitated from the same cause. Half an hour after nine in the morning, without the least breath of wind, the water in Loch Lomond rose suddenly and violently against its banks. It immediately fell very low, again returned to the shore, and in five minutes rose as high as at first. This commotion continued till 15 minutes after 10, with an alternate flux and reflux every five minutes. From this time, till 11 o'clock, the height to which the water rose gradually diminished, till it returned to its former tranquility. But each flux and reflux continued for a period of five minutes as at first. Here the violence of the shock was such, that a large stone lying at some distance from the shore in shallow water, was moved from its place and carried to dry land, leaving a deep furrow in the ground along which it had moved.\n\nAbout the same time the waters of Loch Ness in the north of Scotland exhibited also a very unusual agitation. About ten o'clock the river Oich, which falls into the head of the loch, swelled very much, and ran upwards from the loch with a high wave two or three feet above its usual level. The motion of the wave was in a direction contrary to that of the wind, and it proceeded with great rapidity up the river for the space of 200 yards, broke on a shallow, and overflowed the banks. It then returned gently to the loch. This ebbing and flowing continued for about an hour, the height of the waves gradually diminishing, till, about 11 o'clock, a wave higher than any of the former broke with such violence on the bank on the side of the river, that it ran upwards of 30 feet from the bank.\n\nBetween two and three o'clock in the afternoon, at Kinfaile in Ireland, when the weather was perfectly calm and the tide nearly full, a great body of water suddenly burst into the harbour, and with such violence,\nJence, that it broke the cables of two vessels, each moored with two anchors, and of several boats which lay near the town. The vessels were whirled round several times by an eddy formed in the water, and then hurried back again with the same rapidity as before. These motions were repeated different times; and while the current rushed up along one side of the harbour, it ran down with the same violence along the other. The muddy bottom of the harbour was greatly altered; the mud was removed from some places and deposited in others. At one place the height of the water, where it was measured, was found to be five feet and a half; in other places it is said to have been much higher, particularly where it flowed into the market-place with such rapidity, that many persons had not time to escape, but were immersed, knee deep, in the water. These commotions extended several miles up the river, and were most perceptible in shallow places. The alternate elevation and depression of the water continued about ten minutes, when the tide returned to its usual level. In the evening, between six and seven, the water rose again, but with less violence than before, and continued to ebb and flow till three next morning. The rise of the waters was not at first gradual, but, accompanied with a hollow noise, rose six or seven feet in a minute, and rushed in like a deluge, after which it suddenly subsided. The waters, too, became thick and muddy, emitting at the same time a most offensive smell. Similar agitations of the waters were observed all along the coast to the westward of Kinfaile.\n\nSuch were the phenomena of this earthquake, as they were observed on land in the different places which have been mentioned. Its effects were also severely felt at sea. A frigate off St Lucar received so violent a shock, that it was supposed she had struck the ground. Another vessel in N. Lat. 36\u00b0 24', between nine and ten in the morning, was so much shaken and strained as if she had struck upon a rock. The seam of the deck opened, and the compass was overturned. The sensation experienced by some persons on board of another vessel, which was then in N. Lat. 25\u00b0 W. Long. 40\u00b0, were such as if she had been suddenly raised up and suspended by a rope. One person looking out at the cabin window, thought he saw land about a mile distant; but when he reached the deck, no land was to be seen. A strong current was observed crossing the ship's way to leeward. The current returned in about a minute with great violence; and, at the distance of about a league, three craggy pointed rocks were seen throwing up water of various colours, and seemingly resembling fire. This appearance terminated in a thick black cloud, which arose heavily in the atmosphere. Between nine and ten in the morning another ship, 40 leagues off St Vincent, received so violent a shock, that the men on deck were thrown a foot and a half above its surface, and the anchors, although they were lashed down, bounced up. Immediately after the ship sunk in the water so low as the main chains. On hearing the lead a great depth of water was found, and the line was of a yellow colour, and gave out the smell of sulphur. The first shock was the most violent; but smaller ones were repeated for 24 hours.\n\nThe effects of this earthquake on springs were very remarkable. On the afternoon of the 31st of October, the water of a fountain at Colares was observed to be greatly diminished. On the morning of the 1st of November, the day on which the earthquake happened, it became thick and muddy, but afterwards recovered its usual quantity and limpidity. In some places springs appeared where there had been formerly no water, and continued afterwards to flow. At Varge, on the river Macaas, many springs of water burst forth at the time of the earthquake, and some threw up their waters mixed with sand of various colours, to the height of 18 or 20 feet. In Barbary, a stream of water, which was as red as blood, burst forth from a mountain, which was split in two. At Tangier all the fountains were dried up during the whole of the day on which the earthquake happened. The mineral waters of Toplitz, a village in Bohemia, which have been celebrated since the year 1762, experienced a very remarkable change. The principal hot spring had continued to flow from the time it was discovered, of the same temperature and the same in quantity. On the morning of the earthquake, between 11 and 12 o'clock, the waters of this spring increased so much in quantity, that all the baths ran over in the space of half an hour. A short time before the water increased, it flowed from the spring thick and muddy; and then having entirely stopped for about a minute, it burst out with great violence, carrying before it a great quantity of reddish ochre. It afterwards became limpid, and flowed as formerly; but in larger quantity, and of a higher temperature. At Angoul\u00eame in France the earth opened in one place, and discharged a great body of water, which was mixed with reddish sand. Most of the springs in the neighbourhood sunk low, that for some time it was supposed they had become quite dry.\n\nSuch were the extraordinary effects of this terrible earthquake, which extended over a space not less than four millions of square miles. Other earthquakes, although of more limited extent, have produced effects not less destructive, and particularly some of the earthquakes which have visited Italy and Sicily in modern times; accounts of which have been drawn up with accuracy and attention. Some of these we shall now detail.\n\nOne of the most calamitous earthquakes was that which befell Calabria in the year 1783. Of this earthquake Sir William Hamilton, who, soon after the Calabria in earthquake happened, visited the scenes of desolation which it left behind, has drawn up a particular account. He observes, that \"if on a map of Italy, and with your compass on the scale of Italian miles, you were to measure off 22, and then fixing the central point on the city of Oppido, which seemed to be the spot where the earthquake had exerted its greatest force, form a circle, the radius of which will be 22 miles, you will then include all the towns, villages, &c. that have been utterly ruined, and the spots where the greatest mortality happened, and where there have been the most visible alterations on the face of the earth. Then extend your compass in the same scale to 72 miles, preserving the same centre, and form another circle, you will include the whole country that has any mark of having been affected by the earthquake. A gradation was plainly observed in the damage done to the...\"\nThe inhabitants of the town of Scilla, on the first shock of the earthquake on the 5th of February, had fled along with their prince to the sea shore for safety, and remained either on the strand or in boats near the shore. In the night time a tremendous wave overflowed the land to the distance of three miles from the shore, and, in its return, swept off near 3000 of the inhabitants, among whom was the prince. This water was said by some to have been boiling hot, so that many of the people were supposed to have been scalded with it. A mountain, it is alleged, of 500 palms in height, and 1300 palms in circumference at its base, was detached from the place where it stood, and carried to the distance of four miles. It was about the same time that the hill on which the town of Oppido stood, and which extended three miles in length, was split in two, and filled up on each side the bed of a river. Two great lakes were formed by the current of the rivers being stopped; and, as they increased in extent, infected the air with their putrid and noisome exhalations.\n\nSir William Hamilton, who was then resident at Naples as ambassador from Britain, was indefatigable in obtaining every kind of information with regard to the effects of this earthquake. With this view he made an extensive tour over those parts of the country which had been visited by this calamity. Some of the accounts which were first published seemed to have been somewhat exaggerated, either from the love of the marvellous in those who framed them, or from the excessive alarms of the surviving sufferers. On the 2d of May following Sir William landed on the coast of Nether Calabria. The effects of the earthquake were first perceived at Cedraro. The inhabitants had quitted their houses, but it did not appear that the town had sustained any material damage. Most of the inhabitants of St Lucido were then living in barracks, and the baron's palace, as well as the church steeple, had suffered greatly. He afterwards landed at the town of Pizzo in Farther Calabria. This town stood on volcanic tufa. It sustained great injury from the shock of the 5th February, but was completely destroyed by that of the 28th. Here he was informed, that Stromboli, a volcanic mountain which is nearly opposite, and in full view, but 50 miles distant, had ejected much less matter, and had thrown up less smoke, during the time of the earthquakes, than it had done for many years before. Even at this time slight shocks of earthquakes were occasionally felt. One indeed happened the same night. The boat in which he slept received a smart shock, and seemed to be lifted out of the water; but this shock was unaccompanied with noise.\n\nThe town of Monteleone is situated on a hill which overlooks some fine rich plains and the sea below. These plains, formerly covered with numerous towns and villages, now exhibited a gloomy scene of utter defoliation. The town of Monteleone itself had not suffered materially from the first shock on the 5th of February; but it was considerably damaged by some of those which took place afterwards. It was generally observed, that the shocks of the earthquake came on with a rattling noise, which seemed to proceed from the westward. They usually began with a horizontal motion, and terminated with a whirling motion, during which most of the buildings in the province were thrown down. It was generally observed too, that previous to a shock the clouds...\nclouds seemed to be unusually still and motionless, and that a flock quickly succeeded a heavy shower of rain.\n\nApproaching the plain, it was observed, according to the general remark made above, that the towns and villages were more or less defoliated in proportion to their vicinity to the plain. Of the town of Mileto, which stood in a bottom, not a house remained. Soriano and the noble Dominican convent presented a heap of ruins. According to the same general remark, all the buildings which stood upon the high grounds, the foil of which is a gritty sandstone, sustained less damage than those situated in the plain, for the latter were universally thrown down. The soil of the plain is a sandy clay of various colours, and full of sea shells. It is frequently intersected by rivers and torrents which have formed wide and deep ravines. Paffing through St Pietro, a town in ruins, Sicily was seen and the summit of Mount Aetna, which at this time threw out a considerable quantity of smoke. In a swampy plain through which he passed, Sir William examined a number of small holes in the earth, of the shape of an inverted cone. These holes were covered with sand as well as the surrounding soil. During the earthquake of the 5th of February, water mixed with sand spouted up to a considerable height from each of these openings. The river, it was observed, before these fountains burst out, was dried up; but soon after the waters returned, and overflowed their banks. It appeared from more extensive observation, that the same thing had uniformly happened to all the other rivers in the plain during the shock of the 5th of February. This has been ascribed to the first impulse of the earthquake proceeding from the bottom upwards, and this seemed to be the general opinion. The surface of the plain then rising suddenly, the rivers which are shallow naturally disappeared; and the plain returning with violence to its former level, the rivers returned and overflowed from the sudden depression of the boggy grounds, which would naturally force out the water under their surface.\n\nThe town of Rofarno, with the duke of Monteleone's palace, was a heap of ruins; six feet high of the walls only remained. It was somewhat singular, that the only building which escaped uninjured was the public jail. At Laureana Sir William ascertained the truth of the circumstance of the two tenements which were said to have been removed from their situations. These stood in a valley surrounded with high grounds. In the same valley were observed hollows in the form of inverted cones similar to those which he had formerly examined. Between this place and the town of Polifene he did not see a single house, after travelling four days through a rich and beautiful country. Everything presented the most indefinable misery: the violence of the earthquake was so great that all the inhabitants were buried in an instant alive or dead in the ruins of their houses. This town was situated between two rivers that were occasionally subject to overflow their banks. Of six thousand inhabitants, more than two thousand lost their lives by the shock on the 5th of February.\n\nThe princess Gerace Grimaldi, with four thousand of her subjects, perished at Catal Nuova on the same day; some persons who were dug alive out of the ruins observed, that they felt their houses fairly lifted up without any previous warning. An inhabitant of this town, being at that moment on a hill which overlooked the plain, when he felt the shock turned round towards the town, but he could see nothing excepting a thick white cloud of dust. So completely was this town destroyed, that no vestige of house or street remained; all lay in the same confused heap of ruins. Other towns had suffered in the same manner, and now exhibited the same scene of desolation.\n\nTerra Nuova suffered severely from the same earthquake. It is situated between two rivers which had formed deep and wide ravines in their course; one of these was not less than 500 feet deep, and three quarters of a mile broad. In consequence of the great depth of this ravine, and the violent motion of the earth, two large masses of the soil on which a great part of the town, consisting of some hundred houses, had been thrown into the ravine at the distance of half a mile from the place where they formerly stood. Many of the inhabitants who had been carried along with their houses, were dug out of the ruins alive, and even some of them escaped unhurt. Of 1600 inhabitants, 400 only remained alive. In other places in the same neighbourhood, great tracts of land had been removed and carried to a considerable distance, with all their plantations and crops, which continued to grow and thrive in their new situation as well as formerly. The river here disappeared at the moment of the earthquake; but soon after returned, and covered the bottom of the ravine to the depth of three feet. This water was observed to be fat like that of the sea.\n\nThe whole town of Molochi di Sotto had been thrown into the ravine, and a vineyard of many acres lay near it in an inclined situation, but had not suffered any other injury. In several parts of the plain, the soil, with all its trees and crops of corn, to the extent of many acres, had sunk eight and ten feet below the level of the plain; and in other places it had risen the same height. The soil of this plain, it is to be observed, is composed of clay mixed with sand, which readily assumes any form.\n\nSir William next proceeded to Oppido, which, it will be recollected, was considered as the central point of Oppido, which the greatest force of the earthquake was exerted. This city stands on a mountain of gritstone of a reddish colour. It is surrounded by two rivers, which run in a deep ravine. It had been reported, that the mountain on which the city stands, had been split in two, and stopped up the course of the rivers; but it appeared on examination, that huge masses of the plain on the edge of the ravine, had been detached into it, and had so far filled it up, as to stop the course of the rivers, the waters of which were collecting, and forming lakes to a great extent. Part of the rock, it was found, on which the city stood, was separated, and with several houses upon it, was thrown into the ravine. Great tracts of land, with plantations of vines and olives, were transported from one side of the ravine to the other, to a distance exceeding half a mile.\n\n\"Having walked,\" (says Sir William,) \"over the ruins of Oppido, I descended into the ravine, and examined carefully the whole of it. Here I saw, indeed, the wonderful force of the earthquake, which has produced exactly the same effects as those described in the ravine at Terra Nuova, but on a scale infinitely greater. The enormous masses of the plain detached from each side of...\"\nof the ravine, lie sometimes in confused heaps, forming real mountains, and having flopped the course of two rivers (one of which is very considerable), great lakes are already formed; and if not afflicted by nature or art so as to give the rivers their due course, must infallibly be the cause of a general infection in the neighbourhood. Sometimes I met with a detached piece of the surface of the plain (of many acres in extent) with the large oaks and olive trees, with corn or lupins under them, growing as well and in as good order at the bottom of the ravine, as their companions from whence they were separated do on their native foil, at least 500 feet higher, and at the distance of about three quarters of a mile. I met with whole vineyards in the same order in the bottom, that had likewise taken the same journey. As the banks of the ravine from whence these pieces came are now bare and perpendicular, I perceived that the upper foil was a reddish earth, and the under one a sandy white clay, very compact, and like a soft stone. The impulse these huge masses received, either from the violent motion of the earth alone, or that assisted with the additional one of the volcanic exhalations let at liberty, seems to have acted with greater force on the lower and more compact stratum than on the upper cultivated crust: for I constantly observed, where these cultivated lands lay, the under stratum of compact clay had been driven some hundred yards farther, and lay in confused blocks; and, as I observed, many of these blocks were in a cubical form. The soil, having had a greater impulse, and leaving the upper in its flight, naturally accounts for the order in which the trees, vineyards, and vegetation fell, and remain at present in the bottom of the ravine.\n\n\"In another part of the bottom of the ravine there is a mountain composed of the same clay foil, and which was probably a piece of the plain detached by an earthquake at some former period; it is about 250 feet high, and 400 feet diameter at its basis. This mountain, as is well attested, has travelled down the ravine near four miles; having been put in motion by the earthquake of the 5th of February. The abundance of rain which fell at that time, the great weight of the fresh detached pieces of the plain which I saw heaped up at the back of it, the nature of the soil of which it is composed, and particularly its situation on a declivity, account well for this phenomenon; whereas the reports which came to Naples of a mountain having leaped four miles, had rather the appearance of a miracle. I found some single timber trees also with a lump of their native foil at their roots, standing upright in the bottom of the ravine, and which had been detached from the bottom of the plain above mentioned. I observed also, that many confused heaps of the loose soil, detached by the earthquake from the plains on each side of the ravine, had actually run like a volcanic lava (having probably been assisted by the heavy rain), and produced many effects much resembling those of lava during their course down a great part of the ravine. At Santa Cristina, near Oppido, the like phenomena have been exhibited, and the great force of the earthquake of the 5th of February seems to have been exerted on these parts, and at Cafal Nuova, and Terra Nuova.\"\n\nThe next places which were visited were the towns of Seminara and Palmi. Palmi is nearer the sea, and Earthquakes and Volcanoes had suffered most; not fewer than 1,400 of the inhabitants having been destroyed. In the course of his tour in this part of the country, he was informed that the sea was observed to be hot, and fire was seen issuing from the earth.\n\nAt Reggio, although the shock had been much less violent than in other places, no house was yet habitable. During the earthquakes which visited this place in 1770 and 1780, near 17,000 inhabitants lived for several months encamped in the fields, or in barracks.\n\nHaving examined the different places on the Calabrian coast, which had suffered from this terrible earthquake, Sir William Hamilton sailed for Messina in Sicily, to be informed of its effects there. He found that the shock had been very violent, but far less to than on the opposite shores. Many of the houses, even in the lower part of the town, were standing, and some of them had sustained little damage; but in the more elevated situations the shocks seemed to have had scarcely any effect. This still corresponds with the general remark, which was already made. A striking instance of this appeared in two convents, which are situated on elevated places, and had suffered nothing from the earthquakes which had afflicted the country for four months. It was said that fire had been seen issuing from fissures of the earth near the shore. The shock of the earthquake on the 5th of February, seemed to proceed from the bottom upwards; but the succeeding shocks came on with a horizontal or whirling motion.\n\nA remarkable circumstance with regard to fish, was taken notice of at Messina, and indeed the same thing was observed along the coast of Calabria, where the effects of the earthquake had been most severe. A small fish, somewhat larger than the English white bait, but resembling it, and which usually lies at the bottom of the sea, buried in sand, had remained for several months after the commencement of the earthquakes, near the surface, and was taken in great abundance to be the common food of poor people. Before the earthquake, this fish was extremely rare, and was considered as a great delicacy. After the earthquake, indeed, it was observed, that fish of all kinds were found in greater abundance.\n\nThese earthquakes, of which we have now given so detailed an account, continued for many months afterwards; tremulous motions of the earth continued to be felt, and they were not perfectly settled even in the year 1784.\n\nThe southern continent of America is often visited by earthquakes. In the year 1797, Peru was afflicted with this dreadful calamity, which perhaps in the extent of surface which experienced the dreadful shock, exceeds that of any earthquake, the history of which is on record. The following is a short account of this earthquake, by M. Cavanilles. \"In the midst, (says he), of the most profound calm, there is frequently heard a dreadful bellowing noise, the forerunner of earthquakes, to which this part of the world is often exposed. After the year 1791, this noise was frequently heard in the neighbourhood of the mountain of Tunguragua. Antonio Pineda and N\u00e9e, the two naturalists employed in the expedition round the world, when examining the declivity of this volcano, the lava of which had been hardened more by the internal fire than...\nthan by the ardour of the sun, were struck with terror by the horrible sound which they heard, and the heat which they experienced. Pineda, that valuable member of society, whose premature death is still deplored by the friends of science, foretold that a terrible eruption was preparing in the mountain of Tunguragua; and his conjectures were confirmed by the event. On the 4th of February 1797, at three quarters past seven in the morning, the summit of the volcano was more free from vapours than usual; the interior part of the mountain was agitated by frequent shocks, and the adjacent chains burst in such a manner, that in the space of four minutes an immense tract of country was convulsed by an undulating movement. Never did history relate the effects of an earthquake so extraordinary, and never did any phenomenon of nature produce more misfortunes, or destroy a greater number of human beings. A number of towns and villages were destroyed in a moment: some of them, such as Riobamba, Quero, Pelileo, Patate, Pillaro, were buried under the ruins of the neighbouring mountains; and others in the jurisdictions of Hambata, Latacunga, Guaranda, Riobamba, and Alaufi, were entirely overthrown. Some sustained prodigious loss by the gulfs which were formed, and by the reflux of rivers intercepted in their course by mounds of earth; and others, though in part saved, were in such a shattered state as to threaten their total ruin. The number of persons who perished during the first and succeeding shocks is estimated at 16,000. At ten o'clock in the morning, and four in the afternoon, the same day, (February 4.) after a dreadful noise, the earth was again agitated with great violence, and it did not cease to shake, though faintly, for the whole months of February and March; but, at three quarters past two in the morning of the 5th of April, the villages already ruined were again exposed to such violent shocks as would have been sufficient to destroy them. This extraordinary phenomenon was felt throughout the extent of 140 leagues from east to west, from the sea as far as the river Napo; and without doubt farther, for we are little acquainted with the districts which are inhabited by the savages. The distance north-east and south-west between Popayan and Piura, is reckoned to be 170 leagues; but in the centre of that district, 1 degree 16' from these places, is situated the part totally destroyed, and which comprehends 40 leagues from north to south between Guaramand and Machache, and twenty leagues from east to west. But, as if an earthquake alone had not been sufficient to ruin this fertile and populous country, another misfortune, hitherto unknown, was added. The earth opened, and formed immense gulfs; the summits of the mountains tumbled down into the valleys, and from the fissures in their sides there issued an immense quantity of fetid water, which in a little time filled up valleys a thousand feet in depth and six hundred in breadth. It covered the villages, buildings, and inhabitants; choked up the sources of the purest springs, and being condensed by desiccation, in the course of a few days into an earthy and hard paste, it intercepted the course of rivers, made them flow backwards for the space of 87 days, and converted whole districts of dry land into lakes. Very extraordinary phenomena, which will doubtless be one day mentioned in history, occurred during these earthquakes; I shall, however, content myself with mentioning only two of them. At the same moment that the earth shook, the lake of Quirotoa, near the village of Infiloc, in the jurisdiction of Latacunga, took fire, and the vapour which rose from it suffocated the cattle and flocks that were feeding in the neighbourhood. Near the village of Pelileo, a large mountain named Moya, which was overturned in an instant, threw out a prodigious stream of the before-mentioned thick fetid matter, which destroyed and covered the miserable remains of that city. Naturalists will one day find, in these ravaged countries, objects worthy of their researches. Fragments of the minerals and earths of Tunguragua are about to be transported to Spain; but it is not in such fragments that we ought to search for the cause of these surprising phenomena; we must visit the country itself, where this conflict of the elements took place, and where the ruins it occasioned are still to be seen (G.)\n\nTo the history of earthquakes now given, we shall in Scotland, only add the following account of the earthquakes which have taken place at Comrie in Perthshire, in Scotland, which was communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, by Dr Finlayson, in a letter from Mr Taylor.\n\n\"The earthquakes which have lately (January 1790) taken place at Comrie (H) and its neighbourhood, are certainly very deserving of attention. I shall therefore cheerfully comply with your request, and give you as particular a description as I can of such of them as have been most remarkable. To give a particular account of all the noises or concussions which, during the last half year, have been heard or felt at Comrie, and within a short distance to the north, east, and west of that village, is beyond my power, and would indeed be of little use. With regard to these small concussions, it will be sufficient to say, that many of them have sometimes been observed to succeed one another in the space of a few hours; that they take place in all kinds of weather; that they are thought by some people to proceed from north-west to south-east, and by others from north-east to south-west; that they have not been observed to affect the barometer; that they do not extend in any direction above three or four miles from Comrie; and that towards the south they are bounded by the Earn, which is in the immediate vicinity of the village. The same person, though bestowing the minutest attention, is often uncertain whether they proceed from the earth.\n\n(G) The volcano of Tunguragua occasioned an earthquake in 1557.\n(H) Comrie is a village about 22 miles west of Perth, situated in the valley of Strathearn, and on the north side of the river Earn, about four miles below the place where it issues from the lake. The remains of a Roman camp on the opposite side of the river, have made the name of this village very well known to Scottish antiquaries.\nearth or from the air, sometimes believing them to come from the one, and sometimes from the other; neither do all agree with respect to the seat of any one of them.\n\n\"After the strictest inquiry, I find it impossible to determine with accuracy the date of any of the concussions which took place before the 2d of September last. Some people in the neighbourhood of Killin assert positively, that they heard unusual rumbling noises in the month of May; but the impression which these noises made was so faint, that they would probably have been soon forgotten altogether, had they not been succeeded by concussions of a less equivocal nature. Towards the end of August, two or three shocks are said to have been felt at Dundurn, Dunira Lodge and Comrie; but I have not been able to learn the precise day or hour on which any of them happened. The truth is, the concussions hitherto observed were feeble, and the minds of the people seem not to have been roused to particular attention till the 2d of September. About eleven o'clock that evening, a smart shock was felt at Comrie. I myself heard here, for the first time, a rumbling noise, which I took for that of a large table, dragged along the floor above stairs, and which I probably would never have thought of again, unless my attention had been turned to it by the alarm which it had excited in the neighbourhood. Many other feeble noises or concussions are said to have been observed in Glen Leadnach and about Comrie during the months of September and October. At that time, however, I confess I was disposed to doubt the numerous reports of earthquakes with which the country was filled, and to ascribe them to the workings of an imagination, on which the alarm of the 2d of September still continued to be impressed.\n\n\"On the 5th of November, a concussion took place two or three minutes before six o'clock P.M., which was too violent to be mistaken. Some compared the noise which accompanied it to that of heavy loaded waggons, dragged with great velocity along a hard road or pavement, and thought, that it passed under their feet. To me it seemed as if an enormous weight had fallen from the roof of the house, and rolled with impetuosity along the floor of the rooms above; and it must have made a similar impression on the servants, for some of them instantly ran up stairs to discover what had happened. Others were sensible of a tremulous motion in the earth, perceived the flames of the candles to vibrate, and observed the mirrors and kitchen-utensils placed along the walls to shake and clatter. There is also reason to believe, that the waters in the loch of Monivaird, in the near neighbourhood of Ochtertyre, suffered unusual agitation, as the wild fowl then upon the loch were heard to scream and flutter. The noise on this occasion, as far as I can judge, did not last above ten or twelve seconds. During the course of the day, the mercury in the barometer rose and fell several times, and at six o'clock it stood at 28\u00bd inches. The sky was then perfectly serene, and hardly a breath of wind was to be felt; but next morning, about six o'clock, a violent tempest rose, which raged without intermission for 24 hours.\n\n\"At Glen Leadnach, Comrie and Lawers, this concussion was much more violent, and the noise that accompanied it much more alarming. The inhabitants of these places, and of Aberuchill and Dunira, declare, that they perceived distinctly the earth heaving under them, and the motion communicated to their chairs, and other furniture. They imagined that the plates and stones were tumbling from their houses, and many of them ran out in the greatest trepidation, from the notion, that the roofs were falling in. Even the domestic animals were alarmed, and contributed, by their howls and screams, to increase the terrors of the people. Though I have not been able to discover whether Loch Earn was ever agitated by these concussions, there is little doubt, that the river near Comrie was affected on this occasion, as two men then on its banks heard the dashings of its waters. This great shock was succeeded by a number of those slighter rumbling noises which have been already mentioned. Not less than 30 of them were counted in the space of two hours after it happened; but they did not extend above two miles to the east, north and west of Comrie.\n\n\"On the 10th of November, at three o'clock P.M., we had here another shock of much the same length, violence and extent, as that on the 5th. The mercury in the barometer on this day was more stationary than on the former, and at the time of the earthquake was 29 inches high. The weather was calm and hazy. It was a market-day at Comrie; and the people, who were assembled from all parts of the country, felt as if the mountains were to tumble instantly upon their heads. The hardware exposed for sale in the shops and booths shook and clattered, and the horses crowded together with signs of unusual terror.\n\n\"About one o'clock P.M. of the 29th December, we had another pretty smart shock, during a violent storm of wind and rain, which continued the whole day, and which was at its height during the time of the earthquake. Indeed, as has been remarked already, these concussions seem to have no dependence on the weather. According to the accounts of those who live nearest to the centre of the phenomena, rumbling noises, like those above described, may be heard in all states of the atmosphere.\n\n\"Though I mention no more of these earthquakes, you are not to conclude, that many more have not taken place, and some of them perhaps equally violent with those of the 5th and 10th of November. Several shocks have happened during the stillness of the night, which, even at this distance from Comrie, where their centre seems to be, have been abundantly terrifying. But the great resemblance, or rather the perfect similarity of their effects, and of the impression they make on our minds, renders it unnecessary for me trouble you with a particular description of each of them.\n\n\"The direction of all the noises or concussions I have observed, great as well as small, appeared to be in the same line from N.W. to S.E. Others describe them as sometimes proceeding in that direction, and sometimes as coming from N.E. to S.W. I have not heard any other line of direction ascribed to them.\n\n\"Upon the fullest enquiry, I find, that these earthquakes have been very limited in point of extent. The greater shocks have been feebly felt at Loch Earn head, about Killin, and at Ardronich, on the southern bank of Loch Tay. They do not appear to have extended farther easterly on that lake; and, what is more remarkable, they have not been felt in Glen Almond,\"\nmond, or the small glen through which the military road from Crieff to Tay-bridge passes. The farmer at Auchnafree, (which lies at the head of Glen Almond,) and is separated from Glen Leadnach only by the mountain Benechoni, over the northern side of which his sheepards daily travel, has assured me, that neither he, nor any of his people, have been at any time sensible of the least extraordinary noise or concussion. Towards the east, the two first great shocks extended to Monzie, Cultquhey and Dollary, about seven miles distant from Comrie. The shock of the 5th of November reached still farther, and was felt, though but faintly, at Ardoch and Drummond Cattle towards the S. E. In the direction of the south, however, the banks of the Earn seem to be its general boundary, as the noise of the most violent concussions was heard but faintly at the manse of Comrie, and along the strath on the south side of the river. The limits of the lesser concussions, I am confident, do not extend above three miles in any direction from their centre. They are commonly observed at Lawers on the east; throughout the whole of Glen Leadnach, at Dunira, Dalchonzie and Aberuchill, on the north and west; and do not reach so far as the manse, which is about three quarters of a mile on the south of Comrie (1).\n\nIn another communication, dated in 1793, from the same gentleman, he observes, that \"there is no reason to believe that these phenomena are yet come to an end. After temporary intermissions, sometimes of several months, they have returned, ever since their first appearance in 1789, without any apparent difference in their extent or force. The rumbling noises or lighter concussions, as usual, are observed at Comrie, in Glen Leadnach, and the places in their near neighbourhood; the more violent extend to much the same distance as formerly described. Having been only occasionally in that country since February 1791, I have not been able to ascertain dates. On the 2d of September 1791, at five minutes past five in the afternoon, a slight shock was felt at Ochteryre. The barometer was not in order, on which account the weight of the atmosphere could not be ascertained. Its electrical state was tried by Sauflaire's electrometer, but no indication of anything uncommon was perceived. Since that period, shocks have been observed at different times till within these few weeks past.\n\n\"From this account, it will be observed, that all the greater shocks have taken place in the season of autumn or the beginning of winter; that this has been now repeated for more than four years; and that those greater shocks have been succeeded at short intervals by rumbling noises or more feeble concussions. It has also been remarked, that they have in general been preceded or followed by great rains or boisterous weather; but variations in the weather take place so frequently in our climate at that season of the year, that the connection between them and the phenomena above described, is probably altogether accidental.\"\n\nAfter the view which we have given of the phenomena and history of earthquakes, we now proceed to the consideration of the causes, by the operation of quakes, which, according to the speculations of philosophers, these terrible convulsions of nature, which spread ruin and desolation in some of the fairest portions of the earth, are to be accounted for. Various opinions have been formed, and various hypotheses have been proposed, for the explanation of these dreaded phenomena. According to some of the ancient philosophers, subterraneous clouds existed in the internal cavities of the earth, and these bursting into lightning, shook and demolished the vaults which contained them. This was the opinion of Anaxagoras. It was supposed by others, according to the ancients, that earthquakes were owing to the falling in of immense arched roofs, which confined subterraneous fires; the vaults or arches being weakened by the constant burning of these fires. Some ascribed earthquakes to the vapour of water which was produced, and greatly rarefied, by means of internal fires, while others, among whom was Epicurus and some of the peripatetic philosophers, sought for the explanation of the phenomena of earthquakes, in the explosion of certain inflammable substances, which were exhaled from the internal cavities of the earth.\n\nSome of the modern philosophers, as Gassendi, Kircher, Varenius, Des Cartes, and others, have adopted the last hypothesis, according to which it is supposed, that there are immense cavities in the earth, communicating with each other. Some of these cavities contain water, and others contain vapours and exhalations, arising from bituminous, sulphureous, and other inflammable substances. These combustible materials being kindled by some subterraneous spark, or by some actual flame, proceeding through narrow fissures from without, or by the heat evolved during the mixture of different substances, and the formation of new ones, produce commotions on the surface of the earth, according to the extent of the cavities, and the quantity and active nature of the inflamed matter. Those who support\n\n(1) \"The tract within which the concussions described in this letter appear to have been confined, is a space of a rectangular form, which extends from east to west along the north side of the Earn about 22 miles in length, by a little more than five in breadth; reckoning the utmost length from about Monzie to the head of Loch Tay, and the breadth from a little south of the Earn northward to the ridge which separates the branches of that river from those of the Almond. The whole of this tract is mountainous, except toward the eastern extremity, where it joins the low country, and on the banks of the river Earn on the south. It is intersected by narrow glens or valleys, the most considerable of which is Glen Leadnach, where the centre of the concussion seems to be placed. The mineralogy of this part of the country has not hitherto been accurately examined; but it is known in general, that the stone is the primary schistus, and in some places granite; that no mineral veins, nor any hot springs, have been found in it, and that no volcanic appearances have been observed. In the valleys, among the mountains, iron ore, of the kind that is called bog ore, is said to abound. Dr Hutton has remarked, that the line which terminates this tract on the south east, seems to be nearly the same with that where the primary strata sink under the surface, and are covered by the secondary or horizontal strata. Note by Mr Playfair.\"\nsupport this hypothesis think, that it receives illustration from a common experiment of mixing together iron filings and sulphur, and burying them in the earth; and in consequence of the chemical action of these substances on each other, and the elastic vapours thus produced, the shaking of the earth is effected.\n\nA different hypothesis has been proposed by Dr Woodward. According to this hypothesis, water is continually raised by means of subterranean heat, from the abyss which he supposes to occupy the centre of the earth, to furnish rain and dew. Obstructions may take place in this process of nature, and whenever this happens, a swelling and commotion are occasioned by the heat in the waters of the abyss. This force is at the same time exerted against the incumbent strata, and thus the agitation and concussion, with the other phenomena which accompany earthquakes, are produced.\n\nAnother hypothesis, different from any of these, has been proposed by M. Amontons, of which the following explanation is given. The atmosphere being taken at 45 miles high, and the density of the air increasing in proportion to the absolute height of the superincumbent column of fluid, it is shewn that at the depth of 43,528 fathoms below the surface of the earth, the air is but one-fourth lighter than mercury. But this depth is only about one seventy-fourth of the semidiameter of the earth. The immense sphere beyond this depth, the diameter of which is 6,451,538 fathoms, may perhaps be only filled with air: this air must be here greatly condensed, and heavier than the heaviest bodies with which we are at present acquainted. It is found by experiment, that the more air is compressed, the more do equal degrees of heat increase its elastic force, and the more capable it becomes of producing violent effects. As, for instance, the temperature of boiling water increases the elasticity of the air beyond its natural force in temperate climates, by a quantity equal to one-third of the weight with which it is pressed. Hence it is concluded, that a degree of heat which on the surface of the earth produces only a moderate effect, may occasion violent convulsions by the rarefaction of the denser air at great depths; but if it be considered that this condensed air may be exposed to much higher degrees of heat than that of boiling water, the elastic force of the air thus produced, and assisted by the great weight of a high column, may be more than sufficient to convulse and break up the solid orb of 43,528 fathoms, the weight of which, comparing it with that of the included air, would be trifling.\n\nThese hypotheses, however insufficient they may appear for explaining in a satisfactory manner the phenomena of earthquakes, were generally adopted till about the middle of the 18th century, when the knowledge of electricity began to be cultivated and extended. This principle was applied successfully in the explanation of many natural phenomena, and, among others, the phenomena of earthquakes were ascribed to the same principle. An earthquake which was felt at London in the month of March, 1749, directed the attention of philosophers to this explanation. The first who made this attempt, we believe, was Dr Stukeley, who had been much occupied about that time with electrical experiments. The consideration of the phenomena which accompanied this earthquake, led him to suppose that it could not be occasioned by vapours generated in the cavities of the earth, or by any process like fermentation, in which elastic fluids are formed and disengaged, to which such effects could be ascribed. He is of opinion, that no evidence has yet been brought to establish the probability of the existence of extensive cavities within the earth. On the contrary, he thinks there is good reason to presume, that it is in a great measure solid, so that there is little space for those changes which are supposed to be effected within the cavities, to take place. Coal pits, he adds, which have been frequently known to be on fire, and for a great length of time, never exhibited any of the phenomena which accompany an earthquake on the surface of the ground above.\n\nThe earthquake which visited London and other places of Britain, in March 1749, was felt in a circuit of 30 miles diameter; but there was no eruption of fire or vapour, and it was unattended with smoke or smell. From this consideration alone, of the extent of surface which felt the effects of the earthquake, he supposes that it could not be ascribed to the expansive force of subterraneous vapours; for, he observes, small fire-balls which are exploded in the air, emit a fulphurous smell to the distance of several miles. Now, it cannot be imagined, that so prodigious a force, acting instantaneously, on so great an extent of ground, should neither break the surface, nor indicate its presence either by the sight or smell. But if this effect is to be ascribed to fermentation, this process is not instantaneous; it continues many days, and the evaporation of such a quantity of inflammable matter would require a long space of time. Such an effect, therefore, can only be accounted for on electrical principles, the operation of which is always instantaneous.\n\nIf earthquakes were occasioned by vapours and subterraneous fermentations, explosions and eruptions, such processes would entirely destroy springs and fountains, wherever they had once existed. This, however, is contrary to what happens, for although springs are stopped, or otherwise changed, previous to an earthquake, or about the time it happens, they very often recover their former state. In the great earthquake which happened A.D. 17, in Asia Minor, and which shook a mass of earth 300 miles in diameter, and destroyed 13 great cities, neither the springs nor the face of the country received any injury.\n\nIf it be considered, that a subterraneous power capable of moving 30 miles in diameter, as in the earthquake mentioned above, which happened at London, must exist and operate at least 15 or 20 miles under the surface, the hypothesis of earthquakes being occasioned by the force of vapours will be found totally inapplicable, because this force must move an inverted cone of solid earth, the base of which is 30 miles in diameter, and the axis 15 or 20. This is an effect which is impossible to any known natural power, excepting that of electricity.\n\nBut besides, no subterraneous explosion can account for the singular effects of an earthquake on ships that are far out in the ocean. It has been already observed, that they seem as if they struck on a rock, or as if some solid body struck against their bottom. Even fishes, it is found, are particularly affected by the shock of an earthquake; but a subterraneous explosion could only produce on the water a gradual swell. It could not communicate\ncommunicate to it that impulse by which it produces effects, as if it were a stone projected with great force against solid bodies.\n\nFrom the consideration of all these circumstances, Dr Stukeley is of opinion, that the phenomena of earthquakes can only be satisfactorily explained on electrical principles. He was particularly led to this opinion by directing his attention to the phenomena which accompanied the earthquakes which took place in England in 1749 and 1750. For five or six months previous to this time, the weather had been unusually warm; the wind was from the south and south-west, and there had been no rain, so that the earth was particularly prepared to receive an electrical shock. The flat country of Lincolnshire had suffered greatly from extreme drought, and hence, as dry weather is favourable to electricity, earthquakes and other similar phenomena are more frequent in southern regions of the world. Before the earthquake at London, all vegetables had been unusually premature, and it is well known how much electricity quickens vegetation. About the same time the aurora borealis had been very frequent. A very short time before the earthquake, it had exhibited unusual colours, and its motions were to the south, contrary to the ordinary direction. From these circumstances an earthquake was predicted by Italians and others who had been accustomed to the appearances which precede them. During this year, too, meteors of different kinds, as fire-balls, lightnings, and corufactions, had been common; and particularly it was observed in the night preceding the earthquake, and early in the morning on the day on which it happened, that corufations were very frequent. In these circumstances nothing was wanting to produce an earthquake, according to this hypothesis, but the touch of a non-electric body. This body must be derived from the air or atmosphere; hence it is inferred, that if a non-electric could discharge its contents upon any part of the earth, in this prepared and highly electrical state, a violent commotion or earthquake must be produced; and as the discharge from an excited tube produces a shock on the human body, so the discharge of electric matter from an extent of many miles of solid earth, must produce an earthquake. The rattling, uncouth noise which attends it, is to be ascribed to the snap which is occasioned by the contact.\n\nBefore the earthquake alluded to came on, a black cloud suddenly covered the atmosphere to a great extent; the discharge of a shower, according to this hypothesis, probably occasioned the shock; and as the electrical snap precedes the shock, a sound was observed to roll from the Thames towards Temple-bar, before the motion of the houses ceased. This noise, which is generally the forerunner of earthquakes, it is supposed can only be accounted for on the principles of electricity. The contrary to this would take place, were these phenomena owing to subterraneous eruptions. The flames and sulphurous fumes which accompany earthquakes, might, it is thought, be more easily accounted for on the same principles, than by eruptions from the bowels of the earth. The sudden concussion, too, seems to be produced by a motion which could only be excited by electricity, not proceeding from any convulsion in the interior parts of the earth, but from a uniform vibration along its surface, like that of a musical string, or like the vibratory motion of a glass, when the edge is rubbed with the finger. From the circumstance that earthquakes are chiefly fatal to places near the sea coasts, along the course of rivers, and elevated situations, a farther proof is derived, that they depend on the operation of electricity. The course or direction which the earthquake above alluded to took, affords an illustration of this point. Another argument in favour of the electrical hypothesis, is drawn from the effects of the earthquake, or the state of the weather at the time, on persons of weak or nervous constitutions. To some these disorders proved at that time fatal; and its effects, in general, were similar to those of artificial electricity.\n\nA similar hypothesis was proposed by Beccaria, to account for the phenomena of earthquakes. He supposes that the electric matter to which these phenomena are owing, is lodged deep in the earth, and that it is this matter discharged from the earth, to restore the equilibrium or deficiency which the clouds in the atmosphere have sustained during thunder storms, by giving out their electrical matter to another part of the earth. This, he supposes, is confirmed by the noise resembling thunder, and the flashes of lightning which are perceived during earthquakes.\n\nDr Priestley proposes to construct, on the principles of Stukeley and Beccaria, an hypothesis which he thinks will explain the phenomena in a more satisfactory manner. For this purpose he supposes the electric matter to be some way or other accumulated on one part of the surface of the earth, and on account of the dryness of the season, not easily to diffuse itself. It may, as Beccaria supposes, force its way into the higher regions of the air, forming clouds in its passage out of the vapours which float in the atmosphere, and occasion a sudden shower, which may farther promote the passage of the fluid. The whole surface thus unloaded will receive a concussion like any other conducting substance, on parting with or receiving a quantity of the electric fluid. The rushing noise will likewise sweep over the whole extent of the country; and upon this supposition also, the fluid, in its discharge from the country, will naturally follow the course of the rivers, and also take the advantage of any eminences, to facilitate its ascent into the higher regions of the air. In making some experiments on the passage of the electrical fluid over water, he observed that it produced a tremulous motion, and therefore he concludes that it must receive a concussion resembling that which is given to the waves of the sea by an earthquake. To try this still farther, he immersed his hands in water, while an electrical flash passed over its surface, and he felt a sudden concussion, like that which is supposed to affect ships at sea during an earthquake. The impulse, which was felt in different parts of the water, was strongest near the place where the explosion was made.\n\n\"Pleased with this resemblance of the earthquake, he observes, I endeavoured to imitate that great natural phenomenon in other respects; and it being frosty weather, I took a plate of ice, and placed two sticks about three inches high on their ends, so that they would just stand with ease; and upon another part of the ice I placed a bottle, from the cork of which was suspended a brass ball with a fine thread. Then making the electrical flash pass over the surface of the ice, which it did...\"\ndid with a very loud report, the nearer pillar fell down, while the more remote stood, and the ball which had hung nearly still, immediately began to make vibrations, about an inch in length, and nearly in a right line from the place of the fall.\n\n\"I afterwards diversified this apparatus, erecting more pillars, and suspending more pendulums, sometimes upon bladders stretched on the mouth of open vessels, and at other times on wet boards swimming in a vessel of water. This last method seemed to answer the best of any; for the board representing the earth, and the water the sea, the phenomena of them both during an earthquake may be imitated at the same time; pillars, &c., being erected on the board, and the electric flash being made to pass, either over the board, over the water, or over them both.\"\n\nThe ingenious Dolomieu proposes to account for these phenomena on different principles. On this subject he makes the following observations with regard to the earthquakes which defeated Calabria in 1783, and the causes by which they were produced. \"The sea, says he, during the earthquakes of 1783, had little share in the shocks on the main land. The mass of water experienced no general movement, or fluctuation, or oscillation; the waves did not rise above their ordinary limits. Those which on the night of the 5th February beat against the coast of Sicily, and which afterwards covered the point of the Faro of Messina, were only the effects of a particular cause. The fall of a mountain into the sea raised the waters, which received an undulating motion, as happens always in similar cases. The undulation reached from the point of Sicily beyond the cape of Rofacolmo, extending in length along the coast which runs to the south; but always with a decrease in elevation as it was more remote from Sicily. Whatever inquiries the author has made, he has not been able to discover, in all the details which have been given him, any proofs of the existence of electrical phenomena; no spark, no disengagement of the electrical fluid, which the Neapolitan naturalists wish to assign as the cause of earthquakes.\n\n\"The state of the atmosphere was not the same in the whole range of earthquakes. While the tempests and the rain seemed to have conspired with them for the destruction of Messina, the interior part of Calabria enjoyed very fine weather. A little rain fell in the plain in the morning of the 5th of February; but the sky was clear during the rest of the day. This month and that of March were not only pretty serene, but likewise warm. There were some storms and rain; but they were the natural attendants of the season.\n\n\"The moving force seems to have resided under Calabria itself, since the sea which surrounds it had no share in the oscillations or vibrations of the continent. This force seems also to have advanced along the ridge of the Apennines in ascending from the south to the north. But what power in nature is capable of producing such effects? I exclude electricity, which cannot accumulate continually during the course of a year, in a country surrounded with water, where everything conspires to place this fluid in equilibrium. Fire remains to be considered. This element, by acting directly upon the solids, can only dilate them; then their expansion is progressive, and cannot produce violent and instantaneous movements. When fire acts upon fluids, such as air and water, it gives them an astonishing expansion; and we know that then their elastic force is capable of overcoming the greatest resistances. These appear the only means which nature could employ to operate the effects we speak of; but in all Calabria there is no vestige of a volcano; nothing to point out any interior combustion; no fire concealed in the centre of mountains, or under their base; a fire which could not exist without some external signs. The vapours dilated, the air rarefied by a heat constantly active, must have escaped through some of the crevices or clefts formed in the soil; they must there have formed currents. Both flame and smoke must have issued by some one or other of these passages. They once opened, the pressure would have ceased; the force not meeting with any more resistance, would have lost its effect; and the earthquakes could have no longer continued. None of these phenomena took place: we must then renounce the supposition of a combustion acting directly under Calabria. Let us see whether, having recourse to a fire at some distance from this province, and acting upon it only as an occasional cause, we shall be able to explain all the phenomena which have accompanied the shocks. Let us take for example Etna in Sicily, and suppose large cavities under the mountains of Calabria; a supposition which cannot be refused. It is certain that immense subterranean cavities do exist, since Etna, in elevating itself by the accumulation of its explosions, must leave in the heart of the earth cavities proportioned to the greatness of the mass.\n\n\"The autumn of 1782 and the winter of 1783 were very rainy. The interior waters, augmented by those of the surface, may have run into those caverns which form the focus of Etna: there must have been converted into vapour capable of the highest degree of expansion, and must have pressed forcibly against everything which opposed their dilatation. If they found canals to conduct them into the cavities of Calabria, they could not fail to occasion there all the calamities of which I have given the description.\n\n\"If the first cavity is separated from the second by a wall (to speak) or some flight division, and this separation is broken down by the force of the elastic vapour, the whole force will act against the bottom and sides of the second. The focus of the shocks will appear to have changed place, and become weaker in the space which was agitated most violently by the first earthquake.\n\n\"The plain, which was undoubtedly the most slender part of the vault, yielded most easily. The city of Messina, placed upon low ground, experienced a shock which the buildings on higher grounds did not. The moving force ceased at once as suddenly as it acted violently. When, at the periods of the 7th of February and the 28th of March, the focus appeared changed, the plain scarce suffered anything. The subterranean noise, which preceded and accompanied the shocks, appeared always to come from the southwest, in the direction of Messina. It seemed like thunder underground, which resounded beneath vaults.\n\n\"If Etna, then has been the occasional cause of the earthquakes, it has also prepared, for some time, the misfortunes of Calabria, by gradually opening a passage along the coast of Sicily to the foot of the Neptunian...\"\nnian mountains: for during the earthquakes of 1780, which disturbed Messina the whole summer, they felt, for the whole length of that coast, from Taormina even to the Faro, considerable shocks; but near the villages of Alli and Fiume de Nisi, which are situated about the middle of that line, shocks so violent were experienced, that they dreaded lest the mouth of a volcano should open. Each shock resembled the effort of a mine that had not strength to make an explosion. It appears, that then the volcano opened a free passage for the expansion of its vapours, and that they have since circulated without restraint; since in the year 1783 the earthquake was almost nothing upon that part of Sicily, at the time that Messina buried under its ruins the half of its inhabitants.\"\n\nBy others the phenomena of earthquakes have been ascribed to the force of vapour or steam, which, no doubt, is an agent sufficiently powerful, if it is confined to, that its prodigious elastic force may be exerted; but it is denied by those who oppose this hypothesis, that earthquakes, though very frequent in regions where subterranean fires are really known to exist, as in volcanic countries, always happen in such places, and therefore water cannot be converted into vapour. But, besides, it is well known, that this vapour, even admitting the possibility of its production in subterranean cavities, would be re-converted into water, the moment it came in contact with a cold body, which would deprive it of the principle of heat, in combination with which water affumes the form of vapour.\n\nMany objections might have been made to the hypotheses which have been proposed to account for earthquakes. Many of these will probably occur to the attentive reader, who is a little acquainted with the nature and properties of the agents by which they are supposed to be produced; but whatever may be the cause of these extraordinary phenomena, it appears that it is very far from being clearly ascertained. Perhaps all the agents which have been stated as the cause of earthquakes, may have some influence in contributing to the effect, and may operate at different times, and in different circumstances.\n\nSect. II. Of Volcanoes.\n\nVolcanoes exist in almost every part of the world, from the north to the south pole. Hecla in Iceland, and a volcano which has been observed in Terra del Fuego, at the termination of the southern continent of America, nearly comprehends the extremities of the globe; and having mentioned these boundaries, it is unnecessary to observe, that they exist in all climates.\n\nThe number of volcanoes at present known, is not less than 100. The volcanoes of Europe are well known: these are Vesuvius in Italy, Etna in Sicily, and Hecla in Iceland. To these may be added the volcanoes in the Aeolian or Lipari islands on the coast of Italy, of which Stromboli is remarkable for having thrown out flames, without the eruption of other volcanic matter, for more than 2000 years. In Asia there is a volcano in Mount Taurus; five in Kamtschatka, 10 in the islands of Japan; one in the peak of Adam in the island of Ceylon; four which have been observed in Sumatra; and some others in different parts of the Asiatic continent or islands. There are also some volcanoes on the African continent, as well as in some of the islands. Volcanoes exist also in the American continent, and in many of the islands which have been discovered in the South seas.\n\nAlmost all volcanoes are in the immediate vicinity of the sea. Mount Taurus, in the interior of Asia, and some of the volcanoes in the Andes, are the only exceptions to this.\n\nAnother general remark which may be made with regard to volcanoes is, that they always occupy the tops of mountains. No volcano was ever found buried in plains. The existence of volcanoes at the bottom of the ocean seems to be an exception; but it is to be observed, that these are also in the peaks of mountains, which have been raised up from great depths at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe first symptom of an approaching eruption is an increase of the smoke, if smoke has been emitted, in fair weather. This smoke is of a whitish colour; but, after some time, black smoke is observed to shoot up in the midst of the column of white smoke. These appearances are usually accompanied with explosions. The black smoke is then followed, at a shorter or longer distance of time, by a reddish-coloured flame. Showers of stones are afterwards thrown out, and some of them are projected to great heights in the air, which shows that the force by which they are impelled is very great. Along with these, ashes are likewise ejected. These phenomena, which daily increase in frequency and violence, are also usually preceded and accompanied by earthquakes, and hollow noises from the bowels of the earth, something like those that precede earthquakes unaccompanied with volcanic eruptions. The smoke, flame, and the quantity of stones and ashes, increase, and the stones are at last thrown out red hot.\n\nThe smoke which issues from the crater has been observed to be sometimes in a highly electrified state. The ashes are strongly attracted, and carried up along with the smoke to great heights in the atmosphere, forming a dense black column of vast height and size. Flashes of lightning are seen darting in a zigzag direction, through the column of smoke and ashes; and this lightning is sometimes attended with thunder. But from some observations which have been made, this thunder and lightning are seemingly less intense than atmospheric electricity. When these terrible appearances have continued for four or five months, or for a longer or shorter time, according to the nature of the eruption, the lava begins to flow. This is a current of melted matter, which sometimes boils over the top, and sometimes, when the mountain is high, as is the case with Etna, bursts out at the side, and makes a passage for itself. The period of the duration of the eruption is very different. Sometimes it continues to flow, at intervals, for the space of several weeks.\n\nThe matters ejected from volcanoes are lavas, which are either more or less consolidated; ashes, flags of different kinds, and stones which have undergone little or no fusion. For an account of the nature and properties of volcanic productions, see Mineralogy. Stones have been projected into the air from Mount Etna, to the height of 7000 feet. A stone which was ejected from Vesuvius, measured 12 feet long, and 45 feet in circumference; and even larger masses have been thrown out from Etna.\n\nWater has been frequently ejected from volcanoes.\nThis water is sometimes cold, and sometimes hot. Earthquakes and eruptions of water have taken place, both from Vesuvius and \u00c6tna. At one time salt water was ejected from Mount Vesuvius. Different opinions have been held concerning the origin of this water, or its connexion with the volcano. This is founded on the circumstance already taken notice of in the general remark which was made, that almost all volcanoes are in the vicinity of the sea.\n\nIt seems to be a singular circumstance in the history of volcanoes, that when once eruptions have commenced, they follow each other in rapid succession; and at other times that they cease for a long period. From the year 1447, \u00c6tna ceased to throw out any fire till the year 1536, when a terrible eruption took place, accompanied with smoke, flame, ashes, and burning stones. This conflagration continued to rage with great violence for many weeks. The following year a river swelled and overflowed its banks to a great distance; furious squalls of wind succeeded, after which there was a terrible eruption from \u00c6tna. The torrents of flaming and fused matter which flowed out, destroyed towns, villages, and vineyards, to a great extent. After the conflagration, the summit of the mountain fell in with a dreadful crash. For 100 years after this period, the eruptions seemed to observe some kind of regularity, returning periodically every 25 and 30 years. From the year 1686 to 1755, the same year on which the earthquake at Lisbon happened, for more than half a century, \u00c6tna enjoyed profound repose.\n\nThe first considerable eruption of Vesuvius, the account of which is recorded in history, happened in the year 79 of the Christian era. It was this eruption which destroyed Herculaneum and Pompeii; but this was not the first eruption of this mountain, for the streets of these cities have been since discovered to be paved with lava. Since that time, 30 different eruptions have taken place. There was a very remarkable one in 1538.\n\nIt would appear that volcanoes seem to become quite extinct, and are rekindled. Some of the Roman writers, as Diodorus Siculus, Vitruvius, and others, speak of Vesuvius only as having been a volcano. After this period it burnt for 1000 years, and again became extinct, from 1136 to 1536. Pools of water had collected in the crater, and woods were growing on its sides, and even in the crater itself. Vesuvius has now burnt for three centuries past, as furiously as ever; but particularly, during the 18th century. Of 29 eruptions which have taken place from Vesuvius, since the reign of Titus, half of the number have happened in the 18th century.\n\nBeside the volcanoes, the history of which we have now briefly detailed, volcanoes are known to exist at the bottom of the ocean. These are distinguished by the name of submarine volcanoes. Excepting in situation, so far as the history of submarine volcanoes is known, they resemble the volcanoes on land. It would appear that they exist in the tops of mountains at the bottom of the ocean, and eject immense burning masses of matter in whirlwinds of ashes and pumice, with prodigious torrents of lava. Submarine volcanoes are either very few in number, or the places where they exist have not been ascertained. Those that are certainly known are at Santorin, the Azores, and Iceland. The island of Santorin, formerly called Thera and St Irene, was denominated by the Greeks, in allusion to its origin, \u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, or \"burnt.\" According to Pliny, there is a tradition that it rose out of the sea, at a very remote but unknown period.\n\nWithout going far back into history, to inquire concerning the early eruptions of this volcano, we shall mention some of a later date, the existence of which is better ascertained. In 1457, an eruption took place, at which time ashes and red-hot rocks were ejected, with a great quantity of lava. This event, with the date of it, is recorded on a marble stone, erected near the gate of Fort Scarus, in Santorin. An eruption also took place in 1570. This produced a new island, called the Little Kaminoi. In 1650, the agitations of the volcanoes continued for the greater part of a year. Smyrna and Constantinople were incommodeous with the ashes, which rushed from the ocean in whirlwinds of flame. The same volcano opened again in 1707. The Little Kaminoi, mentioned, was increased, and it is now more than three leagues in circumference. A violent eruption took place in 1767, which shook the earth greatly for some days, and raised the sea in such a manner, as to excite apprehensions of the destruction of the islands in the neighbourhood. A thick black smoke darkened the air, which was so infected with a strong smell of sulphur, that many persons and animals were suffocated by it. Black ashes resembling gunpowder were dispersed around, and torrents of flame issuing from the sea, and waving above it, to the height of several feet, lighted, at intervals, the horrid scene. At the end of 10 or 12 days the eruption began to be more moderate; and a new island which had been thrown up was discovered. When it was examined, many parts of it were still burning; but the next day, those whom curiosity had drawn to the spot, were compelled to betake themselves to flight. They felt the new foil moving; in some parts it rose, and sunk in others. The earth, sea, and sky, soon resumed their formidable appearance; the boiling sea changed colour; flames in rapid succession issued as from a furnace, but accompanied with ashes and pumice. The frightful noise of subterranean thunders was heard; it seemed as if enormous rocks, darting from the bottom of the abyss, beat against the vaults above it, and were alternately repelled and thrown up again. The repetition of their blows seemed to be distinctly heard. Some of them finding a passage, were seen flying up red hot into the air, and again falling into the sea from which they had been ejected. Masses were produced, held together for some days, and then disappeared. In this general disorder, large portions of the Little Kaminoi were swallowed up. Meanwhile the labour of the volcano took a larger surface. Its ejections became prodigiously abundant, and a new island was seen forming. By successive additions continued for near four months, it made a junction with that produced in June. From the colour of its foil it was named the Black Island. It is larger than the Little Kaminoi, and is separated from it by a narrow strait. After frequent alarms for several months, the volcano opened again on the 15th of April in the following year; but the eruption was only for a moment, when it threw out a multitude of burning rocks, which fell at the distance of two miles.\nSimilar submarine volcanoes have been observed near quakes and the island of St Michael, one of the Azores or Western Volcanoes, in the Atlantic ocean. In the year 1638, near the island of St Michael, where the sea was known to be 120 feet deep, there arose, after an agitation of several weeks, an island about six miles round. It was again swallowed up in about the same space of time that had elapsed during its formation. In the year 1691, this volcano was in great agitation for a month. It convulsed the whole island of St Michael, and by the heat and violent commotion of the sea, as well as by the eruption of flames, ashes, and pumice, occasioned great damage; but in this case no island appeared. Similar eruptions were known in 1720, and in 1757.\n\nDuring the latter eruption, some of the islands were shaken to their foundations.\n\nAfter this account of submarine volcanoes, of their effects, and of the islands formed by them, it would be unnecessary to enter into any detail of the submarine volcano which threw up an island off the coast of Iceland, in the year 1783. This island, the existence of which seemed to be fully ascertained, was again swallowed up in the ocean, and was seen no more.\n\nVolcanoes of a very different kind have been described. The volcanoes to which we allude, have received the name of mud volcanoes, from ejecting a great quantity of mud. These, however, are similar to those which have been already described, in having volcanic motions and convulsive eruptions. The first volcano of this kind which was discovered is in the island of Sicily, near a place called Maccalouba, between Aragona and Girgenti. It is in a hill of a conical shape, truncated at the top, and 150 feet high. The summit is a plain, half a mile round, and the whole surface is covered with thick mud. The depth of the mud, which is supposed to be immense, is unknown. There is not the slightest appearance of vegetation upon it. In the rainy season the mud is much softened; the surface is even, and there is a general ebullition over it, which is accompanied with a very sensible rumbling noise. In the dry season, the mud acquires greater consistency, but without ceasing its motion. The plain assumes a form somewhat convex; a number of little cones are thrown up, which rarely rise to the height of two feet. Each of them has a crater, where a black mud is seen in constant agitation, and incessantly emitting bubbles of air. With these the latter intensively rises, and as soon as the crater is full of it, it discharges. The residue sinks, and the cone has a free crater until a new emission.\n\nThis hill is sometimes subject to alarming convulsions. Earthquakes are felt at the distance of two or three miles, accompanied with internal noises, resembling thunder. These increase for several days, and terminate in an eruption of a prodigious spout of mud, earth, and stones, which rises two or three hundred feet into the air. This explosion is repeated twice or thrice in the course of 24 hours. Some years pass over without any eruption, but it generally happens that the eruptions continue yearly for five years successively. An eruption from this mud volcano took place in 1777.\n\nPhenomena somewhat similar have been described by Pallas, which he observed partly in the peninsula of the Kercha, the boundary of Europe to the south-east of Little Tartary, now Taurida, and partly in the island Earthquakes and Volcanoes, of Taman, which is separated from Kercha only by one of the mouths of the river Cuban. The island of Taman is situated in Asia. These places, he observes, are in flat countries where there are few hills, and those very little raised above the level of the sea. The whole is covered with beds of lime, mixed with sand, with some beds of marl and sea-shells. From this he concludes that no real volcanic pit can exist here. Copious springs of petroleum are found in several places, and also pools or typhons of various dimensions, through most of which a briny mud is discharged in bubbles. Pallas observed several of these pools, both in the peninsula and in Taman. The last eruption which took place, he observes, was in 1794. This was the greatest and most copious that had been known. It proceeded from the top of a hill at the north point of Taman. The place where the new gulf opened was a pool, where the snow and rain water usually remained for a long time. The explosion came on with a noise like that of thunder, and with the appearance of a mass of fire in the form of a sheaf. This lasted only for about half an hour, and it was accompanied with a thick smoke; but the ebullition which threw up part of the liquid mud, continued till the next day, after which the mud ran slowly in streams down the hill. The mud discharged was of a soft clay, of a bluish ash colour, everywhere of the same nature, and mixed with brilliant sparks of mica, with a small quantity of marl, calcareous and sandy fragments of schistus, which seemed to have been torn from their beds.\n\nPallas supposes that a very deep coal mine had been for ages on fire, under Kercha and Taman, and that the sea having accidentally broken into the burning cavities of the mine, the expansion produced by the water converted into steam, and the struggle of the different aeriform substances to get free, forced the upper beds, broke them in pieces, and formed a passage to themselves. The vapours, as they escaped, carried the mud along with them. But others have supposed that these phenomena are not produced by fire; that the appearance of the sheaf of fire must have been extraneous, or, that it was only a quantity of inflammable air, which exploded when it came to the surface; or, perhaps it was altogether an illusion, from the appearance of the vapours which were emitted.\n\nAn account is given of a singular phenomenon, somewhat similar to the above, which was observed in 1711, at Bofely near Wenlock, in Shropshire. After a great hurricane, the inhabitants were awakened in the middle of the night by commotions of the earth, which were accompanied with noise. Some persons went to an eminence, from which the noise proceeded, and they saw water oozing through the turf, while at the same time inflammable air was emitted. The water was not hot. This continued for some time, but at last it ceased to throw out any inflammable air for some years, previous to the year 1746, when a second eruption took place, attended with similar circumstances.\n\nWe shall not dwell longer on the history of volcanoes. For a particular account of the most remarkable eruptions of the principal volcanoes in the world, the reader is referred to the history given under Etna, Hecla, and Vesuvius. We shall now proceed to state some of the opinions and conjectures of philosophers,\nVolcanic eruptions have been ascribed to the action of the waters of the sea, bursting in upon an immense quantity of fused or burning matter; to the action of central fires, and to the decomposition of different substances, by which a great quantity of heat and inflammable substances is produced.\n\nWater, according to some philosophers, is absolutely necessary for the formation of volcanoes. This opinion is supported by the circumstance of almost all volcanoes being near the sea. According to this opinion, they were all formed under the surface of the waters of the ocean. The first explosion at the formation of a volcano, it is supposed, was preceded by an earthquake. The first eruptions would be extremely violent, and immense quantities of matter would be ejected. Torrents of lava would continue to be discharged for a long series of ages, and thus the foundations of the burning mountain are laid in the bottom of the ocean. But it becomes a question, in what way the internal fire was preferred from extinction by the incumbent waters of the ocean? To this M. Houel replies, that the fire having disposed the substances in fusion to make an eruption, next laid open the earth, and emitted as much matter as it could discharge, with a force sufficient to overcome the resistance of the column of water, which would oppose its ascent; but as the strength of the fire diminished, the matter discharged was no longer expelled beyond the mouth; but, by accumulating there, soon closed up the orifice. Thus, only small orifices would be left sufficient for giving vent to the vapors of the volcano, and from which only small bubbles of air could ascend to the surface of the water, until new circumstances, such as originally gave occasion to the eruption of the volcano, again took place in the bowels of the earth, and produced new eruptions, either through the same or other mouths. The appearance of the sea over the new formed volcano, in its state of tranquility, would then be similar to what it is betwixt the islands of Bafifizzo and Pariaria. Columns of air bubbles are there ascending at the depth of more than 30 feet, and burst on their arriving at the surface. This air would continue to disengage itself with little disturbance as long as it issues forth only in small quantity, until, at the very instant of explosion, when prodigious quantities, generated in the burning focus, would make their way at once, and the same phenomena which originally took place would again make their appearance.\n\nA volcano, while under water, cannot act precisely as it does in the open air. Its eruptions, though equally strong, cannot extend to so great a distance. The lava accumulates in greater quantity round the crater; the sand, ashes, and pozzolana are not carried away by the winds, but are deposited around its edges, and prevent the marine substances which are driven that way by the waters from entering. Thus they agglomerate with these bodies, and thus a pyramidal mount is formed of all the materials together.\n\nIn this manner M. Houel supposes that the mountain was gradually raised out of the sea by the accumulation of lava, &c., at every eruption, and that the cavern of the volcano was gradually enlarged, the lava being driven down into the bottom of the cavern by the continued action of the stones which the volcano is constantly throwing up; that it was there fused, and at last thrown out at the top of the mountain to accumulate on its sides. M. Houel's opinion about the volcanic fire we shall give in his own words.\n\n\"We cannot form any idea of fire subsisting alone, without any pabulum, and unconnected with any other principle. We never behold it but in conjunction with some other body, which nourishes and is consumed by it. The matter in fusion, which issues from the focus, is but the incombustible part of that which nourishes the fire, and into the bosom of which that active principle penetrates in search of pabulum. But as the fire acts only in proportion to the facility with which it can dissolve and evaporate, I am of opinion, that it is only the bottom of the volcano on which it acts; and that its action extends no farther than to keep these substances which it has melted in a constant state of ebullition. That fusible matter being discharged from the mouth of the volcano, and hardening as it is gradually cooled by the action of the air, produces that species of stones which are distinguished by the name of lavas. This lava, even when in the focus, and in a state of fluidity, must also possess a certain degree of solidity, on account of the gravity and density of its particles. It therefore opposes the fire with a degree of resistance which irritates it, and requires, to put it into a state of ebullition, a power proportioned to the bulk of the mass.\n\n\"That quantity of matter, when dissolved by the action of the fire, must constantly resemble any other fusible substance in a state of ebullition. Small explosions are produced in various parts over the surface of every such substance while in a state of ebullition; and, by the bursting of these bubbles, a great number of small particles are scattered around. This is the very process carried on in the focus of a volcano, though on a scale immensely more large; and the vast explosions there produced expel every body which lies in their way with the utmost violence; nor is there any piece of lava which falls down from the upper part of the arch, of weight sufficient to resist this violent centrifugal force.\n\nThe pabulum by which the internal fire is supported, M. Houel thinks to be substances contained in the mountain itself, together with bitumen, sulphur, and other inflammable materials, which may from time to time flow into the focus of the volcano in a melted state through the subterraneous ducts, and the explosions he attributes to water making its way in the same manner. The water is converted into steam, which fills the cavern and pushes the melted lava out at the crater; this opinion is corroborated by the copious smoke which always precedes an eruption. But, combined with the water, there is always a quantity of other substances, whose effects precede, accompany, or follow the eruptions, and produce all the various phenomena which they display. The eruption of water from Etna in the year 1775 proceeded undoubtedly from this cause. The sea, or some of the reservoirs in Etna or the adjacent mountains, by some means discharged a vast quantity of water into the focus of the volcano. That water was instantly resolved into vapour, which filled the whole cavern, and issued from the mouth of the crater. As soon as it made its way into the open atmosphere, it was condensed again into water, which streamed down...\"\nthe sides of the mountain in a dreadful and destructive torrent.\n\nOthers have attempted to account for the existence of volcanic fire, on the supposition that it is derived from central fires, and to these it is supposed that volcanoes act the part of chimneys; while others are of opinion that they are owing to the chemical decomposition of different substances, by which inflammable matters are evolved, with a great deal of heat, and by means of the latter the combustible materials are kindled, and exhibit the phenomena which are thus proposed to be accounted for.\n\nM. Patrin is one of the latest naturalists who, with the affluence of modern chemistry, has attempted to account for the phenomena of volcanoes on the principles of this science. For a full view of his theory, or rather of his fanciful conjectures on this subject, we must refer the reader to the work itself.* But the following is a recapitulation of the principles on which he gives this explanation. All volcanoes, he observes, in a state of activity, are in the vicinity of the sea, and are never found but in those places where sea salt is abundant. The volcanoes of the Mediterranean attract the salt which the waters of the ocean hold in solution, and are constantly pouring in by the straits of Gibraltar. The strata of primitive schistus are the great laboratories in which volcanic matters are prepared, by a constant circulation of different fluids; but according to this theory, these strata contribute no part of their own substance. They suffer no waste in the process.\n\nThe sphere of the activity of volcanoes may be far extended in these strata, but they have no other outlet beside spiracles, by which the gaseous substances escape, of which one part is dissipated in the atmosphere, and the other becomes concrete by its combination with oxygen. The concretion of these fluids is supposed to be analogous to the concretion of the primitive matters of the globe, according to the theory of La Place; and the elective attractions determine, in the same way, the formation of flinty crystals.\n\nVolcanic eruptions are proportioned, in regard to their violence and duration, to the extent of the strata of schistus in which the volcanic fluids are accumulated. These fluids are,\n\n1. Muriatic acid, which carries off the oxygen from the metallic oxides of the schistus.\n\n2. The oxygen of the atmosphere, which constantly replaces in the metals that which was carried off by the muriatic acid.\n\n3. Carbonic acid gas, which the water absorbs from the atmosphere, and conveys to the schistus, which always abounds in carbons.\n\n4. Hydrogen, which proceeds from the decomposition of water. A part of this hydrogen is inflamed by electric explosions; the other united to carbonic acid forms oil, which becomes petroleum by its combination with sulphuric acid; and it is this petroleum that the bitterness of sea water is owing.\n\n5. The electric fluid, which is attracted from the atmosphere by the metals contained in the schistus. Sulphur seems to be the most homogeneous portion of this fluid, which has become concrete. Phosphorus is a modification of it, and it contributes to the fixation of oxygen. The sulphur formed in the schistus by means of the electric fluid, combines with the oxygen, and forms sulphuric acid, which decomposes the sea salt.\n\n6. The metalliferous fluid. This forms the iron in lavas. It is the origin of metallic veins, and the colouring principle of organized bodies. This substance in its undecomposed state affords iron, but by decomposition it produces other metals. It is conjectured to be one of the principles of muriatic acid, and it contributes, along with phosphorus, to fix oxygen under an earthly form.\n\n7. The last of the volcanic fluids is azotic gas. To this gas is owing the formation of the masses of carbonate of lime which are ejected by Vesuvius, and of the calcareous earth contained in lavas.\n\nSuch are the materials with which the author proposes to form the different substances which are produced in volcanoes, and by the operation of which he proposes to explain the phenomena of volcanic eruptions. Our readers will probably agree with us in thinking, that the present state of chemical science, even with the affluence of such hypothetical substances as the metalliferous fluids, is yet inadequate to give any degree of support to such opinions, even in the form of conjecture. We shall therefore dismiss it without further remark.\n\nWe shall now conclude this subject with some interesting observations by M. de Luc, on the nature of the strata in which volcanic fires exist.\n\n\"Volcanoes, he observes, have been more numerous on the surface of our continents, when they were under the waters of the ancient sea; and as this class of mountains, raised by subterranean fires, manifest themselves still on the shores of the present sea, and in the middle of its waters, it is of importance to geology and the philosophy of the earth to obtain as just ideas of them as possible.\n\n\"I have attended a great deal to this subject from my own observations; and I have shown, at different times, the errors into which several geologists and naturalists, in treating of it, have fallen.\n\n\"This class of mountains, in particular, requires that we should see them, that we should behold them during their eruptions, that we should have traced the progress of their lava, and have observed closely their explosions; that we should have made a numerous collection of the matters which they throw up under their different circumstances, that we might afterwards be able to study them in the cabinet, and to judge of their composition according to the phenomena which have been observed on the spot.\n\n\"This study is highly necessary when we apply it to geology and the philosophy of the earth, in order that we may avoid falling into those mistakes which make us attribute to subterranean fires what does not belong to them, or which leads us to refuse them what really belongs to them.\n\n\"We read in the Journal de Physique for January 1804, under the title, On the cause of Volcanoes, the following assertions:\n\n\"What is the nature of the matters which maintain these subterranean fires? We have seen that Chimborazo, all these enormous volcanoes of Peru, and the Peak of Teneriffe, are composed of porphyry.\n\n\"The Puy-de-D\u00f4me is also composed of porphyry, as well as the Mont d'Or and the Cantal.\"\n\n* Hist. Nat. de Min\u00e9ralogie, tom. v.\n\u00c6tna, Solfatara, and Vesuvius, are also of the porphyry kind.\n\nThese facts prove that the most considerable volcanoes with which we are acquainted are of porphyry.\n\nThis opinion, that the fires of volcanoes have their centres in such or such a rock, and that their lavas are produced from these rocks, has always appeared to me not to be founded on any certain data. Opinions also on this subject have varied; some having placed the origin of lava in horn rock, others in granite or schist, and at present it is assigned to porphyry.\n\nI have always been of opinion that nothing certain could be determined in regard to this point. It ever remains uncertain whether the seat of the matters of which lava is formed be in compact rocks, or in strata in the state of fusibles, pulverulent, and muddy.\n\nThose who see lava issue from a volcano in its state of fusion and incandescence, and in its cooling, are convinced that the nature of every thing is changed, that it exhibits a state in which nothing can be known, except the substances which the volcanic fires have not reduced to fusion.\n\nBut those substances contained in the paste of lava, and those which are the most numerous, show us, that the strata from which they proceed cannot be similar to those exposed to the view, nor even to the most profound strata to which we can penetrate.\n\nAdmitting the hypothesis, that the strata from which the lavas proceed are in a pulverulent and muddy state, containing elements of all these small crystals, one may conceive how they are formed there, inflated, grouped, or solitary, and are found then in the lava in that state of insolubility.\n\nThe fragments of natural rocks thrown up by Vesuvius are not of the same kind as the matters of which the lava is composed. Most of these fragments are calcareous rocks, with laminae of greater or less size, and of a kind of granite called felsite. I have found some composed of white quartzy rock; it is found sometimes of calcareous rock.\n\nThe most probable idea that can be formed in regard to the origin of these fragments is, that they have been carried from the borders of the strata through which the lava, that comes from great depths, has opened for itself a passage. These fragments are carried to the surface of the lava as far as the bottom of the chimney of the crater, whence they have been thrown out by explosions, mixed with fragments separated, or rather torn, from the lava; for it is not by the lava that they have been brought forth to view, but by explosions.\n\nSome of these fragments of natural rocks have not been attacked by the fire; others have more or less; which depends, no doubt, on the place which they occupied in the volcano, and on the time which they remained in it. The most of the latter have retained at their surface a crust of lava, and this crust contains substances which are not the same as that of the fragment it covers.\n\nOn Vesuvius the strata pierced by eruptions are lower than the surface of the soil; in Auvergne and several places of Germany they are above; for this reason there are seen there in their place schists or granites, which the eruptions have broken to form for themselves a passage.\n\nNo volcano rests on natural strata: they sometimes show themselves on the exterior; but they have been opened by eruptions, and their edges have remained in their place.\n\nThe focus of no volcano exists or has existed in the cone which appears above the surface of the ground. They have been raised by eruptions, which, proceeding from great depths, have thrown them up through the upper strata. When it is said, therefore, that the volcanic mountains of Auvergne rest on granite, this is a mistake, and an incorrect expression has been used by those who have not formed a just idea of the phenomenon. Lava may have flowed upon granite or any other rock, and rested upon it; but this is never the case with the volcano itself; its bases are below all the rocks visible.\n\nIt is from the bosom even of the lava, when in a state of fusion in the interior of the volcano, that all the explosions proceed. In that state of fusion they contain all the matters which produce fermentations, and the disengagement of expandible fluids.\n\nI have been enabled to ascertain this on Vesuvius as far as was possible. The continual noise which was heard through the two interior mouths of the crater which I had before my eyes, was that of an ebullition, accompanied with inflammable vapours, and the gerbes of burning matters which they threw up at intervals were separated pieces of the lava in its state of fusion. I saw several of them in the air change their form, and sometimes become flat on the bodies which they struck or embraced in falling. And among the most apparent of these fragments there are always a multitude of small ones of the size of peas and nuts, and still smaller ones, which show at their surface, by their appearances, all the characters of laceration.\n\nThe name of scoria has been given to these fragments, to distinguish them from compact lava, though their composition be the same as that of the hardest lava; and it is for want of reflecting properly on this point that it has been said that it is the compact part only that we must observe, in order to judge of their nature. The pieces which I took from the flowing lava with an iron hook, have at their surface the same lacerations and the same appearances as the fragments thrown up by explosions, and both contain the same substances.\n\nThis separation, by tearing off the parcels of the lava affected by fermentations and explosions which proceed from their bosom, serves to explain those columns, sometimes prodigious, of volcanic sand, which rise from the principal crater. When seen with a magnifying glass, this sand exhibits nothing but lava reduced very small, the particles of which, rough with inequalities, have the bright black colour and the varnish of recent lava.\n\nParcels of substances which exist in our strata, such as fragments of quartz, scales of mica, and crystals of feldspar, are found sometimes in lava. Similar matters must no doubt be disseminated in the composition of our globe, without there being reason to conclude that the strata from which they proceed are the same as the exterior strata. It is neither in the granites, the porphyries,\nries, nor the horn rock, and still less in the schists and calcareous rocks, that the schorls of volcanoes, the leucites, and perhaps olivins, will be found. These small crystals are brought to view by the lava, otherwise they would be unknown to us.\n\n\"These lavas contain a great deal of iron, which they acquire neither from the granite nor porphyries. Might not one see in the ferruginous sand which is found in abundance on the borders of the sea near Naples, and in the environs of Rome, specimens of that kind of pulverulent strata from which lava proceeds?\n\n\"I have here offered enough to prove that it cannot be determined that lava proceeds from strata similar to those with which we are acquainted. The operations of volcanoes, those vast laboratories of nature, will always remain unknown to us, and on this subject our conjectures will always be very uncertain.\n\nWhat is the nature of that mixture which gives birth to these eruptions, that produce lava and throw up mountains? What we observe as certain is, that the introduction of the water of the sea is necessary to excite these fermentations, as containing marine acid and other salts, which, united to the sulphuric acid, the bases of which are contained in abundance in the subterranean strata, determine these fermentations, which produce the disengagement of fire and other fluids, and all the grand effects that are the consequence.\n\n\"Several naturalists have believed, and still believe, that fresh or rain water is sufficient for this purpose; but they are mistaken: this opinion is contradicted by every fact known. To be convinced of this, nothing is necessary but to take a short view of them. I have done it several times, as it is necessary to consider them often. I shall here enumerate the principal ones:\n\n\"No burning mountain exists in the interior part of the earth; and all those which still burn are, without exception, in the neighbourhood of the sea, or surrounded by its waters. Among the deliquescent salts deposited by the smoke of volcanoes, we distinguish chiefly the marine salt, united to different bases. Several of the volcanoes of Iceland, and Hecla itself, sometimes throw up eruptions of water, which deposit marine salt in abundance. No extent of fresh water, however vast, gives birth to a volcano. These facts are sufficient to prove that the concurrence of sea-water is absolutely necessary to excite those fermentations which produce volcanoes.\n\n\"I shall here repeat the distinction I have already made between burnt-out volcanoes and the ancient volcanoes, that I may range them in two separate classes.\n\n\"When we simply give the name of burnt-out or extinguished volcanoes to volcanic mountains which are in the middle of the continents, it is to represent them as having burnt while the land was dry, and inhabited as it is at present; which is not a just idea. These volcanoes have burnt when the land on which they are raised was under the waters of the ancient sea, and none of them have burnt since our continents became dry. It is even very apparent that most of them were extinct before the retreat of the sea, as we find by numerous examples in the present sea.\n\n\"Those which I denominate extinct volcanoes are such as no longer burn, though surrounded by the sea, or placed on the borders of it. They would still burn, were not the inflammable matters by which they were raised really exhausted and consumed. Of this kind is the volcano of Agde, in Languedoc. Of this kind also are many of the volcanic islands which have not thrown up fire since time immemorial.\n\n\"M. Humboldt, in his letters written from Peru, speaks of the volcanoes which he visited, but what he says is not sufficiently precise to enable us to form a just idea of them. He represents Chimborazo as being composed of porphyry from its bottom to its summit, and adds, that the porphyry is 1900 toises in thickness; afterwards, he remarks, that it is almost improbable that Chimborazo, as well as Pichincha and Antisana, should be of a volcanic nature: 'The place by which we ascended, (says he,) is composed of burnt and scoriified rock, mixed with pumicestone, which resembles all the currents of lava in this country.'\n\n\"Here are two characters very different. If Chimborazo be porphyry from the top to the bottom, it is not composed of burnt and scoriified rocks, mixed with pumicestone; and if it be composed of burnt rocks, it cannot be porphyry. This expression, burnt and scoriified rocks, is not even exact, because it excites the idea of natural rocks, altered in their place by fire, and they are certainly lava which has been thrown up by the volcano. But the truth must be, that Chimborazo, and all the other volcanoes of Peru, are composed of volcanic matters, from their base at the level of the sea to the summit.\n\n\"I have just read in the Annales du Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle*, a letter of the same traveller, written from Mexico, on his return from Peru, where, speaking of the volcanoes of Popayan, Pasto, Quito, and the other parts of the Andes, he says, 'Great masses of this fossil (obsidian) have issued from the craters; and the sides of these gulls, which we closely examined, consist of porphyry, the base of which holds a mean between obsidian and pitchstone (pechstein). M. Humboldt therefore considers obsidian, or black compact glass, as a natural fossil or rock, and not as volcanic glass.'\"","sp":205,"ep":274},{"h":"GEOMANCY","t":"GEOMANCY, Geomantia, a kind of divination, performed by means of a number of little points, or dots, made on paper at random; and considering the various lines and figures which those points present; and thence forming a pretended judgment of futurity, and deciding any question propounded.\n\nThe word is formed of the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1, \"earth;\" and \u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, \"divination,\" it being the ancient custom to cast little pebbles on the ground, and thence to form their conjectures; instead of the points afterwards made use of.\n\nPolydore Virgil defines geomancy a kind of divination performed by means of clefts or chinks made in the ground; and takes the Persian Magi to have been the inventors thereof.","sp":280,"ep":281},{"h":"GEOMETRY","t":"INTRODUCTION.\n\nThere is reason to believe that geometry, as well as most of the other sciences, was first cultivated in Egypt; and, according to some authors, it had its origin in the necessity there was of affixing to the inhabitants every year their particular shares of land: for as the country was annually overflowed by the Nile, it has been taken for granted (perhaps without good reason), that the land-marks would be obliterated, and the possessions rendered undistinguishable from one another. Such is said to have been the origin of land-measuring, the form under which geometry was first known, and from which it has taken its name; for geometry literally signifies the measuring of the earth.\n\nThe historian Herodotus refers the origin of geometry to the time when Sesostris intersected Egypt by numerous canals, and divided the country among the inhabitants; and this account of the beginning of the science has been considered by some as very probable.\n\nFrom Egypt geometry was carried into Greece by Thales of Miletus about 600 years before the Christian era. This celebrated philosopher is said to have made numerous discoveries in geometry; and in particular to have first observed that any angle in a semicircle is a right angle; a discovery which gave him great joy, and for which he thanked the muses by a sacrifice.\n\nAmong the disciples of Thales were Anaximander and Anaxagoras: the first of these wrote an elementary treatise or introduction to geometry, the earliest of which there is any mention in history; and the last is said to have attempted the quadrature of the circle, a problem which has baffled the skill of mathematicians of every age.\n\nPythagoras followed Thales, and had the merit of discovering one of the most beautiful and important propositions of the whole science, namely, that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle was equal to the squares of the two other sides. He is said to have been so transported with joy at this discovery, that he sacrificed a hundred oxen to the gods as a testimony of his gratitude. The truth of this anecdote has however been doubted, on account of the philosopher's moderate fortune and religious opinions concerning the transmigration of souls.\n\nZenodorus is the earliest of the geometers whose writings have reached modern times, a part of them having been preserved by Theon, in his commentary on Ptolemy.\n\nHippocrates of Chios cultivated geometry, and distinguished himself by the quadrature of the curvilinear space contained between half the circumference of one circle, and the fourth part of the circumference of another circle, their concavities being both turned the same way, and the radius of the former to that of the latter as 1 to \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). He also wrote elements of geometry which are now lost.\n\nThe founding of the school of Plato forms one of the earliest and most important epochs in the history of geometry; for to that philosopher we are said to be indebted for the discovery of the Geometrical Analysis, by which the science has been greatly extended, and which is indeed absolutely necessary for the solution of problems of a certain degree of difficulty.\n\nThe Conic Sections, and the theory of Geometrical Loci, are commonly reckoned among the improvements which geometry received from his disciples; and there is reason to suppose that these, as well as many other important discoveries which we have not room here to enumerate, were first suggested by the attempts of the geometers of the Platonic school to resolve two celebrated problems, namely, to trisect, or divide into three equal parts, a given angle; and to construct a cube which should be the double of another cube; which last problem Hippocrates had shewn to be equivalent to the finding of two mean proportions between two given lines. The esteem in which Plato held the science of geometry is fully evinced by the following inscription over the door of his school: Let no one enter here that is ignorant of geometry.\n\nThe science of geometry was likewise cultivated in all its branches by the philosophers of the Alexandrian school, among whom Euclid claims in a particular manner our attention. This celebrated mathematician lived about 300 years before the Christian era, and probably studied geometry at Athens under the disciples of Plato. From Greece he went to Alexandria, allured thither no doubt by the fame of the celebrated school of that city, and by the favours conferred by the first Ptolemy upon learned men. He composed elements of geometry in a systematic form, comprehending in them such propositions belonging to the first principles of the science as had been discovered by mathematicians previous to his time. This work has had the singular good fortune to preserve the highest reputation in all ages and in all countries where science has been cultivated, and it has served as the groundwork of innumerable other treatises, few of which, if any, have excelled it. Many commentaries have been written on it, and it has been translated into almost all the...\nthe European and Oriental languages. Euclid is likewise known to have written other works on geometry; of these we have his Data, which may be regarded as a continuation of his Elements; and an account of a work of his on Porisms (see Porisms) preferred in the writings of Pappus, but which has suffered too much from time as to be almost unintelligible.\n\nAfter Euclid, lived Archimedes, who cultivated and improved all the branches of the mathematics known at that period, and in a particular manner geometry. He was the first that found nearly the ratio of the diameter of a circle to its circumference, and he squared the parabola. He likewise wrote treatises on the Sphere and Cylinder, on Spirals, on Conoids and Spheroids, besides others on mixt Mathematics. He also extended and improved the Geometrical Analysis, the principles of which had been established in the school of Plato. Many of the writings of Archimedes have been lost; but such as remain prove him to have been one of the greatest geometers that ever lived, and indeed the Newton of antiquity.\n\nApollonius of Perge was nearly contemporary with Archimedes, that is, he flourished about the end of the second century before the Christian era. He studied geometry in the Alexandrian school under the successors of Euclid, and he greatly extended the theory of the conic sections (see introduction to Conic Sections). He also composed treatises on different parts of Geometrical Analysis, but of these only one has come down to us entire; it is entitled De Sectione Rationis, and was discovered in the Arabic tongue, from which it has been translated into Latin by Dr Halley. Such accounts however are preserved in the mathematical collections of Pappus of his other treatises, that several of them have been restored by modern mathematicians. We may mention in particular his treatises De Locis Planis, de Sectione Spatii, de Sectione Determinata, de Tactionibus, each of which is divided into two books.\n\nHaving mentioned Archimedes and Apollonius, by far the most illustrious mathematicians of the period in which they lived, we shall pass over several others who contributed nothing to the improvement of the science, and therefore are but little known to us. We shall however, briefly notice Theodosius, who lived about 50 years A.D. and who is the author of a work on Spherics, which is considered as one of the most valuable of the books on the ancient geometry.\n\nPappus and Theon of Alexandria deserve to be mentioned as among the most celebrated of the commentators and annotators of the ancient geometry. We are particularly indebted to Pappus (who lived about the middle of the fourth century) for our knowledge of various discoveries and treatises of the ancient geometers, which, but for the account he has given of them in his mathematical collections, would have been forever lost to mathematicians of modern times.\n\nProclus, the head of the Platonic school at Athens, cultivated mathematics about the middle of the fifth century; and although it does not appear that he made any discoveries in the science, yet he rendered it some service by his example and instruction. He wrote a commentary on the first book of Euclid, which contains many curious observations, respecting the history and metaphysics of mathematics.\n\nWe have now briefly noticed the principal epochs in the history of geometry, and the most celebrated men who have contributed to its improvement from the earliest periods of history to the end of the fifth century; but long before this time the era of discovery seems to have been past, and the science on the decline. Still however the Alexandrian school existed, and it was possible that a Euclid or an Apollonius might again arise in that seminary. But the taking of Alexandria by the Arabs in the year 641 gave a death-blow to the sciences, not only in that capital, but throughout the whole Greek empire. The library, a treasure of infinite value, was burnt, and the stores of learning which had been accumulating for ages were annihilated for ever.\n\nAlthough by this unfortunate event the sciences suffered an irreparable loss, it must be attributed to the fanaticism of the new religion which the conquerors had adopted, rather than to national ignorance or barbarity; for before that period, the sciences, when on the decline in Greece, had found an asylum among them, and about 120 years after the death of Mohammed they again took them under their protection.\n\nThe Arabs translated the greater part of the works of the Greek geometers, and chiefly those introductory to astronomy. They even began to study the more sublime geometry of the ancients; for Apollonius's Conic Sections became familiar to them, and some of the books of that work have only reached us in an Arabic version. They gave to Trigonometry its present simple and commodious form, and greatly simplified its operations by the introduction of sines instead of the chords of double arcs, which had been formerly used.\n\nAfter geometry, as well as its kindred mathematical sciences, had remained for several centuries under the protection of the Arabs, it was again received into Spain, Italy, and the rest of Europe, about the year 1400. Among the earliest writers on the subject after this period, were Leonardus Pitanus, and Lucas Paciolus or de Bergo.\n\nThe limits within which we must necessarily confine this sketch of the history of the science, will not, however, allow us to enumerate all the improvements which it has received since the restoration of letters in Europe; for a list of the names of those who have contributed more or less to its extension, would include almost every mathematician of note from the time of Leonardus Pitanus to the present day.\n\nThe writings of the ancient geometers have been assiduously sought after, and held in great repute; for it appears that as far as they carried some of their theories, they left but little room for improvement, and of this remark we think the writings of Euclid, of Archimedes, and of Apollonius, afford remarkable instances. Euclid's elements of geometry have been considered, at least in this country, as one of the best books that could be put into the hands of the mathematical student, particularly that edition of its first six and eleventh and twelfth books which was given to the world by the late Dr Simson. An excellent system of geometry, comprehending the first six books of the illustrious ancient, together with three supplementary books, has of late years been published by Mr Professor Playfair, of the University of Edinburgh. We believe no modern system has excelled that of Euclid.\nSECT. I. THE FIRST PRINCIPLES.\n\nDefinitions.\n\nI. Geometry is a science which treats of the properties and relations of quantities having extension, and which are called magnitudes. Extension is distinguished into length, breadth, and thickness.\n\nII. A Point is that which has position, but not magnitude.\n\nIII. A Line is that which has only length. Hence the extremities of a line are points, and the intersections of one line with another are also points.\n\nIV. A Straight or Right Line is the shortest way from one point to another.\n\nV. Every line which is neither straight, nor composed of straight lines, is a Curve Line. Thus AB is a straight line, ACDB is a line made up of straight lines, and AEB is a curve line.\n\nVI. A Superficies, or Surface, is that which has only length and breadth. Hence the extremities of a superficies are lines, and the intersections of one superficies with another are also lines.\n\nVII. A Plane Superficies is that in which any two points being taken, the straight line between them lies wholly in that superficies.\n\nVIII. Every superficies which is neither plane nor composed of plane superficies, is a Curve Superficies.\n\nIX. A Solid is that which has length, breadth, and thickness. Hence the boundaries of a solid are superficies; and the boundary which is common to two solids, which are contiguous, is a superficies.\n\nX. A Plane Rectilineal Angle is the inclination of two straight lines to one another, which meet together, but are not in the same straight line. The point in which the lines meet one another is called the Vertex of the angle.\n\nWhen there is only one angle at a point, it may be expressed by the letter placed at that point; thus the angle contained by the lines EF and EG may be called the angle E; if, however, there be several angles, as at B, then each is expressed by three letters, one of which is the letter that stands at the vertex of the angle, and the others are the letters that stand somewhere upon the lines containing the angle, the letter at the vertex being placed between the other two. Thus the angle contained by the lines BA and BD is called the angle ABD or DAB.\n\nAngles in common with other quantities admit of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Thus the sum of the angles ABD and DBC is the angle ABC; the difference of the angle ABC and ABD is the angle DBC.\n\nXI. When a straight line standing on another straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of them is called a Right Angle, and the straight line which stands on the other is called a Perpendicular to it. Thus, if DC meet AB, and make the angles ACD, DCB equal to one another; each of them is a right angle, and DC is a perpendicular to AB.\n\nXII. An Obtuse Angle is that which is greater than a right angle, and an Acute Angle is that which is less than a right angle. Thus ABC being supposed a right angle, DRC is an obtuse angle, and EBC an acute angle.\n\nXIII. Parallel Straight Lines are such as are in the same plane, and which being produced ever so far both ways, do not meet.\n\nXIV. A Plane Figure is a plane terminated everywhere by lines.\n\nIf the lines be straight, the space which they enclose is called a Rectilineal figure, or a Polygon, and the lines themselves constitute the Perimeter of the polygon.\n\nXV. When a polygon has three sides (which is the smallest number it can have) it is called a Triangle; when it has four, it is called a Quadrilateral; when it has five, a Pentagon; when six, a Hexagon, &c.\n\nXVI. An Equilateral triangle is that which has all its sides equal (fig. 7); an Isosceles triangle is that which has only two equal sides (fig. 8); and a Scalene triangle is that which has all its sides unequal (fig. 9).\n\nXVII. A Right-angled triangle is that which has a right angle; the side opposite to the right angle is called the Hypotenuse. Thus in the triangle ABC, having the angle at B a right angle, the side AC is the hypotenuse.\n\nXVIII. An Obtuse-angled triangle is that which has an obtuse angle (fig. 9); and an acute-angled triangle is that which has three acute angles (fig. 11).\n\nXIX. Of quadrilateral figures, a Square is that which has all its sides equal, and all its angles right angles (fig. 12). A Rectangle is that which has all its angles right angles, but not all its sides equal, (fig. 13.). A Rhombus is that which has all its sides equal, but its angles are not right angles, (fig. 14.). A Parallelogram, or Rhomboid, is that which has its opposite sides parallel (fig. 15.). A Trapezoid is that which has only two of its opposite sides parallel, (fig. 16.).\n\nXX. A Diagonal is a straight line which joins the vertices of two angles, which are not adjacent to each other; such is AC.\n\nXXI. An Equilateral Polygon is that which has all its sides equal; and an Equiangular Polygon is that which has all its angles equal. If a polygon be both equilateral and equiangular, it is called a Regular Polygon.\n\nXXII. Two polygons are equilateral between themselves, when the sides of the one are equal to the sides of the other, each to each, and in the same order; that is, when in going about each of the figures in the same direction, the first side of the one is equal to the first side of the other; the second side of the one is equal to the\nthe second side of the other; the third to the third, and so on. The same is to be understood of two polygons which are equiangular between themselves.\n\nExplanation of Terms.\n\nAn Axiom is a proposition, the truth of which is evident at first sight.\n\nA Theorem is a truth which becomes evident by a process of reasoning called Demonstration.\n\nA Problem is a question proposed, which requires a solution.\n\nA Lemma is a subsidiary truth employed in the demonstration of a theorem, or the solution of a problem.\n\nThe common name of Proposition is given indifferently to theorems, problems, and lemmas.\n\nA Corollary is a consequence which follows from one or several propositions.\n\nA Scholium is a remark upon one or more propositions that have gone before, tending to shew their connection, their restriction, their extension, or the manner of their application.\n\nA Hypothesis is a supposition made either in the enunciation of a proposition, or in the course of a demonstration.\n\nExplanation of Signs.\n\nThat the demonstrations may be more concise, we shall make use of the following signs borrowed from Algebra; and in employing them we shall take for granted that the reader is acquainted with at least the manner of notation and first principles of that branch of mathematics.\n\nTo express that two quantities are equal the sign = is put between them; thus $A = B$, signifies that the quantity denoted by $A$ is equal to the quantity denoted by $B$.\n\nTo express that $A$ is less than $B$, they are written thus; $A < B$.\n\nTo express that $A$ is greater than $B$, they are written thus; $A > B$.\n\nThe sign + (read plus) written between the letters which denote two quantities, indicates that the quantities are to be added together; thus $A + B$ means the sum of the quantities $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe sign \u2014 (read minus) written between two letters, means the excess of the one quantity above the other; thus $A - B$ means the excess of the quantity denoted by $A$ above the quantity denoted by $B$. The signs + and \u2014 will sometimes occur in the same expression; thus $A + C - D$ means that $D$ is to be subtracted from the sum of $A$ and $C$, also $A - D + C$ means the same thing.\n\nThe sign $\\times$ put between two quantities means their product, if they be considered as numbers; but if they be considered as lines, it signifies a rectangle having these lines for its length and breadth; thus $A \\times B$ means the product of two numbers $A$ and $B$; or else a rectangle having $A$ and $B$ for the sides about one of its right angles. We shall likewise indicate the product of two quantities, in some cases, by writing the letters close together; thus $m \\times A$ will be used to express the product of $m$ and $A$, and so on with other expressions, agreeable to the common notation in algebra.\n\nThe expression $A^2$ means the square of the quantity $A$, and $A^3$ means the cube of $A$; also $PQ^2$, and $PQ^3$ mean, the one the square, and the other the cube, of a line whose extremities are the points $P$ and $Q$.\n\nOn the other hand, the sign $\\sqrt{}$ indicates a root to be extracted; thus $\\sqrt{A \\times B}$ means the square root of the product of $A$ and $B$.","sp":281,"ep":284},{"h":"GEOMETRY","t":"Theorem XXVI.\n\nThe opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, and the opposite angles are also equal.\n\nDraw the diagonal BD; the two triangles ADB, DBC have the side BD common to both, and AB, DC being parallel, the angle ABD = BDC (21.) also, AD, BC being parallel, the angle ADB = DBC, therefore the two triangles are equal (6.), and the side AB, opposite to the angle ADB, is equal to DC, opposite to the equal angle DBC. In like manner the third side AD is equal to the third side BC, therefore the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.\n\nIn the next place, because of the equality of the same triangles, the angle A is equal to the angle C, and also the angle ADC composed of the two angles ADB, BDC is equal to the angle ABC composed of the angles CBD, DBA; therefore the opposite angles of a parallelogram are also equal.\n\nSECT. II. OF THE CIRCLE.\n\nDefinitions.\n\nI. A Circle is a plane figure contained by one line which is called the circumference, and is such, that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within the figure to the circumference, are equal to one another. And this point is called the centre of the circle.\n\nII. Every straight line CA, CE, CD, &c. drawn from the centre to the circumference, is called a radius or semidiameter; and every straight line, such as AB, which passes through the centre, and is terminated both ways by the circumference, is called a diameter.\n\nHence it follows that all the radii of a circle are equal, and all the diameters are also equal, each being the double of the radius.\n\nIII. An Arch of a circle is any portion of its circumference, as FHG.\n\nThe chord or subtense of an arch is the straight line FG which joins its extremities.\n\nIV. A Segment of a circle is the figure contained by an arch, and its chord. If the figure be the half of the circle it is called a Semicircle.\n\nNote. Every chord corresponds to two arches, and consequently to two segments; but in speaking of these, it is always the smallest that is meant, unless the contrary be expressed.\n\nV. A Sector of a circle is the figure contained by an arch DE and the two radii CD, CE, drawn to the extremities of the arch. If the radii be at right angles to each other it is called a Quadrant.\n\nVI. A straight line is said to be placed or applied in a circle, when its extremities are in the circumference of the circle as FG.\n\nVII. A rectilineal figure is said to be inscribed in a circle when the vertices of all its angles are upon the circumference of the circle; in this case the circle is said to be circumscribed about the figure.\n\nVIII. A straight line is said to touch a circle, or to be a tangent to a circle, when it meets the circumference in one point only; such, for example, is BD, fig. 49. The point A which is common to the straight line and circle is called the Point of Contact.\n\nIX. A polygon is said to be described or circumscribed about a circle when all its sides are tangents to the circle; and in this case the circle is said to be inscribed in the polygon.\n\nTheorem I.\n\nAny diameter AB, divides the circle and its circumference into two equal parts.\n\nFor if the figure AEB be applied to AFB, so that the base AB may be common to both, the curve line AEB must fall exactly upon the curve line AFB; otherwise there would be points in the one or the other unequally distant from the centre, which is contrary to the definition of a circle.\n\nTheorem XXVII.\n\nIf the opposite sides of a quadrilateral ABCD are Fig. 43. equal, so that AB = DC, and AD = BC; then the equal sides are parallel, and the figure is a parallelogram.\n\nDraw the diagonal BD. The two triangles ABD, CDB have the three sides of the one equal to the three sides of the other, each to each, therefore the triangles are equal (10.) and the angle ADB, opposite to AB, is equal to DBC opposite to DC, therefore the side AD is parallel to BC (22.). For a similar reason AB is parallel to DC; therefore the quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.\n\nTheorem XXVIII.\n\nIf two opposite sides, AB, DC, of a quadrilateral Fig. 42. are equal and parallel, the two other sides are in like manner equal and parallel; and the figure is a parallelogram.\n\nDraw the diagonal BD. Because AB is parallel to CD, the alternate angles ABD, BDC are equal, (21.) now the side AB = DC, and DB is common to the triangles ABD, BDC, therefore these triangles are equal (5.) and hence the side AD = BC, and the angle ADB = DBC, consequently AD is parallel to BC, (22.) therefore the figure ABCD is a parallelogram.\n**Theorem I.**\n\nEvery chord is less than the diameter.\n\nLet the radii CA, CD be drawn from the centre to the extremities of the chord AD; then the straight line AD is less than AC + CD, that is \\(AD < AB\\).\n\n**Theorem II.**\n\nA straight line cannot meet the circumference of a circle in more than two points.\n\nFor if it could meet it in three, these three points would be equally distant from the centre, and therefore three equal straight lines might be drawn from the same point to the same straight line, which is impossible (2 cor. 15. i.).\n\n**Theorem IV.**\n\nIn the same circle, or in equal circles, equal arches are subtended by equal chords, and, conversely, equal chords subtend equal arches.\n\nIf the radius AC be equal to the radius EO, and the arch AMD equal to the arch ENG; the chord AD shall be equal to the chord EG.\n\nFor the diameter AB being equal to the diameter EF, the semicircle AMDB may be applied exactly upon the semicircle ENGF, and then the curve line AMDB shall coincide entirely with the curve line ENGF, but the arch AMD being supposed equal to ENG, the point D must fall upon G, therefore the chord AD is equal to the chord EG.\n\nConversely, if the chord AD = EG, the arch AMD is equal to the arch ENG.\n\nFor if the radii CD, OG be drawn, the two triangles ACD, EOG have three sides of the one equal to three sides of the other, each to each, viz. AC = EO, CD = OG and AD = EG, therefore these triangles are equal, (10. i.) and hence the angle ACD = EOG.\n\nNow if the semicircle ADR be placed upon EGF, because the angle ACD = EOG, it is evident that the radius CD will fall upon the radius OG, and the point D upon G, therefore the arch AMD is equal to the arch ENG.\n\n**Theorem V.**\n\nIn the same circle, or in equal circles, the greater arch is subtended by the greater chord, and, conversely, (if the arch be less than half the circumference) the greater chord subtends the greater arch.\n\nFor let the arch AH be greater than AD, and let the chords AD, AH, and the radii CD, CH be drawn. The two sides AC, AH, of the triangle ACH, are equal to the two sides AC, CD, of the triangle ACD; and the angle ACH is greater than ACD; therefore the third side AH is greater than the third side AD, (9. i.) therefore the chord which subtends the greater arch is the greater. Conversely, if the chord AH be greater than AD, it may be inferred (cor. 9. i.) from the same triangles that the angle ACH is greater than ACD, and that thus the arch AH is greater than AD.\n\nNote. Each of the arches is here supposed less than half the circumference; if they were greater, the contrary property would have place, the arch increasing as the chord diminishes.\n\n**Theorem VI.**\n\nThe radius CG, perpendicular to a chord AB, Fig 46. bisects the chord (or divides it into two equal parts), it also bisects the arch AGB subtended by the chord.\n\nDraw the radii CA, CB; these radii are two equal oblique lines in respect of the perpendicular CD, therefore they are equally distant from the perpendicular (15. i.) that is \\(AD = DB\\).\n\nIn the next place, because CG is perpendicular to the middle of AB, every point in CG is at equal distances from A and B, (16. i.) therefore, if GA, GB be drawn, these lines are equal, and as they are the chords of the arches AG, BG, the arches are also equal. (4.)\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nSince the centre C, the middle D of the chord AB, and the middle G of the arch subtended by that chord, are three points situated in the same straight line perpendicular to that chord; and that two points in a straight line are sufficient to determine its position; it follows, that a straight line which passes through any two of these points must necessarily pass through the third; and must be perpendicular to the chord. It also follows, that a perpendicular to the middle of a chord passes through the centre, and the middle of the arch subtended by that chord.\n\n**Theorem VII.**\n\nIf three points A, B, C, be taken in the circumference of a circle, no other circumference which does not coincide with the former, can be made to pass through the same three points.\n\nLet the chords AB, BC be drawn, and let OD, OF be drawn from the centre, perpendicular to, and consequently bisecting those chords. The centre of every circle passing through A and B must necessarily be somewhere in the perpendicular DO, (last theor.) and in like manner the centre of every circle passing through B and C, must be somewhere in the perpendicular OF, therefore the centre of a circle passing through A, B, and C, must be in the intersection of the perpendiculars DO, FO; and consequently can only be at one and the same point O; therefore, only one circle can be made to pass through the same three points A, B, C.\n\nCor. One circumference of a circle cannot intersect another in more than two points, for if they could have three common points they would have the same centre, and consequently would coincide with each other.\n\n**Theorem VIII.**\n\nTwo equal chords are equally distant from the centre,\ncentre; and of unequal chords, that which is nearer the centre is greater than that which is more remote.\n\nLet the chord \\( AB = DE \\), suppose the chords bisected by the perpendiculars \\( CF, CG \\) from the centre, and draw the radii \\( CA, CD \\). The right-angled triangles \\( CAF, CDG \\) have equal hypotenuses \\( CA, CD \\); the side \\( AF (= \\frac{1}{2} AB) \\) of the one is also equal to the side \\( DG (= \\frac{1}{2} DE) \\) of the other, therefore, their remaining sides \\( CF, CG \\) (which are the distances of the chords from the centre) are equal (17. i.).\n\nNext let the chord \\( AH \\) be greater than \\( DE \\); the arch \\( AKH \\) shall be greater than \\( DME \\). Upon the arch \\( AKH \\) take \\( ANB \\) equal to \\( DME \\); draw the chord \\( AB \\), and suppose \\( COF \\) drawn from the centre perpendicular to \\( AB \\), and \\( CI \\) perpendicular to \\( AH \\).\n\nIt is evident that \\( CF > CO \\), and (\\( 15.1 \\)) \\( CO > CI \\); much more then is \\( CF > CI \\); but \\( CF = CG \\), because the chords \\( AB, DE \\) are equal; therefore \\( CG > CI \\); that is, the chord nearer the centre is greater than that which is farther from it.\n\n**Theorem IX.**\n\nThe perpendicular \\( BD \\), drawn at the extremity of a radius \\( CA \\), is a tangent to the circle.\n\nFor any oblique line \\( CE \\) is greater than the perpendicular \\( CA \\) (\\( 15.1 \\)) therefore the point \\( E \\) is without the circle; therefore the line \\( BD \\) has but one point \\( A \\) common with the circumference, and consequently it is a tangent to the circle. (Def. 8).\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nThrough the same point \\( A \\), only one tangent, \\( AD \\), can be drawn to the circle. For if it be possible to draw another, let \\( AG \\) be that other tangent; draw \\( CF \\) perpendicular to \\( AG \\); then \\( CF \\) shall be less than \\( CA \\), (\\( 15.1 \\)) therefore \\( F \\) must be within the circle; and consequently \\( AF \\) when produced must necessarily meet the circle in another point besides \\( A \\); therefore it cannot be a tangent.\n\n**Theorem X.**\n\nIf \\( BC \\), the distance of the centres of two circles, be less than the sum of their radii; and also the greater radius less than the sum of the distance of their centres and the lesser radius; the two circles intersect each other.\n\nFor that the circles may intersect each other in a point \\( A \\), it is necessary that the triangle \\( ABC \\) be possible; therefore, not only must \\( CB \\) be less than \\( CA + AB \\), but also the greater radius \\( AB \\) must be less than \\( AC + CB \\); (\\( 7.1 \\)) and it is evident, that as often as the triangle \\( ABC \\) can be constructed, the circumferences described on the centres \\( B, C \\), shall intersect each other in two points \\( A, D \\).\n\n**Theorem XI.**\n\nIf the distance \\( CB \\) of the centres of two circles be equal to the sum of the radii \\( CA, BA \\), the circles shall touch each other externally.\n\nIt is evident that they have a common point \\( A \\); but they cannot have more; for if they had two, then the distance of the centres must necessarily be less than the sum of the radii.\n\n**Theorem XII.**\n\nIf the distance \\( CB \\) of the centres of two circles Fig. 53 be equal to the difference of the radii, the two circles shall touch each other internally.\n\nIn the first place, it is evident that the point \\( A \\) is common to them both; they cannot, however, have another; for that this may happen, it is necessary that the greater radius \\( AB \\) be smaller than the sum of the radius \\( AC \\) and the distance \\( CB \\) of the centre, (\\( 10.1 \\)) which is not the case.\n\nCor. Therefore, if two circles touch each other, either internally or externally, their centres and the point of contact are in the same straight line.\n\n**Theorem XIII.**\n\nIn the same circle, or in equal circles, equal angles \\( ACB, DCE \\), at the centres, intercept upon the circumference equal arches \\( AB, DE \\). And, conversely, if the arches \\( AB, DE \\) are equal, the angles \\( ACB, DCE \\) are equal.\n\nFirst, if the angle \\( ACB \\) be equal to \\( DCE \\), the one angle may be applied upon the other; and as the lines containing them are equal, it is manifest that the point \\( A \\) will fall upon \\( D \\), and the point \\( B \\) upon \\( E \\); thus the arch \\( AB \\) will coincide with, and be equal to the arch \\( DE \\).\n\nNext, if the arch \\( AB \\) be equal to \\( DE \\), the angle \\( ACB \\) is equal to \\( DCE \\); for if the angles are not equal; let \\( ACB \\) be the greater; and let \\( ACI \\) be taken equal to \\( DCE \\); then, by what has been already demonstrated, the arch \\( AI = DE \\); but by hypothesis \\( AB = DE \\); therefore, \\( AI = AB \\) which is impossible; therefore the angle \\( ACB = DCE \\).\n\n**Theorem XIV.**\n\nThe angle \\( BCD \\) at the centre of a circle is double Fig. 55 the angle \\( BAD \\) at the circumference, when both stand on the same arch \\( BD \\).\n\nFirst let the centre of the circle be within the angle \\( BAD \\); draw the diameter \\( AE \\). The exterior angle \\( BCE \\) of the triangle \\( BCA \\) is equal to both the inward and opposite angles \\( BAC, CBA \\); (\\( 23.1 \\)) but the triangle \\( RCA \\) being isosceles, the angle \\( BAC = CBA \\); therefore the angle \\( BCE \\) is double of the angle \\( BAC \\). For the same reason, the angle \\( DCE \\) is double of the angle \\( DAE \\), therefore the whole angle \\( BCD \\) is double of the whole angle \\( BAD \\).\n\nSuppose in the next place that the centre is without the angle \\( BAD \\); then, drawing the diameter \\( AE \\), it may be demonstrated, as in the first case, that the angle \\( ECD \\) is double of the angle \\( EAD \\), and that the angle...\nOf proper angle ECB, a part of the first, is double the angle EAB a part of the other; therefore the remaining angle BCD is double the remaining angle BAD.\n\n**Theorem XV.**\n\nAll angles BAD, BFD in the same segment BAFD of a circle are equal to one another.\n\nIf the segment be greater than a semicircle, from the centre C draw CB and CD; then the angles BAD and BFD being (by last theorem) each equal to half BCD; they must be equal to one another.\n\nBut if the segment BAFD be less than a semicircle, let H be the intersection of BF and AD; then, the triangles ABH and FDH having the angle AHB of the one equal to FHD of the other, (4. i.) and ABH = FDH, (by case i.) will have the remaining angles of the one equal to the remaining angles of the other; that is the angle BAH = HFD, or BAD = BFD.\n\n**Theorem XVI.**\n\nThe opposite angles of any quadrilateral figure ABCD described in a circle are together equal to two right angles.\n\nDraw the diagonals AC, BD; because the angle ABD = ACD, and CBD = CAD, (last theor.) the sum ABD + CBD = ACD + CAD; or ABC = ACD + CAD; to each of these equals add ADC, and ABC + ADC = ACD + CAD + ADC; but the last three angles, being the angles of the triangle ADC, are taken together equal to two right angles, (24. i.), therefore ABD + CBD = two right angles. In the same manner, the angles BAD, BCD may be shown to be together equal to two right angles.\n\n**Sect. III. Of Proportion.**\n\n**Definitions.**\n\nI. When one magnitude contains another a certain number of times exactly, the former is said to be a multiple of the latter, and the latter a part of the former.\n\nII. When several magnitudes are multiples of as many others, and each contains its parts the same number of times, the former are said to be equimultiples of the latter, and the latter like parts of the former.\n\nIII. Betwixt any two finite magnitudes of the same kind there subsists a certain relation in respect to quantity, which is called their ratio. The two magnitudes compared are called the terms of the ratio, the first the antecedent, and the second the consequent.\n\nIV. If there be four magnitudes, or quantities, A, B, C, D, and if A contain some part of B just as often as C contains a like part of D, then, the ratio of A to B is said to be the same with (or equal to) the ratio of C to D.\n\nIt follows immediately from this definition, that if A contain B just as often as C contains D, then the ratio of A to B is equal to the ratio of C to D; for in that case it is evident that A will contain any part of B just so often as C contains a like part of D.\n\nV. When two ratios are equal, their terms are called proportional.\n\nTo denote that the ratio of A to B is equal to the ratio of C to D, they are usually written thus, \\(A : B :: C : D\\), or thus, \\(A : B = C : D\\), which is read thus: A is to B as C to D; such an expression is called an analogy or a proportion.\n\nVI. Of four proportional quantities, the last term is called a fourth proportional to the other three taken in order.\n\nVII. Three quantities A, B, C, are said to be proportional, when the ratio of the first A to the second B is equal to the ratio of the second B to the third C.\n\nVIII. Of three proportional quantities, the middle term is said to be a mean proportional between the other two, and the last a third proportional to the first and second.\n\nIX. Quantities are said to be continual proportionals, when the first is to the second, as the second to the third, and as the third to the fourth, and so on.\n\nX. When there is any number of magnitudes A, B, C, D, of the same kind, the ratio of the first A to the last D is said to be compounded of the ratio of\nSect. III.\n\nOf Propor- A to B, and of the ratio of B to C, and of the ratio of C to D.\n\nXI. If three magnitudes A, B, C be continual proportional; that is, if the ratio of A to B be equal to the ratio of B to C; then the ratio of the first A to the third C is said to be duplicate of the ratio of the first A to the second B. Hence, since by the last definition the ratio of A to C is compounded of the ratio of A to B and of B to C, a ratio which is compounded of two equal ratios is duplicate of either of them.\n\nXII. If four magnitudes A, B, C, D be continual proportional, the ratio of the first A to the fourth D is said to be triplicate the ratio of the first A to the second B. Hence a ratio compounded of three equal ratios is triplicate of any one of them.\n\nXIII. Ratio of Equality is that which equal magnitudes bear to each other.\n\nThe next four definitions explain the names given by geometers to certain ways of changing either the order or magnitude of proportions, so that they still continue to be proportional.\n\nXIV. Inverse Ratio is when the antecedent is made the consequent, and the consequent the antecedent. See Theor. 3.\n\nXV. Alternate proportion is when antecedent is compared with antecedent, and consequent with consequent. See Theor. 2.\n\nXVI. Compounded ratio is when the sum of the antecedent and consequent is compared either with the antecedent, or with the consequent. See Theor. 4.\n\nXVII. Divided ratio is when the difference of the antecedent and consequent is compared either with the antecedent or with the consequent.

It is evident that CE multiplied by a certain number m will be greater than AC; divide CA into as many equal parts as there are units in m, and let these be CF, FG, GH, HA, each of which will be less than CE. Through each of the points F, G, H, let planes be made to pass parallel to the plane BCD, making with the sides of the pyramid the sections FPQ, GRH, HTU, which will be all similar to one another, and to the base BCD (13.). From the point B draw in the plane of the triangle ABC the straight line BK parallel to CF, meeting FP produced in K. In like manner, from D draw DL parallel to CF, meeting FQ in L; join KL, and it is plain that the solid KBCDLF is a prism. By the same construction let the prisms PM, RO, TV be described. Also let the straight line IP, which is in the plane of the triangle ABC be produced till it meet BC in h; and let the line MQ be produced till it meet DC in g. Join h g, then h C g QFP is a prism; and is equal to the prism PM (cor. 11.) In the same manner is described the prism m S equal to the prism RO, and the prism q U equal to the prism TV. The sum, therefore, of all the inscribed prisms h Q, m S and q U is equal to the sum of the prisms PM, RO and TV, that is, to the sum of all the circumscribed prisms except the prism BL; therefore, BL is the excess of the prisms circumscribed about the pyramid above the prisms inscribed within it. But the prism BL is less than the prism which has the triangle BCD for its base, and for its altitude the perpendicular from E upon the plane BCD, which prism is, by hypothesis, equal to the given solid Z; therefore the excess of the circumscribed above the inscribed prisms is less than the solid Z. But the excess of the circumscribed prisms above the inscribed is greater than their excess above the pyramid ABCD, because ABCD is greater than the sum of the inscribed prisms; much more therefore is the excess of the circumscribed prisms above the pyramid less than the solid Z. A series of prisms of the same altitude has therefore been circumscribed about the pyramid ABCD exceeding it by a solid less than the given solid Z.\n\nTheorem XV.\n\nPyramids that have equal bases and altitudes are Fig. 146. equal to one another.\n\nLet ABCD, EFGH be two pyramids that have equal bases BCD, FGH, and also equal altitudes; the pyramid ABCD is equal to the pyramid EFGH.\n\nIf they are unequal, let the pyramid EFGH exceed the pyramid ABCD by the solid Z. Let a series of prisms of the same altitude be circumscribed about the pyramid ABCD that shall exceed it by a solid less than Z, (14.) and let another series equal in number to the former, and having all the same altitude, be described about the pyramid EFGH; then, because the pyramids have equal altitudes, the altitude of each of the prisms described about the one pyramid is equal to the altitude of each of the prisms described about the other pyramid; therefore the sections of the pyramids which are the bases of the corresponding prisms will be at equal distances from the bases of the pyramids, and hence these sections will be equal; (1. cor. 13.) and because the prisms have all the same altitude, the corresponding prisms will be equal, and the sum of the prisms described about the pyramid ABCD will be equal to the sum of the prisms described about the pyramid EFGH. Let the pyramid EFGH be denoted by P, and the pyramid ABCD by p, and put Q for the sum of the prisms described about P, and q for the prisms described about p: Then by hypothesis Z = P \u2212 p, and by construction Z > q \u2212 p, therefore P \u2212 p > q \u2212 p, and consequently P > q, but it has been shown that q = Q, therefore P > Q, that is, the pyramid EFGH is greater than the sum of the prism described about it, which is impossible, therefore the pyramids ABCD, EFGH are not unequal, that is, they are equal.\n\nTheorem XVI.\n\nEvery prism having a triangular base may be divided into three pyramids that have triangular bases, and that are equal to one another.\n\nLet ABC, DEF be the opposite bases of a triangular prism. Join AE, EC, CD; and because ABED is a parallelogram, of which AE is the diameter, the triangle ADE is equal to the triangle ABE; therefore the pyramid of which the base is the triangle ADE and vertex the point C, is equal to the pyramid of which the base is the triangle ADE, and vertex the point C. But the pyramid of which the base is the triangle ABE and vertex the point C, that is the pyramid ABCE, is equal to the pyramid DEFC, (15.) for they have equal bases, viz. the triangles ABC, DFE, and the same altitude, viz. the altitude of the prism ABCDEF. Therefore, the three pyramids ADEC, ABEC, DFEC are equal to one another; but these pyramids make up the whole prism ABCDEF; therefore, the prism ABCDEF is divided into three equal pyramids.\n\nCor. 1. From this it is manifest that every pyramid...\nSECT. IX. OF CYLINDERS, CONES, AND THE SPHERE.\n\nDefinitions.\n\nI. A Cylinder is a solid figure described by the revolution of a right-angled parallelogram about one of its sides, which remains fixed.\n\nThe Axis of the cylinder is the fixed straight line about which the parallelogram revolves.\n\nThe Bases of the cylinder are the circles described by the two revolving opposite sides of the parallelogram.\n\nII. A Cone is a solid figure described by the revolution of a right-angled triangle about one of the sides containing the right angle, which side remains fixed.\n\nThe Axis of the cone is the fixed line about which the triangle revolves.\n\nThe Base of the cone is the circle described by that side containing the right angle which revolves.\n\nIII. A Sphere is a solid figure described by the revolution of a semicircle about a diameter.\n\nThe Axis of a sphere is the fixed line about which the semicircle revolves.\n\nThe Centre of a sphere is the same with that of the semicircle.\n\nThe Diameter of a sphere is any straight line which passes through the centre, and is terminated both ways by the surfaces of the sphere.\n\nIV. Similar cones and cylinders are those which have their axes and diameters of their bases proportional.\n\nTheorem I.\n\nIf from any point E in the circumference of the base of a cylinder ABCD, a perpendicular EF be drawn to the plane of the base AEB, the straight line EF is wholly in the cylindric surfaces.\n\nLet HG be the axis, and AGHD the rectangle, which by its revolution describes the cylinder. Because HG is perpendicular to AG in every position of the revolving rectangle, it is perpendicular to the plane of the circle described by AG; and because AD, the line which describes the cylindric surfaces, is parallel to GH, it is also perpendicular to the plane of that circle. (5.7.) Now when by the revolution of the rectangle AGHD the point A coincides with the point E, the line EF will coincide with AD, and thus will be wholly in the cylindric surfaces; for otherwise two perpendiculars might be drawn to the same plane, from the same point, which is impossible (2 cor. 4. 7.).\n\nTheorem II.\n\nA cylinder and a parallelopiped having equivalent bases and the same altitude are equal to one another.\n\nCor. 2. Pyramids having equal altitudes are to one another as their bases; because the prisms upon the same bases, and of the same altitude, are to one another as their bases.\n\nLet ABCD be a cylinder, and EF a parallelopiped having equivalent bases, viz. the circle AGB and the parallelogram EH, and having also equal altitudes; the cylinder ABCD is equal to the parallelopiped EF. If not, let them be unequal; and first let the cylinder be less than the parallelopiped EF; and from the parallelopiped EF let there be cut off a part EQ by a plane PQ parallel to NP, equal to the cylinder ABCD. In the circle AGB inscribe the polygon AGKBLM that shall differ from the circle by a space less than the parallelogram PH, (1 cor. 2. 6.) and cut off from the parallelogram EH a part OR equal to the polygon AGKBLM, then it is manifest that the parallelogram OR is greater than the parallelogram OP, therefore the point R will fall between P and N. On the polygon AGKBLM let an upright prism be constituted of the same altitude with the cylinder, which will therefore be less than the cylinder, because it is within it; (1.) and if through the point R a plane RS parallel to NF be made to pass, it will cut off the parallelopiped ES equal to the prism AGBC, because its base is equal to that of the prism, and its altitude is the same. But the prism AGBC is less than the cylinder ABCD, and the cylinder ABCD is equal to the parallelopiped EQ, by hypothesis; therefore, ES is less than EQ, and it is also greater, which is impossible. The cylinder ABCD therefore is not less than the parallelopiped EF; and in the same manner it may be shewn not to be greater than EF, therefore they are equal.\n\nTheorem III.\n\nIf a cone and cylinder have the same base and the same altitude, the cone is the third part of the cylinder.\n\nLet the cone ABCD, and the cylinder BFKG have the same base, viz. the circle BCD, and the same altitude, viz. the perpendicular from the point A upon the plane BCD; the cone ABCD is the third part of the cylinder BFKG. If not, let the cone ABCD be the third part of another cylinder LMNO having the same altitude with the cylinder BFKG; but let the bases BCD, LIM be unequal, and first let BCD be greater than LIM. Then, because the circle BCD is greater than the circle LIM, a polygon may be inscribed in BCD that shall differ from it less than LIM does, (1. cor. 2. 6.) and which therefore will be greater than LIM. Let this be the polygon BECFD, and upon BECFD let there be constituted the pyramid ABECFD, and the prism BCFKHG. Because the polygon BECFD is greater than the circle LIM, the prism BCFKHG is greater than the cylinder LMNO, for they have the same altitude, but the prism has the greater base. But the pyramid ABECFD is the third part of the prism BCFHG (16. \u00a7.) therefore it is greater\ngreater than the third part of the cylinder LMNO.\n\nNow the cone A.BECFD is by hypothesis the third part of the cylinder LMNO, therefore, the pyramid A.BECFD is greater than the cone ABCD, and it is also less, because it is inscribed in the cone, which is impossible. Therefore the cone ABCD is not less than the third part of the cylinder BFKG. And in the same manner, by circumscribing a polygon about the circle BCD, it may be shewn, that the cone ABCD is not greater than the third part of the cylinder BFKG; therefore, it is equal to the third part of the cylinder.\n\n**Theorem IV.**\n\nIf a hemisphere and cone have equal bases and altitudes, a series of cylinders may be inscribed in the hemisphere, and another series may be circumscribed about the cone, having all the same altitudes with one another, and such that their sum shall differ from the sum of the hemisphere and the cone by a solid less than any given solid.\n\nLet ADB be a semicircle, of which the centre is C, and let CD be at right angles to AB; let DB and DA be squares described on DC, draw CE, and let the figure thus constructed revolve about DC: then the quadrant BCD will describe a hemisphere having C for its centre, and the triangle CDE will describe a cone having its vertex at C, and having for its base the circle described by DE, equal to that described by BC, which is the base of the hemisphere. Let W be a given solid, a series of cylinders may be described in the hemisphere ADB, and another described about the cone ECI, so that their sum shall differ from the sum of the hemisphere and cone, by a solid less than the solid W.\n\nUpon the base of the hemisphere let a cylinder be constituted equal to W, and let its altitude be CX. Divide CD into such a number of equal parts, that each of them shall be less than CX; let these be CH, HG, GF and FD. Draw FN, GO, HP parallel to CB, meeting the circle in K, L, and M, and the straight line CE in Q, R, and S. Draw Kf, Lg, Mh, perpendicular to GO, HP, and CB; and draw Qq, Rr, Ss perpendicular to the same lines. It is evident that the figure being thus constructed, if the whole revolve about CD, the rectangles Ff, Gg, Hh will describe cylinders that will be circumscribed by the hemisphere BDA; and that the rectangles DN, Fg, Gr, Hs will also describe cylinders that will circumscribe the cone ICE. Now it may be demonstrated, as was done of the prisms inscribed in a pyramid (14, 8.), that the hemisphere exceeds the sum of all the cylinders described within it, by a solid less than the cylinder generated by the rectangle HB, that is, by a solid less than W. In the same manner it may be demonstrated, that the sum of the cylinders circumscribing the cone ICE is greater than the cone by a solid less than the cylinder generated by the rectangle DN, that is, by a solid less than W. Therefore, since the sum of the cylinders inscribed in the hemisphere together with a solid less than W, is equal to the hemisphere; and\n\nsince the sum of the cylinders described about the cone is equal to the cone together with a solid less than W; adding equals to equals, the sum of all the cylinders together with a solid less than W is equal to the hemisphere and cone together with a solid less than W; therefore, the difference between the whole of the cylinders, and the sum of the hemisphere and the cone, is equal to the difference of two solids, each of which is less than W: but this difference must also be less than W; therefore the difference between the two series of cylinders, and the sum of the hemisphere and cone is less than the given solid W.\n\n**Theorem V.**\n\nThe same things being supposed as in last theorem, Fig. 151: the sum of all the cylinders inscribed in the hemisphere, and described about the cone, is equal to a cylinder having the same base and altitude with the hemisphere.\n\nFor, the same construction being supposed as in last theorem, let L be the point in which GO meets the circle ADB, then because CGL is a right angle, if CL be joined, the circles described with the radii CG and GL are equal to the circle described with the radius CL or GO (2. cor. 4.6.). Now CG=GR, because CD=DE, therefore, the circles described by the revolution of the radii GR and GL about the point G are together equal to the circle described by the revolution of the radius GO about the same point G; therefore also the cylinders that stand upon the two first of these circles having the common altitude GH are equal to the cylinder which stands upon the remaining circle, and which has the same altitude GH. The cylinders described by the revolution of the rectangles Gg and Gr are therefore equal to the cylinder described by the rectangle GP. And as the same may be shewn of all the rest, the cylinders described by the rectangles Ha, Gg, Ff, and by the rectangles Hr, Gr, Fq, DN, are together equal to the cylinder described by DB, that is, to the cylinder having the same base and altitude with the hemisphere.\n\n**Theorem VI.**\n\nEvery sphere is two thirds of the circumscribing cylinder.\n\nLet the figure be constructed as in the two last theorems, and if the hemisphere described by the quadrant BDC be not equal to two thirds of the cylinder described by the rectangle BD, let it be greater by the solid W. Then as the cone described by CDE is one-third of the cylinder described by BD, the cone and the hemisphere together will exceed the cylinder by W. But that cylinder is equal to the sum of all the cylinders described by the rectangle Hh, Gg, Ff, Hs, Gr, Fq, DN; therefore, the hemisphere and the cone added together exceed the sum of all these cylinders by the solid W, which is absurd; for it has been shewn (4.) that the hemisphere and the cone together differ from the sum of these cylinders by a solid less than W. The hemisphere is therefore equal to two thirds of the cylinder described...\nOf Cylinders, Cones, Sphere is two thirds of the cylinder described by twice the rectangle BD, that is to two thirds of the circumference cylinder.\n\nWe here conclude the Elements of Geometry.

II. and III. kings of Great Britain.\u2014George I. the son of Ernest Augustus, duke of Brunswick Lunenburgh, and elector of Hanover; succeeded to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, in virtue of an act of parliament, passed in the latter part of the reign of King William III., limiting the succession of the crown, after the demise of that monarch, and Queen Anne (without issue), to the princess Sophia of Hanover, and the heirs of her body, being Protestants.\u2014George II. the only son of the former, succeeded him in 1727, and enjoyed a long reign of glory, dying amidst the most rapid and extensive conquests in the 77th year of his age. He was succeeded by his grandson George III. our present sovereign. For particulars, see BRITAIN, No. 374\u2014701.\n\nGeorge, or Knights of St George, has been the denomination of several military orders, whereof that of the garter is one of the most illustrious. See Garter, and St George, below.\n\nKing George's Islands, are two islands in the South sea, lying in W. Long. 144\u00b0 56'. S. Lat. 14\u00b0 28'. They were first discovered by Commodore Byron in 1765, and have since been visited by Captain Cook in 1774. Commodore Byron's people had an encounter with the inhabitants, which proved fatal to some of the natives; but Captain Cook was more fortunate. A lieutenant and two boats well-armed were sent on shore by Captain Cook; and landed without opposition. As soon as the gentlemen landed, the islanders embraced them by touching noses, a mode of civility used in New Zealand.\nland, which is 900 leagues distant, and the only place besides this where the custom has been observed to prevail. Notwithstanding this ceremony, however, very little real friendship seemed to take place on the part of the islanders. They crowded about the boats as the people were stepping into them, and seemed in doubt whether they should detain them or let them go; at last, however, not thinking themselves sufficiently strong, they seemed contented with their departure, and assisted them in pushing off their boats; but some of the most turbulent threw stones into the water, which fell very near them, and all seemed to glory that they had as it were driven them off. The British brought off five dogs of a white colour with fine long hair, with which the island seemed to be plentifully supplied. These they purchased with small nails, and some ripe bananas which had been brought from the Marquesas. On this island Mr Forster found a kind of scurvy-grafts, which the natives informed him they were wont to bruise and mix with shell fish; after which, they threw it into the sea whenever they perceived a shoal of fish. This preparation intoxicates them for some time; and thus they are caught on the surface of the water without any other trouble than that of taking them out. The name of this plant among the natives is enow. The largest island, which they call Tiooea, is something of an oval shape, and about 10 leagues in circuit; the other island, which lies two leagues to the westward of Tiooea, is four leagues long from north-east to south-west, and from three to five miles broad. The soil of both is extremely scanty; the foundation consists of coral, very little elevated above the surface of the water.\n\nGeorge, St., or George of Cappadocia; a name whereby several orders, both military and religious, are denominated. It took its rise from a saint or hero famous throughout all the East, called by the Greeks \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c2, q. d. great martyr.\n\nOn some medals of the emperors John and Manuel Comneni, we have the figure of St George armed, holding a sword or javelin in one hand, and in the other a buckler, with this inscription; an O, and therein a little P\n\nA, and \u0393\u0395\u2014\u0393\u0399\u039f\u03a3, making \u039f \u0391\u0393\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u0393\u0395\u03a9\u03a1\u0393\u0399\u039f\u03a3, Oh holy O\n\nGeorge. He is generally represented on horseback, as being supposed to have frequently engaged in combats in that manner. He is highly venerated throughout Armenia, Muscovy, and all the countries which adhere to the Greek rite: from the Greek, his worship has long ago been received into the Latin church; and England and Portugal have both chosen him for their patron saint.\n\nGreat difficulties have been raised about this saint or hero. His very existence has been called in question. Dr Heylin, who wrote first and most about him, concluded with giving him entirely up, and supposing him only a symbolical device; and Dr Pettingal has turned him into a mere Basilidian symbol of victory. Mr Pegg, in a paper in the Archaeologia, has attempted to restore him. And, finally, Mr Gibbon has sunk him into an Arian bishop in the reigns of Constantius and Julian.\u2014The bishop alluded to,\n\nGeorge the Cappadocian, was so named, according to our author, from his parents or education; and was born at Epiphania in Cilicia, in a fuller's shop. \"From this obscure and servile origin he raised himself by the talents of a parasite: and the patrons, whom he assiduously flattered, procured for their worthless dependent a lucrative commission, or contract, to supply the army with bacon. His employment was mean; he rendered it infamous. He accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud and corruption; but his malversations were so notorious, that George was compelled to escape from the pursuits of justice. After this disgrace, in which he appears to have saved his fortune at the expense of his honour, he embraced, with real or affected zeal, the profession of Arianism. From the love, or the ostentation, of learning, he collected a valuable library of history, rhetoric, philosophy, and theology; and the choice of the prevailing faction promoted George of Cappadocia to the throne of Athanasius.\" His conduct in this station is represented by our historian as polluted by cruelty and avarice, and his death considered as a just punishment for the enormities of his life, among which Mr Gibbon seems to rank his \"enmity to the gods.\"\n\nThe immediate occasion of his death, however, as narrated by ecclesiastical writers, will not probably appear calculated to add any stain to his memory. \"There was in the city of Alexandria a place in which the heathen priests had been used to offer human sacrifices. This place, as being of no use, Constantius gave to the church of Alexandria, and George the bishop gave orders for it to be cleared, in order to build a Christian church on the spot. In doing this they discovered an immense subterranean cavern, in which the heathen mysteries had been performed, and in it were many human skulls. These, and other things which they found in the place, the Christians brought out and exposed to public ridicule. The heathens, provoked at this exhibition, suddenly took arms and rushing upon the Christians, killed many of them with swords, clubs, and stones: some also they strangled, and several they crucified. On this the Christians proceeded no farther in clearing the temple; but the heathens, pursuing their advantage, seized the bishop as he was in the church, and put him in prison. The next day they despatched him; and then fastening the body to a camel, he was dragged about the streets all day, and in the evening they burnt him and the camel together. This fate Sozomen says, the bishop owed in part to his haughtiness while he was in favour with Constantius, and some say the friends of Athanasius were concerned in this massacre; but he ascribes it chiefly to the inveteracy of the heathens, whose superstitions he had been very active in abolishing.\n\nThis George, the Arian bishop of Alexandria, was a man of letters, and had a very valuable library, which Julian ordered to be seized for his own use; and in his orders concerning it, he says that many of the books were on philosophical and rhetorical subjects, though many of them related to the doctrine of the impious Galileans (as in his sneering contemptuous way he always affected to call the Christians). 'These books (says he) I could wish to have utterly destroyed; but lest books of value should be destroyed along with them, let these also be carefully sought for.'\n\nBut Mr Gibbon gives a different turn to the affair\nGeorge of George's murder, as well as relates it with different circumstances. \"The Pagans (says he) excited his devout avarice; and the rich temples of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by the haughty prelate, who exclaimed, in a loud and threatening tone, 'How long will these sepulchres be permitted to stand?' Under the reign of Constantius, he was expelled by the fury, or rather by the justice, of the people: and it was not without a violent struggle, that the civil and military powers of the state could restore his authority, and gratify his revenge. The messenger who proclaimed at Alexandria the accession of Julian, announced the downfall of the archbishop. George, with two of his obsequious ministers, Count Diodorus and Darcontius master of the mint, was ignominiously dragged in chains to the public prifon. At the end of 24 days, the prifon was forced open by the rage of a superstitious multitude, impatient of the tedious forms of judicial proceedings. The enemies of gods and men expired under their cruel insults; the lifeless bodies of the archbishop and his associates were carried in triumph through the streets on the back of a camel; and the inactivity of the Athanasian party was esteemed a shining example of evangelical patience. The remains of these guilty wretches were thrown into the sea; and the popular leaders of the tumult declared their resolution to disappoint the devotion of the Christians, and to intercept the future honours of these martyrs, who had been punished, like their predecessors, by the enemies of their religion. The fears of the Pagans were just, and their precautions ineffectual. The meritorious death of the archbishop obliterated the memory of his life. The rival of Athanasius was dear and sacred to the Arians, and the seeming conversion of those sectaries introduced his worship into the bosom of the Catholic church.

There have been various other orders under this denomination, most of which are now extinct; particularly one founded by the emperor Frederic III, in the year 1470, to guard the frontiers of Bohemia and Hungary against the Turks; another, called St George of Alfama, founded by the kings of Arragon; another in Austria and Carinthia; and another in the republic of Genoa, still subsisting, &c.\n\nReligious of St George. Of these there are divers orders and congregations; particularly canons regular of St George in Alga, at Venice, established by authority of Pope Boniface IX, in the year 1404. The foundation of this order was laid by Bartholomew Colonna, who preached, in 1396, at Padua, and some other villages in the state of Venice. Pope Pius V, in 1579, gave these canons precedence of all other religious.

It fronts the sea, and has a salt water river on its back side, which hinders the fresh water springs from coming near the town, so that they have no good water within a mile of them. In the rainy seasons it is incommodeed by inundations; and from April to September, it is so scorching hot, that if the sea breezes did not cool the air, there would be no living there. There are two towns, one of which is called the White Town, which is walled round, and has several bulwarks and bastions to defend it: it is 400 paces long and 150 broad, and is divided into regular streets. Here are two churches, one for the Protestants, and the other for the Papists; as also a good hospital, a town hall, and a prifon for debtors. They are a corporation, and have a mayor and aldermen, with other proper officers. The Black Town is inhabited by Gentoos, Mahometans, and Portuguese and Armenian Christians, and each religion has its temples and churches. This, as well as the White Town, is ruled by the English governor and his council. The diamond mines are but a week's journey from this place, which renders them pretty plentiful, but there are no large ones since that great diamond was procured by Governor Pitt. This colony produces very little of its own growth or manufacture for foreign markets, and the trade is in the hands of the Armenians and Gentoos. The chief things the British deal in, besides diamonds, are calicoes, chintz, muslins, and the like. This colony may consist of 50,000 inhabitants in the towns and villages, and there are generally 400 or 500 Europeans. Their rice is brought by sea from Gangam and Orix\u00e1, their wheat from Surat and Bengal, and their fire wood from the islands of Diu; so that an enemy, with a superior force at sea, may easily distress them. The houses of the White Town are built with brick, and have lofty rooms and flat roofs; but the Black Town consists chiefly of thatched cottages. The military power is lodged in the governor and council, who are also the last resort in civil causes. The Company have two chaplains, who officiate by turns, and have each 100l. a-year, besides the advantages of trade. They never attempt to make proselytes, but leave that to the Popish millionaries. The salaries of the Company's writers are very small: but, if they have any fortune of their own, they may make it up by trade; which must generally be the case, for they commonly grow rich.

It lies to the south of Lake Champlain, and its waters lie about 100 feet higher. It abounds with fishes of a superior quality, such as the Oswego bass, and speckled trouts of considerable magnitude. The French at one period called it Lake Sacramento, as they were at the trouble to bring from it their water for sacramental purposes, to the churches they had planted in Canada.","sp":315,"ep":331},{"h":"GEORGETOWN","t":"the name of several towns in America, such, for instance, as Georgetown in Maryland, about 65 miles S.W. of Philadelphia; Georgetown in the county of Lincoln, and district of Maine, lying on both sides of Kennebec river, 148 miles S.W. of Philadelphia, where the Roman Catholics have a very flourishing college: it is the name of a village in Fayette county, Pennsylvania, where a number of boats are annually built; and of a post town in the district of the same name, where the Episcopalians, Baptists, and Methodists, have each a place of worship, although the number of houses in it does not much exceed 300, which are constructed chiefly of wood.

About the etymon of the name of this country, authors are not agreed. The most probable opinion is, that it is a corruption by softening of Kurgia, from the river Kur; whence also it is supposed that the inhabitants are called by the Persians indifferently Gurgi and Kurgi; and the country Kurgialan and Gurgialan. It is divided by a ridge of mountains into eastern and western; the former of which is again subdivided into the kingdoms of Caket, Carduel or Carthuel, and Goguetin; and the latter into the provinces of Abcassia, Mireta or Imeretia, and Guriel. Another division is into Georgia Proper, Abcassia, and Mingrelia. A third division will be afterwards mentioned.\n\n\"Georgia (says Sir George Chardin) is as fertile a country as can be seen; the bread is as good here as in any part of the world; the fruit of an exquisite flavour, and of different sorts: no place in Europe yields better pears and apples, and no place in Asia better pomegranates. The country abounds with cattle, venison, and wild fowl, of all sorts; the river Kur is well stocked with fish; and the wine is so rich, that the king of Persia has always some of it for his own table. The inhabitants are robust, valiant and of a jovial temper; great lovers of wine, and esteemed very truthful and faithful; endowed with good natural parts, but, for want of education, very vicious. The women are generally so fair and comely, that the wives and concubines of the king of Persia and his court are for the most part Georgian women. Nature has adorned them with graces nowhere else to be met with: it is impossible to see them without loving them; they are of a good size, clean limbed, and well shaped. Another traveller, however, of no mean character, thus expresses himself with respect to the women: 'As to the Georgian women, they did not at all surprise us; for we expected to find them perfect beauties. They are, indeed, no way disagreeable; and may be counted beauties, if compared with the Curdes. They have an air of health that is pleasing enough; but, after all, they are neither so handsome nor so well shaped as is reported. Those who live in the towns have nothing extraordinary more than the others; so that I may, I think, venture to contradict the accounts that have been given of them by most travellers.'\n\nThis country formerly abounded with great cities, as appears not only from its history, but from the ruins of many of them still visible, which show that they must have been very large, opulent, and magnificently built. These were all destroyed by the inundations of northern barbarians from Mount Caucasus, as the Alans, Huns, Suevi, and some others, so much noted in history for their strength, courage, and conquests.\n\nThe latest division of this country is into nine provinces; five of which are subject to the famous prince Heraclius, forming what is commonly called the kingdom of Georgia; and four are under the dominion of David, composing the kingdom or principality of Imeretia. See Imeretia.\n\nThis whole country is so extremely beautiful, that some fanciful travellers have imagined they had here found the situation of the original garden of Eden. The hills are covered with forests of oak, ash, beech, chestnuts, walnuts, and elms, encircled with vines, growing perfectly wild, but producing vast quantities of grapes. From these is annually made as much wine as is necessary for the yearly consumption; the remainder is left to rot on the vines. Cotton grows spontaneously, as well as the finest European fruit trees. Rice, wheat, millet, hemp, and flax, are raised on the plains, almost without culture. The valleys afford the finest pasturage in the world; the rivers are full of fish; the mountains abound in minerals, and the climate is delicious; so that nature appears to have lavished on this favourite country every production that can contribute to the happiness of its inhabitants.\n\nOn the other hand, the rivers of Georgia, being fed by mountain torrents, are at all seasons either too rapid or too shallow for the purposes of navigation: the Black sea, by which commerce and civilization might be introduced from Europe, has been till very lately in the exclusive possession of the Turks: the trade of Georgia by land is greatly obstructed by the high mountains of Caucasus; and this obstacle is still increased by the swarms of predatory nations, by which those mountains are inhabited.\n\nIt is said, that in the 15th century, a king of Georgia divided among his five sons the provinces of Carduel and Caket, Imeretia, Mingrelia, Guriel, and Abcassia. These petty princes were too jealous to unite for their common defence, and too weak singly to resist a foreign enemy, or even to check the encroachments of their great vassals, who soon became independent. By forming a party among these nobles, the Turks gradually gained possession of all the western provinces, while the Persians occupied the governments of Carduel and Caket. Since that period the many unsuccessful attempts of the Georgians to recover their liberty have repeatedly produced the devastation of their country. Abbas the Great is said to have carried off in one expedition from the provinces of...\nof Carduel and Caket no less than 80,000 families; a number which, probably, exceeds the whole actual population of those provinces. The most horrible cruelties were again exercised on the unhappy people, at the beginning of the present century, by the merciless Nadir; but these were trifling evils, compared with those arising from the internal dissensions of the great barons. This numerous body of men, idle, arrogant, and ferocious, possessed of an unlimited power over the lives and properties of their vassals, having no employment but that of arms, and no hopes of aggrandizing themselves but by the plunder of their rivals, were constantly in a state of warfare; and as their success was various, and the peasants of the vanquished were constantly carried off and sold to the Turks or Persians, every expedition increased the depopulation of the country. At length they invited the neighbouring mountaineers, by the hopes of plunder, to take part in their quarrels; and these dangerous allies, becoming acquainted with the country, and being spectators of the weakness of its inhabitants, soon completed its desolation. A few squaid wretches, half naked, half starved, and driven to despair by the merciless exactions of their landlords, are thinly dispersed over the most beautiful provinces of Georgia. The revolutions of Persia, and the weakness of the Turks, have indeed enabled the princes of the country to recover their independence; but the smallness of their revenue has hitherto disabled them from repelling effectually the tyranny of the nobles, and relieving the burdens of the peasants.\n\nThe capital of Georgia is Teflis, where Prince Heraclius resides (See Teflis.) Of this prince, so celebrated for his exploits and success in shaking off the Ottoman yoke, we have the following account by the late Professor Guldenstaedt when he travelled into these parts in 1770. \"Heraclius, or, as he is called, the Tzar Iracli, is above 60 years old, of a middle size, with a long countenance, a dark complexion, large eyes, and a small beard. He passed his youth at the court and in the army of the celebrated Nadir Shah, where he contracted a fondness for Persian customs and manners, which he has introduced into his kingdom. He has seven sons and six daughters. He is much revered and dreaded by the Persian khans and his neighbours; and is usually chosen to mediate between them in their disputes with each other. When they are at war, he supports one of the parties with a few troops, who diffuse a spirit and courage among the rest, because the Georgian soldiers are esteemed the bravest of those parts; and Prince Heraclius himself is renowned for his courage and military skill. When on horseback he has always a pair of loaded pistols at his girdle, and, if the enemy is near, a musket flung over his shoulder. In all engagements he is the foremost to give examples of personal bravery; and frequently charges the enemy at the head of his troops with the sabre in his hand. He loves pomp and expense; he has adopted the dress of Persia; and regulates his court after the manner of that country. From the example of the Russian troops, who were quartered in Georgia during the last Turkish war, he has learnt the use of plates, knives, and forks, dishes and household furniture, &c.\"\n\nThe subjects of Heraclius are estimated at about 60,000 families; but this, notwithstanding the present defoliated state of the country, is probably an underestimation. The peasants belonging to the queen, and those of the patriarch, pay no tax to the prince, and therefore do not appear on the books of the revenue officers. Many similar exemptions have likewise been granted by the prince to his sons-in-law, and his favourites. Besides, as the impost on the peasants is not a poll-tax, but a tax on hearths, the inhabitants of a village, on the approach of the collectors, frequently carry the furniture of several huts into one, and destroy the remainder, which are afterwards very easily replaced. It is probable, therefore, that the population of Georgia does not fall short of 350,000 souls. The revenues may be estimated at about 150,000 rubles, or 26,250l. They consist of, 1. The customs, farmed at 1750l.\u20142. Rent paid by the farmers of the mint, at Teflis, 1750l.\u20143. The tribute paid by the khans of Erivan and Ganisha, 7000l.\u2014and, 4. The hearth money levied on the peasants, amounting to 15,750l. The common coins here are the abasies, of about 1\u00bdd. value, and a small copper coin, stamped at the mint at Teflis. Besides these, a large quantity of gold and silver money is brought into the country from Persia and Turkey, in exchange for honey, butter, cattle, and blue linens.\n\nThe government of Georgia is despotic; but, were it not for the affluence of the Russian troops, the prince would be frequently unable to carry his decrees into execution. The punishments in criminal cases are shockingly cruel; fortunately they are not frequent, because it is seldom difficult to escape into some of the neighbouring countries, and because the prince is more enriched by confiscating the property of the criminal, than by putting him to torture. Judicial combats are considered as the privilege of nobility, and take place when the cause is extremely intricate, or when the power and interest of two claimants are so equal, that neither can force a decision of the court in his favour. This mode of trial is called an appeal to the judgment of God.\n\nThe dress of the Georgians nearly resembles that of the Cossacks; but men of rank frequently wear the habit of Persia. They usually dye their hair, beard, and nails with red. The Georgian women employ the same colour to stain the palms of their hands. On their heads they wear a cap or fillet, under which their black hair falls on their forehead; behind, it is braided into several tresses. Their eyebrows are painted with black, in such a manner as to form one entire line, and their faces are perfectly coated with white and red. Their robe is open to the girdle, so that they are reduced to conceal their breasts with their hands. Their air and manner are extremely voluptuous. Being generally educated in convents, they can all read and write; a qualification which is very unusual among the men, even of the highest rank. Girls are betrothed as soon as possible, often at three or four years of age. In the streets the women of rank are always veiled, and then it is indecent in any man to accost them. It is likewise uncivil in conversation to inquire after the wives of any of the company. These, however, are not ancient customs, but are a consequence of the violences committed by the Persians, under Shah Nadir.\n\nTravellers\nTravellers accuse the Georgians of drunkenness, superstition, cruelty, sloth, avarice, and cowardice; vices which are everywhere common to slaves and tyrants, and are by no means peculiar to the natives of this country. The descendants of the colonists, carried off by Shah Abbas, and settled at Peria, near Isfahan, and in Masandaran, have changed their character with their government; and the Georgian troops, employed in Persia against the Afghans, were advantageously distinguished by their docility, their discipline, and their courage.\n\nThe other inhabitants of Georgia are Tartars, Offi, and Armenians, called in the Georgian language Somakhi. These last are found all over Georgia, sometimes mixed with the natives, and sometimes in villages of their own. They speak among themselves their own language, but all understand and can talk the Georgian. Their religion is partly the Armenian, and partly the Roman Catholic. They are the most oppressed of the inhabitants, but are still distinguished by that instinctive industry which everywhere characterizes the nation.\n\nBesides these, there are in Georgia considerable numbers of Jews, called, in the language of the country, Urias. Some have villages of their own; and others are mixed with the Georgian, Armenian, and Tartar inhabitants, but never with the Offi. They pay a small tribute above that of the natives.\n\nGeorgia, one of the United States of America, lying between South Carolina and Florida. It extends 120 miles upon the sea-coast, and 300 miles from thence to the Appalachian mountains, and its boundaries to the north and south are the rivers Savannah and Altamaha. The whole coast is bordered with islands; the principal of which are Skidaway, Wassaw, O'fallon, St Catherine's, Sapelo, Frederica, Jekyll, Cumberland, and Amelia.\n\nThe settlement of a colony between the rivers Savannah and Altamaha was meditated in England in 1732, for the accommodation of poor people in Great Britain and Ireland, and for the further security of Carolina. Private compassion and public spirit conspired to promote the benevolent design. Humane and opulent men suggested a plan of transporting a number of indigent families to this part of America free of expense. For this purpose they applied to the king, George II, and obtained from him letters patent, bearing date June 9, 1732, for legally carrying into execution what they had generously projected. They called the new province Georgia, in honour of the king, who encouraged the plan. A corporation, consisting of 21 persons, was constituted by the name of, The Trustees for settling and establishing the colony of Georgia.\n\nIn November 1732, 116 settlers embarked for Georgia to be conveyed thither free of expense, furnished with everything requisite for building and for cultivating the soil. Mr James Oglethorpe, one of the trustees, and an active promoter of the settlement, embarked as the head and director of these settlers. They arrived at Charleston early in the next year. Mr Oglethorpe, accompanied by William Bull, shortly after his arrival, visited Georgia; and after surveying the country, marked the spot on which Savannah now stands, as the site to begin their settlement. Here they accordingly began and built a small fort, and a number of small huts for their defence and accommodation. Such of the settlers as were able to bear arms were embodied, and well appointed with officers, arms, and ammunition. A treaty of friendship was concluded between the settlers and their neighbours the Creek Indians, and every thing wore the aspect of peace and future prosperity. But the fundamental regulations established by the trustees of Georgia were ill adapted to the circumstances and situation of the poor settlers, and of pernicious consequences to the prosperity of the province. Yet although the trustees were greatly mistaken with respect to their plan of settlement, it must be acknowledged their views were generous. Like other distant legislators, who framed their regulations upon principles of speculation, they were liable to many errors and mistakes; and however good their design, their rules were found improper and impracticable. These injudicious regulations and restrictions, the wars in which they were involved with the Spaniards and Indians, and the frequent insurrections among themselves, threw the colony into a state of confusion and wretchedness too great for human nature long to endure. Their oppressed situation was represented to the trustees by repeated complaints; till at length finding that the province languished under their care, and weary with the complaints of the people, they in the year 1752 surrendered their charter to the king, and it was made a royal government.\n\nIn the year 1742, the Rev. George Whitefield founded an orphan house academy in Georgia about 12 miles from Savannah. Mr Whitefield died at Newburyport, in New England, in October 1770, in the 56th year of his age, and was buried under the Presbyterian church in that place. From the time Georgia became a royal government in 1752 till the peace of Paris in 1763, she struggled under many difficulties, arising from the want of credit and friends, and the frequent molestations of enemies. The good effects of the peace were sensibly felt in the province of Georgia. From this time it began to flourish under the fatherly care of Governor Wright. To form a judgment of the rapid growth of the colony, we need only attend to its exports. In the year 1763, they consisted of 7500 barrels of rice, 9633 pounds of indigo, 1250 bushels of Indian corn, which, together with deer and beaver skins, naval stores, provisions, timber, &c., amounted to no more than 27,021l. sterling. Ten years afterwards, in 1773, they amounted to 121,677l. sterling. The chief articles of export from this state are, rice, tobacco, indigo, fag, lumber of various kinds, naval stores, leather, deer skins, snake-root, myrtle, bees wax, corn, live stock, &c.\n\nDuring the American war, Georgia was overrun by the British troops, and the inhabitants were obliged to flee to the neighbouring states for safety. Since the peace the progress of the population of this state is said to have been astonishingly rapid; though it has been a good deal checked within these few years by the hostile irruptions of the Creek Indians, who continually harass the frontiers of the state. Treaties have been held, and a cessation of hostilities agreed to, between the parties, but all have hitherto proved ineffectual to the accomplishment of a peace.\n\nThese Indians inhabit the middle parts of the state,\nand are the most numerous tribe of Indians of any within the limits of the United States. Their whole number is 17,280, of which 3,860 are fighting men. Their principal towns lie in latitude 32\u00b0 and longitude 119\u00b0 25' from Philadelphia. They are settled in a hilly but not mountainous country. The soil is fruitful in a high degree, and well watered, abounding in creeks and rivulets, whence they are called the Creek Indians. The Seminoles, a division of the Creek nation inhabit a level flat country on the Apalachicola and Flint rivers, fertile and well watered. The Chactaws or Flatheads inhabit a very fine and extensive tract of hilly country, with large and fertile plains intervening, between the Alabama and Mississippi rivers, in the western part of this state. This nation have 43 towns and villages, in three divisions, containing 12,123 souls, of which 4,041 are fighting men. The Chickasaws are settled on the head branches of the Tombeckbe, Mobile, and Yazoo rivers, in the north-west corner of the state. Their country is an extensive plain, tolerably well watered from springs, and of a pretty good soil. They have 7 towns, the central one of which is in latitude 34\u00b0 23', and longitude 14\u00b0 30' west. The number of souls in this nation, have been reckoned at 17,25, of which 575 are fighting men.\n\nThat part of Georgia which has been laid out in counties is divided into the following, viz. Chatham, Effingham, Burke, Richmond, Wilkes, Liberty, Glynn, Camden, Washington, Greene, Franklin; and the chief towns are, Savannah, Ebenezer, Waynborough and Louiville, Augusta, Washington, Sunbury, Brunswick, St Patrick's, Golphinton, Greenburg.\u2014Savannah was formerly the capital, and is still the largest town (see SAVANNAH). But the present seat of government in this state is Augusta, situated on the south-west bank of Savannah river, about 134 miles from the sea, and 117 north-west of Savannah. The town, which contains not far from 200 houses, is on a fine large plain; and as it enjoys the best soil, and the advantage of a central situation between the upper and lower countries, is rising fast into importance. Louiville, however, is designed as the future seat of government in this state. It has lately been laid out on the bank of Ogeechee river, about 70 miles from its mouth, but is not yet built.\n\nSavannah river forms a part of the divisional line which separates this state from South Carolina. It is formed principally of two branches, by the names of Tugalo and Keowee, which spring from the mountains. Ogeechee river, about 18 miles south of the Savannah, is a smaller river, and nearly parallel with it in its course. Altamaha, about 60 miles south of Savannah river, is formed by the junction of the Okonee and Okemulgee branches. It is a noble river, but of difficult entrance. Like the Nile, it discharges itself by several mouths into the sea. Besides these, there is Turtle river, Little Sitilla, Great Sitilla, Crooked river, and St Mary's, which form a part of the southern boundary of the United States. The rivers in the middle and western parts of this state are the Apalachicola, which is formed by the Chattahoochee and Flint rivers, Mobile, Pacagoula, and Pearl rivers. All these running southwardly, empty into the gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn the grand convention at Philadelphia in 1787, Georgia, the inhabitants of this state were reckoned at 90,000, including three-fifths of 20,000 negroes. But from the number of the militia, which has been ascertained with a considerable degree of accuracy, there cannot be at most more than half that number. No general character will apply to the inhabitants at large. Collected from different parts of the world, as interest, necessity, or inclination led them, their character and manners must of course partake of all the varieties which distinguish the several states and kingdoms from whence they came. There is so little uniformity, that it is difficult to trace any governing principles among them. An aversion to labour is too predominant, owing in part to the relaxing heat of the climate, and partly to the want of necessity to excite industry. An open and friendly hospitality, particularly to strangers, is an ornamental characteristic of a great part of this people.\n\nIn regard to religion, politics, and literature, this state is yet in its infancy. In Savannah is an Episcopal church, a Presbyterian church, a synagogue, and a German Lutheran church, supplied occasionally by a German minister from Ebenezer, where there is a large convenient stone church, and a settlement of sober industrious Germans of the Lutheran religion. In Augusta they have an Episcopal church. In Midway is a society of Christians established on the congregational plan. Their ancestors emigrated in a colony from Dorchester, near Boston, about the year 1700, and settled at a place named Dorchester, about 20 miles south-west of Charlestown, South Carolina. In 1752, for the sake of a better climate and more land, almost the whole society removed and settled at Midway.\u2014They, as a people, retain in a great measure that simplicity of manners, that unaffected piety and brotherly love, which characterized their ancestors, the first settlers of New England. The upper counties are supplied pretty generally by Baptist and Methodist ministers; but the greater part of the state is without ministers of any denomination.\n\nThe numerous defects in the late constitution of this state, induced the citizens pretty universally to petition for a revision of it. It was accordingly revised, or rather a new one was formed, in the course of the year 1789, nearly upon the plan of the constitution of the United States, which has lately been adopted by the state.\n\nThe charter containing the present system of education in this state was passed in the year 1785. A college, with ample and liberal endowments, is instituted in Louiville, a high and healthy part of the country, near the centre of the state. There is also provision made for the institution of an academy in each county in the state, to be supported from the same funds, and considered as parts and members of the same institution, under the general superintendence and direction of a president and board of trustees, appointed for their literary accomplishments from the different parts of the state, and invested with the customary powers of corporations. The institution thus composed is denominated the university of Georgia.\u2014The funds for the support of this institution are principally in lands, amounting in the whole to about 50,000 acres, a great part of which is of the best quality,","sp":331,"ep":334},{"h":"GERARD","t":"Jonn, a surgeon in London, and the greatest botanist of his time, was many years chief gardener to Lord Burleigh; who was himself a great lover of plants, and had the best collection of any nobleman in the kingdom, among which were a great number of exotics introduced by Gerard.

Its name, according to the most probable conjecture, is derived from the Celtic words Ghar man, signifying a warlike man, to which their other name, Allman, or Aleman, likewise alludes.\n\nThe ancient history of the Germans is altogether wrapped up in obscurity; nor do we, for many ages, know anything more of them than what may be learned from the history of their wars with the Romans. The first time we find them mentioned by the Roman historians, is about the year 211 B.C., at which time Marcellus subdued Insubria and Liguria, and defeated the Gaetatae, a German nation situated on the banks of the Rhine. From this time history is silent with regard to any of these northern nations, till the irruption of the Cimbri and Teutones, who inhabited the most northerly parts of Germany. The event of their enterprise is related under the articles AMBRONES, CIMBRI, and TEUTONES. We must not, however, imagine, because these people happened to invade Italy at the same time, that therefore their countries were contiguous to one another. The Cimbri and Teutones only dwelt beyond the Rhine; while the Ambrones inhabited the country between Switzerland and Provence. It is indeed very difficult to fix the limits of the country called Germany by the Romans. The southern Germans were intermixed with the Gauls, and the northern ones with the Scythians; and thus the ancient history of the Germans includes that of the Dacians, Huns, Goths, &c., till the destruction of the western Roman empire by them. Ancient Germany, therefore, we may reckon to have included the northern part of France, the Netherlands, Holland, Germany so called at present, Denmark, Prussia, Poland, Hungary, part of Turkey in Europe, and Muscovy.\n\nThe Romans divided Germany into two regions; Belgic or Lower Germany, which lay to the southward of the Rhine; and Germany Proper, or High Germany. The first lay between the rivers Seine and the Rhine; and in this we find a number of different nations, the most remarkable of which were the following:\n\n1. The Ubii, whose territory lay between the Rhine and the Moselle, and whose capital was the city of Cologne.\n2. Next to them were the Tungrici, supposed to be the same whom Caesar calls Eburones and Condruithi; and whose metropolis, then called Atuatuca, has since been named Tongres.\n3. Higher up from them, and on the other side of the Moselle, were the Treviri, whose capital was Augusta Trevirorum, now Trier.\n4. Next to them were the Tribocci, Nemetes, and Vangiones. The former dwelt in Alsace, and had Argentoratum, now Strasbourg, for their capital; the others inhabited the cities of Worms, Speyer, and Mentz.\n5. The Mediomatrici were situated along the Moselle, about the city of Metz in Lorraine; and above them were situated another German nation, named Rauricii, Rauraci, or Rauriaci, and who inhabited that part of Helvetia, or Switzerland, about Basle. To the westward and southward of these were the Nervii, Suefiones, Silvaneites, Leuci, Rhemi, Lingones, &c., who inhabited Belgic Gaul.\n\nBetween the heads of the Rhine and Danube was seated the ancient kingdom of Vindelicia, whose capital was called Augusta Vindelicorum, now Augsburg. Below it on the banks of the Danube were the kingdoms of Noricum and Pannonia. The first of these was divided into Noricum Ripense and Mediterraneum. It contained a great part of the provinces of Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol, Bavaria, and some others of less note. The latter contained the kingdom of Hungary, divided into Upper and Lower; and extending from Illyricum to the Danube, and the mountains Caeti in the neighbourhood of Vindebona, now Vienna.\n\nUpper or High Germany lay beyond the Rhine and the Danube. Between the Rhine and the Elbe were the following nations:\n1. The Chauci, Upper and Lower; who were divided from each other by the river Vlurges, now the Weser. Their country contained what is now called Bremen, Lunenburg, Friedland, and Groningen. The Upper Chauci had the Cherucii, and the lower the Chamavi on the south-east, and the German ocean on the north-west.\n2. The Frisii, Upper and Lower, were divided from the Lower Chauci by the river Amisia, now the Ems; and from one another by an arm of the Rhine. Their country still retains the name of Friesland, and is divided into east and west; but the latter is now dismembered from Germany, and become one of the Seven United Provinces.\n3. Beyond the Isela, now the Ijssel, which bounded the country of the Frisii, were situated the Bructeri, who inhabited that tract now called Broekmolen; and the Marsi, about the river Luppe. On the other side of that river were the Ulpiae or Ulpites; but these were famed for often changing their territories, and therefore found in other places.\n4. Next to these were the Juvenes, or inhabitants of Juliers, between the Maece and the Rhine.\n5. The Catti, another ancient and warlike nation, inhabited Hesse and Thuringia, from the Harzian mountains to the Rhine and Weser; among whom were comprehended the Mattiaci, whose capital is by some thought to be Marburg, by others Baden.\n6. Next to these were the Seduli bordering upon Suabia; the Norici, or the ancient inhabitants of Northgau, whose capital was Nuremberg; and the Marcomanni, whose country anciently reached from the Rhine to the head of the Danube, and to the Neckar. The Marcomanni afterwards went and settled in Bohemia and Moravia, under their general or king Marobodus; and some of them in Gaul, whence they drove the Boii, who had seated themselves there.\n7. On the other side of the Danube, and between the Rhine and it, were the Hermunduri, who possessed the country now called Mysnia in Upper Saxony; though some make their territories to have extended much farther, and to have reached quite to, or even beyond, the kingdom of Bohemia, once the seat of the Boii, whence its name.\n8. Beyond them, on the north of the Danube, was another seat of the Marcomanni along the river Albis, or Elbe.\n9. Next to Bohemia were situated the Quadi, whose territories extended from the Danube to Moravia, and the northern part of Austria. These are comprehended under the ancient name of Suevi; part of whom at length forced their way into Spain, and settled a kingdom there.\n10. Eastward of the Quadi were situated the Bastarnae, and parted from them by the Granna, now Gran; a river that falls into the Danube, and by the Carpathian mountains, from them called Alpes Bastarnicae. The country of the Bastarnae indeed\nGermany, indeed made part of the European Sarmatia, and so was without the limits of Germany properly so called; but we find these people so often in league with the German nations, and joining them for the destruction of the Romans, that we cannot but account them as one people.\n\nBetween those nations already taken notice of, seated also on the other side of the Danube and the Hercynian forest, were several others whose exact situation is uncertain, viz. the Martingi, Burii, Borades, Lygii or Logiones, and some others, who are placed by our geographers along the forest above mentioned, between the Danube and the Vistula.\n\nOn this side the Hercynian forest, were the famed Rhaetii, now Grifones, seated among the Alps. Their country, which was also called Western Illyricum, was divided into Rhaetia Prima or Propria and Secunda; and was then of much larger extent, spreading itself towards Swabia, Bavaria, and Austria.\n\nOn the other side of the Hercynian forest were,\n\n1. The Suevi, who spread themselves from the Vistula to the river Elbe.\n2. The Longobardi, so called according to some on account of their wearing long beards, but, according to others, on account of their consisting of two nations, viz. the Bardi and Lingones. These dwelt along the river Elbe, and bordered southward on the Chauci above mentioned.\n3. The Burgundi, of whose original seat we are uncertain.\n4. The Semnones; who, about the time of Tiberius, were seated on the river Elbe.\n5. The Angles, Saxons, and Goths, were probably the descendants of the Cimbri; and inhabited the countries of Denmark, along the Baltic sea, and the peninsula of Scandinavia, containing Norway, Sweden, Lapland, and Finnmark.\n6. The Vandals were a Gothic nation, who, proceeding from Scandinavia, settled in the countries now called Mecklenburg and Brandenburg.\n7. Of the same race were the Dacians, who settled themselves in the neighbourhood of the Palus Maeoticus, and extended their territories along the banks of the Danube.\n\nThese were the names of the German nations who performed the most remarkable exploits in their wars with the Romans. Besides these, however, we find mention made of the Scordisci, a Thracian nation, who afterwards settled on the banks of the Danube. About the year 113 B.C. they ravaged Macedon, and cut off a whole Roman army sent against them; the general, M. Porcius Cato, grandson to Cato the censor, being the only person who had the good fortune to make his escape. After this, they ravaged all Thrace; and advanced to the coasts of the Adriatic, into which, because it stopped their farther progress, they discharged a shower of darts. By another Roman general, however, they were driven back into their own country with great slaughter; and soon after, Metellus so weakened them by repeated defeats, that they were incapable, for some time, of making any more attempts on the Roman provinces. At last, in the consulship of M. Livius Drusus and L. Calpurnius Piso, the former prevailed on them to pass the Danube, which thenceforth became the boundary between the Romans and them. Notwithstanding this, in the time of the Jugotheine war, the Scordisci repassed the Danube on the ice every winter, and being joined by the Triballi a people of Lower Moesia, and the Daci of Upper Moesia, penetrated as far as Macedon, committing everywhere dreadful ravages. So early did these northern nations begin to be formidable to the Romans, even when they were most renowned for warlike exploits.\n\nTill the time of Julius Caesar, however, we hear nothing more concerning the Germans. About 58 years B.C., he undertook his expedition into Gaul; during which, his assistance was implored by the Aedui, against Ariovitus, a German prince who oppressed them. Caesar, pleased with this opportunity of increasing his power, invited Ariovitus to an interview; but this being declined, he next sent deputies, desiring him to restore the hostages he had taken from the Aedui, and to bring no more troops over the Rhine into Gaul. To this a haughty answer was returned; and a battle soon after ensued, in which Ariovitus was entirely defeated, and with great difficulty made his escape.\n\nIn 55 B.C., Caesar having subdued the Sueiones, Bellovaci, Ambiani, Nervii, and other nations of Belgic Gaul, hastened to oppose the Usipetes and Tenchtheri. These nations having been driven out of their own country by the Suevi, had crossed the Rhine with a design to settle in Gaul. As soon as he appeared, the Germans sent him a deputation, offering to join him, provided he would assign them lands. Caesar replied, that there was no room in Gaul for them; but he would desire the Ubii to give them leave to settle among them. Upon this, they desired him to retreat with the Ubii; but in the mean time fell upon some Roman squadrons; which so provoked Caesar, that he immediately marched against them, and coming unexpectedly upon them, defeated them with great slaughter. They fled in the utmost confusion; but the Romans pursued them to the confluence of the Rhine and the Maese, where the slaughter was renewed with such fury, that almost 400,000 of the Germans perished. After this, Caesar being resolved to spread the terror of the Roman name through Germany, built a bridge over the Rhine, and entered that country. In this expedition, however, which was his last in Germany, he performed no remarkable exploit. A little before his death, indeed, he had projected the conquest of that, as well as of a great many other countries; but his ill-health prevented the execution of his designs. Nor is there anything recorded of the Germans till about 17 B.C., when the Tenchtheri made an irruption into Gaul, and defeated M. Lollius, proconsul of that province. At last, however, they were repulsed, and forced to retire with great loss beyond the Rhine.\n\nSoon after this the Rh\u00e6tii invaded Italy, where they committed the greatest devastations, putting all the males they met to the sword, without distinction of age: nay, we are told, that when they happened to take women with child, they consulted their augurs to know whether the child was a male or female; and if they pronounced it a male, the mother was immediately massacred. Against these barbarians was sent Drusus, the second son of Livia, a youth of extraordinary valour and great accomplishments. He found means to bring them to a battle; in which the Romans proved victorious, and cut in pieces great numbers of their enemies, with very little loss on their own.\nGermany. own side. Those who escaped the general slaughter, being joined by the Vindelici, took their route towards Gaul, with a design to invade that province. But Augustus, upon the first notice of their march, despatched against them Tiberius with several chosen legions. He was no less successful than Drusus had been; for having transported his troops over the lake Brigantium, now Constance, he fell unexpectedly on the enemy, gave them a total overthrow, took most of their strong holds, and obliged the whole nation to submit to such terms as he chose to impose upon them.\n\nThus were the Vindelici, the Rhaetii, and Norici, three of the most barbarous nations in Germany subdued, Tiberius, to keep the conquered countries in awe, planted two colonies in Vindelicum, and opened from thence a road into Rhaetia and Noricum. One of the cities which he built for the defence of his colonies, he called, from his father Drusus, Drususonagus; the other by the name of Augustus, Augusta Vindelicorum; which cities are now known by the names of M\u00fcnchingen and Augsburg. He next encountered the Pannonians, who had been subdued by Agrippa, but revolted on hearing the news of that great commander's death, which happened 11 years B.C. Tiberius, however, with the affluence of their neighbours the Scordisci, soon forced them to submit. They delivered up their arms, gave hostages, and put the Romans in possession of all their towns and strong holds, Tiberius spared their lives; but laid waste their fields, plundered their cities, and sent the best part of their youth into other countries.\n\nIn the mean time, Drusus having prevented the Gauls from revolting, which they were ready to do, prepared to oppose the Germans who dwelt beyond the Rhine. They had collected the most numerous and formidable army that had ever been seen in those parts; with which they were advancing towards the Rhine, in order to invade Gaul. Drusus defeated them as they attempted to cross that river; and, pursuing the advantage he had gained, entered the country of the Ubii, now Remichausen, and from thence advanced against the Sicambri in the neighbourhood of the Lyppe and Yssel. Them he overthrew in a great battle, laid waste their country, burnt most of their cities, and following the course of the Rhine, approached the German ocean, reducing the Frisii and the Chauci between the Ems and the Elbe. In these marches the troops suffered extremely for want of provisions; and Drusus himself was often in great danger of being drowned, as the Romans who attended him were at that time quite unacquainted with the flux and reflux of the ocean.\n\nThe Roman forces went into East Friesland for their winter quarters; and next year (10 B.C.) Drusus marched against the Tenchtheri, whom he easily subdued. Afterwards, passing the Lupias, now the Lyppe, he reduced the Catti and Cherufci, extending his conquests to the banks of the Vifurgis or Weller; which he would have passed, had he not been in want of provisions, the enemy having laid waste the country to a considerable distance. As he was retiring, the Germans unexpectedly fell upon him in a narrow passage; and having surrounded the Roman army, cut a great many of them in pieces. But Drusus having animated his men by his example, after a bloody conflict, which lasted the whole day, the Germans were defeated with such slaughter, that the ground was strewed for several miles with dead bodies. Drusus found in their camp a great quantity of iron chains which they had brought for the Romans; and so great was their confidence, that they had agreed beforehand about the division of the booty. The Tenchtheri were to have the horses, the Cherufci and Sicambri the baggage, and the Ubii the captives. After this victory, Drusus built two forts to keep the conquered countries in awe; the one at the confluence of the Lyppe and the Alme, the other in the country of the Catti on the Rhine. On this occasion also he made a famous canal, long afterwards called in honour of him Foja Drusiana, to convey the waters of the Rhine into the Sala or Sale. It extended eight miles; and was very convenient for conveying the Roman troops by water to the countries of the Frisii and Chauci, which was the design of the undertaking.\n\nThe following year (9 B.C.) Augustus, bent on subduing the whole of Germany, advanced to the banks of the Rhine, attended by his two sons-in-law Tiberius and Drusus. The former he sent against the Daci, who lived up to the south of the Danube; and the latter to complete the conquest he had so successfully begun in the western parts of Germany. The former easily overcame the Daci, and transplanted 40,000 of them into Gaul. The latter, having passed the Rhine, subdued all the nations from that river to the Elbe; but having attempted in vain to cross this last, he set out for Rome; an end, however, was put to his conquests and his life by a violent fever, with which he was seized on his return.\n\nAfter the death of Drusus, Tiberius again overran all those countries in which Drusus had spent the preceding summer; and struck some of the northern nations with such terror, that they sent deputies to sue for peace. This, however, they could not obtain upon any terms; the emperor declaring that he would not conclude a peace with one, unless they all desired it. But the Catti, or according to some the Sicambri, could not by any means be prevailed upon to submit; so that the war was still carried on, though in a languid manner, for about 18 years. During this period, some of the German nations had quitted their forests, and begun to live in a civilized manner under the protection of the Romans; but one Quinctilius Varus being sent to command the Roman forces in that country, so provoked the inhabitants by his extortions, that not only those who still held out refused to submit, but even the nations that had submitted were seized with an eager desire of throwing off the yoke. Among them was a young nobleman of extraordinary parts and valour, named Arminius. He was the son of Si-Arminius giner, one of the most powerful lords among the heads the Catti, had served with great reputation in the Roman armies, and been honoured by Augustus with the privileges of a Roman citizen and the title of knight. But the love of his country prevailing over his gratitude, he resolved to improve the general discontent which reigned among his countrymen, to deliver them from the bondage of a foreign dominion. With this view he engaged, underhand, the leading men of all the nations between the Rhine and the Elbe, in a conspiracy against the Romans. In order to put Varus off\nGermany, off his guard, he at the same time advised him to show himself to the inhabitants of the more distant provinces, administer justice among them, and accustom them, by his example, to live after the Roman manner, which he said would more effectually subdue them than the Roman sword. As Varus was a man of a peaceable temper, and averse from military toils, he readily consented to this injurious proposal, and, leaving the neighbourhood of the Rhine, marched into the country of the Cherufci. Having there spent some time in hearing causes and deciding civil controversies, Arminius persuaded him to weaken his army, by sending out detachments to clear the country of robbers. When this was done, some distant nations of Germany rose up in arms by Arminius's directions; while those through which Varus was to pass in marching against them, pretended to be in a state of profound tranquillity, and ready to join the Romans against their enemies.\n\nOn the first news of the revolt, Varus marched against the enemy with three legions and six cohorts; but being attacked by the Germans as he passed through a wood, his army was almost totally cut off, while he himself and most of his officers fell by their own hands. Such a terrible overthrow, though it raised a general consternation in Rome, did not, however, dishearten Augustus, or cause him to abandon his enterprise. About two years after (A.D. 12), Tiberius and Germanicus were appointed to command in Germany. The death of Augustus, however, which happened soon after, prevented Tiberius from going on his expedition; and Germanicus was for some time hindered from proceeding in his, by a revolt of the legions, first in Pannonia, and then in Germany. About the year 15, Germanicus having brought over the soldiers to their duty, laid a bridge across the Rhine, over which he marched 12,000 legionaries, 26 cohorts of the allies, and eight alae (squadrons of 300 each) of horse. With these he first traversed the C\u00e6sarian forest (part of the Hercynian, and thought to lie partly in the duchy of Cleves, and partly in Westphalia), and some other woods. On his march he was informed that the Marbi were celebrating a festival with great mirth and jollity. Upon this he advanced with such expedition, that he surprised them in the midst of their debauch; and giving his army full liberty to make what havoc they pleased, a terrible massacre ensued, and the country was destroyed with fire and sword for 50 miles round, without the loss of a single man on the part of the Romans.\u2014This general massacre roused the Bructeri, the Tubantes, and the Ubigenes; who, befriending the passes through which the Roman army was to return, fell upon their rear, and put them into some disorder; but the Romans soon recovered themselves, and defeated the Germans with considerable loss.\n\nThe following year (A.D. 16), Germanicus taking advantage of some intestine broils which happened among the Catti, entered their country, where he put great numbers to the sword. Most of their youth, however, escaped by swimming over the Aarana, now the Oder, and attempted to prevent the Romans from laying a bridge over that river; but being disappointed in this, some of them submitted to Germanicus, while the greater part, abandoning their villages, took refuge in the woods; so that the Romans, without opposition, set fire to all their villages, towns, &c., and having laid their capital in ashes, began their march back to the Rhine.\n\nGermanicus had scarcely reached his camp, when he received a message from Segestes, a German prince, in the interest of the Romans, acquainting him that he was besieged in his camp by Arminius. On this advice, he instantly marched against the besiegers; entirely defeated them; and took a great number of prisoners, among whom was Thuneldis, the wife of Arminius, and daughter of Segestes, whom the former had carried off, and married against her father's will. Arminius then, more enraged than ever, for the loss of his wife, whom he tenderly loved, roused up all the neighbouring nations against the Romans. Germanicus, however, without being dismayed by such a formidable confederacy, prepared himself to oppose the enemy with vigour; but, that he might not be obliged to engage such numerous forces at once, detached his lieutenant Caecina, at the head of 40 cohorts, into the territories of the Bructeri; while his cavalry, under the command of Pedo, entered the country of the Fritii. As for Germanicus himself, he embarked the remainder of his army, consisting of four legions, on a neighbouring lake; and transported them by rivers and canals to the place appointed on the river Ems, where the three bodies met. In their march they found the sad remains of the legions conducted by Varus, which they buried with all the ceremony their circumstances could admit. After this they advanced against Arminius, who retired and posted himself advantageously close to a wood. The Roman general followed him; and coming up with him, ordered his cavalry to advance and attack the enemy. Arminius, at their first approach, pretended to fly; but suddenly wheeled about, and giving the signal to a body of troops, whom he had concealed in the wood, to rush out, obliged the cavalry to give ground. The cohorts then advanced to their relief; but they too were put into disorder, and would have been pushed into a morass, had not Germanicus himself advanced with the rest of the cavalry to their relief. Arminius did not think it prudent to engage these fresh troops, but retired in good order; upon which Germanicus also retired towards the Ems. Here he embarked with four legions, ordered Caecina to reconduct the other four by land, and sent the cavalry to the sea side, with orders to march along the shore to the Rhine. Though Caecina was to return by roads well known, yet Germanicus advised him to pass, with all possible speed, a causeway, called the long bridges, which led across vast marshes, surrounded on all sides with woods and hills that gently rose from the plain.\n\nArminius, however, having got notice of Caecina's march, arrived at the long bridges before Caecina, and filled the woods with his men, who, on the approach of the Romans, rushed out, and attacked them with great fury. The legions, not able to manage their arms in the deep waters and slippery ground, were obliged to yield; and would in all probability have been entirely defeated, had not night put an end to the combat. The Germans, encouraged by their success, instead of refreshing themselves with sleep, spent the whole night in diverting the courses of the springs, which...\nGermany, which rose in the neighbouring mountains; so that, before day, the camp which the Romans had begun was laid under water, and their works were overturned. C\u00e6cina was for some time at a loss what to do; but at last resolved to attack the enemy by daybreak, and, having driven them to their woods, to keep them there in a manner besieged, till the baggage and wounded men should pass the cauleway, and get out of the enemy's reach. But when his army was drawn up, the legions posted on the wings, seized with a sudden panic, deserted their stations, and occupied a field beyond the marshes. C\u00e6cina thought it advisable to follow them; but the baggage stuck in the mire, as he attempted to cross the marshes, which greatly embarrassed the soldiers. Arminius perceiving this, laid hold of the opportunity to begin the attack; and crying out, \"This is a second Varus, the same fate attends him and his legions,\" fell on the Romans with inexplicable fury. As he had ordered his men to aim chiefly at the horses, great numbers of them were killed; and the ground becoming slippery with their blood and the slime of the marsh, the rest either fell or threw their riders, and, galloping through the ranks, put them in disorder. C\u00e6cina distinguished himself in a very eminent manner; but his horse being killed, he would have been taken prisoner, had not the first legion rescued him. The greediness of the enemy, however, saved the Romans from utter destruction; for just as the legions were quite spent, and on the point of yielding, the barbarians on a sudden abandoned them in order to seize their baggage. During this respite, the Romans struggled out of the marsh, and having gained the dry fields, formed a camp with all possible speed, and fortified it in the best manner they could.\n\nThe Germans having lost the opportunity of destroying the Romans, contrary to the advice of Arminius, attacked their camp next morning, but were repulsed with great slaughter; after which they gave C\u00e6cina no more molestation till he reached the banks of the Rhine. Germanicus, in the mean time, having conveyed the legions he had with him down the river Ems into the ocean, in order to return by sea to the river Rhine, and finding that his vessels were overloaded, delivered the second and thirteenth legions to Publius Vitellius, desiring him to conduct them by land. But this march proved fatal to great numbers of them; who were either buried in the quicksands, or swallowed up by the overflowing of the tide, to which they were as yet utter strangers. Those who escaped, lost their arms, utensils, and provisions; and passed a melancholy night upon an eminence, which they had gained by wading up to the chin. The next morning the land returned with the tide of ebb; when Vitellius, by a hasty march, reached the river Ufingis, by some thought to be the Hoerenster, on which the city of Groningen stands. There Germanicus, who had reached that river with his fleet, took the legions again on board, and conveyed them to the mouth of the Rhine, whence they all returned to Cologne, at a time when it was reported they were totally lost.\n\nThis expedition, however, cost the Romans very dear, and procured very few advantages. Great numbers of men had perished; and by far the greatest part of those who had escaped so many dangers returned without arms, utensils, horses, &c., half naked, lamed, Germany, and unfit for service. The next year, however, Germanicus bent on the entire reduction of Germany, made vast preparations for another expedition. Having considered the various accidents that had befallen him during the war, he found that the Germans were chiefly indebted for their safety to their woods and marshes, their short summers and long winters; and that his troops suffered more from their long and tedious marches than from the enemy. For this reason he resolved to enter the country by sea, hoping by that means to begin the campaign earlier, and surprise the enemy. Having therefore built with great dispatch, during the winter, 1000 vessels of different sorts, he ordered them early in the spring (A.D. 16) to fall down the Rhine, and appointed the island of the Batavians for the general rendezvous of his forces. When the fleet was failing, he detached Silius one of his lieutenants, with orders to make a sudden irruption into the country of the Catti; and, in the mean time, he himself, upon receiving intelligence that a Roman fort on the Lupgias was besieged, hastened with six legions to its relief. Silius was prevented, by sudden rains, from doing more than taking some small booty, with the wife and daughter of Arpen king of the Catti; neither did those who besieged the fort wait the arrival of Germanicus. In the mean time, the fleet arriving at the island of the Batavians, the provisions and warlike engines were put on board and sent forward; ships were assigned to the legions and allies; and the whole army being embarked, the fleet entered the canal formerly cut by Drufus, and from his name called Fossa Drufiana. Hence he sailed prosperously to the mouth of the Ems; where, having landed his troops, he marched directly to the Wefer, where he found Arminius encamped on the opposite bank, and determined to dispute his passage. The next day Arminius drew out his troops in order of battle; but Germanicus, not thinking it advisable to attack them, ordered the horse to ford over under the command of his lieutenants Stertinus and Emilius; who, to divide the enemy's forces, crossed the river in two different places. At the same time Cariovalda, the leader of the Batavian auxiliaries, crossed the river where it is most rapid; but being drawn into an ambuscade, he was killed, together with most of the Batavian nobility; and the rest would have been totally cut off, had not Stertinus and Emilius hastened to their assistance. Germanicus in the mean time passed the river without molestation. A battle soon after ensued; in which the Germans were defeated with so great a slaughter that the ground was covered with arms and dead bodies for more than 10 miles round; and among the spoils taken on this occasion, were found, as formerly, the chains with which the Germans had hoped to bind their captives.\n\nIn memory of this signal victory Germanicus raised a mound, upon which he placed as trophies the arms of the enemy, and inscribed underneath the names of the conquered nations. This so provoked the Germans, though already vanquished and determined to abandon their country, that they attacked the Roman army unexpectedly on its march, and put them into some disorder. Being repulsed, they encamped between a river and a large forest surrounded by a marsh except\nGermany, on one side, where it was enclosed by a broad rampart formerly raised by the Angrivarii as a barrier between them and the Cherulci. Here another battle ensued; in which the Germans behaved with great bravery, but in the end were defeated with great slaughter.\n\nAfter this second defeat, the Angrivarii submitted, and were taken under the protection of the Romans, and Germanicus put an end to the campaign. Some of the legions he sent to their winter quarters by land, while he himself embarked with the rest on the river Ems, in order to return by sea. The ocean proved at first very calm, and the wind favourable; but all of a sudden a storm arising, the fleet, consisting of 1000 vessels, was dispersed; some of them were swallowed up by the waves; others were dashed in pieces against the rocks, or driven upon remote and inhospitable islands, where the men either perished by famine, or lived upon the flesh of the dead horses with which the shores soon appeared strewn; for, in order to lighten their vessels, and disengage them from the shoals, they had been obliged to throw overboard their horses and beasts of burden, nay, even their arms and baggage. Most of the men, however, were saved, and even great part of the fleet recovered. Some of them were driven upon the coast of Britain; but the petty kings who reigned there generously sent them back.\n\nOn the news of this misfortune, the Catti, taking new courage, ran to arms; but Caius Silius being detached against them with 30,000 foot and 3000 horse, kept them in awe. Germanicus himself, at the head of a numerous body, made a sudden irruption into the territories of the Marci, where he recovered one of Varus's eagles, and having laid waste the country, he returned to the frontiers of Germany, and put his troops into winter quarters; whence he was soon recalled by Tiberius, and never suffered to return into Germany again.\n\nAfter the departure of Germanicus, the more northern nations of Germany were no more molested by the Romans. Arminius carried on a long and successful war with Marobodus king of the Marcomanni, whom he at last expelled, and forced to apply to the Romans for assistance; but, excepting Germanicus, it seems they had at this time no other general capable of opposing Arminius, so that Marobodus was never restored. After the final departure of the Romans, however, Arminius having attempted to enslave his country, fell by the treachery of his own kindred. The Germans held his memory in great veneration; and Tacitus informs us, that in his time they still celebrated him in their songs.\n\nNothing remarkable occurs in the history of Germany from this time till the reign of the emperor Claudius. A war indeed is said to have been carried on by Lucius Domitius, father to the emperor Nero. But of his exploits we know nothing more than that he penetrated beyond the river Elbe, and led his army farther into the country than any of the Romans had ever done. In the reign of Claudius, however, the German territories were invaded by Cn. Domitius Corbulo, one of the greatest generals of his age. But when he was on the point of forcing them to submit to the Roman yoke, he was recalled by Claudius, who was jealous of the reputation he had acquired.\n\nIn the reign of Vespasian, a terrible revolt happened among the Batavians and those German nations who Germany had submitted to the Romans; a particular account of which is given under the article Rome. The revolting Daci were with difficulty subdued; but, in the reign of Domitian, the Dacians invaded the empire, and proved the Roman a more terrible enemy than any of the other German nations had been. After several defeats, the emperor was at last obliged to consent to pay an annual tribute to Decebalus king of the Dacians; which continued to the time of Trajan. But that warlike prince refused to pay tribute; alleging, when it was demanded of him, that \"he had never been conquered by Decebalus.\" Upon this the Dacians passed the Danube, and began to commit hostilities in the Roman territories. Trajan, glad of this opportunity to humble an enemy whom he began to fear, drew together a mighty army, and marched with the utmost expedition to the banks of the Danube. As Decebalus was not apprised of his arrival, the emperor passed the river without opposition, and entering Dacia, laid waste the country with fire and sword. At last he was met by Decebalus with a numerous army. A bloody engagement ensued, in which the Dacians were defeated; though the victory cost the Romans dear: the wounded were so numerous, that they wanted linen to bind up their wounds; and to supply the defect, the emperor generously devoted his own wardrobe. After the victory, he pursued Decebalus from place to place, and at last obliged him to consent to a peace on the following terms: 1. That he should surrender the territories which he had unjustly taken from the neighbouring nations. 2. That he should deliver up his arms, his warlike engines, with the artificers who made them, and all the Roman deserters. 3. That for the future he should entertain no deserters, nor take into his service the natives of any country subject to Rome. 4. That he should dismantle all his fortresses, castles, and strong holds. And, lastly, That he should have the same friends and foes with the people of Rome.\n\nWith these hard terms Decebalus was obliged to comply, though sore against his will; and being introduced to Trajan, threw himself on the ground before him, acknowledging himself his vassal; after which the latter, having commanded him to send deputies to the senate for the ratification of the peace, returned to Rome.\n\nThis peace was of no long duration. Four years after (A.D. 105.), Decebalus, unable to live in servitude as he called it, began, contrary to the late treaty, to raise men, provide arms, entertain deserters, fortify his castles, and invite the neighbouring nations to join him against the Romans as a common enemy. The Scythians hearkened to his solicitations; but the Jazyges, a neighbouring nation, refusing to bear arms against Rome, Decebalus invaded their country. Hereupon Trajan marched against him; but the Dacian, finding himself unable to withstand him by open force, had recourse to treachery, and attempted to get the emperor murdered. His design, however, proved abortive, and Trajan pursued his march into Dacia. That his troops might the more readily pass and repass the Danube, he built a bridge over that river;* see \u0394\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, which by the ancients is styled the most magnificent and wonderful of all his works*. To guard the bridge, No. 133.\nGermany. he ordered two castles to be built; one on this side the Danube, and the other on the opposite side; and all this was accomplished in the space of one summer. Trajan, however, as the season was now far advanced, did not think it advisable to enter Dacia this year, but contented himself with making the necessary preparations.\n\nIn the year 106, early in the spring, Trajan set out by for Dacia; and having passed the Danube on the bridge he had built, reduced the whole country, and would have taken Decebalus himself, had he not put an end to his own life, in order to avoid falling into the hands of his enemies. After his death the kingdom of Dacia was reduced to a Roman province; and several castles were built in it, and garrisons placed in them, to keep the country in awe.\n\nAfter the death of Trajan, the Roman empire began to decline, and the northern nations to be daily more and more formidable. The province of Dacia indeed was held by the Romans till the reign of Galienus; but Adrian, who succeeded Trajan, caused the arches of the bridge over the Danube to be broken down, lest the barbarians should make themselves masters of it, and invade the Roman territories. In the time of Marcus Aurelius, the Marcomanni and Quadi invaded the empire, and gave the emperor a terrible overthrow. He continued the war, however, with better success afterwards, and invaded their country in his turn. It was during the course of this war that the Roman army is said to have been saved from destruction by that miraculous event related under the article CHRISTIANS, p. 70, col. 2.\n\nIn the end, the Marcomanni and Quadi were, by repeated defeats, brought to the verge of destruction; inasmuch that their country would probably have been reduced to a Roman province, had not Marcus Aurelius been diverted from pursuing his conquests by the revolt of one of his generals. After the death of Marcus Aurelius, the Germanic nations became every day more and more formidable to the Romans. Far from being able to invade and attempt the conquest of these northern countries, the Romans had the greatest difficulty to repel the incursions of their inhabitants. But for a particular account of their various invasions of the Roman empire, and its total destruction by them at last, see the article ROME.\n\nThe immediate destroyers of the Roman empire were the Heruli; who, under their leader Odoacer, deposed Augustulus the last Roman emperor, and proclaimed Odoacer king of Italy. The Heruli were soon expelled by the Ostrogoths; and these in their turn were subdued by Justinian, who reannexed Italy to the eastern empire. But the popes found means to obtain the temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction over a considerable part of the country, while the Lombards subdued the rest. These last proved very troublesome to the popes, and at length besieged Adrian I. in his capital. In this distress he applied to Charles the Great, king of France; who conquered both Italy and Germany, and was crowned emperor of the west in 800.\n\nThe posterity of Charlemagne inherited the empire of Germany until the year 885; at which time the different princes assumed their original independence, rejected the Carolingian line, and placed Arnulf king of Bohemia on the throne. Since this time Germany has ever been considered as an elective monarchy. Princes of different families, according to the prevalence of their interest and arms, have mounted the throne. Of these the most considerable, until the Austrian line acquired the imperial power, were the houses of Saxony, Franconia, and Swabia. The reigns of these emperors contain nothing more remarkable than the contests between them and the popes; for an account of which see the article ITALY. From hence, in the beginning of the 13th century, arose the factions of the Guelphs and Gibellines, of which the former was attached to the popes, and the latter to the emperor; and both, by their virulence and inveteracy, tended to disquiet the empire for several ages. The emperors too were often at war with the infidels; and sometimes, as happens in all elective kingdoms, with one another, about the succession.\n\nBut what more deserves our attention is the progress of government in Germany, which was in some measure opposite to that of the other kingdoms of Europe. When the empire raised by Charlemagne fell asunder, all the different independent princes assumed the right of election; and those now distinguished by the name of electors had no peculiar or legal influence in appointing a successor to the imperial throne; they were only the officers of the king's household, his secretary, his steward, chaplain, marshal, or master of his horse, &c. By degrees, however, as they lived near the king's person, and had, like all other princes, independent territories belonging to them, they increased their influence and authority; and in the reign of Otho III. 984, acquired the sole right of electing the emperor. Thus, while in the other kingdoms of Europe, the dignity of the great lords, who were all originally allodial or independent barons, was diminished by the power of the king, as in France, and by the influence of the people, as in Great Britain; in Germany, on the other hand, the power of the electors was raised upon the ruins of the emperor's supremacy, and of the people's jurisdiction. In 1440, Frederic III. duke of Austria was elected emperor, and the imperial dignity continued in the male line of that family for 300 years. His successor Maximilian married the heiress of Charles duke of Burgundy; whereby Burgundy and the 17 provinces of the Netherlands were annexed to the house of Austria. Charles V., grandson of Maximilian, and heir to the kingdom of Spain, was elected emperor in the year 1519. Under him MEXICO and PERU were conquered by the Spaniards; and in his reign happened the REFORMATION in several parts of Germany; which, however, was not confirmed by public authority till the year 1648, by the treaty of Westphalia, and in the reign of Ferdinand III. The reign of Charles V. was continually disturbed by his wars with the German princes and the French king Francis I. Though successful in the beginning of his reign, his good fortune towards the conclusion of it began to forsake him; which, with other reasons, occasioned his abdication of the crown. See CHARLES V.\n\nHis brother Ferdinand I., who in 1558 succeeded to the throne, proved a moderate prince with regard to religion. He had the address to get his son Maximilian declared king of the Romans in his own lifetime,\nGermany, time, and died in 1564. By his last will he ordered, that if either his own male issue, or that of his brother Charles, should fail, his Aulic estates should revert to his second daughter Anne, wife to the elector of Bavaria, and her issue. We mention this definition, as it gave rise to the late opposition made by the house of Bavaria to the pragmatic sanction, in favour of the empress queen of Hungary, on the death of her father Charles VI. The reign of Maximilian II. was disturbed with internal commotions, and an invasion from the Turks; but he died in peace in 1576. He was succeeded by his son Rodolph; who was involved in wars with the Hungarians, and in differences with his brother Matthias, to whom he ceded Hungary and Austria in his lifetime. He was succeeded in the empire by Matthias; under whom the reformers, who went under the names of Lutherans and Calvinists, were so much divided among themselves, as to threaten the empire with a civil war. The ambition of Matthias at last tended to reconcile them; but the Bohemians revolted, and threw the imperial commissaries out of a window at Prague. This gave rise to a ruinous war, which lasted 32 years. Matthias thought to have exterminated both parties; but they formed a confederacy, called the Evangelic League, which was counterbalanced by a Catholic league.\n\nMatthias dying in 1618, was succeeded by his cousin Ferdinand II.; but the Bohemians offered their crown to Frederic the elector Palatine, the most powerful Protestant prince in Germany, and son-in-law to his Britannic majesty James I. That prince was incalculable enough to accept of the crown; but he lost it, by being entirely defeated by the duke of Bavaria and the imperial generals at the battle of Prague; and he was even deprived of his electorate, the best part of which was given to the duke of Bavaria. The Protestant princes of Germany, however, had among them at this time many able commanders, who were at the head of armies, and continued the war with wonderful obstinacy; among them were the margrave of Baden Durlach, Christian duke of Brunswick, and count Mansfeld; the last was one of the best generals of the age. Christian IV. king of Denmark declared for them; and Richelieu, the French minister, was not fond of seeing the house of Austria aggrandized. The emperor, on the other hand, had excellent generals; and Christian, having put himself at the head of the evangelic league, was defeated by Tilly, an Imperialist of great reputation in war. Ferdinand made no moderate use of his advantages obtained over the Protestants, that they formed a fresh conspiracy at Leipzig, of which the celebrated Gustavus Adolphus king of Sweden was the head. An account of his glorious victories is given under the article Sweden. At last he was killed at the battle of Lutzen in 1632. But the Protestant cause did not die with him. He had brought up a set of heroes, such as the duke of Saxe Weimer, Torstenson, Banier, and others, who shook the Austrian power; till under the mediation of Sweden, a general peace was concluded among all the belligerent powers, at Munster, in the year 1648; which forms the basis of the present political system of Europe.\n\nFerdinand II. was succeeded by his son Ferdinand III. This prince died in 1657; and was succeeded by the emperor Leopold, a severe, unamiable, and not very fortunate prince. He had two great powers to contend with, France on the one side, and the Turks on the other; and was a loser in his war with both. Louis XIV. at that time king of France, was happy in having the two celebrated generals Cond\u00e9 and Turenne in his service. The latter had already distinguished himself by great exploits against the Spaniards; and, on the accession of Leopold, the court of France had taken the opportunity of confirming the treaty of Munster, and attaching to her interest several of the independent princes of Germany. The tranquillity which now took place, however, was not established upon any permanent basis. War with Spain was resumed in the year 1668; and the great successes of Turenne in the Netherlands stimulated the ambition of the prince of Cond\u00e9 to attempt the conquest of Franche Comt\u00e9, at that time under the protection of the house of Austria. This was accomplished in three weeks; but the rapid success of Louis had awakened the jealousy of his neighbours to such a degree, that a league was formed against him by England, Holland, and Sweden; and the French monarch, dreading to enter the lists with such formidable enemies, consented to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, by which, among other articles, Franche Comt\u00e9 was restored. The flames of war, however, were renewed by the infatuated ambition of the French monarch; who, having entered into an alliance with Charles II. of England, aimed at nothing less than the total overthrow of the Dutch republic. The events of that war are related under the article United Provinces; here it is sufficient to observe, that the misfortunes of the Dutch excited the compassion of the emperor and court of Spain, who now openly declared themselves their allies. Turenne was opposed by the prince of Orange in conjunction with the celebrated Imperial general Montecucculi, whose artful conduct eluded even the penetration of Turenne, and he sat down suddenly before the city of Bonne. Here he was joined by the prince of Orange, who had likewise found means to elude the vigilance of the French generals. Bonne surrendered in a short time, and several other places in Cologne fell into the hands of the allies; who likewise cut off the communication between France and the United Provinces; so that Louis was soon obliged to recall his armies, and abandon all his conquests with greater rapidity than they had been made. In 1674 he was abandoned by his ally Charles II. of England, and the bishop of Munster and elector of Cologne were compelled to renounce their allegiance to him; but notwithstanding these misfortunes, he continued everywhere to make head against his enemies, and even meditated new conquests. With a powerful army he again invaded Franche Comt\u00e9 in person, and in six weeks reduced the whole province to his obedience. In Alsace, Turenne defeated the Imperial general at Sintzheim, and ravaged the palatinate. Seventy thousand Germans were surprised; a considerable detachment was cut in pieces at Mulhausen; the elector of Brandenburg, who had been intrusted with the chief command, was routed by Turenne near Colmar; a third body met with a similar fate at Turckheim; and the whole German forces were obliged at last to evacuate the province and repass the Rhine.\nIn consequence of these disasters the Imperial general Montecucculi was recalled to act against Turenne. The military skill of the two commanders seemed to be nearly equal; but before the superiority could be adjudged to either, Turenne was killed by a cannon ball as he was reconnoitring a situation for erecting a battery. By his death the Imperialists obtained a decided superiority. Montecucculi penetrated into Alsace; and the French, under De Lorges nephew to the deceased general, were happy in being able to escape a defeat.\n\nPart of the German army now sat down before Treves, where they were opposed by Marechal Crequi; but the negligence of that general exposed him to such a dreadful defeat, that he was obliged to fly into the city with only four attendants. Here he endeavoured in vain to animate the people to a vigorous defence. The garrison mutinied against his authority; and, when he refused to sign the capitulation they made, delivered him up prisoner to the enemy. Louis in the mean time had taken the field in person against the prince of Orange; but the disastrous state of affairs in Germany induced him to recall the prince of Cond\u00e9 to make head against Montecucculi. In this campaign the prince seemed to have the advantage. He compelled the Germans to raise the sieges of Haguenau and Saverne; and at last to repulse the Rhine without having been able to force him to a battle.\n\nThis was the last campaign made by these celebrated commanders; both of them now, contented with the fame they had acquired, retiring from the field to spend the remainder of their days in peace. The excellent discipline, however, which the two great French generals had introduced into their armies, still continued to make them very formidable, though it did not always ensure them of victory. In Germany, the duke of Lorraine, who had recovered Philipburgh, was repeatedly defeated by Marechal Crequi, who had been ransomed from his captivity, and become more prudent by his defeat. In Flanders, the prince of Orange was overmatched by the duke of Orleans and Marshal Luxembourg. A peace was at length concluded at Nimeguen in 1679, by which the king of France secured himself Franche Comt\u00e9 with a great many cities in the Netherlands; while the king of Sweden was reinstated in those places of which he had been stripped by the Danes and Germans. This tranquillity, however, was of no long duration. Louis employed every moment in preparations for new conquests; possessed himself of the imperial city of Stra\u00dfburg by treachery; and dispossessed the elector Palatine and the elector of Treves of the lordships of Falkenburg, Germantheim, and Valdertz. On the most frivolous pretences he had demanded Aloft from the Spaniards; and on their refusal, seized upon Luxembourg. His conduct, in short, was so intolerable, that the prince of Orange, his inveterate enemy, found means to unite the whole empire in a league against him. Spain and Holland became parties in the same cause; and Sweden and Denmark seemed also inclined to accede to the general confederacy. Notwithstanding this formidable combination, however, Louis seemed still to have the advantage. He made himself master of the cities of Philipburgh, Manheim, Frankenthal, Spire, Worms, and Oppenheim; the fruitful country of the palatinate was ravaged in a dreadful manner; the towns were reduced to ashes; and the people, driven from their habitations, were everywhere left to perish through the inclemency of the weather and want of provisions. By this cruelty his enemies were rather exasperated than vanquished: the Imperialists, under the conduct of the duke of Lorraine, resumed their courage, and put a stop to the French conquests. At length all parties, weary of a destructive war, consented to the treaty of Ryswick in 1679. By this treaty Louis gave up to the empire, Fribourg, Brisac, Kehl, and Philippsburg; he consented also to destroy the fortifications of Stra\u00dfburg. Fort Louis and Traerbach, the works of which had exhausted the skill of the great Vauban, with Lorraine, Treves, and the Palatinate, were resigned to their respective princes; inasmuch that the terms to which the French monarch now consented, after so many victories, were such as could scarce have been expected under the pressure of the greatest misfortunes. The views of Louis, however, in consenting to this apparently humiliating treaty, were beyond the views of ordinary politicians. The health of the king of Spain was in such a declining way, that his death appeared to be at hand; and Louis now resolved to renew his pretensions to that kingdom, which he had formerly by treaty solemnly renounced. His designs in this respect could not be concealed from the vigilance of William III. of Britain; of which Louis being sensible, and knowing that the emperor had claims of the same nature on Spain, he thought proper to enter into a very extraordinary treaty with William. This was no less than the partition of the whole Spanish dominions, which were now to be distributed in the following manner. To the young prince of Bavaria were to be assigned Spain and the East Indies; and the dauphin, son to Louis, was to have Naples, Sicily, and the province of Guipufoa; while the archduke Charles, son to the emperor Leopold, was to have only the duchy of Milan. By this scandalous treaty the indignation of Charles was roused, so that he bequeathed the whole of his dominions to the prince of Bavaria. This scheme, however, was disconcerted by the sudden death of the prince; upon which a new treaty of partition was concluded between Louis and William. By this the kingdom of Spain, together with the East India territories, were to be bestowed on the archduke Charles, and the duchy of Milan upon the duke of Lorraine. The last remains of the Spanish monarch were disturbed by the intrigues of the rival houses of Austria and Bourbon; but the haughtiness of the Austrian ministers so disgusted those of Spain, that they prevailed upon their dying monarch to make a new will. By this the whole of his dominions were bequeathed to Philip duke of Anjou, grandson to the king of France; and Louis, prompted by his natural ambition, accepted the kingdom bequeathed to his grandson, excusing himself to his allies in the best manner he could for departing from his engagements with them. For this, however, he was made to pay dear. His insatiable ambition and his former successes had alarmed all Europe. The emperor, the Dutch, and the king of England, entered into a new confederacy against him; and a bloody war ensued, which threatened\nGermany, to overthrow the French monarchy entirely. While this war (of which an account is given under the article Britain) was carried on with such success, the emperor Leopold died in the year 1705.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Joseph, who put the electors of Cologne and Bavaria to the ban of the empire; but being ill served by Prince Louis of Baden general of the empire, the French partly recovered their affairs, notwithstanding their repeated defeats. The duke of Marlborough had not all the success he expected or deserved. Joseph himself was suspected of a design to subvert the Germanic liberties; and it was plain by his conduct, that he expected England should take the labouring oar in the war, which was to be entirely carried on for his benefit. The English were disgusted at his flowness and selfishness: but he died in 1711, before he had reduced the Hungarians; and leaving no male issue, he was succeeded in the empire by his brother Charles VI., whom the allies were endeavouring to place on the throne of Spain, in opposition to Philip duke of Anjou, grandson to Louis XIV.\n\nWhen the peace of Utrecht took place in 1713, Charles at first made a show as if he would continue the war; but found himself unable, now that he was forsaken by the English. He therefore was obliged to conclude a peace with France at Baden in 1714, that he might attend the progress of the Turks in Hungary; where they received a total defeat from Prince Eugene at the battle of Peterwaradin. They received another of equal importance from the same general in 1717, before Belgrade, which fell into the hands of the Imperialists; and next year the peace of Paffarowitz, between them and the Turks was concluded. Charles employed every minute of his leisure in making arrangements for increasing and preserving his hereditary dominions in Italy and the Mediterranean. Happily for him, the crown of Britain devolved to the house of Hanover; an event which gave him a very decisive weight in Europe, by the connexions between George I. and II. and the empire. Charles was sensible of this; and carried matters so high a hand, that, about the years 1724 and 1725, a breach ensued between him and George I. and so unequally was the system of affairs all over Europe at that time, that the capital powers often changed their old alliances, and concluded new ones contradictory to their interest. Without entering into particulars, it is sufficient to observe, that the safety of Hanover, and its aggrandizement, was the main object of the British court; as that of the emperor was the establishment of the pragmatic sanction in favour of his daughter the (late empress queen), he having no male issue. Mutual concessions upon those great points restored a good understanding between George II. and the emperor Charles: and the elector of Saxony, flattered with the view of gaining the throne of Poland, relinquished the great claims he had upon the Austrian succession.\n\nThe emperor, after this, had very bad success in a war he entered into with the Turks, which he had undertaken chiefly to indemnify himself for the great sacrifices he had made in Italy to the princes of the house of Bourbon. Prince Eugene was then dead, and he had no general to supply his place. The system of France, however, under Cardinal Fleury, happened at that time to be pacific; and she obtained for him, from the Turks, a better peace than he had reason to expect. Charles, to keep the German and other powers easy, had, before his death, given his eldest daughter, the late empress queen, in marriage to the duke of Lorraine, a prince who could bring no accession of power to the Austrian family.\n\nCharles died in 1740; and was no sooner in the grave, than all he had so long laboured for must have been overthrown, had it not been for the firmness of George II. The young king of Prussia entered and conquered Silesia, which he said had been wrongfully dismembered from his family. The king of Spain and the elector of Bavaria set up claims directly incompatible with the pragmatic sanction, and in this they were joined by France; though all those powers had solemnly guaranteed it. The imperial throne, after a considerable vacancy, was filled up by the elector of Bavaria, who took the title of Charles VII., in January 1742. The French poured their armies into Bohemia, where they took Prague; and the queen of Hungary, to take off the weight of Prussia, was forced to cede to that prince the most valuable part of the duchy of Silesia by a formal treaty.\n\nHer youth, her beauty, and sufferings, and the noble fortitude with which she bore them, touched the hearts of the Hungarians, into whose arms she threw herself and her little son; and though they had been always remarkable for their disaffection to the house of Austria, they declared unanimously in her favour. Her generals drove the French out of Bohemia; and George II., at the head of an English and Hanoverian army, gained the battle of Dettingen, in 1743. Charles VII. was at this time miserable on the imperial throne, and would have given the queen of Hungary almost her own terms; but she haughtily and impolitically rejected all accommodation, though advised to it by his Britannic majesty, her best and indeed only friend. This obstinacy gave a colour for the king of Prussia to invade Bohemia, under pretence of supporting the imperial dignity; but though he took Prague, and subdued the greatest part of the kingdom, he was not supported by the French; upon which he abandoned all his conquests, and retired into Silesia. This event confirmed the obstinacy of the queen of Hungary: who came to an accommodation with the emperor, that she might recover Silesia. Soon after, his Imperial majesty, in the beginning of the year 1745, died; and the duke of Lorraine, then grand duke of Tuscany, comfort the queen of Hungary, after surmounting some difficulties, was chosen emperor.\n\nThe bad success of the allies against the French and Bavarians in the Low Countries, and the loss of the battle of Fontenoy, retarded the operations of the empress queen against his Prussian majesty. The latter beat the emperor's brother, Prince Charles of Lorraine, who had before driven the Prussians out of Bohemia; and the conduct of the empress queen was such, that his Britannic majesty thought proper to guarantee to him the possession of Silesia, as ceded by treaty. Soon after, his Prussian majesty pretended that he had discovered a secret convention which had been entered into between the empress queen, the empress of Russia, and the king of Poland as elector of Saxony, to strip him of his dominions, and to divide them.\nGermany, them among themselves. Upon this his Prussian majesty, very suddenly, drove the king of Poland out of Saxony, defeated his troops, and took possession of Dresden; which he held till a treaty was made under the mediation of his Britannic majesty, by which the king of Prussia acknowledged the duke of Lorraine, great duke of Tuscany, for emperor. The war, however, continued in the Low Countries, not only to the disadvantage, but to the discredit of the Austrians and Dutch, till it was finished by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in April 1748. By that treaty Silesia was once more guaranteed to the king of Prussia. It was not long before that monarch's jealousies were renewed and verified; and the empress of Russia's views falling in with those of the empress queen and the king of Poland, who were unnaturally supported by France in their new schemes, a fresh war was kindled in the empire. The king of Prussia declared against the admission of the Russians into Germany, and his Britannic majesty against that of the French. Upon these two principles all former differences between these monarchs were forgotten, and the British parliament agreed to pay an annual subsidy of \u00a370,000 to his Prussian majesty during the continuance of the war.\n\nThe flames of war now broke out in Germany with greater fury and more destructive violence than ever. The armies of his Prussian majesty, like an irresistible torrent, burst in Saxony; totally defeated the imperial general Brown at the battle of Loholitz; forced the Saxons to lay down their arms, though almost impregnable fortified at Pirna; and the elector of Saxony fled to his regal dominions in Poland. After this, his Prussian majesty was put to the ban of the empire; and the French poured, by one quarter, their armies, as the Russians did by another, into the empire. The conduct of his Prussian majesty on this occasion is the most amazing that is to be met with in history; for a particular account of which, see the article PRUSSIA.\n\nAt last, however, the taking of Colberg by the Russians, and of Schweidnitz by the Austrians, was on the point of completing his ruin, when his most formidable enemy, the empress of Russia, died, January 5, 1762; George II, his only ally, had died on the 25th of October 1760.\n\nThe deaths of those illustrious personages were followed by great consequences. The British ministry of George III. fought to finish the war with honour, and the new emperor of Russia recalled his armies. His Prussian majesty was, notwithstanding, so very much reduced by his losses, that the empress queen, probably, would have completed his destruction, had it not been for the wise backwardness of other German princes, not to annihilate the house of Brandenburg. At first the empress queen rejected all terms proposed to her, and ordered 30,000 men to be added to her armies. The visible backwardness of her generals to execute her orders, and new succours obtained by his Prussian majesty, at last prevailed on her to agree to an armistice, which was soon followed by the treaty of Hubertburgh, which secured to his Prussian majesty the possession of Silesia. Upon the death of the emperor her husband, in 1765, her son Joseph, who had been crowned king of the Romans in 1764, succeeded him in the empire.\n\nThis prince showed an active and restless disposition, much inclined to extend his territories by conquest, and to make reformation in the internal policy of his dominions, yet without taking any proper methods for accomplishing his purposes. Hence he was almost always disappointed; infirmly that he wrote for himself the following epitaph: \"Here lies Joseph, unfortunate in all his undertakings.\" In the year 1788, a war commenced betwixt him and the king of Prussia; in which, notwithstanding the impetuous valour of that monarch, Joseph acted with such caution that his adversary could gain no advantage over him; and an accommodation took place without any remarkable exploit on either side. In 1781 he took the opportunity of the quarrel betwixt Britain and the United Provinces, to deprive the latter of the barrier towns which had been secured to them by the treaty of Utrecht. These indeed had frequently been of great use to the house of Austria in its state of weakness; but Joseph, conscious of his own strength, looked upon it as derogatory to his honour to allow so many of his cities to remain in the hands of foreigners, and to be garrisoned at his expense. As at that time the Dutch were unable to refit, the imperial orders for evacuating the barrier towns were instantly complied with; nor did the court of France, though then in friendship with Holland, make any offer to interpose. Encouraged by this success, Joseph next demanded the free navigation of the Scheldt; but as this would evidently have been very detrimental to the commercial interests of Holland, a flat refusal was given to his requisitions. In this the emperor was much disappointed; having flattered himself that the Hollanders, intimidated by his power, would yield the navigation of the river as easily as they had done the barrier. Great preparations were made by the emperor, which the Dutch, on their part, seemed determined to refit. But while the emperor appeared so much set upon this acquisition, he suddenly abandoned the project entirely, and entered into a new scheme of exchanging the Netherlands for the duchy of Bavaria. This was opposed by the king of Prussia; and by the interference of the court of France, the emperor found himself at last obliged also to abandon his other scheme of obtaining the navigation of the Scheldt. A treaty of peace was concluded, under the guarantee of his most Christian majesty. The principal articles were, that the states acknowledged the emperor's sovereignty over the Scheldt from Antwerp to the limits of Seftingen; they agreed to demolish certain forts, and to pay a considerable sum of money in lieu of some claims which the emperor had on Maastricht, and by way of indemnification for laying part of his territories under water.\n\nThe treaty with the Dutch was no sooner concluded than a quarrel with the Turks took place, which terminated in an open war. It does not appear that the emperor had at this time any real provocation, but seems to have acted merely in consequence of his engagements with Russia to reduce the dominions of the Grand Signior. All these foreign engagements, however, did not in the least retard the progress of reformation which the emperor carried on throughout his dominions with a rapidity scarcely to be matched, and which at last produced the revolt of the Austrian Netherlands. In the course of his labours in this way, a complete\nGermany: complete code of laws was compiled. These were at first greatly commended for their humanity, as excluding almost entirely every species of capital punishment; yet, when narrowly considered, the commutations were found to be exceedingly severe, that the most cruel death would, comparatively speaking, have been an act of mercy. Even for smaller crimes the punishments were severe beyond measure; but the greatest fault of all was, that the modes of trial were very defective, and the punishments so arbitrary, that the most perfect and innocent character lay at the mercy of a tyrannical judge. The innovations in ecclesiastical matters were, however, most offensive to his subjects in the Netherlands. Among the many changes introduced into this department, the following were some of the most remarkable:\n\n1. An abridgment of divine service.\n2. A total suppression of vocal performers in choirs.\n3. The introduction of the vernacular language instead of the Latin in administering the sacraments.\n4. The prohibition of chanting hymns in private houses.\n5. The suppression of a great number of religious houses, and the reduction of the number of the clergy.\n6. The total abolition of the papal supremacy throughout the imperial dominions. The same spirit of innovation displayed itself even in the most minute matters. Many favours were bestowed upon the Jews; and in 1786 the emperor wrote with his own hand to the different handicraft and trading corporations in Vienna, requesting that their youths might be received as apprentices in that city. Severe laws against gaming were enacted and put in execution with equal rigour. Heavy restrictions were also laid on all the societies of free masons in Germany, while those in the Netherlands were totally suppressed.\n\nThe great number of innovations in religious matters were highly resented by the inhabitants of the Netherlands, who have always been remarkable for their attachment to the Roman religion in its most superstitious form. Indeed the alterations in the civil constitution were so great, that even those who were least bigotted in this respect began to fear that their liberties were in danger, and an universal dissatisfaction was excited. The emperor behaved at first in a very haughty manner, and refused to yield the smallest point to the solicitations of his subjects. Finding, however, that a general revolt was about to take place, and being unable at that time, on account of the Turkish war, to spare such a force as would be necessary to reduce the provinces to obedience, he thought proper, in the autumn of 1787, to promise a restoration of their ancient constitution and privileges. His promises, however, were found to be so delusive, and his conduct was so arbitrary and capricious, that in the end of the year 1789 the states of all the provinces in the Austrian Netherlands came to a resolution of entirely throwing off the yoke. Articles of a federal union were drawn up, and a new republic was formed under the title of the Belgic Provinces. The situation of the emperor's affairs at that time did not allow him to take the measures necessary for preventing this revolt; to which perhaps his ill state of health also contributed. About the beginning of February 1790 his distemper increased to such a degree as to be thought dangerous; and continuing daily to grow worse, he sunk under it on the 20th of the same month, in the 40th year of his age, and 26th of his reign.\n\nThe leaders of the Austrian revolution, however, soon became so disagreeable to their countrymen, that they were obliged to fly; and the congress, which had been established as the supreme legislative body, behaved with such tyranny, that they became generally detested. Meantime, the late emperor was succeeded by his brother Peter Leopold Joseph, grand duke of Tuscany; under whose administration matters have taken a more favourable turn. By his wisdom, moderation, and humanity, he has already in a great measure retrieved the bad consequences of his predecessor's conduct, having made peace with the Ottomans, and regained the allegiance of the Netherlands; and upon the whole seems to be actuated not more by a sense of his own rights, than by a regard to the rights and happiness of his subjects.\n\nAt present, Germany is bounded on the north by the Baltic sea, Denmark, and the German ocean; on the east, by Prussia, Hungary, and Poland; and on the west, by the Low Countries, Lorraine, and Franche Comt\u00e9: so that it now comprehends the Palatinate of Cologne, Triers, and Liege, which formerly belonged to the Gauls; and is dismembered of Friesland, Groningen, and Overijssel, which are now incorporated with the Low Countries.\n\nSince the time of Charles the Great, this country has situated, been divided into High and Low Germany. The first extent, &c., comprehends the Palatinate of the Rhine, Franconia, Swabia, Bavaria, Bohemia, Moravia, Austria, Carinthia, Carniola, Stiria, the Swits, and the Grifons. The provinces of Low Germany are, the Low Country of the Rhine, Triers, Cologne, Mentz, Westphalia, Hesse, Brunswick, M\u00fcnna, Lufatia, High Saxony upon the Elbe, Low Saxony upon the Elbe, Mecklenburg, L\u00fcneburg, Brandenburg, and Pomerania.\n\nMonarchy was first established in Germany by Clovis, after him Charlemagne extended his power and his dominions; and so great had the empire become, that during his reign, and that of his son, government was administered in the provinces by persons vested with power for that purpose under the title of Dukes. In the districts of these provinces, justice was distributed by a comes or count, which officer was in Germany called Graf. But from their courts lay an appeal to that of the emperor, before a president styled Comes Palatinus, that is, \"Count Palatine, or of the palace,\" in German denominated Pfalzgraf. The frontiers or marches were governed by a marquis, styled by the Germans Markgraf, similar to our lord warden. Generally the centre of the empire was ruled by an officer who possessed a similar power, but a greater extent of dominion, than the Grave, under the title of Landgrave. Towns and castles, which were occasionally honoured with the residence of the emperor, were governed by a Burggraf. It may be remarked, that the signification of the above-mentioned titles, and the extent of power which they conferred upon the persons honoured with them, differ according to the successive ages and the gradual development of the German constitution.\n\nBy reason of family broils in the imperial house, and civil wars in their dominions, the dignity of the sovereign...\nGermany, reign was depressed, and a new form in the government raised up. The dukes exalted themselves above the power of the emperor, and secured for their sons a succession to their greatness; while the interest of the sovereign, in order to strengthen the bond of personal attachment, ratified to others and their descendants that sway which had been formerly delegated and dependant on his will. Hence arose the modern constitution of distinct principalities, acknowledging one head in the person of an emperor. But shortly after the election of Conrade duke of Franconia to the throne, this new-gained authority of the princes became doubtful. However, after most violent disturbances and confusions, the regulations yielded to by Albert II. and his successors, particularly by Frederick III., laid the foundation of the German constitution; but the power and form of which were afterwards improved by Maximilian. Before Charles V. mounted the throne, on the death of Maximilian, the electors formed a bulwark against the Imperial power, by an instrument called the capitulation; to which articles of government he and all emperors elected since have sworn, previous to their investiture with the Imperial dignity.\n\nWhen the German monarchy received an elective form, the right of election was not limited to the great officers of state, for other princes participated of this privilege. But the empire being governed by four dukes, the princes under their authority, in order to court their favour, gave to them the disposal of their votes, and of those of their vassals. The three archbishops also, who were necessarily present at the coronation, obtained the electoral dignity. However, beside this origin of the modern electors, the high stations about court procured their predecessors an influence over other members, and their general residence there gave them a solid advantage in their constant and early presence at the diet of election. For in times of turbulence several emperors were elected, when the princes had not an opportunity to attend. And hence sprung up a sanction to that right, which the high officers of the household had assumed, of electing without any consultation of the other members of the empire. Pope Gregory X. too, either conceiving that they did possess, or willing that they should acquire, this right, exhorted them in a bull to terminate the troubles of Germany by electing an emperor. And since that period they have been held as the sole electors. But the possession of this high power was strengthened by a league amongst themselves, called the electoral union, which received additional confirmation from the emperor Louis of Bavaria, and was formally and fully ratified by that famous constitution of Charles IV., termed the golden bull; according to which, the territories and the high officers by which the electoral dignity is conveyed, must descend according to the right of primogeniture, and are indivisible.\n\nThe golden bull declares the following number and titles of the electors: The archbishop of Mentz as great chancellor of the German empire; the elector of Cologne as great chancellor of the empire in Italy; the elector of Trier as great chancellor of the empire in Gaul and Arles; the king of Bohemia as cupbearer; the count Palatine as high steward; the duke of Saxony as grand marshal; the margrave of Brandenburg as grand chamberlain. The number originally Germany was seven, but the emperor Leopold created the duke of Lunenburg, ancestor to our present British sovereign, an elector; to whom the post of arch-treasurer was afterwards given; and thus Hanover forms the eighth electorate. But this number cannot be increased by the emperor without a previous election by the electors themselves; who, thus capable of electing and of being elected, may style themselves Coimperantes; and they exercise part of the imperial authority, if a vacancy of the throne happen. But when or before this Election occurs, the election of the emperor is proceeded to after the following manner: The elector of Mentz, before the last of a month after the death of the emperor, summons, as great chancellor of the empire, the rest of the electors to attend on some fixed day within the space of three months from the date of the summons. The electors generally send their ambassadors to the place of election, which is held at Frankfort on the Main; but having the right of the city of Frankfort, it may be held elsewhere.\n\nWhen the diet of electors is assembled, they proceed to compose the capitulation, to which the emperor when elected is to swear. The capitulation being adjusted, the elector of Mentz appoints a day for the election. When this day arrives, the gates of the city are shut, and the keys delivered to the elector of Mentz. The electors or their ambassadors, Protestants excepted, repair in great pomp to meet; and after its celebration they take a solemn oath to choose, unbiased and uninfluenced, the person that appears most proper for the imperial dignity. After this they repair to the sacrificial, where the elector of Mentz first asks, if there be any impediment known against their proceeding at present to an election; and next he obtains a promise, that the person elected by the majority shall be received as emperor. The declarations of the electoral ambassadors, in respect to those two points, are recorded by two notaries of the empire. Then all witnesses withdraw; and the elector of Mentz collecting the suffrages, which are vivae voce, and giving his own last, the witnesses are recalled, and he declares the person whom the electors have chosen. But the election is not complete, nor is the new emperor proclaimed, until the capitulation be sworn to either by himself or by his ambassadors if he be absent. From this time he is styled king of the Romans until the coronation takes place; which ceremony confers the title of emperor. According to the golden bull, it should be celebrated at Aix-la-Chapelle, out of respect to Charlemagne, who resided there; but having the right to Aix-la-Chapelle, it may take place elsewhere. The coronation is performed by the archbishop of Mentz or elector of Cologne. And, when he is seated on his throne, the duke of Saxony delivers into his hand the sword of Charles the Great, with which he makes some knights of the holy Roman empire, and is also obliged to confer that honour upon such others as are nominated by the respective electors. When he proceeds to dinner in the great hall, he is seated at a table elevated two steps higher than that of the electors, and is served by counts of the empire. The electors, each of whom has also his table, are attended by the gentlemen of their respective courts. These electors, who assist personally at the ceremony...\nGermany. remony, fit and eat at their own tables; but those who are represented by ambassadors have only their tables covered out of form with plates, at which the ambassadors do not fit.\n\nFor the benefit of the empire during the reign of an emperor, his presumptive successor may be elected king of the Romans. But this election confers at first a mere title; for by an express article in his capitulation, the king of the Romans swears not to interfere with the government during the life of the emperor; but on his decease, the coronation confirms him emperor without a second election.\n\nShould there not be a king of the Romans, and the throne become vacant, the government is administered by vicars of the empire, who are the electors Palatine and of Saxony, as count palatine and arch-marshal of the empire. Each has his district and tribunal of the vicariate; and by the golden bull it is established, that all acts of the vicars are valid; but they are all fully confirmed by the emperor; which confirmation, by an article of his capitulation, he is bound to give.\n\nThere are also vicars of the emperor. These officers are constituted by a delegation of the imperial power from the emperor to any prince of the empire, when he is unable to execute his authority himself. But these vicars stand accountable to the emperor; their acts may be annulled and their offices revoked, all dependent on the will of the emperor, and determinable at his pleasure.\n\nWhen the race of Charlemagne ceased to govern in Germany, the princes and states associated to continue the empire; and that its majesty might be visible, and its laws enforced, they agreed to choose an emperor. From this emperor all electors and princes except those before 1582 receive investiture of their dominions; counts and free cities from the Aulic council. But this investiture is no more than a sign of submission to the majesty of the empire, which is deposed in the emperor. For as the constituted members of the empire are dependent on that collective union from which they derive protection, they therefore show this dependence on the emperor, because he represents the majesty of that union or of that empire; but in all other respects they are independent and free.\n\nThese princes or sovereigns may even wage war with the prince wearing the imperial crown, as possessed of other titles and dominions unconnected with his imperial station. Nor can the sovereignty of any member be affected so long as he remains loyal to the empire; which loyalty constitutes his duty, and secures him its protection. But should he be guilty of any violation against the emperor, as head of the empire, such a crime would commit him to the punishment of its laws, and he would be put under the ban. For this crime would be against that collective body of sovereigns whose union constitutes the empire; and therefore any violation of that union is justly punished with deprivation of these territories which render such sovereigns members of the empire. Nor can this punishment of the ban derogate from the dignity of those princes who derive their sovereignty from this constitution, and whose subjection is an act of their own consent. However, no member of the empire can at present be put under the ban without being first heard, and without the concurrence of the electors, princes, and states, being previously obtained.\n\nThe emperor is endowed with many privileges, and powers of his power partly appears in the exercise of his referred emperors rights, or the peculiar prerogatives annexed to the imperial dignity. He grants to princes the investiture of their dominions; but to this he is bound as the laws direct. He confers titles, but promises that they shall be bestowed only on such persons as will maintain their dignity, and can support their rank. Beside, he can give merely the title; for the power or privilege of prince or count can be obtained only from their respective bodies. But in some instances, even titles are of high importance. For the descendants of a prince are incapable of succession, if their mother be of inferior rank to their father; but the conferring of a title ennobles her and removes the bar, if the collateral line consents.\n\nThe emperor can also make cities, found universities, grant the privilege of fairs, &c. He can also dispense with the tedious terms of minority, and empower princes to assume at an earlier age, the government of their own dominions. He decides all rank and precedence, and has a power of prime pretor, that is, of granting for once in every chapter of the empire a vacant seat. But he is not above the law; for electors have not only chosen but deposed emperors. However, the influence of the capitulation is to prevent such rigorous proceedings: but should the capitulation be violated, the college of electors might proceed to remonstrance; and if these remonstrances should be without effect, in conjunction with the diet, they might resort to more forcible remedies.\n\nThe diet is that assembly of the states in which the Diet of the legislative power of the empire resides; and is composed of the electors, princes, prelates, counts, and free cities of the empire. It has sat since 1663, and is held usually at Ratibon. The emperor, when present, presides in person; when absent, by his commissary, whose communication of proposals from the emperor to the assembly is called the commissorial decree. The elector of Mentz, as chancellor of the empire, is director of the diet; and to his chancery are all things addressed that are to be submitted to the empire; the reading of which by his secretary to the secretaries of the other ministers at the diet is denominated per dictaturam, and constitutes the form of transmitting papers or memorials to the dictature of the empire.\u2014The diet is composed of three distinct colleges, each of which has its particular director. The first college is that of electors; of which the archbishop of Mentz is director as first elector. The second college is that of princes. It consists of princes, archbishops, and bishops; and of prelates, abbots, and counts, who are not considered as princes. Each prince spiritual and temporal has a vote, but prelates and counts vote by benches. The prelates are divided into two benches, the counts into four; and each bench has only one vote. The archduke of Austria and the archbishop of Salzburg are alternately directors of the college of princes. The third college is that of the free cities of the empire; the director of which is the minister of the city in which the diet happens to sit.\nIn all these colleges, the sentiments of the majority are conclusive, except in respect of fundamental laws, which affect the whole empire, or such matters as relate to religion. In these they must be unanimous.\n\nWhere religion is interested, the proceedings are also different. The colleges are then considered as consisting of two bodies, the evangelic and the catholic; and if any religious point be proposed, it must meet not only the unanimous concurrence of the proposing body, but must have the majority of the other to establish it. This distinction arose from a conjunction called the evangelic body; which was formed by the Protestant states and princes to guard the Protestant interest in Germany, by watching over the laws for the security of their religion, and, in case of violation, by obtaining redress from the imperial throne. For in any part of the empire, as in the palatinate, where the count is a Papist and the subjects are Protestants, should oppressions arise, application would be made to the evangelic body through the director. The elector of Saxony is director of the evangelic body, though he is a Papist; but therefore his representations in favour of the Protestants have more force; and beside, should he abuse an office which invests him with considerable weight and influence, he could be instantly deprived of it.\n\nThe first two colleges are styled superior, and in effect constitute the diet; for all points that come before the diet, are generally first deliberated in the college of electors, and pass from that to the college of princes; in which, if any objection arise, a free conference takes place between the directors of each college. And should they, in consequence of this free conference, concur, they invite the third college to accede to their joint opinion; which invitation is generally complied with; but should this college return a refusal, the opinion of the other two colleges is in some few cases engrossed in the chancery, and delivered to the emperor's commissary as the opinion of the empire. The opinion of the third college is merely mentioned at the close. However, though the superior colleges do in effect constitute the diet; yet the received maxim is, that no two colleges constitute a majority, that is, the majority of voices at the diet; nor can the emperor confirm the opinion of two colleges as an opinion of the diet. By the peace of Westphalia, a decisive vote was recognized as a right of the imperial cities, which the two superior colleges should not infringe upon; their vote being, by the fundamental law, of equal weight with that of the electors and princes.\n\nAfter a measure is approved of by the colleges, it is submitted to his Imperial majesty to receive his negative or confirmation. Should he approve the point, it is published in his name as the resolution of the empire, which states are exhorted to obey, and tribunals desired to consider as such.\n\nThe diet not only makes and explains laws, but decides ambiguous cases. It must also be consulted before war is made; appoints the field marshal who is to command the army, and affixes his council of war. The diet also enters into and makes alliances, but usually empowers the emperor to negotiate them; and foreign states have their ambassadors at the diet, but the diet sends no ministers to foreign courts.\n\nIn the origin of the empire, justice was administered in the districts of the provinces by counts, and appeals lay from their courts to that of the emperor before the count palatine. But as civil broils shook the administration of the emperor, they interrupted also the course of justice, &c. Justice. The consequent inconveniences caused several solicitations to be preferred from the states to different emperors for the establishment of a court of justice, which should take cognizance of great as well as small causes. And at length such a court was erected by Maximilian I. under the title of the Imperial Chamber at Worms, in the year 1495; but was removed to Spire in 1533, and to Wetzlar in 1696, where it is now held. The members of this court are a judge of the chamber and 25 assessors, partly Protestants partly Papists. The president is appointed by the emperor, the assessors by the states. The court receives appeals from inferior jurisdictions, and decides dubious titles; and all causes before it between prince and prince, or princes and private persons, are adjudged according to the laws of the respective parties, or according to the Imperial law. The tribunal is under the inspection of visitors appointed by the states; and, during their visitation, the sentences of the court are subject to revision. Appeals lie afterwards also from the judgment of the visitors to that of the diet.\n\nThe emperors finding themselves deprived of many of their powers, wished to raise their prerogatives still by forming a tribunal, of which they should name the judge, and before whom causes in the last resort should come. But Maximilian foresaw, in respect to the new tribunal, that though a consciousness of its importance made the states struggle for its erection, the expenses of its establishment would make them neglect its support; and the event bore witness to his sagacity. But when, through the omissions and negligence of the states, there happened to be a cessation in the distribution of justice by the Imperial chamber, he revived his court of the count Palatine, or Aulic council. And in order to gain the quiet acquiescence of the states, under the mask of a partition of power, and of generous moderation, he desired them to add eight to the number of assessors, and the salaries of all should be discharged by him. The states swallowed the bait, but soon perceived that they had lost part of their liberty.\n\nThe emperor, by keeping the tribunal always open, by filling its seats with men of first-rate talents, and by having its sentences duly and speedily executed, drew all causes before it. The states remonstrated, declaring, that the Imperial chamber ought to be not only the supreme, but sole tribunal of that kind. The emperor answered, that he had erected the Imperial chamber in consequence of their solicitations; but as they had not supplied the tribunal with judges, he provided for that deficiency by a constant administration of justice in the establishment of another.\n\nThe Aulic council now subsists with equal authority, each receiving appeals from inferior jurisdictions; but neither appealing to the other, as the dernier ressort from both must be had to the diet. However, to the Aulic council belong the reserved rights of the emperor; and to the Imperial chamber also are annexed peculiar powers. The Imperial chamber subsists during a vacancy\nGermany: cancy of the throne under the authority of the vicars of the empire; whereas the Aulic council does not exist until appointed by the succeeding emperor.\n\nThe Aulic council consists of a president, vice president, and 17 members, of whom six are Protestants. The vice chancellor of the empire is also entitled to a seat; and all decrees issuing from the council pass through his hands to those who are to execute them. This tribunal obtains for the emperor, through the appeals from the courts of other princes, a new authority beside that which he possesses from his reserved rights; but electors and some princes, as those of Hanover, Austria, Brunswick, Swedish Pomerania, Hesse, are free from this dependence on the emperor, to whose Aulic council their subjects cannot appeal; nor can it take cognizance of ecclesiastical or criminal causes, both of which appertain to territorial justice; which we shall presently consider when we have surveyed the executive instrument of Imperial justice.\n\nThe division of the empire into circles is a regulation coeval with the establishment of the Imperial chamber by Maximilian, in order to strengthen the arm of justice with vigour to enforce its decrees. The original division was into five circles, which are called the ancient circles; and are, Bavaria, Franconia, Swabia, Lower Saxony, the Upper Rhine, and Westphalia; but the powerful princes, who at first declined bringing their dominions under the form of circles, were led by a political necessity of the emperors to adopt the regulation, and increase the number to ten, by forming the four new circles of Austria, Burgundy, the Electorate circle, and Upper Saxony.\n\nOver these circles preside directors, to whom the tribunals of justice commit the execution of their decrees. The five old circles have two directors each, the four new have one each. The office of director is permanent and hereditary, as it belongs always to the first prince in the circle, upon whom it confers high authority; for all the decrees of the Imperial chamber and Aulic council are of no avail unless the director will execute them.\n\nThe directors of the circles are not only instruments of war but of peace; for in case of an Imperial war, they are to collect the troops of the circle; and if any state or prince of their respective circles suffers violation from others, they are to yield protection and enforce the peace; or should there be any tumultuous risings of the people, the suppression of such belongs to them.\n\nThe emperor is the executive instrument of the whole empire; the directors are such of the constitutive parts called circles. The prosperity and security of which being at stake, the directors, as presidents, must hold frequent diets in their respective circles, in order to consult on and adopt salutary measures for their safety and welfare; but as the interests of those near to us are generally so intimately blended with our own, that the good of either cannot be pursued without the mutual concurrence of both, there arise negotiations on particular points between the diets of different circles, which are therefore styled confederate circles; and these negotiations being more frequent amongst the circles of the Upper and Lower Rhine, or Westphalia, they are denominated the corresponding circles.\n\nEvery prince is sovereign in his own country; and may enter into alliances, and pursue by all political measures his own private interest, as other sovereigns do; for if even an imperial war be declared, he may remain neuter if the safety of the empire be not at stake, the German states or sovereigns in general three main principal colleges for its government. The first is the geheimrath, or privy council; the second is the regierung, or regency; the third the rentkammer, or chamber of finances. Each of these has a president; and a member of the first college is always president of the second.\u2014The geheimrath represents the prince, and superintends the other two. The regierung regulates limits of territories, holds conferences with other princes, and is in most countries a court of justice; however, in some states there is also a court of justice called justiz department. And besides the right of conferences assigned to the regierung by the sovereign, when there are disputes between princes, there is also an aufrage, or arbitration appointed in order to decide them. Attention must be paid to this privilege of princes, who must be called on to appoint an aufrage before resort be had to the Imperial tribunal, but to which there still lies an appeal from the judgment of the aufrage. The rentkammer attends to the regulation of domains and estates, to the territorial revenues, and management of the taxes.\n\nEvery sovereign or prince is arbitrary in laws of policy, but not of revenue; for no new tax or impost can be laid on his country without the consent of the nobles and subjects. For this purpose, on the land tag, or day on which his subjects are to be convened, which is once in the period of four or five years, and at no other time can he assemble them, he calls together the nobles and commissaries or deputies of the towns of his dominions. The nobles usually attend in person, but may send representatives.

Total 543,500.\n\nThe revenue accruing to the emperor as such in time of peace, is very trifling, only about 20,000 crowns, being the contributions of a few imperial towns; but in case of war, extraordinary aids, called Roman Months, laid on by the diet, are contributed by the different circles at the following rate for raising 1\u00bd millions of florins, viz.\n\n| Florins | Xtr. |\n|---------|-----|\n| Upper Saxony | 156,360 | 15 |\n| Lower Saxony | 156,360 | 15 |\n| Westphalia | 156,360 | 15 |\n| Upper Rhine | 101,411 | 30 |\n| Lower Rhine | 105,654 | 5 |\n| Burgundy | 156,360 | 15 |\n| Franconia | 113,481 | 25 |\n| Austria | 306,390 | 20 |\n| Bavaria | 91,261 | 5 |\n| Swabia | 156,360 | 15 |\n\nTotal 1,499,997 40\n\nThe actual revenue of all Germany has been calculated at nearly 18,000,000l. sterling, or 100 millions of dollars.\n\nFrom the great extent of the empire, every variety of soil is to be met with; but it is upon the whole more fertile than otherwise. The middle parts are most productive in corn and cattle; the southern abound with excellent wines and fruits. The northern parts, from their coldness, are rather unfavourable to vegetation; however, agriculture throughout improves exceedingly. Their mines, though early explored, still continue great sources of wealth. They produce, excepting tin, almost every mineral. Of quicksilver, one mine alone is computed to yield 50,000 pounds weight a-year. They furnish the finest sort of clay for porcelain, and have excellent and extensive salt works.\n\nFrom the central situation of Germany, its commerce with the rest of Europe is very extensive. Its minerals are decidedly the first native articles for trade; after which its medicinal waters, salt, hemp, flax, linen, silk, wines, fruits, corn, cattle, silks, cloths, timber, porcelain, wrought iron and steel, drugs, oil, and colours, are the principal. The artisans furnished by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, enable Germany no longer to stand in need of the wrought silks of other countries. Great commercial fairs still exist in Germany, and it is considered upon the whole that the balance of trade is in its favour.\n\nWith regard to the character of the ancient Germans, they are described to us by the Greek and Roman writers as resembling the Gauls; and differing from other nations by the largeness of their stature, ruddy complexion, blue eyes, and yellow bushy hair, haughty and threatening looks, strong constitutions, and being proof against hunger, cold, and all kinds of hardship.\n\nTheir native disposition displayed itself chiefly in their martial genius, and in their singular fidelity. The former of these they did indeed carry to such an extreme as came little short of downright ferocity; but, as to the latter, they not only valued themselves highly upon it, but were greatly esteemed by other nations for it; infomuch that Augustus, and several of his successors, committed the guard of their persons to them, and almost all other nations either courted their friendship and alliance, or hired them as auxiliaries; though it must be owned, at the same time, that their extreme love of liberty, and their hatred of tyranny and oppression, have often hurried them to treachery and murder, especially when they have thought themselves ill used by those who hired them; for in all such cases they were easily stirred up, and extremely vindictive. In other cases, Tacitus tells us, they were noble, magnanimous, and beneficent, without ambition to aggrandize their dominions, or invading those from whom they received no injury; rather choosing to employ their strength and valour defensively than offensively; to preserve their own, than to ravage their neighbours.\n\nTheir friendship and intercourse was rather a compound of honest bluntness and hospitality, than of wit, humour, or gallantry. All strangers were sure to meet with a kind reception from them to the utmost of their ability: even those who were not in a capacity to entertain them, made it a piece of duty to introduce them to those who could; and nothing was looked upon as more scandalous and detestable, than to refuse them either the one or the other. They do not seem, indeed, to have had a taste for grand and elegant entertainments; they affected in every thing, in their houses, furniture, diet, &c. rather plainness and simplicity, than sumptuousness and luxury. If they learned of the Romans and Gauls the use of money, it was rather because they found it more convenient than their ancient way of bartering one commodity for another; and then they preferred these ancient coins which had been stamped during the times of the Roman liberty, especially such as were either milled or cut in the rims, because they could not be so easily cheated in them as in some others, which were frequently nothing but copper or iron plated over with silver. This last metal they likewise preferred before gold, not because it made a greater show, but because it was more convenient for buying and selling: And as they became in time more feared by, or more useful to, the Romans; so they learned how to draw enough of it from them to supply their whole country, besides what flowed to them from other nations.\n\nAs they despised superfluities in other cases, so they did also in the connubial way: every man was contented with one wife, except some few of their nobles, who allowed themselves a plurality, more for show than pleasure; and both were so faithful to each other, and chaste, true, and disinterested, in their conjugal affection, that Tacitus prefers their manners in this respect to those of the Romans. The men fought not dowries from their wives, but bestowed them upon them. Their youth, in those cold climes, did not begin so soon to feel the warmth of love as they do in hotter ones: it was a common rule with them not to marry young; and those were most esteemed who continued longest in celibacy, because they looked upon it as an effectual means to make them...\nGermany, them grow tall and strong; and to marry, or be concerned with a woman, before they were full 20 years old, was accounted shameful wantonness. The women shared with their husbands not only the care of the family, and the education of their children, but even the hardships of war. They attended them in the field, cooked the victuals for them, dressed their wounds, stirred them up to fight manfully against their enemies, and sometimes have, by their courage and bravery, recovered a victory when it was upon the point of being snatched from them. In a word, they looked upon such constant attendance on them, not as a servitude, like the Roman dames, but as a duty and an honour. But what appears to have been still a harder fate upon the ancient German dames was, that their great Odin excluded all those from his Valhalla or paradise, who did not, by some violent death, follow their deceased husbands thither. Yet notwithstanding their having been anciently in such high repute for their wisdom and suppoled spirit of prophecy, and their continuing such faithful and tender helpmates to their husbands, they sunk in time low in their esteem, that, according to the old Saxon law, he that hurt or killed a woman was to pay but half the fine that he should have done, if he had hurt or killed a man.\n\nThere is scarcely any one thing in which the Germans, though so nearly allied in most of their other customs to the Gauls, were yet more opposite to them than in their funerals. Those of the latter were performed with great pomp and profusion; those of the former were done with the same plainness and simplicity which they observed in all other things; the only grandeur they affected in them was, to burn the bodies of their great men with some peculiar kinds of wood; but then the funeral pile was neither adorned with the clothes and other fine furniture of the deceased, nor perfumed with fragrant herbs and gums: each man's armour, that is, his sword, shield, and spear, were flung into it, and sometimes his riding horse. The Danes, indeed, flung into the funeral pile of a prince, gold, silver, and other precious things, which the chief mourners, who walked in a gloomy guise round the fire, exhorted the bystanders to fling liberally into it in honour of the deceased. They afterwards deposited their ashes in urns, like the Gauls, Romans, and other nations; as it plainly appears, from the vast numbers which have been dug up all over the country, as well as from the sundry dissertations which have been written upon them by several learned moderns of that nation. One thing we may observe, in general, that whatever sacrifices they offered for their dead, whatever presents they made to them at their funerals, and whatever other superstitious rites they might perform at them, all was done in consequence of those excellent notions which their ancient religion had taught them, the immortality of the soul, and the bliss or misery of a future life.\n\nIt is impossible, indeed, as they did not commit anything to writing till very lately, and as none of the ancient writers have given us any account of it, to guess how soon the belief of their great Odin, and his paradise, was received among them. It may, for aught we know, have been older than the times of Tacitus, and he have known nothing of it, by reason of their scrupulous care in concealing their religion from strangers: but as they conveyed their doctrines to posterity by songs and poems, and most of the northern poets tell us that they have drawn their intelligence from those very poems which were still preserved among them; we may rightly enough suppose, that whatever doctrines are contained in them, were formerly professed by the generality of the nation, especially since we find their ancient practice to exactly conformable to it. Thus, since the surest road to this paradise was, to excel in martial deeds, and to die intrepidly in the field of battle; and since none were excluded from it but base cowards, and betrayers of their country; it is natural to think, that the signal and excessive bravery of the Germans flowed from this ancient belief of theirs: and, if their females were so brave and faithful as not only to share with their husbands all the dangers and fatigues of war, but at length to follow them by a voluntary death, into the other world; it can hardly be attributed to any thing else but a strong persuasion of their being admitted to live with them in that place of bliss. This belief, therefore, whether received originally from the old Celtes, or afterwards taught them by the since deified Odin, seems, from their general practice, to have been universally received by all the Germans, though they might differ one from another in their notions of that future life.\n\nThe notion of a future happiness obtained by martial exploits, especially by dying sword in hand, made them bewail the fate of those who lived to an old age, as dishonourable here, and hopeless hereafter: upon which account, they had a barbarous way of sending them into the other world, willing or not willing. And this custom lasted several ages after their receiving Christianity, especially among the Prutians and Vendii; the former of whom, it seems, despatched by a quick death, not only their children, the sick, servants, &c. but even their parents, and sometimes themselves: and among the latter we have instances of this horrid parricide being practised even in the beginning of the 14th century. All that need be added is, that, if those persons, thus supposed to have lived long enough, either desired to be put to death, or at least seemed cheerfully to submit to what they knew they could not avoid, their exit was commonly preceded with a feast, and their funeral with a feast; but if they endeavoured to shun it, as it sometimes happened, both ceremonies were performed with the deepest mourning. In the former, they rejoiced at their deliverance, and being admitted into bliss; in the latter, they bewailed their cowardly excluding themselves from it. Much the same thing was done towards those wives who betrayed a backwardness to follow their dead husbands.\n\nWe must likewise observe, that, in these funerals, as well as in all their other feasts, they were famed for able for drinking to excess; and one may say of them, above all the other descendants of the ancient Celtes, that their hospitality, banquets, &c. consisted much more in the quantity of strong liquors, than in the elegance of eating. Beer and strong mead, which were their natural drink, were looked upon as the chief promoters of health, strength, fertility, and bravery; upon which account, they made no scruple to indulge themselves to\nGermany: the utmost in them, not only in their feasts, and especially before an engagement, but even in their common meals.\n\nThe modern Germans in their persons are tall and strong built. The ladies have generally fine complexions; and some of them, especially in Saxony, have all the delicacy of features and shape that are so bewitching in a certain island of Europe.\n\nBoth men and women affect rich dresses, which in fashion are the same as in France and England; but the better sort of men are excessively fond of gold and silver lace, especially if they are in the army. The ladies at the principal courts differ not much in their dress from the French and English, only they are not so excessively fond of paint as the former. At some courts they appear in rich furs; and all of them are loaded with jewels, if they can obtain them. The female part of the burghers families, in many German towns, dress in a very different manner, and some of them inconceivably fantastic, as may be seen in many prints published in books of travels; but in this respect they are gradually reforming, and many of them make quite a different appearance in their dress from what they did 30 or 40 years ago. As to the peasantry and labourers, they dress as in other parts of Europe, according to their employments, conveniency, and opulence. In Westphalia, and most other parts of Germany, they sleep between two feather beds, or rather the upper one of down, with sheets stretched to them, which by use becomes a very comfortable practice. The most unhappy part of the Germans are the tenants of little needy princes, who squeeze them to keep up their own grandeur; but, in general, the circumstances of the common people are far preferable to those of the French.\n\nThe Germans are naturally a frank, honest, hospitable people, free from artifice and disguise. The higher orders are ridiculously proud of titles, ancestry, and show. The Germans, in general, are thought to want animation, as their persons promise more vigour and activity than they commonly exert even in the field of battle. But when commanded by able generals, especially the Italians, such as Montecuccoli and Prince Eugene, they have done great things, both against the Turks and the French. The Imperial arms have seldom made any remarkable figure against either of those two nations, or against the Swedes or Spaniards, when commanded by German generals. This possibly might be owing to the arbitrary officinity of the court of Vienna; for in many wars the Austrians have exhibited prodigies of military valour and genius.\n\nIndustry, application, and perseverance, are the great characteristics of the German nation, especially the mechanical part of it. Their works of art would be incredible were they not visible, especially in watch and clockmaking, jewellery, turnery, sculpture, drawing, painting, and certain kinds of architecture. The Germans have been charged with intemperance in eating and drinking; and perhaps not unjustly, owing to the vast plenty of their country in wine and provisions of every kind. But those practices seem now to be wearing out. At the greatest tables, though the guests drink pretty freely during dinner, yet the repast is commonly finished by coffee after three or four public toasts have been drank. But no people have more feasting at marriages, funerals, and birthday days.\n\nThe German nobility are generally men of so much honour, that a sharper in other countries, especially in England, meets with more credit if he pretends to be a German, than of any other nation.\n\nThe merchants and tradesmen are very civil and obliging. All the sons of noblemen inherit their father's titles, which greatly perplexes the heralds and genealogists of that country. This perhaps is one of the reasons why the German husbands are not quite so complaisant as they ought otherwise to be to their ladies, who are not entitled to any pre-eminence at the table; nor indeed do they seem to affect it, being far from either ambition or loquacity, though they are said to be somewhat too fond of gaming. From what has been premised, it may easily be conceived, that many of the German nobility, having no other hereditary estate than a high founding title, easily enter into their armies, and those of other sovereigns. Their fondness for title is attended with many other inconveniences. Their princes think that the cultivation of their lands, though it may treble their revenue, is below their attention; and that, as they are a species of beings superior to labourers of every kind, they would demean themselves in being concerned in the improvement of their grounds.\n\nThe domestic diversions of the Germans are the same as in England; billiards, cards, dice, fencing, dancing, and the like. In summer, people of fashion repair to places of public resort, and drink the waters. As to their field diversions, besides their favourite one of hunting, they have bull and bear baiting, and the like. The inhabitants of Vienna live luxuriously, a great part of their time being spent in feasting and carousing; and in winter, when the several branches of the Danube are frozen over, and the ground covered with snow, the ladies take their recreation in fedges of different shapes, such as griffins, tygers, swans, scollop-shells, &c. Here the lady sits, dressed in velvet, lined with rich furs, and adorned with laces and jewels, having on her head a velvet cap; and the fedge is drawn by one horse, flag, or other creature, set off with plumes of feathers, ribands, and bells. As this diversion is taken chiefly in the nighttime, servants ride before the fedge with torches, and a gentleman sitting on the fedge behind guides the horse.\n\nThe Reformation first spread in Germany to most advantage; and since the religious peace of 1555, there have been established the Roman Catholic, prevailing mostly in the south; the Lutheran in the north; and the Calvinist, called also the Reformed, near the Rhine. Civil wars considerably deranged this settlement; it was, however, established by the celebrated peace of Westphalia, that the religion of the Seven States should remain as in 1624. The Roman superior clergy consist of 8 archbishops, 40 bishops, and many abbots. The Protestant clergy are governed by confestories under the sovereign of each state. The Corpus Catholicorum is under the direction of the archbishop, elector of Mentz; and the Corpus Evangelicum, or Protestants, under the elector of Saxony; who have the care of the public concerns of their respective bodies.\nLiterature is in a very advanced state throughout almost all Germany, but particularly in the Protestant states. It is but about half a century since the German language has been purified and cultivated; since which various works of taste and elegance, as well as superior productions in the different walks of science, have appeared in it. There are 38 universities in Germany; 19 Protestant, 17 Catholic, and two which partake of both; besides a number of literary societies and academic institutions: and education in general is particularly attended to even in the very lowest ranks.\n\nWe have said nothing of the part which the states of Germany, either individually or as a body, naturally took in the late revolution in France. It would indeed be only an unnecessary repetition of the history of transactions already detailed under France and Britain. Of the changes in the government of particular states, or rather in the names of the rulers, we shall say nothing. These changes, made at the instigation of France, will probably not satisfy the inordinate ambition and growing power of her present ruler, and therefore will not be permanent.","sp":335,"ep":357},{"h":"GERMEN","t":"the seed bud; defined by Linn\u00e6us to be the base of the pistillum, which contains the rudiments of the seed; and, in progress of vegetation, swells and becomes the seed vessel.

Millet, wheat, and several of the grasses, rise in one day; blite, spinach, beans, mustard, kidney beans, turnips, and rocket, in three days; lettuce and dill, in four; cucumber, gourd, melon, and cress, in five; radish and beet, in six; barley, in seven; orach, in eight; purlain, in nine; cabbage, in ten; hyssop, in thirty; parsley, in forty or fifty days; peach, almond, walnut, chestnut, peony, horned poppy, hypecoum, and ranunculus falcatus, in one year; rose bush, cornel tree, hawthorn, medlar, and hazel nut, in two. The seeds of some species of orchis, and of some liliaceous plants, never rise at all. Of seeds, some require to be sowed almost as soon as they are ripe, otherwise they will not sprout or germinate. Of this kind are the seeds of coffee and fraxinella. Others, particularly those of the pea-bloom flowers, prefer their germinating faculty for a series of years. Mr Adanson affirms, that the fenfutive plant retains that virtue for 30 or 40 years.\n\nAir and water are the agents of germination. The humidity of the air alone makes several seeds to rise that are exposed to it. Seeds too are observed to rise in water, without the intervention of earth; but water without air is insufficient. Mr Homberg's experiments on this head are decisive. He put several seeds under the exhausted receiver of an air pump, with a Gerontes view to establish something certain on the caules of germination. Some of them did not rise at all; and the greatest part of those which did, made very weak and feeble productions. Thus it is for want of air that seeds which are buried at a very great depth in the earth, either thrive but indifferently, or do not rise at all. They frequently preserve, however, their germinating virtue for many years within the bowels of the earth; and it is not unusual, upon a piece of ground being newly dug to a considerable depth, to observe it soon after covered with several plants, which had not been seen there in the memory of man. Were this precaution frequently repeated, it would doubtless be the means of recovering certain species of plants which are regarded as lost; or which perhaps, never coming to the knowledge of botanists, might hence appear the result of a new creation. Some seeds require a greater quantity of air than others. Thus purlain which does not rise till after lettuce in the free air, rises before it in vacuo; and both prosper but little, or perish altogether, while cresses vegetate as freely as in the open air.","sp":357,"ep":357},{"h":"GERONTES","t":"in antiquity, a kind of judges, or magistrates, in ancient Sparta, answering to what the Areopagites were at Athens.

Having finished his studies in France, he travelled into Italy, and taught medicine and philosophy in his own country with extraordinary reputation. He was acquainted with the languages; and excelled so much in natural history, that he was surnamed the Pliny of Germany. He died in 1564, leaving many works behind him; the principal of which are, 1. A history of animals, plants, and fossils; 2. Bibliotheca Universalis, a Greek and Latin lexicon. This author is by Boerhaave emphatically styled Monstrum Eruditionis, \"a prodigy of learning.\" These indeed (as Mr Coxe observes in his Letters on Switzerland) \"who are conversant with the works of this great scholar and naturalist, cannot repress their wonder, and admiration at the amplitude of his knowledge in every species of erudition, and the variety of his discoveries in natural history, which was his peculiar delight. Their wonder and admiration is still further augmented, when they consider the gross ignorance of the age which he helped to enlighten, and the scanty succours he possessed to aid him in thus extending the bounds of knowledge; that he composed his works, and made those discoveries which would have done honour to the most enlightened period, under the complicated evils of poverty, sickness, and domestic uneasiness.\"","sp":358,"ep":358},{"h":"GESNER","t":"Solomon, the celebrated author of the Death of Abel and many other admired works in the German language, was born at Zurich in the year 1730. In his early years he showed very few signs of superior abilities; and his progress in the rudiments of education was so slow, that his matter gave him up as incapable of any greater attainments than writing and the four first rules of arithmetic. Upon this he was placed under a clergyman in the neighbourhood, a relation of his father's, and who showed himself better acquainted with the art of discovering the natural inclinations of his pupils. This gentleman often carried young Gesner with him into the fields, where he made him observe the beauties of nature; and finding that he took greater pleasure in such lessons, and seemed to listen to them with peculiar attention, he occasionally repeated some of the most striking passages of the ancient authors, who have written on these subjects, in the most agreeable and pleasing manner. By this ingenious artifice, the mind of young Gesner began to open, and its powers to expand; and it is, perhaps, owing to this circumstance, that he became so fond of the language of Virgil and Theocritus. When he arrived at a proper age to think of pursuing some line of business, Mr Gesner made choice of that of a bookseller, which was the profession of his father, and in some measure of his family. Of five houses at Zurich in the printing and book-selling business, two were occupied by Gesners: one belonged to two brothers of that name; and the other, that in which our poet had a share, was known by the firm of Orel, Gesner, and Company. It was known also by the extent of its correspondence, and by the choice and elegance of the works which it gave to the public.\n\nThough Mr Gesner was a bookseller, he did not, however, damp his genius, by submitting to the drudgery of business. He indulged himself freely in pursuing his favourite object, and his partners never envied him that time which he devoted to meditation and study. In 1752, he made a tour through Germany, not so much for the purpose of extending his commerce, as to see and be acquainted with those authors who have done honour to their country. The following circumstance, which occurred during this tour, deserves to be mentioned, as it is strikingly characteristic of that timidity which often accompanies true genius. When Mr Gesner was at Berlin, he was admitted into a literary society, of which Gleim and Leffing were members. Each of the authors who composed it used to read in turn some pieces of their own composition, and Mr Gesner was very desirous of submitting to these able critics a small work, which was his first attempt; but was far from resembling those poets, whom Horace and other satirists have ridiculed, and who stun every one they meet by reciting their verses before them. As each of the members had done reading, Gesner was observed to move his hand with a kind of tremor towards his pocket, and to draw it back again without the manuscript which he ought to have produced. Having not as yet published anything, none of the company could guess the cause of a motion which his modesty prevented him from explaining. The work which he had not the courage to show, was his small poem, entitled Night, which he published on his return to Zurich in 1753. It was considered as an original, of which no model is to be found among the moderns; but in the opinion of the author, it was only a piece of imaginary painting, or, to use an expression of his own, in one of his letters to Mr Huber who has translated his works, \"A caricature composed in the moments of folly or intoxication.\" In this little poem he has introduced a short episode on the origin of the glow-worm, containing a poetical explanation of this natural phosphorus, which has all the beauty of Ovid's Metamorphoses without their prolixity. The success of this essay emboldened the too timid muse of our young bookseller, and he published a pastoral romance, called Daphnis, in three cantos. The applause that was deservedly bestowed upon this performance induced the author to publish, some time after, his Idylls and some other rural poems in imitation of those of Theocritus. Pastoral poetry, which at this time was little known in Germany but by translations from foreign poets, began to find many partizans, and to be preferred to every other kind. Desirous, therefore, of tracing out a new path for himself, our poet thought that he could not do a more acceptable service to his countrymen, than to paint the felicity of innocence and rural life, and the tender emotions of love and gratitude. The only author worthy of notice who had preceded Mr Gesner in this career, was Mr Ro\u00df of Leipzig, whose pastoral poems appeared for the first time in 1744. This writer polished the language of the German shepherds; he had address enough to unite spirit and simplicity in a kind\nof writing which appears insipid without the former, and which becomes unnatural and disgusting if it is too abundant. He sometimes throws a delicate veil over those images which are deficient in decency, but it is to be regretted that it is often too light. Such was the antagonist against whom Gefner had to contend. Our poet, however, pursued a different course. Instead of placing, like Rott, his scenes in modern times, he goes back with Theocritus to the golden age, that happy age which we are fond of reviewing when our passions are calm, and when freed from those anxious cares which hurry us beyond ourselves, we contemplate amidst tranquility the beauties and fertility of the country. The characters of Gefner's Idylls, therefore, are taken from those societies which exist no longer but in the remembrance, or rather the imagination. His shepherds are fathers, children, and husbands, who blush not at these titles so dear to nature, and to whom generosity, beneficence, and respect for the Deity are sentiments no less familiar than love. These Idylls were the principal and favourite object of his pursuit, and that part of his work which acquired him the greatest reputation, especially among his countrymen. His death of Abel, which is well known, was published for the first time in 1758. It is written, like the rest of his pieces, in poetical prose; and was so much sought after, that it went through no less than three editions in the space of a year, without speaking of the spurious ones which appeared in Holland, at Berlin, and in France. The French edition was followed by several others. One came out in Italian; another in the Dutch language; a fourth in the Danish; and lastly, two in English, one of them in prose and the other in verse. Among the pieces which Mr Gefner published after the Death of Abel was his First Navigator, a poem in three cantos, which many people in Germany consider as his masterpiece. He made an attempt also in the pastoral drama, but not with the same success as in other kinds of rural poetry. He produced likewise, in the same style, Evander and Alcinus, in three acts; and Eratius, a small piece of one act, which was represented with some applause in several societies, both at Leipzig and Vienna.\n\nBut though poetry was Gefner's darling pursuit, and though he enriched the literature of his country with works which will render his name immortal, he did not confine himself to one manner of imitating nature; he in turns took up the pencil and the pen, and his active genius equally directed them both. In his infancy he had received a few lessons in drawing, and he had afterwards pursued this study, but without any intention of becoming an artist. At the age of thirty he felt that violent desire, which may be considered as the voice of genius; and this was in some measure excited by the sight of a beautiful collection formed by Mr Heidegger, whose daughter he had married. To please his father-in-law, he studied this treasure, composed principally of the best pieces of the Flemish school; and to this new taste he had almost sacrificed every other. Mr Gefner at first ventured only to delineate some decorations for the frontispieces of curious books printed in his office; but by little and little he had the courage to make other attempts. In 1765, he published ten landscapes etched and engraved by himself, and dedicated them to his friend Mr Watlet. Mr Gefner owed him this mark of respect for the care which he took to ornament with beautiful vignettes Mr Huber's translation of his Idylls. Twelve other pieces appeared in 1769; and after these attempts, Mr Gefner executed ornaments for many works which came from his press, among which were his own works, a German translation of Swift, and several others.\n\nWere we to judge from Mr Gefner's enthusiasm for his favourite pursuits, and from the time and attention which he bestowed upon them, we should be apt to conclude, that he found little leisure for discharging his duty as a citizen. The contrary however, was the case, for he passed almost the half of his life in the first employments of the state. In 1765 he was called to the grand council, in 1767 to the lesser. In 1768 he was appointed bailiff of Elsbach, that of the four guards in 1776, and in 1781 superintendent of waters, which office in 1787 was continued to him for six years. In all these stations Mr Gefner discharged his duty with the most scrupulous fidelity; and died of a paralytical disorder, lamented by his countrymen and by those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, on the 2d of March 1788, at the age of 56.\n\nAs a pastoral poet, Gefner undoubtedly is entitled to a very distinguished rank: and we may justly say, that if he has been equalled by any, he has been excelled by none. It is commonly believed, that pastoral poetry is very limited and confined; but those who read the works of Gefner will be convinced, that it is susceptible of much variety when treated by the hand of a master. His pastoral romance of Daphnis is not inferior in natural simplicity to the celebrated work of Longus; but it surpasses it far in variety of images and incident. Eratius and Evander are instructive and interesting poems, on account of the contrast between the world and nature which reigns throughout them; and his First Navigator unites the mildest philosophy to all the splendour and imagery of Fairy Land. If we analyze his dramatic poems, we shall find in them interesting fictions, characters well delineated, and situations replete with novelty. His language is that of the Graces, and the chattel ears might listen to the love which he has created. If he has sometimes the humour of Sterne and Fontaine, it is without their licentiousness. The fervent taste can find in his writings, no lacuna to supply, no phrase deserving reprehension, nor could a more ingenious choice of expressions be substituted in the room of those which he has adopted.\u2014Gefner's character as a man, appears to be no less amiable. In whatever point of view we consider him, whether as a husband, a father, a friend, a magistrate, or a citizen, his virtues are equally conspicuous. He was naturally of a melancholy turn, but he was no enemy to rational and well-timed mirth; while the mildness and affability of his temper rendered his company always engaging, and endeared him to those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance. Possessed of that nobleness of sentiment, united with great modesty, which is the usual attendant of true genius, he was simple in his external appearance, as well as in his conversation. His language was lively and animated; but his reserve before strangers resembled timidity,\nGETHERIN and it was only in the presence of those with whom he was acquainted, that his real character appeared in its full luster.\n\nMr. Gethin's reputation and virtues were known even to the remotest parts of Europe. The empress of Russia Catharine II. presented him with a gold medal as a mark of her esteem. Strangers of all nations gave him no less flattering testimonies of their admiration; and travellers thought they had seen only the half of Switzerland, if they had not been in the company of Gethin, or procured some of his landscapes or drawings. In this last way he had acquired so much reputation, that he was ranked among the best artists of Germany; and Mr. Fueflin, his countryman, who was himself a painter, in the preface to the third volume of the new edition which he published of his \"Historical essay on the painters, engravers, architects, and sculptors, who have done honour to Switzerland,\" gives a distinguished place to Mr. Gethin, though then living.","sp":358,"ep":360},{"h":"GESNERIA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the didynamia class, and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, Perianthae.

There is a picture of the whole transaction in the townhouse. Ghent is surrounded with walls and other fortifications, and is tolerably strong for a place of its circumference. But all the ground within the walls is not built upon. The streets are large and well paved, the market places spacious, and the houses built with brick. But the Friday's market place is the largest, and is remarkable for the statue of Charles V., which stands upon a pedestal in the imperial habit. That of Cortere is remarkable for a fine walk under several rows of trees. In 1737 a fine opera house was built here, and a guard house for the garrison. Near the town is a very high tower, with a handsome clock and chimes. The great bell weighs 11,000 pounds.\n\nThis town is famous for the pacification signed here, in 1526, for settling the tranquility of the Seventeen Provinces, which was afterwards confirmed by the king of Spain. It was taken by Louis XIV. in 1678, who\nwho afterwards restored it. The French took possession of it again after the death of Charles II. of Spain. In 1706, it was taken by the duke of Marlborough; and by the French in 1793; but it was retaken the same year.

These three ghosts are distinguished by the names of Manes, Spiritus, Umbra. The manes, they fancied, went down into the infernal region; the spirit ascended to the skies; and the umbra hovered about the tomb, as being unwilling to quit its old connexions. Thus Dido (Virg. Aen. iv. 384.) threatens Aeneas after death that she will haunt him with her umbra, whilst her manes rejoices in his torments below. This idea of a threefold soul is very clearly expressed in these lines, which have been attributed to Ovid.\n\nBis duo sunt homini: Manes, Caro, Spiritus, Umbra:\nQuatror si qua loci bis duo supponant.\nTerra tegit Carnem, tumulum circumvolat Umbra,\nOrcus habet Manes, Spiritus affra petit.\n\nThe most striking outlines of the popular superstitions respecting ghosts among us, are thus humorously collected by Captain Geofe in his Provincial Glossary:\n\n\"A ghost is supposed to be the spirit of a person deceased, who is either commissioned to return for some special errand, such as the discovery of a murder, to procure restitution of lands or money unjustly withheld from an orphan or widow\u2014or, having committed some injustice whilst living, cannot rest till that is redressed. Sometimes the occasion of spirits revisiting this world, is to inform their heir in what secret place, or private drawer in an old trunk, they had hidden the title deeds of the estate; or where, in troublesome times, they buried their money or plate. Some ghosts of murdered persons, whose bodies have been secretly buried, cannot be at ease till their bones have been taken up, and deposited in consecrated ground with all the rites of Christian burial.\n\n\"Sometimes ghosts appear in consequence of an agreement made, whilst living, with some particular friend, that he who first died should appear to the survivor.\n\n\"Glanvil tells us of the ghost of a person who had lived but a disorderly kind of life, for which it was condemned to wander up and down the earth, in the company of evil spirits, till the day of judgment.\n\n\"In most of the relations of ghosts, they are supposed to be mere aerial beings, without substance, and that they can pass through walls and other solid bodies at pleasure. A particular instance of this is given, in relation the 27th, in Glanvil's collection, where one David Hunter, near-herd to the bishop of Down and Connor, was for a long time haunted by the apparition of an old woman, whom he was by a secret impulse obliged to follow whenever she appeared, which he says he did for a considerable time, even if in bed with his wife: and because his wife could not hold him in his bed, he would go too, and walk after him till day, though the saw nothing; but his little dog was so well acquainted with the apparition, that he would follow it as well as his master. If a tree stood in her walk, he observed her always to go through it. Notwithstanding this seeming immateriality, this very ghost was not without some substance; for, having performed her errand, she desired Hunter to lift her from the ground; in the doing of which, he says, she felt just like a bag of feathers. We sometimes also read of ghosts striking violent blows; and that, if not made way for, they overturn all impediments, like a furious whirlwind. Glanvil mentions an instance of this, in relation 17th, of a Dutch lieutenant who had the faculty of seeing ghosts; and who, being prevented making way for one which he mentioned to some friends as coming towards them, was, with his companions, violently thrown down, and sorely bruised. We further learn, by relation 16th, that the hand of a ghost is 'as cold as a clod.'\n\n\"The usual time at which ghosts make their appearance is midnight, and seldom before it is dark; though some audacious spirits have been said to appear even by daylight: but of this there are few instances, and those mostly ghosts who have been laid, perhaps in the Red Sea (of which more hereafter), and whose times of confinement were expired: these, like felons confined to the lighters, are said to return more troublesome and daring than before. No ghosts can appear on Christmas eve; this Shakespeare has put into the mouth of one of his characters in Hamlet.\n\n\"Ghosts commonly appear in the same dress they usually wore whilst living, though they are sometimes clothed all in white; but that is chiefly the churchyard ghosts, who have no particular business, but seem to appear pro bono publico, or to scare drunken rustics from tumbling over their graves.\n\n\"I cannot learn that ghosts carry tapers in their hands, as they are sometimes depicted, though the room in which they appear, if without fire or candle, is frequently said to be as light as day. Dragging chains is not the fashion of English ghosts; chains and black vestments being chiefly the accoutrements of foreign spectres seen in arbitrary governments: dead or alive, English spirits are free. One instance, however, of an English ghost dressed in black is found in the celebrated ballad of William and Margaret, in the following lines:\n\nAnd clay cold was her lily hand\nThat held her sable shroud.\n\nThis, however, may be considered as a poetical license, used, in all likelihood, for the sake of the opposition of lily to sable.\n\n\"If, during the time of an apparition, there is a lighted candle in the room, it will burn extremely blue: this is so universally acknowledged, that many eminent philosophers have busied themselves in accounting for it, without once doubting the truth of the fact. Dogs, too, have the faculty of seeing spirits, as is intimated in...\"\nDavid Hunter's relation above quoted; but in that case they usually show signs of terror, by whining and creeping to their master for protection; and it is generally supposed that they often see things of this nature when their owner cannot; there being some persons, particularly those born on a Christmas eve, who cannot see spirits.\n\n\"The coming of a spirit is announced some time before its appearance, by a variety of loud and dreadful noises; sometimes rattling in the old hall like a coach and six, and rumbling up and down the stair-case like the trundling of bowls or cannon balls. At length the door flies open, and the spectre stalks slowly up to the bed's foot, and opening the curtains, looks steadfastly at the person in bed by whom it is seen; a ghost being very rarely visible to more than one person, although there are several in company. It is here necessary to observe, that it has been universally found by experience, as well as affirmed by diverse apparitions themselves, that a ghost has not the power to speak till it has been first spoken to; so that, notwithstanding the urgency of the business on which it may come, everything must stand still till the person visited can find sufficient courage to speak to it: an event that sometimes does not take place for many years. It has not been found that female ghosts are more loquacious than those of the male sex, both being equally restrained by this law.\n\n\"The mode of addressing a ghost is by commanding it, in the name of the Three Persons of the Trinity, to tell you who it is, and what is its business; this it may be necessary to repeat three times; after which it will, in a low and hollow voice, declare its satisfaction at being spoken to, and desire the party addressing it not to be afraid, for it will do him no harm. This being premised, it commonly enters into its narrative; which being completed, and its request or commands given, with injunctions that they be immediately executed, it vanishes away, frequently in a flash of light; in which case, some ghosts have been so considerate as to desire the party to whom they appeared to shut their eyes: sometimes its departure is attended with delightful music. During the narration of its business, a ghost must by no means be interrupted by questions of any kind; so doing is extremely dangerous: if any doubts arise, they must be stated after the spirit has done its tale. Questions respecting its state, or the state of any of their former acquaintance, are offensive, and not often answered; spirits perhaps being restrained from divulging the secrets of their prison house. Occasionally spirits will even condescend to talk on common occurrences, as is instanced by Glanvil in the apparition of Major George Sydenham to Captain William Dyke, relation 10th, wherein the major reproved the captain for suffering a sword he had given him to grow rusty: saying, 'Captain, captain, this sword did not use to be kept after this manner when it was mine.' This attention to the state of arms, was a remnant of the major's professional duty when living.\n\n\"It is somewhat remarkable that ghosts do not go about their business like the persons of this world. In cases of murder, a ghost, instead of going to the next justice of the peace, and laying its information, or to the nearest relation of the person murdered, appears to some poor labourer who knows none of the parties, draws the curtains of some decrepit nurse or alms woman, or hovers about the place where his body is deposited. The same circuitous mode is pursued with respect to redressing injured orphans or widows; when it seems as if the shortest and most certain way would be, to go to the person guilty of the injustice, and haunt him continually till he be terrified into a reformation. Nor is the pointing out lost writings generally managed in a more summary way; the ghost commonly applying to a third person ignorant of the whole affair, and a stranger to all concerned. But it is presumptuous to scrutinize too far into these matters; ghosts have undoubtedly forms and customs peculiar to themselves.\n\n\"If, after the first appearance, the persons employed neglect, or are prevented from, performing the mischief or business committed to their management, the ghost appears continually to them, at first with a discontented, next an angry, and at length with a furious countenance, threatening to tear them in pieces if the matter is not forthwith executed; sometimes terrifying them, as in Glanvil's relation 26th, by appearing in many formidable shapes, and sometimes even striking them a violent blow. Of blows given by ghosts there are many instances, and some wherein they have been followed with an incurable lameness.\n\n\"It should have been observed, that ghosts, in delivering their commissions, in order to ensure belief, communicate to the persons employed some secret, known only to the parties concerned and themselves, the relation of which always produces the effect intended. The business being completed, ghosts appear with a cheerful countenance, saying they shall now be at rest, and will never more disturb any one; and, thanking their agents, by way of reward communicate to them something relative to themselves, which they will never reveal.\n\n\"Sometimes ghosts appear, and disturb a house, without deigning to give any reason for doing so; with these, the shortest and only way is to exorcise, and eject them; or, as the vulgar term is, lay them. For this purpose there must be two or three clergymen, and the ceremony must be performed in Latin; a language that strikes the most audacious ghost with terror. A ghost may be laid for any term less than 100 years, and in any place or body, full or empty; as, a solid oak\u2014the pommel of a sword\u2014a barrel of beer, if a yeoman or simple gentleman\u2014or a pipe of wine, if an esquire or a justice. But of all places the most common, and what a ghost least likes, is the Red Sea; it being related, in many instances, that ghosts have most earnestly besought the exorcists not to confine them in that place. It is nevertheless considered as an indubitable fact, that there are an infinite number laid there, perhaps from its being a safer prison than any other nearer at hand; though neither history nor tradition gives us any instance of ghosts escaping or returning from this kind of transportation before their time.\n\n\"Another species of human apparition may be here noticed, though it does not come under the strict description of a ghost. These are the exact figures and resemblances of persons then living, often seen not only by their friends at a distance, but many times by themselves;\nGIA\n\nof which there are several instances in Aubery's Miscellanies: one of Sir Richard Napier, a physician of London, who being on the road from Bedfordshire to visit a friend in Berkshire, saw at an inn his own apparition lying on his bed as a dead corpse; he nevertheless went forward, and died in a short time: another of Lady Diana Rich, daughter of the earl of Holland, who met her own apparition walking in a garden at Kennington, and died a month after of the smallpox. These apparitions are called fetches; in Cumberland, swarts; and in Scotland, swraiths: they most commonly appear to distant friends and relations, at the very instant preceding the death of the person whose figure they put on. Sometimes, as in the instances above mentioned, there is a greater interval between the appearance and death.\" For a philosophical inquiry into the subject of apparitions in general, see the article SPECTRE.","sp":361,"ep":363},{"h":"GIACH","t":"in Chronology, a cycle of 12 years; in use among the Turks and Cathayans.\n\nEach year of the giach bears a name of some animal: the first that of a mouse; the second that of a bullock; the third of a lynx or leopard; the fourth of a hare; the fifth of a crocodile; the sixth of a serpent; the seventh of a horse; the eighth of a sheep; the ninth of a monkey; the tenth of a hen; the eleventh of a dog; and the twelfth of a hog.\n\nThey also divide the day into 12 parts, which they call giachs, and distinguish them by the name of some animals.

It is commonly thought, that the stature of men hath been the same in all ages; and some have even pretended to demonstrate the impossibility of the existence of giants mathematically. Of these our countryman Mr. Laurin hath been the most explicit. \"In general (says he) it will easily appear, that the efforts tending to destroy the cohesion of beams arising from their own gravity only, increase in the quadruplicate ratio of their lengths: but that the opposite efforts tending to preserve their cohesion, increase only in the triplicate proportion of the same lengths. From which it follows, that the greater beams must be in greater danger of breaking than the lesser similar ones; and that though a lesser beam may be firm and secure, yet a greater similar one may be made so long, that it will necessarily break by its own weight. Hence Galileo justly concludes, that what appears very firm, and succeeds very well in models, may be very weak and infirm, or even fall to pieces by its own weight, when it comes to be executed in large dimensions according to the model. From the same principle he argues, that there are necessary limits in the operations of nature and art, which they cannot surpass in magnitude. Were trees of a very enormous size, their branches would fall by their own weight. Large animals have not strength in proportion to their size; and if there were any land animals much larger than those we know, they could hardly move, and would be perpetually subject to the most dangerous accidents. As to the animals of the sea, indeed, the case is different; for the gravity of the water in a great measure sustains those animals; and in fact there are known sometimes to be vastly larger than the greatest land animals. Nor does it avail against this doctrine to tell us, that bones have sometimes been found which were supposed to have belonged to giants of immense size; such as the skeletons mentioned by Strabo and Pliny, the former of which was 60 cubits high, and the latter 40: for naturalists have coalesced on just grounds, that in some cases these bones had belonged to elephants; and that the larger ones were bones of whales, which had been brought to the places where they were found by the revolutions of nature that have happened in past times. Though it must be owned, that there appears no reason why there may not have been men who have exceeded by some feet in height the tallest we have seen.\"\n\nIt will easily be seen, that arguments of this kind can never be conclusive; because, along with an increase of stature in any animal, we must always suppose a proportional increase in the cohesion of the parts of its body. Large works sometimes fail when constructed on the plan of models, because the cohesion of the materials whereof the model is made, and of the large work, are the same; but a difference in this respect will produce a very remarkable difference in the ultimate result. Thus, suppose a model is made of firwood, the model may be strong and firm enough; but a large work made also of fir, when executed according to the plan of the model, may be so weak that it will fall to pieces by its own weight. If, however, we make use of iron for the large work instead of fir, the whole will be sufficiently strong, even though made exactly according to the plan of the model. The like may be said with regard to large and small animals. If we could find an animal whose bones exceeded in hardness and strength the bones of other animals as much as iron exceeds fir, such an animal might be of a monstrous size, and yet be exceedingly strong. In like manner, if we suppose the flesh and bones of a giant to be greatly superior in hardness and strength to the bones of other men, the great size of his body will be no objection at all to his strength. The whole of the matter therefore concerning the existence of giants must rest on the credibility of the accounts we have from those who pretend to have seen them, and not on any arguments drawn a priori.\n\nIn the Scripture we are told of giants, who were produced from the marriages of the sons of God with the daughters of men. This passage indeed has been differently interpreted, so as to render it doubtful whether the word translated giants does there imply any extraordinary stature. In other parts of Scripture, however, giants, with their dimensions, are mentioned in such a manner that we cannot possibly doubt; as in the case of Og king of Bashan, and Goliath. In a memoir read before the Academy of Sciences at Rouen, M. Le Cat gives the following account of giants that are said to have existed in different ages.\n\n\"Profane historians have given seven feet of height...\"\nDavid Hunter's relation above quoted; but in that case they usually show signs of terror, by whining and creeping to their master for protection; and it is generally supposed that they often see things of this nature when their owner cannot; there being some persons, particularly those born on a Christmas eve, who cannot see spirits.\n\n\"The coming of a spirit is announced some time before its appearance, by a variety of loud and dreadful noises; sometimes rattling in the old hall like a coach and six, and rumbling up and down the stairs\u2014like the trundling of bowls or cannon balls.

It has not been found that female ghosts are more loquacious than those of the male sex, both being equally restrained by this law.\n\n\"The mode of addressing a ghost is by commanding it, in the name of the Three Persons of the Trinity, to tell you who it is, and what is its business; this it may be necessary to repeat three times; after which it will, in a low and hollow voice, declare its satisfaction at being spoken to, and desire the party addressing it not to be afraid, for it will do him no harm. This being premised, it commonly enters into its narrative; which being completed, and its request or commands given, with injunctions that they be immediately executed, it vanishes away, frequently in a flash of light; in which case, some ghosts have been so considerate as to desire the party to whom they appeared to shut their eyes; sometimes its departure is attended with delightful music. During the narration of its business, a ghost must by no means be interrupted by questions of any kind; so doing is extremely dangerous: if any doubts arise, they must be stated after the spirit has done its tale. Questions respecting its state, or the state of any of their former acquaintance, are offensive, and not often answered; spirits perhaps being restrained from divulging the secrets of their prison house. Occasionally spirits will even condescend to talk on common occurrences, as is instanced by Glanvil in the apparition of Major George Sydenham to Captain William Dyke, relation 10th, wherein the major reproved the captain for suffering a sword he had given him to grow rusty: saying, 'Captain, captain, this sword did not use to be kept after this manner when it was mine?' This attention to the state of arms, was a remnant of the major's professional duty when living.\n\n\"It is somewhat remarkable that ghosts do not go about their business like the persons of this world. In cases of murder, a ghost, instead of going to the next justice of the peace, and laying its information, or to the nearest relation of the person murdered, appears to some poor labourer who knows none of the parties, draws the curtains of some decrepit nurse or alms woman, or hovers about the place where his body is deposited. The same circuitous mode is pursued with respect to redressing injured orphans or widows; when it seems as if the shortest and most certain way would be, to go to the person guilty of the injustice, and haunt him continually till he be terrified into a restitution. Nor is the pointing out lost writings generally managed in a more summary way; the ghost commonly applying to a third person ignorant of the whole affair, and a stranger to all concerned. But it is presumptuous to scrutinize too far into these matters: ghosts have undoubtedly forms and customs peculiar to themselves.\n\n\"If, after the first appearance, the persons employed neglect, or are prevented from, performing the mischief or business committed to their management, the ghost appears continually to them, at first with a discontented, next an angry, and at length with a furious countenance, threatening to tear them in pieces if the matter is not forthwith executed; sometimes terrifying them, as in Glanvil's relation 26th, by appearing in many formidable shapes, and sometimes even striking them a violent blow. Of blows given by ghosts there are many instances, and some wherein they have been followed with an incurable lameness.\n\n\"It should have been observed, that ghosts, in delivering their commissions, in order to ensure belief, communicate to the persons employed some secret, known only to the parties concerned and themselves, the relation of which always produces the effect intended. The business being completed, ghosts appear with a cheerful countenance, saying they shall now be at rest, and will never more disturb any one; and, thanking their agents, by way of reward communicate to them something relative to themselves, which they will never reveal.\n\n\"Sometimes ghosts appear, and disturb a house, without deigning to give any reason for doing so: with these, the shortest and only way is to exorcise, and eject them; or, as the vulgar term is, lay them. For this purpose there must be two or three clergymen, and the ceremony must be performed in Latin; a language that strikes the most audacious ghost with terror. A ghost may be laid for any term less than 100 years, and in any place or body, full or empty; as, a solid oak\u2014the pommel of a sword\u2014a barrel of beer, if a yeoman or simple gentleman\u2014or a pipe of wine, if an esquire or a justice. But of all places the most common, and what a ghost least likes, is the Red Sea; it being related, in many instances, that ghosts have most earnestly besought the exorcists not to confine them in that place. It is nevertheless considered as an indisputable fact, that there are an infinite number laid there, perhaps from its being a safer prison than any other nearer at hand; though neither history nor tradition gives us any instance of ghosts escaping or returning from this kind of transportation before their time.\n\n\"Another species of human apparition may be here noticed, though it does not come under the strict description of a ghost. These are the exact figures and resemblances of persons then living, often seen not only by their friends at a distance, but many times by themselves;\nselves; of which there are several instances in Aubery's Miscellanies: one of Sir Richard Napier, a physician of London, who being on the road from Bedfordshire to visit a friend in Berkshire, saw at an inn his own apparition lying on his bed as a dead corpse; he nevertheless went forward, and died in a short time: another of Lady Diana Rich, daughter of the earl of Holland, who met her own apparition walking in a garden at Kennington, and died a month after of the smallpox. These apparitions are called fetches; in Cumberland, fixarts; and in Scotland, swraiths: they most commonly appear to distant friends and relations, at the very instant preceding the death of the person whose figure they put on. Sometimes, as in the instances above mentioned, there is a greater interval between the appearance and death.\" For a philosophical inquiry into the subject of apparitions in general, see the article Spectre.","sp":363,"ep":365},{"h":"GIBBET","t":"or GIBET, a machine in manner of a gallows, whereon notorious criminals, after execution, are hung in irons or chains, as spectacles in terrorum.

He was the son of a gentleman of fortune and family distinction, who sat as a member in two separate parliaments. Edward when a boy, was of such an extremely delicate constitution, that his life was frequently despaired of. When at the school of Westminster, his progress was often retarded by repeated shocks of bad health. After being for a long time under the management of the best medical practitioners, his constitution was radically changed for the better, which induced his father to place him in Magdalen college as a gentleman commoner, that he might be pushed into manly acquisitions. This was prior to the completing of his fifteenth year. Before this time his reading had been of such a nature as to store his mind with much valuable historical knowledge, although his grammatical and philosophical knowledge at this time was not so extensive as that of some others at the same period of life. He says of himself, I arrived at Oxford with a stock of erudition that might have puzzled a doctor, and a degree of ignorance of which a school-boy would have been ashamed. Under such circumstances he was but ill prepared to receive the benefits of an university education, and this was no doubt the reason why he exclaimed so bitterly against the public and private instructions at Oxford.\n\nHe was fond of polemical divinity from his infancy, and during his leisure moments he turned his attention, when farther advanced, to the celebrated controversy between Papists and Protestants; and as he had not then acquired talents sufficient to enable him to combat error\nerror and defend the truth, he fell a victim to the fo-\nphility of the church of Rome. His father, with a\nview to reclaim him from the love of what he consider-\ned as the most destructive of all errors, sent him to\nLausanne in Switzerland, and put him under the care\nof Mr Pavilliard, a clergyman of the Calvinistic per-\nsuasion. This gentleman called his pupil Edward,\n\"A little thin figure, with a large head, disputing,\nand urging with the greatest ability, all the best ar-\nguments that had ever been used in favour of Popery.\"\nThe masterly exertions of Mr Pavilliard, who had to\ndeal with a young man of solid reason and matured re-\nflection, accomplished the recantation of Mr Gibbon,\nand he received the sacrament in the Protestant church\non the 25th of December 1754. At Lausanne, too,\nhe made great progress in many branches of knowledge\nwhich he had hitherto neglected, and acquired a regu-\nlar habit of study. He became master of the French\nand Latin languages, and was a profound logician.\nHe gave full scope to the exercise of reading excellent\nauthors, which was his ruling passion. He did not\nappear fond of mathematics, and therefore soon relin-\nquished the study of them. At Lausanne he fell in\nlove with a young lady, the daughter of a village cler-\ngyman, but he was frustrated in his hopes, and the\nlady became afterwards the wife of the celebrated\nNecker.\n\nOn his return home in April 1758, his father re-\nceived him with every mark of tenderness and affection,\nand his mother-in-law found means to conciliate his\ngood opinion and his confidence. It is a singular cir-\ncumstance that he should have taken a captain's com-\nmission in the army, a profession, one would have im-\nagined, for which he was very ill calculated. Indeed\nhe soon evinced the truth of this, for his tent and quar-\nters were frequently encumbered with the odd furni-\nture of Greek and Latin authors. On the event of\npeace he resigned his commission, and paid a visit to\nParis in the year 1763, where he resided a few months,\nand afterwards went to Lausanne, where he remained\nabout a year, in order to prepare for a journey into\nItaly, which he accomplished in 1765. He thus speaks\non the occasion of his entering Rome: \"After a sleep-\nless night, I trod, with a lofty step, the ruins of the\nforum; each memorable spot, where Romulus stood, or\nTully spoke, or Caesar fell, was at once present to my\neye; and several days of intoxication were lost or en-\njoyed before I could descend to a cool and minute in-\nvestigation.\" On the 15th of October, he informs us,\nthe idea of writing the decline and fall of Rome first\ncame into his mind, when the bare-footed friars were\nringing vespers in the temple of Jupiter.\n\nIn the year 1770 Mr Gibbon lost his father, and\nsucceeded to an estate which was very much involved;\nyet he considered his circumstances as very well adapted\nto the great and extensive work he had undertaken to\naccomplish, which in his own opinion he had probably\nnever finished, if he had been either poorer or richer\nthan he was. He had an extensive circle of acquaint-\nance in London, but the time necessarily devoted to\ntheir company, he made up by early rising and intense\napplication. In the year 1774 he was chosen member\nof parliament for the borough of Liskeard, by the in-\nfluence of Lord Elliot, which threatened to give his\nstudies a very serious interruption. He sat eight years\nin the house of commons without having the courage so\nmuch as once to open his mouth, notwithstanding he\nwas such an elegant writer. When the first volume of\nhis \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" made its\nappearance in 1776, it met with a greater degree of\napplause than he expected; but by no praise was he so\nhighly gratified as by that which the two great histori-\nans of Scotland, Hume and Robertson, bestowed upon\nhim. For his two chapters which relate to the spread\nof christianity he met with many antagonists, to whom\nhe made no reply but to a Mr Davis, which was con-\nsidered as a masterpiece. There can be no doubt that\nGibbon was a real enemy to revelation in the disguise\nof a believer, a conduct not so abominable as at first\nsight may appear, so long as penal laws exist against\nan open declaration of opinion.\n\nSoon after the publication of the first volume of his\nhistory, he paid another visit to Paris, and did not ap-\npear to be in much haste to complete his extensive\nwork. In 1781, however, the second and third vol-\numes of his history were given to the world; and, al-\nthough in the estimation of many competent judges\nthey were inferior to the first, they still were allowed\nto possess sufficient merit to support his reputation.\nHaving lost his seat for Liskeard, the influence of min-\nistry brought him in as representative for Lymington,\nand on the dissolution of Lord North's ministry,\nhe lost his office as one of the lords of trade, which was\na serious diminution of his income. He again deter-\nmined to visit his favourite Lausanne, where he com-\npleted the remaining volumes of his history; but when\nthe revolutionary mania began to rage on the conti-\nnent, he quitted Lausanne, and sought for an asylum\nin England. He mortally hated innovations of every\nkind, whether necessary or not, as appears from the\nfollowing exclamation: \"I beg leave to subscribe my\naffection to Mr Burke's creed on the revolution of France.\nI admire his eloquence, I approve his politics, I adore\nhis chivalry, and can almost excuse his reverence for\nchurch establishments.\"\n\nDuring his consoling visit to Lord Sheffield, who\nhad met with a trying domestic loss, his attention was\ncalled to the rapid progress of a distemper which had\nsubsided for about 30 years. A mortification at last\nenfeebled, which terminated his existence on the 16th of\nJanuary 1794, in the 67th year of his age. Mr Gib-\nbon gives himself a character which is perhaps pretty\nnear the truth. \"I am endowed with a cheerful tem-\nper, a moderate sensibility, and a natural disposition to\nrepose rather than to activity: some mischievous appe-\ntites and habits have perhaps been corrected by philo-\nsophy or time. The love of study supplies each day,\neach hour, with a perpetual source of independent and\nrational pleasure.\" Mr Gibbon possessed the manners\nand sentiments of a gentleman in an eminent degree;\nhe was easy in society, of which he was extremely fond,\nand beloved by all who had the pleasure of intimately\nknowing him.","sp":368,"ep":369},{"h":"GIBBOS","t":"in Astronomy, a term used in reference to the enlightened parts of the moon, whilst she is moving from the first quarter to the full, and from the full to the last quarter: for all that time the dark part appears horned or falcated; and the light one hunched out, convex, or gibbous.","sp":370,"ep":370},{"h":"GIBBOUS","t":"a term in medicine, denoting any pro-\ntuberance or convexity of the body, as a person hunch-\ned or hump-backed.\n\nInfants are much more subject to gibbosity than adults,\nand it oftener proceeds from external than internal\ncauses.

The Gibellins stood for the emperor against the pope; but concerning their origin and the reason of their names we have but a very obscure account. According to the generality of authors, they rose about the year 1240, upon the emperor Frederick II.'s being excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX. Other writers maintain, that the two factions arose ten years before, though still under the same pope and emperor.

Lat. 36\u00b0 6' W. Long. 5\u00b0 17'. To the ancients it was known by the name of Calpe, and was also called one of the Pillars of Hercules; by the Arabians it is called Gebel Tarek, that is, \"the mouth of Tarek,\" from Tarek the name of the Saracen general who conquered Spain in the beginning of the eighth century. The whole is an immense rock, rising perpendicularly about 440 yards, measuring from north to south about two English miles, but not above one in breadth from east to west.\u2014The town lies along the bay on the west side of the mountain on a declivity; by which, generally speaking, the rains pass through it, and keep it clean. The old town was considerably larger than the new, which at present consists of between 400 and 500 houses. Many of the streets are narrow and irregular; the buildings are of different materials; some of natural stone out of the quarries, some of fictitious or artificial stone, and a few of brick. The people are supplied with fresh provisions chiefly from the coast of Barbary, with fruit, roots, and vegetables of all sorts from thence, or from their own gardens. Besides what is properly called the town, there are several spacious and commodious public edifices erected; such as barracks for the soldiers, with apartments for their officers, magazines of different kinds, storehouses for provisions, &c. The inhabitants, exclusive of the British subjects dependent on the garrison, or who reside there from other motives, consist of some Spaniards, a few Portuguese, a considerable number of Genoese, and about as many Jews; making in the whole, according to Dr Campbell, between two and three thousand, without reckoning the garrison; though some make them much fewer. This town may be said to have two ports; the first lying to the north, and is proper only for small vessels; the other is very commodious for large vessels, and has a fine stone quay. The bay is very beautiful and capacious, being in breadth about five miles, and in length eight or nine, with several small rivers running into it. It is very advantageous to the place. There is no ground to be found in the middle of it at 100 fathoms depth, so that a squadron may lie there in great safety; the breezes from it are very refreshing; and it contributes likewise\nGibraltar, likewise to the subsistence of the inhabitants, by supplying them with plenty of fish.\n\nThe strait of Gibraltar, through which the ocean passes into the Mediterranean, thereby dividing Europe from Africa, runs from west to east about 13 leagues. In this strait there are three remarkable promontories or capes on the Spanish side, and as many opposite to them on the Barbary side. The first of these, on the side of Spain, is Cape Trafalgar, opposite to which is Cape Spartel; and in the neighbourhood of this stood the fortresses of Tangier, once in the possession of the British. The next on the Spanish side is Tarifa; and over against it lies Malabata, near the town of Alcazar, where the straits are about five leagues broad. Lastly, Gibraltar facing the mountain of Abyla, near the fortresses and town of Ceuta, which make the eastern entry of the straits.\n\nThis important fortress seems to have been first particularly noticed as a place of consequence in the year 712. At that time the general of the caliph Al-Walid landed with an army of 12,000 men on the isthmus between Mount Calpe and the continent; and that he might secure an intercourse with Africa, ordered a castle to be built on the face of that hill. Part of the building still remains; and, from an inscription discovered above the principal gate, appears to have been finished in 725. It continued in the possession of the Saracens till the beginning of the 14th century, when it was recovered by Ferdinand king of Castile. In 1333, however, it was obliged to surrender to the son of the emperor of Fez, who came to the assistance of the Moorish king of Granada. An attempt was made upon it in 1349 by Alonso king of Castile; but when the fortress had been reduced to the last extremity, a pestilential fever broke out in the Spanish camp, which carried off the king himself, with great part of his army; after which the enterprise was abandoned.\n\nThe fortresses continued in the possession of the Saracen descendants of the prince of Fez until the year 1410, when it was taken possession of by Joseph III., king of Granada. A design of attacking it was formed by Henry de Guzman in 1435; but the enterprise having miscarried through his imprudence, he was defeated and slain. However, it was at length taken after a gallant defence by his son John de Guzman in 1462; since which time it has remained in the hands of the Christians. In 1542, it was surprised and pillaged by Piali Hamet, one of Barbarossa's corsairs; but the pirates having fallen in with some Sicilian galleys, were by them defeated, and all either killed or taken.\n\nIn the reign of Charles V., the fortifications of Gibraltar were modernized, and such additions made as to render them almost impregnable. It was taken by the English, however, in the reign of Queen Anne, and since that time has remained in their possession; and probably will always do so, unless ceded by treaty, as it appears altogether impossible to reduce it by any force of artillery, let it be ever so great. In the year 1704, in consequence of the resolution adopted by the court of Britain to assist the archduke Charles in his pretensions to the Spanish crown, Sir George Rooke was sent with a powerful fleet into the Mediterranean. His orders being limited, nothing of consequence was done for some time, until at last an attempt on Gibral-\n\nVol. IX. Part II.\nGibraltar, and supposing that the garrison would be off their guard and secure on account of the vicinity of their fleet, they formed the rash design of attempting to surprize the place, though the British admiral was still before it. In this mad attempt 500 volunteers associated, taking the sacrament never to return unless they accomplished their purpose. They were conducted by a goat-herd to the south side of the rock near the cave guard, at that time called the pass of leucif trees. This they mounted, and lodged themselves the first night in the cave of St Michael; the next they scaled Charles V.'s Wall; surprized and massacred the guard at Middle hill; where afterwards, by ropes and ladders, several hundreds of the party designed to support them were hauled up: but being discovered, they were attacked by a strong party of grenadiers, and all of them at last either killed or taken. These brave adventurers were to have been supported by a body of French troops, and some feints were proposed to draw off the attention of the garrison; but, through the disagreement of the commanding officers, these proposals were not put in execution, and thus the volunteers were left to their fate.\n\nNotwithstanding these misfortunes, the Spaniards still continued the siege, and fitted out a strong squadron from Cadiz, with a design to intercept the convoys of provisions which might be sent to the garrison; flattering themselves at the same time, that, on the arrival of their fleet, Sir John would be obliged to retire, and the garrison of consequence to surrender to their united attacks. They continued their fire therefore with additional fury, dismounted many of the cannon, and did essential injury to the works in several different places. The prince of Hesse, however, was by no means deficient in his endeavours to disappoint their expectations. As it was probable that an attempt might be made to storm the curtain, a cuvette was dug in the ditch, which was filled by the tide, and a double row of palliades placed parallel to the works. The chambers of the mine under the glacis were loaded, and all means taken to defeat such an attempt; but on a sudden the Spaniards seemed to have altered their design, and threatened an attack on the lines which the garrison had on the declivity of the hill to flank the glacis, and overlook their advanced works. While affairs remained in this situation, part of the succours they had long expected arrived in the bay, December 7, 1704, and in two days after, the remainder came in with near 2000 men, along with a proportionable quantity of ammunition and provisions. These had failed from Cape Spartel under convoy of four frigates; but were in imminent danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, whose fleet they mistook for their own; however they escaped by the fortunate circumstance of being becalmed, so that they could not get up to them.\n\nSir John Leake having thus powerfully reinforced the garrison, thought his presence in the bay no longer necessary, and therefore let fall for Lisbon, where he arrived about the end of the year. In the beginning of January 1705 the Spaniards were reinforced by a considerable body of infantry, and on the 11th of the month made an attack on the extremity of the King's Lines, but were repulsed. The attack was renewed next day with 600 grenadiers, French and Walloons, supported by 1000 Spaniards, under Lieutenant General Gibraltar Fuy. They disposed themselves in such a manner as showed an intention to storm a breach which had been made in the Round Tower at the extremity of the King's Lines, and another in the intrenchment on the hill. The retrenchment which covered the latter breach, with part of the intrenchment joining the precipice of the rock, was defended at night by a captain, three subalterns, and 90 men; but it was customary for the captain to withdraw, with two subalterns and 60 men, at daybreak. The Round Tower was defended by 180 men, commanded by a lieutenant-colonel. The marquis, by defectors from the garrison, had obtained intelligence of the strength of these posts, and planned his attack accordingly. The detachment for the upper breach mounted the rock at midnight, and concealed themselves in the cliffs until the captain had withdrawn; after which, advancing to the point of the intrenchment, they threw grenades on the subaltern and his party, so that they were obliged to leave the place. At the same time 300 men stormed the Round Tower, where Lieutenant Colonel Bar made a vigorous defence, though the enemy, having passed the breach above, annoyed them on the flanks with great stones and grenades. Observing, however, the Spaniards marching down to cut off his retreat from the town, he retired; and, by getting over the parapet of the King's Lines, descended into the covered way, where the English guards were posted. Thus the garrison were alarmed; all the regiments were assembled at their proper posts; and Captain Fisher endeavoured to stop the progress of the enemy with 17 men, but they were repulsed, and himself taken prisoner. At this juncture, however, the Tower was retaken by Lieutenant Colonel Moncal at the head of 400 or 500 men, after it had been in the possession of the enemy upwards of an hour.\n\nThe garrison was now farther reinforced by six companies of Dutch troops and 200 English soldiers, together with some provisions and stores. The assailants, however, were still determined to go on. The marquis de Villadarias was superseded by Mar\u00e9chal Teff\u00e9, a Frenchman, with whom Admiral Pointis was desired to co-operate in blocking up the place. The mar\u00e9chal therefore joined the army with four fresh battalions, besides eight companies which had been sent before; the ordnance, which had been greatly injured by constant use, was exchanged for others, and the works, as they then stood, put into the best repair. On the part of the English, a reinforcement was ordered under the command of Sir Thomas Dilkes and Sir John Hardy, to join Admiral Leake at Lisbon; which junction being effected, the whole fleet, consisting of 28 English, 4 Dutch, and 8 Portuguese men of war, having on board two battalions of land forces, set sail from Lisbon. Happily for the besieged, however, the incessant rains and storms about this time had retarded the operations of the land forces, and greatly distressed the fleet, owing to the enemy. Eight ships of the latter were forced from their anchors by the strong westerly wind, and obliged to drive aloft. At this critical period Sir John Leake, with the allied fleet, entered the straits. On his approach the few remaining French ships put out to sea; and the British admiral discovering five sail making out of the bay, and a gun fired at them from the garrison,\nThe garrison was now so well supplied, that Mar\u00e9chal Telle withdrew his troops from the trenches, and formed a blockade, drawing an intrenchment across the isthmus to prevent the garrison from ravaging the country. The prince of Hesse remained for some time in the place, where he repaired the batteries, and made some additions to the fortifications; after which he joined the archduke Charles at Lisbon. As the latter, however, was resolved to try his fortune with the earl of Peterborough in Valencia and Catalonia, the prince was sent back to Gibraltar to prepare part of the garrison for embarkation, and soon after was followed by the whole fleet. Major General Ramos was now appointed governor of Gibraltar, in which only two new battalions were left, as nothing was to be feared from the enemy. The new governor, however, brought with him 400 men for the greater security of the place; but soon resigned his government to Colonel Roger Elliot, during whose time Gibraltar was made a free port by a special order from the queen.\n\nColonel Elliot was succeeded by Colonel Congreve before the year 1714, and he by Colonel Cotton a short time after. In 1720 the Spaniards seem to have threatened another attack. Ceuta, a Spanish fortress in Barbary, had been for many years besieged by the Moors; and a powerful armament, commanded by the marquis de Lada, was now assembled in Gibraltar bay, under pretence of relieving the African fortress, but with a secret design of first surprising Gibraltar; for which purpose they had provided scaling ladders, &c. The armament, however, had not been fitted out with such secrecy, but that the British ministry had intelligence of it. On this they sent orders to Colonel Kane, governor of Minorca, to embark with part of his garrison for Gibraltar under convoy of the fleet in the Mediterranean. On his arrival he found the place in a critical situation. The garrison consisted only of three weak battalions under Major Hetherington, besides whom there was only one other field officer, Major Batteroux, in the place, and no more than 14 days provisions remaining. The posture of affairs, however, was altered by the arrival of Colonel Kane with 500 men, with provisions and ammunition; which reinforcement, together with the spirited behaviour of the British commodore, induced the Spanish commander to abandon his design, though he remained of opinion that the fortress might then have been carried by a general assault.\n\nNotwithstanding this disappointment, the Spaniards continued to keep a watchful eye over Gibraltar; and, in the latter end of the year 1726, assembled an army in the neighbourhood of Algeciras, encamping, on the 20th of January following, on the plain below St Roch, and erecting a battery on the beach to protect their camp. Though Admiral Hopson was then at anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, yet, as he had received no intelligence of the actual commencement of hostilities between Britain and Spain, he was obliged to allow the boats of the latter to pass with provisions, arms, and ammunition, between Algeciras and the camp, at the same time that colonel, afterwards Brigadier Kane, who had been a second time sent from Minorca, lay under similar embarrassments. The operations of the Spaniards, however, seemed so evidently to tend towards an attack, that the governor thought proper to order such of that nation as were in the town to leave it, and to forbid their galleys to anchor under his guns (A).\n\nThe count de las Torres commanded the Spanish forces, amounting to near 20,000 men; and soon after forming his camp, he advanced within reach of the garrison. The brigadier then desired him to keep out of his reach, otherwise he should do his utmost to force him; but to this the Spanish commander replied, that, as the garrison could command no more than they had power to maintain, he should obey his Catholic majesty's orders, and encroach as far as possible. Hostilities, however, were not commenced until the 16th of February 1727, when the Spaniards, having brought materials for batteries to the old windmill on the neutral ground, it was determined in a council of war, that the Spanish general had commenced hostilities by encroaching so far on the liberties of the garrison. Still, however, the governor sent to the count to know the reason of breaking ground before the garrison; but received for answer, that \"he was in his master's territories, and was not answerable to any other person for his conduct.\" On this the governor opened the batteries of the Old Mole and those of Willis upon the Spanish workmen; however, they persisted on carrying on their operations, and at night marched a party down to the Devil's Tower, where they immediately broke ground, and began a communication with their other works. The governor was now informed by some deserters, that the enemy were forming a mine in a cave under Willis's Battery, with a design to blow it up; but the plot being thus happily discovered, a party was immediately stationed to cut off the communication. On the 22d of February the Spaniards opened on the garrison with 17 pieces of cannon besides mortars; and the day following Brigadier Kane left Gibraltar to send a reinforcement from Minorca. On the 3d of March the enemy opened a new battery of 22 guns, on the Old Mole, and on the 8th another of 15 guns, bearing also upon the same mole, the guns of which had annoyed the western flank of their approaches.\n\nAll this time the garrison had kept up a constant and well directed fire from the batteries which bore upon the works of the enemy; but the ordnance in general being old, were frequently bursting; by which they suffered more than from the fire of the besiegers.\n\n(A) At this time the fortifications of Gibraltar were considerably different from what they had been in 1705. Several works were erected on the heights above the lines called Willis's Batteries; the Prince's Lines were extended to the extremity of the rock, and an inundation was formed out of the morafs in front of the grand battery.\nGibraltar. The latter were also greatly distressed by the fleet under Admiral Hopson and Sir Charles Wager, who, since the beginning of the siege, had intercepted their home-bound ships, and at the same time greatly benefited the garrison by bringing the prizes into the bay. Finding the Spaniards, however, obstinately bent on their enterprise, they formed a design, on the 2d of April, to bombard Algiers, from whence the besiegers were supplied with various articles of ammunition; but the fleet happening to be becalmed, the design was afterwards unaccountably abandoned; and on the arrival of a reinforcement from Minorca, they failed to the westward, leaving the garrison to defend themselves the best way they could.\n\nThe enemy continued to augment their batteries, and erect new ones, until they amounted at last to 60 cannon besides mortars; and, on the 3d of May, the governor received intelligence that a general assault was intended; to repel which he took every proper precaution. The enemy, however, still added to their approaches, and considerable reinforcements were received by both parties. Hostilities, however, ceased on the 12th, when news arrived that the preliminaries of a general peace were signed; from which time to the year 1779, no farther attempts were made on Gibraltar.\n\nIn the course of these two sieges the loss of the Spaniards was very considerable; that of 1705 counting them not less than 10,000 men, including those who died of sickness; and in that of 1727 their loss was computed at near 3000, besides casualties, which could not be ascertained. That of the garrison amounted in 1705 to 400; and in 1727 to 300; a very small number, considering that during the siege 70 cannon and 30 mortars burnt on the batteries.\n\nThe hostile manifesto presented by the Spanish ambassador to the court of London at the commencement of the late war, was soon followed by an interruption of communication between Spain and the fortresses of Gibraltar. No direct intention of attacking or distressing it, however, was manifested till the 16th of July, when the port was completely blocked up by a squadron of two 74 gun ships, several frigates, galleys, &c. Ten days after they began to form a camp on the plain below St Roch, three miles from the fortresses. The garrison at this time consisted of 5382 men, including officers, with a company of engineers and artificers; but the greatest expectations were formed from the abilities and valour of General Elliot the governor. As soon as the breaking off the communication with Spain indicated approaching hostilities, the governor took every precaution that could be suggested by military wisdom; but though informed of the rupture between the two courts having actually taken place, and though he beheld the hostile operations of the enemy, no means were used to interrupt them till the 12th of September, when the batteries of Green's Lodge, Willis, and Queen Charlotte, were opened for a few hours, with a view to disturb the workmen.\n\nFrom this time to the beginning of the year 1780 the enemy continued the blockade both by sea and land, but without doing any damage to the works or garrison, and it was not until the 12th of January that a single person was wounded. This happened to be a woman, who, passing near one of the houses, was slightly hurt by a shot from the enemy. In the meantime, however, the usual supplies of provisions being cut off, the garrison began to feel all the horrors of famine. All the necessaries of life were very scarce, and to be procured only at exorbitant prices. Veal, mutton, and beef, sold from half a crown to four shillings per pound; fresh pork from two to three shillings; salted beef and pork fifteenpence; fowls eighteen shillings per couple; ducks a guinea; firewood, five shillings per hundred weight; a pint of milk and water fifteenpence; a small cabbage cwt five shillings, and a small bunch of outer leaves fivepence; Irish butter half a crown per pound; candles as much; and eggs sixpence each. As the rock, however, is almost surrounded by the sea, it was natural to suppose, that in such a scarcity of other provisions great benefit would have been derived from the ocean; but the fishermen, being all foreigners, and under no regulation, took advantage of the present scarcity of provisions in the garrison to exact a most exorbitant price for the fish they supplied.\n\nHad matters remained long in this state, it is plain that the fortresses, however strong, must have fallen into the hands of the enemy. They were, however, effectually relieved in consequence of the victory gained by Admiral Rodney over the Spanish fleet commanded by Don Juan de Langara. The former had been furnished with a strong squadron, in order to relieve this important fortress; with which having met fail, he in a few days fell in with a Spanish fleet of 16 transports bound from Bilboa to Cadiz, and laden with provisions and naval stores, convoyed by a man of war of 64 guns, four frigates, and two armed vessels. Of these only a single transport escaped, the rest being all captured on the 8th of January 1780; and the loss of them, at the same time that it promised to be very serviceable to the garrison, was equally detrimental to the enemy, who were now in great want both of provisions and materials for their shipping.\n\nThis advantage was soon after followed by a much greater. On the 16th of the same month a Spanish squadron of 11 sail of the line was discovered off Cape St Vincent; and the British admiral having taken the proper methods to come up with them as quickly as possible, an engagement took place about four in the afternoon. At this time the headmost ships of the British line closed in with the nearest of the enemy, and in half an hour one of the Spaniards, mounting 70 guns, and having on board 600 men, blew up, and all on board perished. In two hours more another Spanish ship of the line was taken; notwithstanding which the fight continued with great vigour till two in the morning, when the headmost ship of the enemy struck to the Sandwich; after which the firing ceased. The weather throughout the night was so tempestuous that it was with the utmost difficulty the British could take possession of those ships which surrendered. There were six in number, but two of them drove ashore and were lost, only four being brought safe into Gibraltar. These were the admiral's ship of 80 guns and 700 men, with three others of 70 guns and 600 men. The engagement, however, happened so near the shore, and the British were so eager in securing the lee gage to prevent the enemy's escape, that Admiral Rodney's ship, together with some of the largest in the fleet, were in great danger of running on the shoals of St Lucar; nor\nGibraltar, nor could they be got into deep water again without much labour and the exertion of great naval skill. It was the opinion of all who were present in the action, that had this engagement happened in the daytime, or had the weather been less boisterous, not one of the Spanish ships could have escaped; and even as it was, those which got off were so essentially damaged as to be unfit for service.\n\nThe news of this important victory arrived at Gibraltar on the evening of the day after it was fought; and in two days more the garrison was completely relieved by the arrival of the fleet and convoy, at the same time that they were farther reinforced by a regiment of Highlanders, consisting of 1051 men, officers included. An opportunity was also taken of sending away with the fleet all the invalids and women in the garrison; with whom they fell foul on the 10th of February, leaving in the bay only the Edgar and Panther ships of the line, with two frigates.\n\nOn the departure of the British fleet the blockade was immediately resumed; and notwithstanding the ample supplies lately received, the garrison soon began again to experience the inconvenience of wanting fresh provisions. It had hitherto received these in abundance from the coast of Barbary; but an unaccountable alteration had now taken place, so that the friendship of the emperor of Morocco was transferred from Great Britain to Spain in a manner totally unprecedented. His partiality towards the latter was the more surprising, as Britain had given no provocation, and the enmity between Spain and Morocco seemed to be in a manner constitutional, and founded upon such causes as could never cease to operate. Thus, however, the garrison became daily more and more distressed, from being obliged to make constant use of their salt provisions, and even this with the strictest economy. The industry and resolution of the British seamen and officers, indeed, sometimes overcame all obstacles, so that they found means to procure the necessary refreshments; though in so doing they were certainly exposed to the utmost danger from the enemy. At the same time the defence of the garrison was so vigorous, that while it continued to be supplied even in this scanty manner, the Spaniards began to lose all hope of reducing it; for which reason they formed a project of burning all the British shipping in the bay.\n\nThe night appointed for putting this scheme in execution was the 6th of June 1780, when 10 fire-ships, favoured by an uncommon darkness, stood over from the Spanish to the British side of the bay. Their design was to set fire to the storehouses nearest to the water side, as well as to the shipping there; but having been too precipitate in firing their ships, and being received also by a very heavy cannonade, the attempt was frustrated. On this occasion the skill and intrepidity of the British seamen were eminently displayed. Having manned their boats, they grappled the fire ships already in flames; and, notwithstanding their dreadful appearance and the danger of their exploding, towed them clear of the vessels under the walls, and extinguished them.\n\nThe failure of this project was a grievous disappointment to Don Barcelo the Spanish admiral, who lay ready with his squadron to intercept the British vessels that might attempt to escape; at the same time that the batteries on their lines were in readiness to bombard the town, if the fire-ships had succeeded in causing any conflagration on shore. The failure of the present attempt, however, was soon followed by other disasters. As soon as they had, with great labour, Spanish works destroyed, they were certainly destroyed by the besieged; and their mortification on these occasions was the greater, as it was usual for the governor to allow them to complete their works before he commenced his destructive operations. Thus the labour of many days was often lost in a few hours, and afterwards was to be resumed with as little prospect of success as before. The garrison was now considerably annoyed by the Spanish gun boats, to which indeed the shipping was equally exposed with themselves. These were very Spanish fells from 30 to 40 tons burden, constructed so that they gun boats lay low in the water, which rendered them difficult to be aimed at. They had 15 oars on a side, carried 40 or 50 men, with a 26 pounder on the prow; and, from the facility of managing them, two were deemed, in calm weather to be a match for a frigate of moderate size. All their efforts, however, could still do no more than to reduce the garrison to great straits for want of provisions; and to this dreadful inconvenience the British submitted with the greatest cheerfulness. From the time of Admiral Rodney's departure in the month of February 1780 to the month of October, almost the only provisions in the garrison were such as tended to produce the scurvy; which accordingly raged in such a manner, as to threaten the most fatal consequences. An antidote, however, was happily procured by the capture of a Danilii dogger from Malaga laden with lemons and oranges, which the governor immediately purchased for the use of the garrison and distributed among them. \"At this time (says Captain Drinkwater) the scurvy had made dreadful ravages in our hospitals, and more were daily confined; many however unwilling to yield to its first attacks, persevered in their duty to the more advanced stages. It was therefore not uncommon, at this period, to see men, who, some months before, were hale, and capable of enduring any fatigue, supporting themselves to their posts upon crutches, and even with that assistance scarcely able to move along. The most fatal consequences in short were to be apprehended to the garrison from this terrible disorder, when this Dane was happily directed to our relief.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Cairncross, an eminent surgeon, who was present during this siege, \"the scurvy which it now raged in Gibraltar, differed in no respect from that disease usually contracted by sailors in long sea voyages; and of which the immediate cause seemed to be the subsisting for a length of time upon salted provisions only, without a sufficient quantity of vegetables or other acidulent foods. The circumstances related in the voyage of that celebrated circumnavigator Lord Anson of consolidated fractures disuniting, and the callusness of the bone being perfectly dissolved, occurred frequently in our hospitals, and old sores and wounds opened anew from the nature of the disorder. Various antiflatuses were used without success, such as acid of vitriol, four court, extract of malt, essence of spruce, &c.; but the only specifics were fresh lemons and oranges given liberally; or, when they could not\nHe procured, the preserved juice in such quantities, from one to four ounces per day, as the patient could bear. Whilst the lemons were found, from one to three were administered each day as circumstances directed. The juice given to those in the most malignant state was sometimes diluted with sugar, wine, or spirits; but the convalescents took it without dilution. Women and children were equally affected; nor were the officers exempted from this dreadful disorder. It became almost general at the commencement of the winter season, owing to the cold and moisture, and in the beginning of spring when vegetables were scarce. The juice was preserved by adding to 60 gallons of expressed liquor about five or ten gallons of brandy, which kept it in a wholesome state, that several casks were opened in good condition at the close of the siege. The old juice, however, was not so speedily efficacious as the fruit, though by persevering longer in its use it seldom failed.\n\nTill this month the allowance of salt provisions had continued undiminished; but now it was judged necessary to reduce the allowance of bread and meat, and to make some other regulations in order to enforce the strictest economy with regard to food. Everything of this kind that could be practised, however, seemed insufficient to preserve the garrison from absolute want. In the beginning of the year 1781 provisions became exceedingly scarce, by reason of the almost total expenditure of what was contained in the public stores, and the vigilance of the enemy's cruisers. About the middle of February the town bakers left off work for want of flour; and many of the poorer sort wanted bread. The price of fresh provisions again rose to a most enormous height. Small pigs sold at two guineas; turkeys at three; geese at 30 shillings; fowls and ducks at 20 shillings; damaged biscuit a shilling the pound; pease 18d.; and all other necessaries in proportion; at the same time the scarcity of fuel was such, that it was sometimes scarcely procurable in quantity sufficient to dress the victuals.\n\nThe garrison had hitherto derived assistance occasionally from the gardens on the neutral ground, though vast quantities of vegetables had been removed thence by the enemy. Towards the end of the month of October 1780, however, the Spaniards determined to expel the British from the gardens entirely; and this they accomplished in spite of all that could be done to prevent them. From this time the resources with regard to vegetables depended entirely upon the attention paid to cultivation; which, happily for the garrison, was attended with such success, especially during the winter months, that the produce came at last to be nearly equal to the demand. At last, on the 12th of April 1781, supplies were brought by the British fleet under Admirals Darby, Digby, and Roos, though they could not be got in without great difficulty. The gun boats already mentioned were now much increased in number and strength of construction; infesting the bay in such a manner as greatly to interrupt the embarkation of the stores. As no vessels of the same kind had been prepared to oppose them, they could scarce be prevented from effecting their purpose of burning the store ships. With this view they had approached them every morning in hazy weather to the number of between 20 and 30, several of them carrying Gibraltar mortar-pieces; and as they used both sails and oars, they eluded all pursuit, by withdrawing on the rise of any breeze. To keep off these troublesome guests, several stout frigates were obliged to station themselves along the bay for the protection of the shipping; but even this did not prevent them from continuing their molestation; and notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of the British sailors, it was seldom that they could come near enough to do them any damage. In spite of all their endeavours, however, the garrison was effectually relieved: an exploit which so exceedingly irritated the court of Spain, that they determined to exhaust the utmost force of the kingdom rather than fail in the execution of their favourite project. The works before the town were therefore carried on with more than usual vigour than ever, and the most tremendous preparations made to cause the obstinate garrison feel the resentment of an exasperated enemy. Their batteries were now mounted with guns of the heaviest metal, and with mortar pieces of the largest size; the number of the former augmented to near 200, and of the latter to upwards of 80. For three weeks this prodigious artillery continued to pour forth an almost incessant shower of shot and shells, informing that, in the time just mentioned, they had consumed 100,000lb. of gunpowder, and thrown into the town four or five thousand shot or shells every 24 hours.\n\nBy such an immense bombardment the town was almost totally laid in ruins. The inhabitants, computed at more than 3000 in number, experienced every difficulty that could arise from the destruction of their habitations: several of them were killed, and all forced to leave the town, and take shelter under tents with what accommodation could be provided for them in such scenes of horror and confusion. Numbers took the opportunity of retiring with the fleet; while many that remained were now reduced from a state of opulence to the greatest distress. The conduct of Governor Elliot was very humane and compassionate to such as were inclined to depart; allowing them a free passage to England, and supplying them with provisions for the voyage.\n\nDuring this bombardment, not only the greatest part of the effects belonging to the inhabitants were destroyed, but the fortifications were in many places greatly injured; and the worst was, that the remainder were destroyed by the soldiers, who had arrived at such behaviour a pitch of licentiousness, that they neither regarded diet, nor would obey their officers. They were incited to this destructive scheme by the avarice of some of the inhabitants who had hoarded up and concealed a quantity of necessary articles, in order to procure an advanced price. They now, therefore, kept no bounds in dissipation, waste, and extravagance; a remarkable instance of which is given by Captain Drinkwater, in their roasting a pig by a fire made of cinnamon. To put a stop to these atrocious proceedings, rigorous measures were of necessity adopted; and it was intimated, that any soldier convicted of being drunk or asleep upon his post, or found marauding, should be immediately executed. The loss of human lives during this dreadful bombardment was less than could have been expected; but many remarkable circumstances are taken notice\nGibraltar. notice of by Captain Drinkwater, some of which are related in the note (B.)\n\nBy the beginning of June 1781, the enemy had relaxed considerably in their firing, seldom exceeding 600 shot in a day; and continued gradually to diminish this number so remarkably, that towards the end of August they seldom fired in the day, and only discharged five or seven, and sometimes not above three, shot in the night. The batteries at land, however, were succeeded by the gun boats; which renewed their attacks every day, keeping the garrison in continual alarm, and never failing to do more or less execution.\n\nTo restrain them, therefore, a battery of guns capable of throwing their shot to a great distance was erected as near as possible to the enemy; and as it reached their very camp, it was determined to open it upon them as often as the gun boats made their attacks; which being soon perceived, they thought it prudent to desist in some measure from that mode of hostility.\n\nThey continued still, however, to improve their works, and for this purpose employed the best engineers both of France and Spain; so that by the latter part of November 1781, they had brought them to such a state of perfection as filled both kingdoms with the most sanguine expectations of success. Governor Elliot, however, far from being dismayed at these formidable bulwarks, suffered them to proceed without molestation to the end of their scheme, that he might as in a moment destroy the labour of so many months, and thus render the disappointment the greater. In the night of the 27th of November, a chosen party of 2000 men were detached, in order to destroy the enemy's works and batteries; and their success was equal to their most sanguine expectations. They marched out in great order and silence about two o'clock in the morning, under the command of Brigadier General Roos; after which they proceeded with the same circumspection, but with the utmost celerity, to the enemy's works, which they stormed and overthrew with astonishing rapidity. The Spaniards were instantly thrown into confusion, and fled on every side; the guns and mortars on the batteries were all spiked up; and\n\n(b) Two boys belonging to the artificer company were endowed with such wonderful strength of vision, that they could see the shot of the enemy in the air almost as soon as it came from the mouth of the gun; and were therefore constantly placed upon some part of the works to give notice to the soldiers of the approaching danger. During the time of the hottest fire, however, the men were so habituated to the fall of shells and shot around them, that they contracted an insensibility of danger, and almost required to be cautioned by their officers to avoid the explosion of a shell when lying with the fuse burning at their feet. In consequence of this inattention, they frequently neglected the advice of the boys above mentioned, and their neglect could not but be productive of fatal effects. An instance of this happened on the Prince of Amelia's battery, where a shot thus disregarded came through one of the capped embrasures, carried off one of the legs from three soldiers, and wounded a fourth in both. In other cases, in which the persons themselves have observed the shot or shells coming towards them, they have been fascinated by its appearance, and unable to move from the spot, as small birds are said to be by the rattle snake. \"This sudden arrest of the faculties (says our author) was nothing uncommon: several instances occurred to my own observation, where men, totally free, have had their senses engaged by a shell in its descent, that though sensible of their danger, even so far as to cry for assistance, they have been immovably fixed to the place. But what is more remarkable, these men have so instantaneously recovered themselves on its fall to the ground, as to remove to a place of safety before the shell burst.\"\n\nIn this manner Lieutenant Lowe of the 12th regiment was fascinated by a shot which he saw coming, but had not power to remove from the place before it fell upon him and took off his leg.\n\nWhere these shells burst they produced instant and certain destruction, mangling in the most dreadful manner. The following are some instances: A matroos had the misfortune of breaking his thigh by some accident; and being a man of great spirit, could scarce bear the confinement necessary for its reunion. In consequence of this he went abroad too soon, and thus unfortunately broke the bone a second time. Being now confined to bed, a shell happened to fall into the room where he was, and, rebounding, lodged itself directly upon him. The convalescents and sick instantly summoned all their strength, and crawled out of the room, while the poor matroos lay below the shell, kept down by its weight, and utterly unable to stir. In a few seconds it burst, and took off both his legs, and scorched him in a dreadful manner. He survived the explosion, was sensible to the last moment, and died regretting that he had not been killed on the batteries. The case of a soldier of the 73rd regiment shows, that even in the most dangerous cases we should never despair of recovery while life remains. This unfortunate man had been knocked down by the wind of a shell, which, instantly bursting, killed his companion, and mangled himself in a shocking manner. His skull was dreadfully fractured, his left arm broken in two places, one of his legs shattered, the skin and muscles torn off from part of his right hand, the middle finger broken to pieces, and his whole body most severely bruised and marked with gunpowder. He presented so horrid an object to the surgeons, that they had not the least hopes of saving his life, and were at a loss what part to attend to first. He was that evening trepanned; a few days afterwards his leg was amputated, and other wounds and fractures were dressed. Being possessed of a most excellent constitution, nature performed wonders in his favour, and in 11 weeks his cure was completely effected. On the 18th of September a shell from the lines fell into a house where the town major Captain Burke, with Majors Mercier and Vignoles of the 39th regiment were sitting. It took off Major Burke's thigh; afterwards fell through the floor into the cellar: there it burst, and forced the flooring with the unfortunate major up to the ceiling. When assistance came, they found him almost buried in the ruins of the room. He was instantly conveyed to the hospital, where he died soon after the wounded part had been amputated. Majors Mercier and Vignoles\nGibraltar, and the artillerymen, artificers, and sailors, exerted themselves so vigorously, that in the space of an hour the magazines were blown up, the storehouses of arms, ammunition, and military implements of every kind, and all the works that had been constructed, were set on fire, and totally consumed; the whole damage done on this occasion being estimated at upwards of two millions sterling.\n\nFor several days after this disaster the Spaniards continued inactive, without even making any attempt to extinguish their batteries, which still continued in flames; but in the beginning of December, as if suddenly aroused from their reverie, upwards of 1000 men were set to work in order to prepare a great number of sasines, from whence it was concluded that they designed to repair their works. In this they proceeded with their usual perseverance and diligence; but as the former methods of attack had constantly failed, it was evident, that if the place could be reduced at all, it must be by some means hitherto unattempted; and for the reduction of this single fortress, the Spanish monarch, after the conquest of Minorca, determined to employ the whole strength of his empire. Among the various projects formed at this time, that of the chevalier D'Arcon, a French engineer of distinction, proved the most acceptable to the court of Spain; and though the expense attending it was immense, this seemed in the present circumstances to be but a matter of small consideration. His plan was to construct such floating batteries as might neither be liable to be sunk nor set on fire. With this view their bottoms were made of the thickest timber, and their sides of wood and cork long soaked in water, with a layer of wet sand betwixt them. Their thickness was such, that they were impenetrable to cannon shot; and to prevent the effects of red-hot balls, a number of pipes were contrived to carry water through every part of the vessel, and pumps sufficient to furnish a constant supply for the purpose. The people at the batteries were sheltered from the bombs by a rope netting, made sloping that they might roll off, and spread with wet skins to prevent fire. Ten of these batteries were constructed out of the hulls of large vessels, some of 50 or 60 guns, cut down for that purpose, and carrying from 10 to 28 guns each, with about half as many in reserve in case of accidents. Each gun was served by 36 artillery men; and these floating batteries were to be seconded by 80 large boats carrying guns and mortars of heavy metal; a great number of ships of force and frigates, with some hundreds of small craft, were to accompany them with troops, for the instant execution of what might be judged necessary. On this occasion upwards of 1000 pieces of artillery and 80,000 barrels of gunpowder were provided. A body of 12,000 of the best troops of France were now added to the Spanish army before the place; the body of engineers was the best that both kingdoms could produce; and numbers of volunteers, of the best families in both, attended the siege. Numbers of military gentlemen also came from every part of Europe to be witnesses of what passed at this celebrated siege, which was now compared to the most famous recorded in history. The concluding of it was committed to the duke de Crillon, who had distinguished himself by the conquest of Minorca. Two princes of the blood royal of France, the count of Artois brother to the king, and the duke of Bourbon his cousin, came to be witnesses of this extraordinary enterprise. These behaved with the greatest politeness both to the governor and garrison. The count of Artois transmitted a packet of letters for various individuals in the garrison, which had been intercepted and carried to Madrid, and which he requested that he might be the means of conveying to those for whom they were designed. Both he and the duke of Bourbon signified to General Elliot the high regard they had for his person and character; and the duke de Crillon himself took this opportunity of expressing the same sentiments, and to entreat him to accept of some refreshments. General Elliot returned a polite answer, but accepted of the present with reluctance, and requested him for the future not to confer any favours of that kind upon him.\n\nSuch a prodigious armament raised the confidence of the besiegers so high, that they looked upon the armament brought before the fortresses as certain to bring about the conquest of Gibraltar.\n\nVignoles had time to escape before the shell burst; nevertheless they were slightly wounded by the splinters, as were a sergeant and his daughter, who happened to be in the cellar when the shell entered.\n\nThe following are related as instances of very extraordinary escapes from the destructive power of these engines, and which indeed it seems difficult to account for.\u2014A corporal had the muzzle of his firelock clofed, and the barrel twisted like a French horn, by a shell, without any injury to his person. A shell happened to fall into a tent where two soldiers were asleep, without awakening them by its fall. A sergeant in an adjacent tent heard it, and ran near 40 yards to a place of safety, when he recollected the situation of his comrades. Thinking the shell had fallen blind, he returned and awakened them; both immediately rose, but continued by the place, debating on the narrow escape they had had, when the shell exploded, and forced them with great violence against a garden wall, but, \"miraculously\" did no further mischief than destroying every thing in the tent. On the new year's day of 1772, an officer of artillery observed a shell falling towards the place where he stood, and got behind a traverse for protection. This he had scarcely done, when the shell fell into the traverse, and instantly entangled him in the rubbish: one of the guard, named Martin, observing his distress, generously risked his own life in defence of his officer, and ran to extricate him: but finding his own efforts ineffectual, called for assistance; when another of the guard joining him, they relieved the officer from his situation; and almost at the same instant the shell burst, and levelled the traverse with the ground. Martin was afterwards promoted, and rewarded by the governor; who at the same time told him, that \"he should equally have noticed him for attending to his comrade.\" A shell happening to fall into the room where Ensign Mackenzie of the 73d regiment was sitting, carried away part of his chair, and fell into the room below, where it burst, lifting him and the chair from the floor without further injury.\nGibraltar, conquest of the place as an absolute certainty. They began to be impatient at the delays which arose in bringing matters to the utmost point of perfection; and the commander in chief was thought by far too modest, when he said that the garrison might hold out for a fortnight. \"It appeared (says Captain Drinkwater) that they meant, previous to their final efforts, to strike if possible a terror through their opponents, by displaying an armament more powerful than had probably ever been brought before any fortress. Forty-seven sail of the line, including three inferior two-deckers; ten battering ships, deemed perfect in design, and deemed invincible, carrying 212 guns; innumerable frigates, xebecos, bomb ketches, cutters, gun and mortar boats, and smaller craft for disembarking men, were assembled in the bay. On the land side were most stupendous and strong batteries and works, mounting 200 pieces of heavy ordnance, and protected by an army of near 40,000 men, commanded by a victorious and active general, and animated by the immediate presence of two princes of the blood royal of France, with other dignified personages, and many of their own nobility. In their certainty of success, however, the enemy seemed entirely to have overlooked the nature of that force which was opposed to them; for though the garrison scarcely consisted of more than 7000 effective men, including the marine brigade, they forgot that they were now veterans in this service, had long been habituated to the effects of artillery, and were by degrees prepared for the arduous conflict that awaited them. We were at the same time commanded by officers of approved courage, prudence, and activity; eminent for all the accomplishments of their profession, and in whom we had unbounded confidence. Our spirits too were not a little elevated by the success attending the firing of red-hot shot (c), which in this attack we hoped would enable us to bring our labours to a conclusion, and relieve us from the tedious cruelty of a vexatious blockade.\"\n\nAs a prelude to the dreadful storm which was about to be poured forth on this devoted garrison, the enemy, on the 9th of September 1782, opened a battery of 64 of their largest cannon, which was shortly accompanied with a terrible fire from other batteries, and a great number of mortars. On this and the following day an attack was made upon the batteries erected on Europa Point (so called from being the most southerly point of the continent of Europe), which at that time were entirely under the management of Captain Curtis of the Brilliant frigate, who had distinguished himself during the siege, and now commanded a brigade of seamen by whom the batteries were served. By these the fire of the Spaniards was so warmly returned, that they not only could make no impression, but were forced to retire, after having received so much damage, that two of their principal ships were obliged to withdraw to the bay of Algeciras opposite to Gibraltar, in order to refit. On the 12th\n\n(c) This was suggested by Lieutenant Governor Boyd, and had been attended with remarkable success, September 8th, when the enemy's advanced works were almost destroyed by it.\n\nAccordingly, on the morning of the 13th, the ten floating batteries came forward, under the command of Don Buenaventura de Moreno, a Spanish officer of great gallantry, and who had signalized himself at the taking of Minorca. Before ten o'clock they had all got into their proper stations, anchoring in a line about a thousand yards distant from the shore. As soon as they were properly arranged, they began a heavy cannonade, and were seconded by all the cannon and mortars in the enemy's lines and approaches, at the same time that the garrison opened all its batteries both with hot and cold shot from the guns, and shells from the howitzers and mortars. This terrible fire continued on both sides without intermission until noon; when that of the Spaniards began to slacken, and the fire of the garrison to obtain a superiority. About two o'clock the principal battering ship commanded by Don Moreno was observed to emit smoke as if on fire, and some men were seen busy upon the roof searching from whence it proceeded. The fire from the garrison was now kept up without the least discontinuance or diminution, while that from the floating batteries was perceived sensibly to decrease; so that about seven in the evening they fired but few guns, and that only at intervals. At midnight the admiral's ship was plainly seen to burn, and in an hour after was completely in flames. Eight more of these batteries took fire successively; and on the signals of distress made by them, destruction of the multitude of feluccas, launches, and boats, with of the Spaniards which they were surrounded, all came to their afflatus, and began to take the men out of the burning vessels. Captain Curtis, who lay ready with the gunboats to take advantage of any favourable circumstance, came upon them at two in the morning, and forming a line on the enemy's flank, advanced upon them with such order and expedition as to throw them into immediate confusion. At this sudden and unexpected attack they were so astonished and disconcerted, that they fled precipitately with all their boats, totally abandoning the floating batteries to be burnt, and all who were in them to perish in the flames. This would undoubtedly have been their fate, had not Captain Curtis extricated them from the fire at the imminent danger of his own life and that of his men. In this work he was so eager, that while his boat was alongside of one of the largest batteries, it blew up, and the fragments of the wreck spreading all around to a vast distance, some heavy pieces of timber fell into his boat and pierced through its bottom, killing one man and wounding several others. He escaped with difficulty out of this boat, which was sunk, as well as another, by the same accident. The floating batteries were every one consumed; and the violence with which they exploded was such that doors and windows at a great distance on shore were burst open. About 400 people were saved from them; many of whom were picked up floating on rafts and pieces of timber. Indeed the blowing up of\nGibraltar, the batteries as the flames reached their powder rooms, and the discharge of the guns in succession as the metal became heated by the fire, rendered any attempt to save them very dangerous.\n\nThis terrible catastrophe took place in sight of the combined fleets of France and Spain. It had been proposed that they should co-operate upon this important occasion, by attacking the garrison at Europa Point, and such places as appeared most exposed to an attempt by sea. This, it was afterwards said, must have occasioned a material diversion of the garrison's force, and, by dividing it, have weakened considerably the vigorous means of defence used in those parts which were actually attacked. The reason assigned for this inactivity was the want of wind.\n\nThough this terrible repulse effectually convinced the Spaniards that Gibraltar could not be taken by force, some hope still remained, that, without any further exertions on their part, the garrison would be obliged to surrender from want of ammunition and provisions. With this view they continued to blockade it closely, and to cut off all communication, flattering themselves that Britain would not be able to collect a naval force sufficient to drive their fleet from the bay before the fortress was reduced to extremity; and this they imagined must be the case in a few days. Such diligence, however, had been used on the part of the British, that a fleet was already assembled at Portsmouth, consisting of 35 sail of the line, in excellent condition, and filled with the best officers and sailors in Europe. The command was given to Lord Howe, who was accompanied in the expedition by Admirals Barrington, Milbank, Hood, Sir Richard Hughes, and Commodore Hotham, all of them men eminent in their profession. At the same time also it fortunately happened, that a large British fleet of merchantmen had just arrived in safety from the Baltic; and that a Dutch squadron, which had been cruising on their own coasts, not being able to penetrate southwards, in order to join the French, had retired into port, and given up the intention of effecting any junction for that season.\n\nAt this time the British nation was in the utmost anxiety about the fate of Gibraltar. The progress of the ships was delayed by contrary winds, and it was not until they had gained the southern coast of Portugal that they received information of the defeat of the enemy's attempt on the 13th of September. On the 11th of October Lord Howe entered the Straits, and several of the store ships destined for Gibraltar came safe to anchor under the cannon of the fort without any molestation from the enemy. The combined fleet in the meantime had been much damaged by a storm; two ships of the line were driven ashore near Algeciras; two more were driven out of the bay into the Mediterranean; others lost their masts, and most of them suffered considerably. One in particular, a ship of 70 guns, was carried by the storm across the bay, and ran aground under the works of Gibraltar, where she was taken by the garrison, with her whole complement of men, consisting of 700. Notwithstanding the endeavours of the enemy to destroy her, she was safely got off, and properly repaired. The combined fleet, however, put to sea on the 13th, with a view to prevent the remaining storeships that had overshot the bay to the east from making good their entrance into it; and at the same time to rejoin the two ships that had been Gibraltar separated from the main body by the storm. Having the advantage of the wind, they bore down upon the British fleet, which drew up in order of battle to receive them; but notwithstanding their superiority, they declined coming to an engagement. On the wind becoming more favourable next day, Lord Howe took the opportunity to bring in the storeships that were in company; and the day following the remainder were conveyed to Gibraltar, the troops for the reinforcement of the garrison were landed, with a large supply of powder, and ample provision in every other respect. As they returned through the straits they were threatened with an engagement by the combined fleets; but though the latter had a superiority of 12 ships of the line, they kept a wary distance. Some firing indeed took place, but it was attended with little effect on either side.\n\nThis last relief proved entirely decisive; for though the blockade continued till news arrived of the preliminaries of peace being signed, in the beginning of February 1783, no other attack was made. The news of the pacification were received with the utmost joy by the Spaniards. Mutual civilities passed between the commanders in chief, and the Duke de Crillon paid many handsome compliments to the governor and garrison for their noble defence; declaring that he had exerted himself to the utmost of his abilities, and though he had not proved successful, yet he was happy in having his sovereign's approbation of his conduct.\n\nThe possession of Gibraltar is esteemed of very great importance to Britain. It not only gives us the command of the Straits, and their navigation; but affords a refreshment and accommodation to our fleets in time of war, and to our merchantmen at all times; which, to a maritime power, is of very great advantage. From its situation, it divides both the kingdoms of France and Spain; that is, it hinders a ready communication by sea between the different parts of these kingdoms. This, of course, hinders the conjunction of their fleets and squadrons with each other, or at least renders it so difficult as to be a perpetual check upon the ambitious powers. It awes also the piratical states of Barbary, and in like manner the emperor of Morocco; insomuch, that our commerce is more safe than that of any other European power, which gives us great advantages in point of freight. It is otherwise highly favourable to our trade in the Mediterranean and Levant. It procures us the respect of the Italian and other powers; who, though far distant from Britain, must consider this as an instance of her power to hurt or assist them. It also saves us the expense of squadrons or convoys, upon any disputes or disturbances that may happen among these powers, and which would otherwise be necessary for the protection of our navigation.\n\n\"The form of this mountain is (says Major Imrie) oblong; its summit a sharp craggy ridge; its direction is nearly from north to south; and its greatest length, in that direction, falls very little short of three miles. Its breadth varies with the indentations of the shore, but it nowhere exceeds three quarters of a mile. The line of its ridge is undulated, and the two extremes are somewhat higher than its centre.\n\n\"The summit of the Sugar Loaf, which is the point Natural of history.\"\nGibraltar, of its greatest elevation towards the south, is 1439 feet; the Rock Mortar, which is the highest point to the north, is 1350; and the Signal House, which is nearly the central point between these two, is 1276 feet above the level of the sea. The western side of the mountain is a series of rugged slopes, interspersed with abrupt precipices. Its northern extremity is perfectly perpendicular, except towards the north-west, where what are called the Lines intervene, and a narrow passage of flat ground that leads to the isthmus, and is entirely covered with fortification. The eastern side of the mountain mostly consists of a range of precipices; but a bank of sand, rising from the Mediterranean in a rapid acclivity, covers a third of its perpendicular height. Its southern extremity falls, in a rapid slope from the summit of the Sugar Loaf, into a rocky flat of considerable extent, called Windmill Hill.\n\n\"The principal mass of the mountain rock consists of a gray, dense (what is generally called primary) marble; the different beds of which are to be examined in a face of 1350 feet of perpendicular height, which it presents to Spain in a conical form. These beds, or strata, are of various thicknesses, from 20 to upwards of 40 feet, dipping in a direction from east to west, nearly at an angle of 35 degrees. In some parts of the solid mass of this rock are found tuffaceous bodies entirely transformed into the constituent matter of the rock, and their interior hollows filled up with calcareous spar; but these do not occur often in its composition, and its beds are not separated by any intermediate strata.\n\n\"The caves of Gibraltar are many, and some of them of great extent. That which most deserves attention and examination is called St Michael's Cave, which is situated upon the southern part of the mountain, almost equally distant from the Signal Tower and the Sugar Loaf. Its entrance is 1000 feet above the level of the sea: This entrance is formed by a rapid slope of earth, which has fallen into it at various periods, and which leads to a spacious hall, inclosed with spar, and apparently supported in the centre by a large mottled stalactite pillar. To this succeeds a long series of caves of difficult access. In these cavernous recesses, the formation and processes of stalactites is to be traced, from the flinty quilt-like cone, suspended from the roof, to the robust trunk of a pillar, three feet in diameter, which rises from the floor, and seems intended by Nature to support the roof from which it originated.\n\n\"The only inhabitants of these caves are bats, some of which are of a large size. The soil, in general, upon the mountain of Gibraltar is but thinly tilled; and in many parts that thin covering has been washed off by the heavy autumnal rains, which have left the surfaces of the rock, for a considerable extent, bare and open to inspection. In those situations, an observing eye may trace the effects of the flow, but constant decomposition of the rock, caused by its exposure to the air, and the corrosion of sea-salts, which, in the heavy gales of easterly winds, are deposited with the spray on every part of the mountain. Those uncovered parts of the mountain rock also expose to the eye a phenomenon worthy of some attention, as it tends clearly to demonstrate, that however high the surface of this rock may now be elevated above the level of the sea, it has once been the bed of agitated waters. This phenomenon is to be observed in many parts of the rock, and is constantly found in the beds of torrents. It consists of pot-like holes, of various sizes, hollowed out of the solid rock, and formed apparently by the attrition of gravel or pebbles, set in motion by the rapidity of rivers or currents in the sea.\n\n\"Upon the west side of the mountain, towards its base, some strata occur, which are heterogeneous to the mountain rock; the first, or highest, forms the segment of a circle; its convex side is towards the mountain, and it slopes also in that direction. This stratum consists of a number of thin beds; the outward one, being the thinnest, is in a state of decomposition, and is mouldering down into a blackish brown or ferruginous coloured earth. The beds, inferior to this, progressively increase in breadth to 17 inches, where the stratification rests upon a rock of an argillaceous nature.\n\n\"This last bed, which is 17 inches thick, consists of quartz of a blackish blue colour, in the septa or cracks of which are found fine quartz crystals, colourless, and perfectly transparent. These crystals are composed of 18 planes, disposed in hexagonal columns, terminated at both extremities by hexagonal pyramids. The largest of those that Major Imrie saw did not exceed one-fourth of an inch in length: They, in general, adhere to the rock by the sides of the column, but are detached without difficulty. Their great degree of transparency has obtained them the name of Gibraltar diamonds.\"\n\n\"In the perpendicular fissures of the rock, and in some of the caverns of the mountain (all of which afford evident proofs of their former communication with the surface), a calcareous concretion is found, of a reddish brown ferruginous colour, with an earthy fracture, and considerable induration, including the bones of various animals, some of which have the appearance of being human. These bones are of various sizes, and lie in all directions, intermixed with shells of snails, fragments of the calcareous rock, and particles of spar; all of which materials are still to be seen in their natural uncombined states, partially scattered over the surface of the mountain. These have been swept, by heavy rains at different periods, from the surface into the situations above described, and having remained for a long series of years in those places of rest, exposed to the permeating action of water, have become enveloped in, and cemented by, the calcareous matter which it deposits.\n\n\"The bones, in this composition, have not the smallest appearance of being petrified; and if they have undergone any change, it is more like that of calcination than that of petrifaction, as the most solid parts of them generally admit of being cut and scraped down with the same ease as chalk.\n\n\"Bones combined in such concretions are not peculiar to Gibraltar: they are found in such large quantities in the country of Dalmatia and upon its coasts, in the islands of Chero and Ofero, that some naturalists have been induced to go so far as to assert, that there has been a regular stratum of such matter in that country, and that its present broken and interrupted appearance has been caused by earthquakes, or other convulsions, experienced in that part of the globe. But, of late years, a traveller (Abb\u00e9 Alberto Fortis) has given a minute description of the concretion in which the bones are found, in that country: And by his account it appears, that with regard to situation, composition, and colour,\nGibraltar. colour, it is perfectly similar to that found at Gibraltar. By his description, it also appears that the two mountain rocks of Gibraltar and Dalmatia consist of the same species of calcareous stone; from which it is to be presumed, that the concretions in both have been formed in the same manner and about the same periods.\n\n\"Perhaps if the fissures and caves of the rocks of Dalmatia were more minutely examined, their former communications with the surface might yet be traced as in those described above; and, in that case, there would be at least a strong probability, that the materials of the concretions of that country have been brought together by the same accidental cause which has probably collected those found in the caverns of Gibraltar. Major Imrie traced, in Gibraltar, this concretion, from the lowest part of a deep perpendicular fissure, up to the surface of the mountain. As it approached to the surface, the concretion became less firmly combined, and, when it had no covering of the calcareous rock, a final degree of adhesion only remained, which was evidently produced by the argillaceous earth, in its composition, having been moistened by rain and baked by the sun.\n\n\"The depth at which these materials had been penetrated by that proportion of stalactitical matter, capable of giving to the concretion its greatest adhesion and solidity, he found to vary according to its situation, and to the quantity of matter to be combined. In fissures, narrow and contracted, he found the concretion possessing a great degree of hardness at six feet from the surface; but in other situations, more extended, and where a larger quantity of the materials had been accumulated, he found it had not gained its greatest degree of adhesion at double that depth. In one of the caves, where the mass of concretion is of considerable size, he perceived it to be divided into different beds, each bed being covered with a crust of the stalactitical spar, from one inch to an inch and a half in thickness, which seems to indicate, that the materials have been carried in at various periods, and that those periods have been very remote from each other.\n\n\"At Rota bay, upon the west side of Gibraltar, this concretion is found in what has evidently been a cavern, originally formed by huge unshaped masses of the rock which have tumbled together. The fissure, or cavern, formed by the disruption and subsidence of those masses, has been entirely filled up with the concretion, and is now exposed to full view by the outward mass having dropped down in consequence of the encroachments of the sea. It is to this spot that strangers are generally led to examine the phenomenon; and the composition, having here attained to its greatest degree of hardness and solidity, the hasty observer, seeing the bones inclosed in what has so little the appearance of having been a cavity, examines no further, but immediately adopts the idea of their being incased in the solid rock. The communication from this former chasm, to the surface from which it has received the materials of the concretion, is still to be traced in the face of the rock, but its opening is at present covered by the base of the line wall of the garrison. Here bones are found that are apparently human; and those of them that appear to be of the legs, arms, and vertebrae of the back, are scattered among others of various kinds and sizes, even down to the smallest bones of small birds. Major Imrie found here the complete jaw-bone of a sheep; it contained its full complement of teeth, the enamel of which was perfect, and its whiteness and lustre in no degree impaired. In the hollow parts of some of the large bones was contained a minute crystallization of pure and colourless calcareous spar; but, in most, the interior part consisted of a sparry crust of a reddish colour, scarcely in any degree transparent.\n\n\"At the northern extremity of the mountain, the concretion is generally found in perpendicular fissures. The miners there employed upon the fortifications, in excavating one of those fissures, found, at a great depth from the surface, two skulls, which were supposed to be human; but, to the Major, one of them, if not both, appeared to be too small for the human species. The bone of each was perfectly firm and solid; from which it is to be presumed, that they were in a state of maturity before they were inclosed in the concretion. Had they appertained to very young children, perhaps the bone would have been more porous, and of a less firm texture. The probability is, that they belonged to a species of monkey, which still continues to inhabit, in considerable numbers, those parts of the rock which are to us inaccessible.\n\n\"This concretion varies, in its composition, according to the situation in which it is found. At the extremity of Prince's Lines, high in the rock which looks towards Spain, it is found to consist only of a reddish calcareous earth, and the bones of small birds cemented thereby. The rock around this spot is inhabited by a number of hawks, that, in the breeding season, nestle here and rear their young: the bones in this concretion are probably the remains of the food of those birds. At the base of the rock, below King's Lines, the concretion consists of pebbles of the prevailing calcareous rock. In this concretion, at a very considerable depth under the surface, was found the under part of a glass bottle, uncommonly shaped, and of great thickness; the colour of the glass was of a dark green.\"\n\nSubterranean galleries pierce the rock in several places and in various directions, and at various degrees of elevation; all of them have a communication with each other, either by flights of steps cut in the rock, or by wooden stairs where the passageways are required to be very perpendicular.\n\n\"The sentinels may now be relieved during a siege from one post to another in perfect safety; whereas, previously to the constructing of these galleries a vast number of men were killed by the Spaniards while marching to their several stations. The width of these galleries is about twelve feet, their height about fourteen. The rock is broken through in various places, both for the purpose of giving light and for placing the guns to bear on the enemy. In different parts there are spacious recesses, capable of accommodating a considerable number of men. To these recesses they give names, such as St Patrick's Chamber, St George's Hall, &c. The whole of these singular structures have been formed out of the solid rock by blasting with gunpowder. Through the politeness of an officer on duty, a place called Smart's Reservoir was opened for our inspection, which is a great curiosity, and not generally permitted to be shewn. It is a spring at a considerable depth in the body of the rock, and is above 750 feet above the level of the sea; we descended into the cavern that contains\nGibraltar, tains it by a rope ladder, and with the aid of lighted candles proceeded through a narrow passage over crystalized protuberances of the rock till we came to a hollow, which appears to have been opened by some convulsion of nature. Here, from a bed of gems, arises the salutary fountain, clear as the brilliant of the east, and cold as the icicle. We hailed the nymph of the grot, and, profligating ourselves, quaffed hygeian nectar from her spring urn. When restored to the light of day, we obtained, through the medium of the same gentleman, the key of St George's Hall, at which we arrived by a very intricate and gloomy path to the spacious excavation, which is upwards of an hundred feet in length, its height nearly the same. It is formed in a semicircular part of the rock; spacious apertures are broken through, where cannons of a very large calibre command the isthmus, the Spanish lines, and a great part of the bay. The top of the rock is pierced through, so as to introduce sufficient light to enable you to view every part of it. It appears almost incredible that so large an excavation could be formed by gunpowder, without blowing up the whole of that part of the rock, and fill more so, that they should be able to direct the operations of such an instrument, so as to render it subservient to the purpose of elegance. We found in the hall a table, placed, I suppose, for the convenience of those who are traversing the rock. The cloth was spread, the wine went round, and we made the vaulted roof resound with the accents of mirth and the songs of conviviality.*\n\n* Month.\n\nMay 1793.","sp":370,"ep":383},{"h":"GIBSON","t":"RICHARD, an English painter, commonly called the Dwarf, was originally page to a lady at Mortlake; who, observing that his genius led him to painting, had the generosity to get him instructed in the rudiments of that art. He devoted himself to Sir Peter Lely's manner, and copied his pictures to admiration, especially his portraits; his paintings in water colours were also esteemed. He was in great favour with Charles I., who made him his page of the back stairs; and he had the honour to instruct in drawing Queen Mary and Queen Anne when they were princesses. He married the Mrs Anne Shepherd, who was also a dwarf; on which occasion King Charles I. honoured their marriage with his presence, and gave away the bride. Mr Waller wrote a poem on this occasion, entitled \"The Marriage of the Dwarfs,\" in which are these lines:\n\nDesign or change makes others wive,\nBut nature did this match contrive;\nEve might as well have Adam fled,\nAs she deny'd her little bed\nTo him for whom heav'n seem'd to frame\nAnd measure out this only dame.\"\n\nMr Fenton, in his notes on this poem, observes that he had seen this couple painted by Sir Peter Lely; and that they were of an equal stature, each being three feet ten inches high. They had nine children, five of whom arrived at maturity; these were well proportioned, and of the usual standard of mankind. But what nature denied this couple in stature, she gave them in length of days: for Mr Gibson died in the 75th year of his age; and his wife, having survived him almost 20 years, died in 1799, aged 89.\n\nGibson, Dr Edmund, bishop of London, was born in Westmorland, in 1669. He applied himself early and vigorously to learning, and displayed his knowledge in several writings and translations, which recommended him to the patronage of Archbishop Tenison. He was appointed domestic chaplain to his Grace; and we soon after find him rector of Lambeth, and archdeacon of Surry. Becoming thus a member of the convocation, he engaged in a controversy, which was carried on with great warmth by the members of both houses, and defended his patron's rights, as president, in eleven pamphlets; he then formed and completed his more comprehensive scheme of the legal duties and rights of the English clergy, which was at length published under the title of Codex Juris Ecclesiasticus Anglicani, in folio. Archbishop Tenison dying in 1715, and Dr Wake bishop of Lincoln being made archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Gibson succeeded the latter in the see of Lincoln, and in 1720 was promoted to the bishopric of London. He now not only governed his diocese with the most exact regularity, but by his great care promoted the spiritual affairs of the church of England colonies in the West Indies. He was extremely jealous of the least of the privileges belonging to the church; and therefore, though he approved of the toleration of the Protestant Dissenters, he continually guarded against all the attempts made to procure a repeal of the corporation and test acts; in particular, his opposition to those licentious assemblies called masquerades, gave great umbrage at court, and effectually excluded him from all further favours. He spent the latter part of his life in writing and printing pastoral letters, visitation-charges, occasional sermons, and tracts against the prevailing immoralities of the age. His pastoral letters are justly esteemed as the most masterly productions against infidelity and enthusiasm. His most celebrated work, the Codex, has been already mentioned. His other publications are, 1. An edition of Drummond's Polemo-Middinia, and James V. of Scotland's Can tileua Ruffa, with notes. 2. The Chronicon Saxonicum, with a Latin translation, and notes. 3. Reliquiae Spelmanianae, the posthumous works of Sir Henry Spelman, relating to the laws and antiquities of England. 4. An edition of Quintilian de Arte Oratoria, with notes. 5. An English translation of Camden's Britannia, with additions, two volumes folio: and, 6. A number of small pieces, that have been collected together and printed in three volumes folio.\u2014His intense application to study impaired his health; notwithstanding which, he attained the age of 79.

His abilities were so well adapted to discharge the duties of his sacred function, that during the incapacity of Archbishop Wake, the tranfaction of ecclesiastical affairs was committed to the bishop of London. He was a true friend to the established church and government, and as great an enemy to persecution.

However this may be, the Romans on that day celebrated a festival in honour of Janus, and paid their respects at the same time to Juno; but they did not pass it in idleness, lest they should become indolent during the rest of the year. They sent presents to one another of figs, dates, honey, &c., to show their friends that they wished them a happy and agreeable life. Clients, that is to say, those who were under the protection of the great, carried presents of this kind to their patrons, adding to them a small piece of silver.

Though a second son, he inherited a considerable fortune from his father. He was educated at Eton, and afterwards at Oxford; where probably he did not continue long. It seems he was intended to finish his studies in the Temple; but being introduced at court by his aunt Mrs Catharine Ashley, then in the queen's service, he was diverted from the study of law, and commenced soldier. Having distinguished himself in several military expeditions, particularly that to Newhaven in 1563, he was sent over to Ireland to assist in suppressing a rebellion; where, for his signal services, he was made commander in chief and gover-\nnor of Munster, and knighted by the lord deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, on the first day of the year 1570. He returned soon after to England, where he married a rich heiress. Nevertheless, in 1572, he sailed with a squadron of nine ships to reinforce Colonel Morgan, who at that time meditated the recovery of Flushing. Probably on his return to England he resumed his cosmographical studies, to which he was naturally inclined: for, in the year 1576, he published his book on the north-west passage to the East Indies; and as Martin Frobisher failed the same year, probably it was in consequence of this treatise. In 1578, he obtained from the queen a very ample patent, empowering him to discover and possess in North America any lands then unsettled. He sailed to Newfoundland, but soon returned to England without success; nevertheless, in 1583, he embarked a second time with five ships, the largest of which put back on account of a contagious distemper on board. Our general landed on Newfoundland on the third of August, and on the fifth took possession of the harbour of St John's. By virtue of his patent, he granted leases to several people; but though none of them remained there at that time, they settled afterwards in consequence of these leases; so that Sir Humphrey deserves to be remembered as the real founder of the vast American empire. On the 29th of August he put to sea again, on board a small flotilla; which on the 29th foundered in a hard gale of wind. Thus perished Sir Humphrey Gilbert; a man of quick parts, a brave soldier, a good mathematician, a skilful navigator, and of a very enterprising genius. We learn also, that he was remarkable for his eloquence, being much admired for his patriotic speeches both in the English and Irish parliaments. He wrote \"A discourse to prove a passage by the north-west to Cathaia and the East Indies, printed London 1576.\" This treatise, which is a masterly performance, is preserved in Hakluyt's Collection of Voyages, vol. iii. p. 11.

He began the study of medicine at Edinburgh, which he afterwards prosecuted at London and Paris. He obtained the degree of doctor of medicine from the university of Rheims; and in the year 1732 he returned to the place of his nativity, where he afterwards constantly resided, and continued the practice of medicine till his death. It may with justice be said, that few physicians of the present century have exercised their profession in a manner more respectable or successful than Dr Gilchrist; and few have contributed more to the improvement of the healing art. Having engaged in business at an early period of life, his attention was wholly devoted to observation. Endowed by nature with a judgment acute and solid, with a genius active and inventive, he soon distinguished himself by departing, in various important particulars, from established but unsuccessful modes of practice. Several of the improvements which he introduced have procured him great and deserved reputation both at home and abroad. His practice, in ordinary cases, was allowed to be judicious, and placed him high in the confidence and esteem of the inhabitants of that part of the country where he lived. But his usefulness was not confined to his own neighbourhood. On many occasions he was consulted by letter from the most distant parts of the country. In different collections are to be found several of his performances, which prove that he had something new and useful to offer upon every subject to which he applied himself. But those writings which do him the greatest honour, are two long dissertations on Nervous Fevers, in the Medical Essays and Observations published by a Society in Edinburgh; and a treatise on the use of Sea Voyages in medicine, which first made its appearance in the year 1757, and was afterwards reprinted in 1771. By means of the former, the attention of physicians was first turned to a species of fever which is now found to prevail universally in this country; and the liberal use of wine, which he was the first among the moderns to recommend, has since been adopted in these fevers by the most judicious physicians of the present age, and has probably contributed not a little to the success of their practice. His treatise on Sea Voyages points out in a manner so clear, and so much on the sure footing of experience, their utility in various distempers, particularly in consumptions, that there is now a prospect of our being able to employ a remedy in this untractable disease much more efficacious than any hitherto in use.

Where he was educated is uncertain; but it appears from his own writings that he was a monk. Some writers say that he went over to Ireland; others, that he visited France and Italy. They agree however in affirming, that after his return to England he became a celebrated and most affluential preacher of the gospel. Du Pin says he founded a monastery at Venetia in Britain. Gildas is the only British author of the fifth century whose works are printed;\nGilding, printed; they are therefore valuable on account of their antiquity, and as containing the only information we have concerning the times of which he wrote. His History of Britain is, however, a very flimsy performance, and his style obscure and inelegant.\n\nGilding, the art of spreading or covering a thing over with gold, either in leaf or liquid. The art of gilding was not unknown among the ancients, though it never arrived among them at the perfection to which the moderns have carried it. Pliny affirms us, that the first gilding seen at Rome was after the destruction of Carthage, under the censorship of Lucius Mummius, when they began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces; the Capitol being the first place on which this enrichment was bestowed. But he adds, that luxury advanced on them so hastily, that in a little time you might see all, even private and poor persons, gild the very walls, vaults, &c. of their houses.\n\nWe need not doubt but they had the same method with us, of beating gold, and reducing it into leaves; though it should seem they did not carry it to the same height, if it be true which Pliny relates, that they only made 750 leaves of four fingers square out of a whole ounce. Indeed he adds, that they could make more; that the thickest were called bracteae praecipue, by reason of a statue of the goddess Fortune at Praeneste girt with such leaves; and that the thinnest sort was called bracteae qu\u00e6loric\u00e6.\n\nThe modern gilders do also make use of gold leaves of divers thicknesses; but there are some so fine, that a thousand do not weigh above four or five drachms. The thickest are used for gilding on iron and other metals; and the thinnest on wood. But we have another advantage over the ancients in the manner of using or applying the gold: the secret of painting in oil, discovered of late ages, furnishes us with means of gilding works that shall endure all the injuries of time and weather, which to the ancients was impracticable. They had no way to lay the gold on bodies that would not endure the fire but with whites of eggs or size, neither of which will endure the water; so that they could only gild such places as were sheltered from the moisture of the weather.\n\nThe Greeks called the composition on which they applied their gilding on wood leucophorum or leucophorum; which is described as a sort of glutinous compound earth, serving in all probability to make the gold stick and bear polishing. But the particulars of this earth, its colour, ingredients, &c. the antiquaries and naturalists are not agreed upon.\n\nThe lustre and beauty of gold have occasioned several inquiries and discoveries concerning the different methods of applying it to different substances. Hence the art of gilding is very extensive, and contains many particular operations and various management.\n\nA colour of gold is given by painting and by varnishing, without employing gold; but this is a false kind of gilding. Thus a very fine golden colour is given to brafs and to silver, by applying upon these metals a gold-coloured varnish, which, being transparent, shows all the brilliancy of the metals beneath. Many ornaments of brafs were varnished in this manner, which is called gold lacquering, to distinguish them from those which are really gilt. Silver leaves thus varnished are put upon leather, which is then called gilt leather. See Gilding, Lacquer.\n\nAmongst the false gilding may also be reckoned those which are made with thin leaves of copper or brafs, called Dutch leaf. In this manner are made all the kinds of what is called gilt paper.\n\nIn the true gilding, gold is applied to the surface of bodies. The gold intended for this purpose ought in general to be beat into thin leaves, or otherwise divided into very fine parts.\n\nAs metals cannot adhere well merely by contact to any but to other metallic substances, when gold is to be fixed, it must be previously covered with some gluey and tenacious substance by which the gold shall be made to adhere. These substances are in general called fixers. Some of these are made of vegetable and animal glues, and others of oily, gluey, and drying matters. Upon these the leaves of gold are applied, and pressed down with a little cotton or a hare's foot; and when the whole is dry, the work is to be finished and polished with a hard instrument, called a dog's tooth, to give lustre.\n\nWhen the work is required to be capable of resisting rain or moisture, it ought to be previously covered with a composition of drying oil and yellow ochre ground together; otherwise a water size may be used, which is prepared by boiling cuttings of parchment or white leather in water, and by mixing with this some chalk or whiting: several layers of this size must be laid upon the wood, and over these a layer of the same size mixed with yellow ochre. Lastly, Another mixture, called gold size, is to be applied above these; upon which the gold leaves are to be fixed. This gold size, the use of which is to make the gold leaf capable of being burnished, is composed of tobacco-pipe clay, ground with some ruddle or black lead, and tempered with a little tallow or oil of olives. The edges of glasses may be gilt by applying first a very thin coat of varnish, upon which the gold leaf is to be fixed; and when the varnish is hardened, may be burnished. This varnish is prepared by boiling powdered amber with linseed oil in a brafs vessel to which a valve is fitted, and by diluting the above solution with four or five times its quantity of oil of turpentine; and that it may dry sooner, it may be ground with some white lead.\n\nThe method of applying gold upon metals is entirely different. The surface of the metal to be gilt is first metals, to be cleaned; and then leaves are to be applied to it, which, by means of rubbing with a polished bloodstone, and a certain degree of heat, are made to adhere perfectly well. In this manner silver leaf is fixed and burnished upon brafs in the making of what is called French plate, and sometimes also gold leaf is burnished upon copper and upon iron.\n\nGold is applied to metals in several other ways. One of these is by previously forming the gold into a paste or amalgam with mercury. In order to obtain a small amalgam of gold and mercury, the gold is first to be reduced into thin plates or grains, which are heated red hot, and thrown into mercury previously heated, till it begins to smoke. Upon stirring the mercury with an iron rod, the gold totally disappears. The proportion of mercury to gold is generally as six or eight to one.\nWith this amalgam the surface of the metal to be gilded is to be covered; then a sufficient heat is to be applied to evaporate the mercury; and the gold is laftly to be burnished with a blood-flone.\n\nThis method of gilding by amalgamation is chiefly used for gilding copper, or an alloy of copper, with a small portion of zinc, which more readily receives the amalgam; and is also preferable for its colour, which more resembles that of gold than the colour of copper. When the metal to be gilt is wrought or chased, it ought to be previously covered with quicksilver before the amalgam is applied, that this may be easier spread; but when the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam may be applied directly to it. The quicksilver or amalgam is made to adhere to the metal by means of a little aquafortis, which is rubbed on the metallic surface at the same time, by which this surface is cleansed from any rust or tarnish which might prevent the union or adhesion of the metals. But the use of the nitrous acid in this operation is not, as is generally supposed, confined merely to cleanse the surface of the metal to be gilt from any rust or tarnish it may have acquired; but it also greatly facilitates the application of the amalgam to the surface of that metal, probably in the following manner: It first dissolves part of the mercury of the amalgam; and when this solution is applied to the copper, this latter metal having a stronger affinity for nitrous acid than the mercury has, precipitates the mercury upon its surface, in the same manner as a polished piece of iron precipitates copper upon its surface from a solution of blue vitriol. When the metal to be gilt is thus covered over with a thin precipitated coat of mercury, it readily receives the amalgam. In this solution and precipitation of mercury, the principal use of the nitrous acid in the process of gilding appears to consist. The amalgam being equally spread over the surface of the metal to be gilt by means of a brush, the mercury is then to be evaporated by a heat just sufficient for that purpose; for if it be too great, part of the gold may also be expelled, and part of it will run together, and leave some of the surface of the metal bare: while the mercury is evaporating, the piece is to be from time to time taken from the fire, that it may be examined, that the amalgam may be spread more equally by means of a brush, that any defective parts of it may be again covered, and that the heat may not be too suddenly applied to it: when the mercury is evaporated, which is known by the surface being entirely become of a dull yellow colour, the metal must then undergo other operations, by which the fine gold colour is given to it. First, the gilded piece of metal is rubbed with a scratch brush (which is a brush composed of bristles) till its surface is made smooth; then it is covered over with a composition called gilding wax, and is again exposed to the fire till the wax be burnt off. This wax is composed of bees wax, sometimes mixed with some of the following substances; red ochre, verdigris, copper scales, alum, vitriol, borax: but according to Dr Lewis, the saline substances alone are sufficient, without any wax. By this operation the colour of the gilding is heightened; and this effect seems to be produced by a perfect distillation of some mercury remaining after the former operation. This distillation is well effected by this equable application of heat. The gilt\n\nsurface is then covered over with a saline composition, consisting of nitre, alum, or other vitriolic salt, ground together, and mixed up into a paste with water or urine. The piece of metal thus covered is exposed to a certain degree of heat, and then quenched in water. By this method its colour is further improved, and brought nearer to that of gold. This effect seems to be produced by the acid of nitre (which is disengaged by the vitriolic acid of the alum, or other vitriolic salt, during the exposure to heat) acting upon any particles of copper which may happen to lie on the gilded surface. Lastly, some artists think that they give an additional lustre to their gilt work by dipping it in a liquor prepared by boiling some yellow materials, as sulphur, orpiment, or turmeric. The only advantage of this operation is, that a part of the yellow matter, as the sulphur or turmeric, remains in some of the hollows of the carved work, in which the gilding is apt to be more imperfect, and to which it gives a rich and solid appearance.\n\nIron cannot be gilt by amalgamation, unless, as it is said, it be previously coated with copper by dipping in a solution of blue vitriol. Iron may also receive a golden coat from a saturated solution of gold in aqua regia, mixed with spirit of wine, the iron having a greater affinity with the acid, from which it therefore precipitates the gold. Whether any of these two methods be applicable to use, is uncertain: but the method commonly employed of fixing gold upon iron is that above mentioned, of burnishing gold leaf upon this metal when heated so as to become blue; and the operation will be more perfect if the surface has been previously scratched or grated.\n\nAnother method is mentioned by authors of gilding upon metals, and also upon earthen ware, and upon glass; which is, to fuse gold with regulus of antimony, to pulverize the mass which is sufficiently brittle to admit that operation, to spread this powder upon the piece to be gilt, and expose it to such a fire that the regulus may be evaporated, while the gold remains fixed. The inconveniences of this method, according to Dr Lewis, are, that the powder does not adhere to the piece, and cannot be equally spread; that part of the gold is dissipated along with the regulus; that glass is fusible with the heat necessary for the evaporation of regulus of antimony; and that copper is liable to be corroded by the regulus, and to have its surface rendered uneven.\n\nOn this subject of gilding by amalgamation Dr Lewis improvement by has the following remarks. \"There are two principal inconveniences in this business: One, that the workmen are exposed to the fumes of the mercury, and generally, sooner or later, have their health greatly impaired by them: the other, the loss of the mercury; for though part of it is said to be detained in cavities made in the chimney for that purpose, yet the greatest part of it is lost. From some trials I have made, it appeared that both these inconveniences, particularly the first and most considerable one, might in good measure be avoided, by means of a furnace of a due construction. If the communication of a furnace with its chimney, instead of being over the fire, is made under the grate, the ash-pit door, or other apertures beneath the grate, closed, and the mouth of the furnace left open; the current of air, which otherwise would have entered beneath,\nGilding, enters now at the top, and passing down through the grate to the chimney, carries with it completely both the vapour of the fuel and the fumes of such matters as are placed upon it; the back part of the furnace should be raised a little higher above the fire than the fore part, and an iron plate laid over it, that the air may enter only at the front, where the workman stands, who will be thus effectually secured from the fumes and from being incommodeed with the heat, and at the same time have full liberty of introducing, inspecting, and removing the work. If such a furnace is made of strong forged (not milled) iron plate, it will be sufficiently durable: the upper end of the chimney may reach above a foot and a half higher than the level of the fire; over this is to be placed a larger tube, leaving an interval of an inch or more all round between it and the chimney, and reaching to the height of 10 or 12 feet, the higher the better. The external air, passing up between the chimney and the outer pipe, prevents the latter from being much heated, so that the mercurial fumes will condense against its sides into running quicksilver, which, falling down to the bottom, is there caught in a hollow rim, formed by turning inwards a portion of the lower part, and conveyed, by a pipe at one side, into a proper receiver.\n\nMr. Hellot communicates, in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1745, a method of making raised figures of gold on works of gold or silver, found among the papers of M. du Fay, and of which M. du Fay himself had seen several trials. Fine gold in powder, such as results from the parting of gold and silver by aquafortis, is directed to be laid in a heap on a levigating stone, a cavity made in the middle of the heap, and half its weight of pure mercury put into the cavity; some of the fetid spirit obtained from garlic root by distillation in a retort, is then to be added, and the whole immediately mingled and ground with a muller till the mixture is reduced into an uniform gray powder. The powder is to be ground with lemon juice to the consistence of paint, and applied on the piece previously well cleaned and rubbed over with the same acid juice; the figures drawn with it may be raised to any degree by repeating the application. The piece is exposed to a gentle fire till the mercury is evaporated so as to leave the gold yellow, which is then to be pressed down, and rubbed with the finger and a little sand, which makes it appear solid and brilliant; after this it may be cut and embellished. The author observes, that being of a spongy texture, it is more advisable to cut it with a chisel than to raise it with a graver; that it has an imperfection of being always pale; and that it would be a desirable thing to find means of giving it colour, as by this method ornaments might be made of exquisite beauty and with great facility. As the paleness appears to proceed from a part of the mercury retained by the gold, I apprehend it might be remedied by the prudent application of a little warm aquafortis, which dissolving the mercury from the exterior part, would give at least a superficial high colour: if the piece is silver, it must be defended from the aquafortis by covering it with wax. Instruments and ornaments of gold, stained by mercury where the gold is connected with substances incapable of bearing fire, may be restored to their colour by the same means.\n\nThe foregoing process is given entirely on the authority of the French writer. I have had no experience of it myself, but have seen very elegant figures of gold raised upon silver, on the same principle, by a method different procedure. Some cinnabar was ground, not with the distilled spirit, but with the expressed juice of garlic, a fluid remarkably tenacious. This mixture was spread all over the polished silver; and when the first layer is dry, a second, and after this a third, was applied. Over these were spread as many layers of another mixture, composed chiefly of asphaltum and linseed oil boiled down to a due consistence. The whole being dried with a gentle heat on a kind of wire grate, the figures were traced and cut down to the silver so as to make its surface rough: the incisions were filled with an amalgam of gold, raised to different heights in different parts according to the nature of the design; after which a gentle fire, at the same time that it evaporated the mercury, destroyed the tenacity of the gummy juice, so that the coating, which served to confine the amalgam, and as a guide in the application of it, was now easily got off. The gold was then pressed down and embellished as in the former method; and had this advantage, that the surface of the silver under it having been made rough, it adhered more firmly, so as not to be in danger of coming off, as M. du Fay says the gold applied in his way sometimes did. The artist, however, found the process too troublesome, that though he purchased the receipt for a considerable sum, he has laid the practice aside.\n\nFinally, some metals, particularly silver, may be gilt in the following manner:\n\nLet gold be dissolved in aqua regia. In this solution pieces of linen are to be dipped, and burnt to black; the ashes being rubbed on the surface of the ingot silver, by means of a wet linen rag, apply the particles of gold which they contain, and which by this method adhere very well. The remaining part of the ashes is to be washed off; and the surface of the silver, which in this state does not seem to be gilt, is to be burnished with a blood-stone, till it acquire a fine colour of gold. This method of gilding is very easy, and consumes a very small quantity of gold. Most gilt ornaments upon fans, snuff boxes, and other toys of much show and little value, are nothing but silver gilt in this manner.\n\nGold may also be applied to glass, porcelain, and other vitrified matters. As the surface of these matters of gilding is very smooth, and consequently is capable of a very glaze perfect contact with gold leaves, these leaves adhere to them with some force, although they are not of metallic nature. This gilding is so much more perfect, as the gold is more exactly applied to the surface of the glass. The pieces are then to be exposed to a certain degree of heat, and burnished slightly to give them lustre.\n\nA more substantial gilding is fixed upon glass, enamel, and porcelain, by applying to these substances powder of gold mixed with a solution of gum arabic, or with some essential oil, and a small quantity of borax; after which a sufficient heat is to be applied to soften the glass and the gold, which is then to be burnished. With this mixture any figures may be drawn. The powders for this purpose may be made, e.g., by grinding gold leaf with honey, which is afterwards\nto be washed away with water. 2. By distilling to drynels a solution of gold in aqua regia. 3. By evaporating the mercury from an amalgam of gold, taking care to stir well the mass near the end of the process. 4. By precipitating gold from its solution in aqua regia, by applying to it a solution of green vitriol in water, or some copper, and perhaps some other metallic substances.","sp":385,"ep":389},{"h":"GILEAD","t":"the son of Machir, and grandson of Manasseh, had his inheritance allotted him in the mountains of Gilead, from whence he took his name.

At a very early period of life, his father, who was a deacon of the Baptist church at Kettering, discovered in him an uncommon capacity for learning; and his ability for literary pursuits afterwards appeared by the rapid progress in whatever became the object of his study. He was sent to a grammar school in the neighbourhood; where he soon surpassed those boys who were much his seniors in age and as pupils. At this school he continued till he arrived at his 11th year; where he read most of the Latin classics, and made considerable proficiency in the Greek language.\n\nMr. Gill's celebrity as a scholar, and his strong attachment to books, were soon observed by the neighbouring clergy, who frequently met and conversed with him at a bookseller's shop, to which he referred for the purpose of reading; and indeed such was his application to books, that it became a proverbial saying among the common people, \"Such a thing is as certain, as that John Gill is in the bookseller's shop.\"\n\nHe left the grammar school, however, early in life. This was occasioned by the imperious conduct of his master, who insisted that the children of dissenting parents should, with other scholars that belonged to the establishment, attend him to church on week days during the performance of divine service. The dissenters considered this requisition as a stretch of power to which his engagements with them gave no claim; and as it was virtually making conformity a test by which his pupils were to expect the benefits of tuition, they resented his conduct; and the children of those parents that were in affluent circumstances were removed to seminaries where the same advantages might be obtained without being subject to the impositions of clerical bigotry. But as the parents of Mr. Gill had it not in their power to confer on him the same privilege, the same steps could not be taken to facilitate his advancement in learning. To pave the way, however, for the completion of his studies, efforts were made by several ministers, of different denominations, to get him upon one or other of the funds in London. For this purpose specimens of his progress in the different branches of literature were transmitted to the metropolis: in answer to which it was objected, \"that he was too young, and that should he continue, as it might be expected he would, to make such rapid advances in his studies, he would go through the common circle before he would be capable of taking care of himself, or of being employed in any public service.\" But these formidable objections were of no weight with our young scholar; his love of learning was unconquerable. Insuperable difficulties, it is true, obstructed the way in which literary eminence is usually acquired; but these difficulties could neither repress his ardent desire of knowledge, nor damp the zeal and application that had marked his former studies. For though his time was daily devoted to the business of his father; yet he had so far improved the hours of leisure, as to be able, before he arrived at his 19th year, to read all the Greek and Latin authors that fell in his way. He studied logic, rhetoric, moral and natural philosophy; and learnt the Hebrew language so as to read it with ease, without any other assistance than Buxtorf's grammar and lexicon.\n\nNeither the pursuit of learning, however, nor the other necessary avocations incumbent on Mr. Gill, could eradicate those religious impressions received in early life. On November 1. 1716, he made a public profession of his faith before the Baptist church at Kettering, and was baptized the same day by Mr. Thomas Wallis. Of this church Mr. Gill had not been long a member before he was called to the work of the ministry; soon after which, he removed to Higham-Ferrers, with a view to pursue his studies under the direction of Mr. Davis; but his stay at this place was soon interrupted by an invitation from London in 1719, to preach to the Baptist church in Horshamdown, over which he was the same year, being the 22d of his age, ordained pastor; which office he sustained upwards of 51 years.\n\nMr. Gill had not been long in London, before rabbinical learning, of which he had before considerable knowledge, became an object of pursuit. To facilitate his progress through the intricacies of this labyrinth, he contracted an acquaintance with one of the most learned Jewish rabbies. He read the Targums, the Talmuds, the Rabbot, their ancient commentaries, the book Zohar, and whatever else of this kind he was able to procure. Of the oriental languages he made himself\nhimself a complete master: in short, there was no branch of knowledge that could either enlarge or enrich Biblical learning, which, however difficult, was not attempted and attained: and it may be truly affirmed, that in this line he had but few equals, and that the annals of literature do not exhibit a character by whom he was excelled.\n\nIn 1748 Mr Gill published a commentary on the New Testament in three volumes folio. The immense reading and learning discoverable in this arduous work, attracted the attention of the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen; and procured for him, without either his solicitation or his knowledge, a diploma, creating him doctor in divinity. This intelligence was communicated to the doctor in the most handsome terms by the professors Othorn and Pollock; who declared, \"that on account of his knowledge of the Scriptures, of the Oriental languages, and of Jewish antiquities, of his learned defence of the Scriptures against Deists and Infidels, and the reputation gained by his other works; the university had, without his privity, unanimously agreed to confer on him the degree of doctor in divinity.\"\n\nDr Gill's sentiments, as a divine, were throughout Calvinistic: \"And perhaps no man (says the Rev. Mr Toplady, a minister in the church of England) since the days of Austin, has written so largely in defense of the system of grace; and certainly no man has treated that momentous subject in all its branches, more closely, judiciously, and successfully. What was said of Edward the Black Prince, that he never fought a battle which he did not win; what has been remarked of the great duke of Marlborough, that he never undertook a siege which he did not carry; may be justly accommodated to our great philosopher and divine; who, so far as the distinguishing doctrines of the gospel are concerned, never besieged an error which he did not force from its strong holds, nor ever encountered an adversary whom he did not baffle and subdue. His learning and labors, if exceedable, were exceeded only by the invariable sanctity of his life and conversation. From his childhood to his entrance on the ministry, and from his entrance on the ministry to the moment of his dissolution, not one of his most inveterate opposers was ever able to charge him with the least shadow of immorality. Himself, no less than his writings, demonstrated that the doctrine of grace does not lead to licentiousness. Those who had the honour and happiness of being admitted into the number of his friends, can go still farther in their testimony. They know that his moral demeanor was more than blameless: it was from first to last consistently exemplary. And indeed an undeviating constancy, both in his views of evangelical truths, and in his obedience as a servant of God, was one of those qualities by which his cast of character was eminently marked. He was in every respect a burning and a shining light: burning with love to God, to truth, and to souls; shining as an example to believers, in word, in faith, in purity; a pattern of good works, and a model of all holy conversation and godliness; and while true religion and sound learning have a single friend remaining in the British empire, the works and name of Gill will be precious and revered.\"\n\nHe died at Camberwell, October 14, 1771, ad 73 years 10 months and 10 days. In 1718 the Doctor married Mrs Elizabeth Negus; by whom he had many children, two of whom only survived him. Mrs Gill died in 1764.\n\nHis works are, A Commentary on the Old and New Testament in 9 vols folio. A Body of Divinity in 3 vols quarto. The Cause of God and Truth, 4 vols 8vo.

It has a manufacture of linen, but the chief produce is grazing and the dairies. Near it are the traces of an ancient residence of Norman or Saxon kings, 320 feet long and 240 broad, surrounded by a rampart of earth.

Edward I. spent his Christmas here in 1273; but the whole of the materials are removed, and the foundation of the house only can be traced, which was in the form of the letter L, in length 180 feet by 80 broad, and the foot of the letter 48 by 40; the area of the house containing 168,000 square feet. It flooded half a mile from the church, on the road to Shafton, encompassed by a moat, now dry, in some places nine feet deep and 20 broad. The rampart appears to have been 30 feet thick. Here is a free school, a large old building, and a workhouse, as well as two stone bridges. In 1694 it received damage of near 4000l. by a fire.

As he was bred in the Catholic religion, so he for some time defended it against the reformers, and at Oxford held a disputation with Hooper afterward bishop of Worcester and a martyr for the Protestant faith; but was staggered in another disputation with Peter Martyr, and began seriously to examine the contested points by the best authorities.\n\nThus, being presented to the vicarage of Norton in the diocese of Durham, he soon resigned it, and went abroad to consult eminent professors on both sides; and after three years' absence returned a little before the death of Queen Mary, satisfied in the general doctrines of the reformation. He was kindly received by his uncle Dr Tonfall, bishop of Durham; who soon after gave him the archdeaconry of Durham, to which the rectory of Effington was annexed. When repairing to his parish, though the persecution was then at its height, he boldly preached against the vices, errors, and corruptions of the times, especially in the clergy, on which a charge consisting of 13 articles was drawn up against him, and presented in form to the bishop. But Dr Tonfall found a method of dismissing the cause in such a manner as to protect his nephew, without endangering himself, and soon after presented him to the rich living of Houghton le Spring. He was a second time accused to the bishop, and again protected; when his enemies, enraged at this second defeat, laid their complaint before Dr Bonner, bishop of London; who immediately gave orders to apprehend him. Upon which Mr Gilpin bravely prepared for martyrdom; and ordering his house steward to provide him a long garment that he might make a decent appearance at the stake, set out for London. Luckily, however, he broke his leg on the journey; which protracted his arrival until the news of the queen's death freed him from all further apprehensions. Being immediately set at liberty, he returned to Houghton, where he was received by his parishioners with the sincerest joy.\n\nUpon the deprivation of the Popish bishops, he was offered the see of Carlisle, which he declined; and confining his attention to his rectory, discharged all the duties of his function in the most exemplary manner. To the greatest humanity and courtesy, he added an unwearied application to the instruction of those under his care. He was not satisfied with the advice he gave in public, but used to instruct in private; and brought his parishioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties. He had a most engaging manner towards those whom he thought well disposed: nay, his very reproof was so conducted, that it seldom gave offence; the becoming gentleness with which it was urged made it always appear the effect of friendship. Thus, with unceasing affability, did he employ himself in admonishing the vicious, and engaging the well-intentioned; by which means, in a few years, he made a greater change in his neighbourhood than could well have been imagined. A remarkable instance, what reformation a single man may effect, when he hath it earnestly at heart!\n\nBut his hopes were not so much in the present generation, as in the succeeding. It was an easier task, he found, to prevent vice, than to correct it; to form the young to virtue, than to amend the bad habits of the old. He employed much of his time, therefore, in endeavouring to improve the minds of the younger part of his parish; suffering none to grow up in an ignorance of their duty; but pressing it as the wisest part to mix religion with their labour, and amidst the cares of this life to have a constant eye upon the next. He attended to every thing which might be of service to his parishioners. He was very affiduous in preventing all law suits among them. His hall is said to have been often thronged with people, who came to him about their differences. He was not indeed much acquainted with law; but he could decide equitably, and that satisfied: nor could his sovereign's commission have given him more weight than his own character gave him.\n\nHis hospitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country. He spent in his family every fortnight 40 bushels of corn, 20 bushels of malt, and a whole ox; besides a proportionable quantity of other kinds of provision. Strangers and travellers found a cheerful reception. All were welcome that came; and even their beasts had so much care taken of them, that it was humorously said, \"If a horse was turned loose in any part of the country, it would immediately make its way to the rector of Houghton's.\"\n\nEvery Sunday, from Michaelmas till Easter, was a sort of public day with him. During this season he expected to see all his parishioners and their families. For their reception, he had three tables well covered: the first was for gentlemen, the second for husbandmen and farmers, and the third for day labourers. This piece of hospitality he never omitted, even when lofts, or a scarcity of provision, made its continuance rather difficult to him. He thought it his duty, and that was a deciding motive. Even when he was absent from home, no alteration was made in his family expences; the poor were fed as usual, and his neighbours entertained.\n\nBut notwithstanding all this painful industry, and the large scope it had in so extended a parish, Mr Gilpin thought the sphere of his benevolence yet too confined. It grieved him extremely to see everywhere, in the parishes around him, so great a degree of ignorance and superstition, occasioned by the shameful neglect of the pastoral care in the clergy of those parts. These bad consequences induced him to supply, as far as he could, what was wanting in others. For this purpose, every year he used regularly to visit the most neglected parishes in Northumberland, Yorkshire, Cheshire, Westmorland, and Cumberland; and that his own parish in the mean time might not suffer, he was at the expense of a constant attendant. In each place he stayed two or three days; and his method was, to call the people about him, and lay before them, in as plain a way as possible, the danger of leading wicked or even careless lives; explaining to them the nature of true religion; instructing them in the duties they owed to God, their neighbour, and themselves; and showing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their present as well as future happiness.\n\nAs Mr Gilpin had all the warmth of an enthusiast, though...\nthough under the direction of a very calm and sober judgment, he never wanted an audience, even in the wildest parts; where he roused many to a sense of religion, who had contracted the most inveterate habits of inattention to every thing of a serious nature. And wherever he came, he used to visit all the gaols and places of confinement; few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed minister. And by his labours, and affectionate manner of behaving, he is said to have reformed many very abandoned persons in those places. He would employ his interest likewise for such criminals whose cases he thought attended with any hard circumstances, and often procured pardons for them.\n\nThere is a tract of country upon the border of Northumberland, called Reddendale and Tine-dale, of all barbarous places in the north at that time the most barbarous. Before the Union, this place was called the debateable land, as subject by turns to England and Scotland, and the common theatre where the two nations were continually acting their bloody scenes. It was inhabited by a kind of desperate banditti, rendered fierce and active by constant alarms: they lived by theft, used to plunder on both sides of the barrier; and what they plundered on one, they exposed to sale on the other; by that means escaping justice. And in this dreadful country, where no man would even travel that could help it, Mr Gilpin never failed to spend some part of every year.\n\nHe generally chose the Christmas holidays for his journey, because he found the people at that season most disengaged, and most easily assembled. He had set places for preaching, which were as regularly attended as the affluence towns of a circuit. If he came where there was a church, he made use of it: if not, of barns, or any other large building; where great crowds of people were sure to attend him, some for his instructions, and others for his charity. This was a very difficult and laborious employment. The country was so poor, that what provision he could get, extreme hunger only could make palatable. The inclemency of the weather, and the badness of the roads through a mountainous country, and at that season covered with snow, exposed him likewise often to great hardships. Sometimes he was overtaken by the night, the country being in many places desolate for several miles together, and obliged to lodge out in the cold. At such times, we are told, he would make his servant ride about with his horses, whilst himself on foot used as much exercise as his age and the fatigues of the preceding day would permit. All this he cheerfully underwent; esteeming such services well compensated by the advantages which he hoped might accrue from them to his uninstructed fellow creatures.\n\nThe disinterested pains he took among these barbarous people, and the good offices he was always ready to do them, drew from them the warmest and sincerest expressions of gratitude. Indeed, he was little less than adored among them, and might have brought the whole country almost to what he pleased. One instance that is related, shows how greatly he was revered. By the carelessness of his servants, his horses were one day stolen. The news was quickly propagated, and every one expressed the highest indignation at the fact. The thief was rejoicing over his prize, when, by the report of the country, he found whose horses he had taken. Terrified at what he had done, he instantly came trembling back, confessed the fact, returned the horses, and declared he believed the devil would have seized him directly, had he carried them off knowing them to have been Mr Gilpin's.\n\nWe have already taken notice of Mr Gilpin's uncommonly generous and hospitable manner of living. The value of his rectory was about \u00a3400. a year: an income, indeed, at that time very considerable, but yet in appearance very disproportionate to the generous things he did: indeed, he could not have done them; unless his frugality had been equal to his generosity. His friends, therefore, could not but wonder to find him, amidst his many great and continual expenses, entertain the design of building and endowing a grammar school: a design, however, which his exact economy soon enabled him to accomplish, though the expense of it amounted to upwards of \u00a3500. His school was no sooner opened, than it began to flourish; and there was so great a resort of young people to it, that in a little time the town was not able to accommodate them. He put himself, therefore, to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own house for that purpose, where he seldom had fewer than 20 or 30 children. Some of these were the sons of persons of distinction, whom he boarded at easy rates: but the greater part were poor children, whom he not only educated, but clothed and maintained: he was at the expense likewise of boarding in the town many other poor children. He used to bring several every year from the different parts where he preached, particularly Reddendale and Tine-dale; which places he was at great pains in civilizing, and contributed not a little towards rooting out that barbarism which every year prevailed less among them.\n\nAs to his school, he not only placed able masters in it, whom he procured from Oxford, but himself likewise constantly inspected it. And, that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys, he always took particular notice of the most forward: he would call them his own scholars, and would fend for them often into his study, and there instruct them himself. One method used by him to fill his school was a little singular. Whenever he met a poor boy upon the road, he would make trial of his capacity by a few questions, and if he found it such as pleased him, he would provide for his education. And besides those whom he sent from his own school to the universities, and there wholly maintained, he would likewise give to others, who were in circumstances to do something for themselves, what farther assistance they needed. By which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education, who otherwise would not have done it. And Mr Gilpin did not think it enough to afford the means only of an academical education to these young people; but endeavoured to make it as beneficial to them as he could. He still considered himself as their proper guardian; and seemed to think himself bound to the public for their being made useful members of it, as far as it lay in his power to make them so. With this view he held a punctual correspondence with their tutors; and made the youths themselves frequently write to him, and give him an account of their studies. So solicitous indeed was he about\nGilpin about them, knowing the many temptations to which their age and situation exposed them, that once every other year he generally made a journey to the universities to inspect their behaviour. And this uncommon care was not unrewarded; for many of his scholars became ornaments to the church, and exemplary instances of piety.\n\nTo the account that hath been already given of Mr Gilpin's hospitality and benevolence, the following particulars may be added. Every Thursday throughout the year, a very large quantity of meat was dished wholly for the poor; and every day they had what quantity of broth they wanted. Twenty-four of the poorest were his constant pensioners. Four times in the year a dinner was provided for them; when they received from his steward a certain quantity of corn, and a sum of money: and at Christmas they had always an ox divided among them.\n\nWhenever he heard of any in distress, whether of his own parish or any other, he was sure to relieve them. In his walks abroad, he would frequently bring home with him poor people, and send them away clothed as well as fed. He took great pains to inform himself of the circumstances of his neighbours, that the modesty of the sufferer might not prevent his relief. But the money best laid out was, in his opinion, that which encouraged industry. It was one of his greatest pleasures to make up the losses of his industrious neighbours, and prevent their sinking under them. If a poor man had lost a beast, he would send him another in its room: or if any farmer had had a bad year, he would make him an abatement in his tithes. Thus, as far as he was able, he took the misfortunes of his parish upon himself; and, like a true shepherd, exposed himself for his flock. But of all kinds of industrious poor, he was most forward to assist those who had large families; such never failed to meet with his bounty, when they wanted to settle their children in the world.\n\nIn the distant parishes where he preached, as well as in his own neighbourhood, his generosity and benevolence were continually showing themselves; particularly in the defolate parts of Northumberland. \"When he began his journey,\" says an old manuscript life of him, \"he would have 10 pounds in his purse; and, at his coming home, he would be 20 nobles in debt, which he would always pay within a fortnight after. In the gaols he visited, he was not only careful to give the prisoners proper instructions, but used to purchase for them likewise what necessaries they wanted.\n\nEven upon the public road, he never let slip an opportunity of doing good. He has often been known to take off his cloak, and give it to a half naked traveller: and when he had scarce money enough in his pocket to provide himself a dinner, yet would he give away part of that little, or the whole, if he found any who seemed to stand in need of it. Of this benevolent temper, the following instance is preserved. One day returning home he saw in a field several people crowding together; and judging something more than ordinary had happened, he rode up, and found that one of the horses in a team had suddenly dropped down, which they were endeavouring to raise; but in vain, for the horse was dead. The owner of it seemed much dejected with his misfortune; and declaring how grievous a loss it would be to him, Mr Gilpin bade him not be disheartened: \"I'll let you have (says he), honest man, that horse of mine,\" and pointed to his servant's. \u2014\"Ah! master (replied the countryman), my pocket will not reach such a beast as that.\"\n\n\"Come, come (said Mr Gilpin), take him, take him; and when I demand my money, then thou shalt pay me.\"\n\nThis worthy and excellent divine, who merited and obtained the glorious titles of the Father of the Poor, and the Apostle of the North, died in 1583, in the 66th year of his age.\n\nGILTHEAD.

This river is extremely large, having more water than the Nile, and being much more rapid; so that, during the rainy season, it would be altogether impassable, were it not for the large rocks which are in its channel. The extreme difficulty which occurs in passing this river, however, is the means of preserving the kingdom of Gingiro, which would otherwise be conquered in a single season by the Galla.\n\nThe most remarkable particular with regard to this kingdom is, that the sovereign is a professed votary of the devil. \"This superstition (says Mr Bruce) reaches down all the western side of the continent on the Atlantic ocean, in the countries of Congo, Angola, and Benin. In spite of the firmest foundation in true philosophy, a traveller, who decides from the information and investigation of facts, will find it very difficult to treat these appearances as absolute fictions, or as owing to the superiority of cunning of one man in overreaching another. For my own part, I confess, I am equally at a loss to assign reasons for disbelieving the fiction on which their pretensions to some supernatural information are founded, as to account for them by the operation of ordinary causes.\"\n\nIn this kingdom every thing is conducted, or pretended to be conducted, by magic; and all those slaves, which in other African countries are sold to Europeans, are here sacrificed to the devil, human blood being a necessary part in all their accursed solemnities. \"How far (says Mr Bruce) this reaches to the southward, I do not know; but I look upon this to be the geographical bounds of the reign of the devil.\"\nWith regard to this country, very little farther is known, than some of the customs of the people transiently picked up by the Jesuit missionaries in Abyssinia. From them we learn, that the kingdom is hereditary in one family, though it does not regularly descend to the eldest son, the king being chosen by the nobles; in which they resemble their neighbours the Abyssinians. When the king dies, his body is wrapped in a fine cloth, and a cow is killed. The body so wrapped up is next enclosed in the cow's skin; and all the princes of the royal family fly and hide themselves in the bushes, while those who are intrusted with the election enter the thickets, beating about everywhere as if for game. At last a bird of prey, called in their language liber, appears, and hovers over the person destined to be king; crying and making a great noise without quitting his station. By this means the person destined to be elected is found out, surrounded, as is reported, by lions, tigers, panthers, and other wild beasts; all which are supposed to be brought by the power of magic or of the devil.\u2014After the king is found, he flies upon those who came in quest of him with great fury, killing and wounding as many as he can reach, until at last he is dragged to the throne whether he will or not. One particular family have the privilege of conducting him to the throne; and if they should not happen to find him at first, they have a right to take him out of the hands of those who did so; and thus another battle ensues before the vacant throne can be filled. Lastly, Before he enters his palace, two men must be killed; one at the foot of a tree by which the house is supported; and the other at the threshold of the door, which is befouled with the blood of the victim. It is the particular privilege of one family to afford these victims; and so far are they from seeking to avoid this fate, that they glory in the occasion, and willingly offer themselves to meet it.

At some distance, on the old ground in the vale, stands the cathedral, a clumsy building patched up by barbarous architects with various discordant parts. This church is enriched with no works of modern painters or sculptors that claim any title to praise, but the baptismal font is made out of an ancient sarcophagus faced with very beautiful bas-reliefs.

Mr Coxe observes of these mountains in general, that they are composed of many parallel chains, the highest of which occupy the centre, and the others gradually diminish in proportion as we recede from thence. The central chain appears covered with pointed rocks; all parts of which, that are not absolutely perpendicular, lie hid under perpetual snow and ice even in summer. On each side of this ridge are fertile and cultivated valleys, interspersed with numerous villages, and watered by numerous streams. The elevated peaks of the central chain are covered with snow; but their declivities, excepting those that are extremely steep, have all a covering of ice as well as snow; the intermediate parts being filled with vast fields of ice, terminating in the cultivated valleys above mentioned. The same phenomena, though on a smaller scale, occur in those chains that are at a distance from the principal one: in those which are most remote, no ice, and scarcely any snow, is observed, unless upon some of the most elevated summits; and the mountains diminishing in height and ruggedness, appear covered with verdure, until at last they terminate in small hills and plains.\n\nThus the glaciers may be divided into two sorts; one occupying the deep valleys situated in the bottom of the Alps, and distinguished by the name of Ice valleys; the others are those which clothe the declivities and sides of the mountains. These two kinds of glaciers are distinguished by Mr Coxe into the upper and lower glaciers.\n\nThe lower glaciers are by far the most considerable; some of them extending several leagues in length. They do not communicate with each other, as has been generally supposed, few of them being parallel to the central chain; but, stretching mostly in a transverse direction, are bordered at the higher extremity by inaccessible rocks, and at the lower extending into the cultivated valleys. The thickness of the ice varies in different parts. In the glacier des Bois, which extends more than 15 miles in length, and upwards of three in breadth, M. Sauflaire found it generally from 80 to 100 feet; but he was credibly informed, that in some places it was not less than 600 feet, and even more. These vast masses of ice usually rest on an inclined plane; where, being pushed forward by their own weight, and but weakly supported by the rugged rocks beneath them, they are intersected by large crevices, and have an appearance of walls, pyramids, &c., according to the position of the eye in viewing them. In those parts, however, where they lie upon even ground, or such as has only a gentle inclination, the surface of the ice is nearly uniform, the crevices being few and narrow, and the glacier being crossed by travellers on foot without any difficulty. The surface of the ice is rough and granulated, so that people may walk upon it, excepting such places as have a steep descent. It is opaque, full of small bubbles about the size of a pea, very porous, and greatly resembles a mixture of snow and water congealed. A vast quantity of stones and earth falls down from the mountains upon the glaciers, and are by them thrown off on each side according to the descent of the ice, as will be afterwards explained. The place on which these rest is more hard and elevated than the rest of the ice, and is very difficult to walk upon; the earth is likewise laid upon them in such regular heaps, that it appears to have been done by art. This collection of earth and stones is termed by the natives the Moraine.\n\nMr Coxe, who visited the glacier des Bois, informs us, that the appearance of it at a distance was so tremendous, that it seemed impracticable to cross it. Numerous and broad chasms intersected it in every direction; but entering upon it, the company found that courage and activity were only required to accomplish the task. They had large nails in their shoes, and spiked sticks; which on this occasion were found to be particularly serviceable. Having passed the moraine, and descended upon the glacier itself, they found the ice softened by a warm wind which rendered it less slippery than usual. Having walked across it for about a quarter of an hour, they came again to the moraine, along which they continued their journey for half an hour, and then entered upon the great body of the glacier. \"Here (says Mr Coxe) it was curious to observe the numerous little rills produced by the collection of drops occasioned by the thawing of the ice on the upper part of the glacier: these little rills hollow out small channels, and, torrent-like, precipitate themselves into the chasms with a violent noise, increasing the body of waters formed by the melting of the interior surface, and finding an outlet under the immense arch of ice in the valley of Chamouni, from which the Arveron rushes.\" As our traveller proceeded on his journey, he was surprised by the noise of a large fragment of rock which had detached itself from one of the highest needles, and bounded from one precipice to another with great rapidity; but before it reached the plain, it was almost reduced to dust. \"Having proceeded about an hour (says\nGlaciers. (says he) we were astonished with a view more magnificent than imagination can conceive: hitherto the glaciers had scarcely answered my expectations, but now they far surpassed them. Nature had clad herself in all her terrors. Before us was a valley of ice 20 miles in extent, bounded by a circular glacier of pure unbroken snow, named Takul, which leads directly to the foot of Mount Blanc, and is surrounded by large conical rocks, terminating in sharp points like the towers on an ancient fortification; to the right rose a range of magnificent peaks, the intervals filled with glaciers; and far above the rest, the magnificent summit of Mount Blanc, his highest point obscured with clouds. He appeared of such immense magnitude, that, at his presence, the circumjacent mountains, however gigantic, seemed to shrink before him, and hide their diminished heads. In half an hour we arrived at the moraine, which forms a boundary of the valley, crowded it, and proceeded upon a body of ice about three quarters of a mile broad. Here the ice was more even and free from chasms than in the great valley. We then passed a second moraine, and beyond that another mass of ice to a third moraine: descending from thence we came upon the last ridge of ice, broader considerably than the two former, and full of large chasms: it is separated from the rock only by a very narrow moraine. These moraines contain great quantities of crystal.\n\nThey continued to ascend the valley of ice, the scene constantly increasing in magnificence and horror; and having walked about five miles on the ice, they arrived at last at the foot of the eminence named Couvercle, where they were obliged to quit the ice. The doing this was extremely dangerous, and at one place very tremendous. It was a bulging smooth rock, with a precipice of considerable depth terminated by a vast crevice in the ice, which seemed to stop all further progress: a small hollow in the middle, however, afforded room for one foot; and having fixed this, they sprung over to the other side, being helped and directed by the guides who went over first. Having gained the top of the Couvercle, they had a view of three of the glaciers, viz. that of Talefre to the left, l'Echaut in front, and Takul on the right; all uniting in that great one called the Glacier de Bois. The Couvercle itself is a most extraordinary rock, having the appearance of a large irregular building with many sides; the substance of which is granite. Having reached the top, they were surprised with a thunder storm, from which they took shelter under an impending rock. The view was exceedingly magnificent; the glaciers appearing like a rugged expanse of frozen sea bounded by gigantic rocks, and terminated by Mount Blanc. A single rock appeared of a triangular figure covered with Alpine plants; and which by reason of its contrast with the rugged and snowy mountains in the neighbourhood, has obtained the name of the Garden. During this, as well as other excursions among the Alps, Mr Coxe had occasion to observe that the colour of the sky was of a much deeper blue than in the lower regions.\n\nThe upper glaciers may be subdivided into those which cover the summits, and those which extend along the sides of the Alps. Those on the very summit, however, though they have the appearance of ice, are not so in reality, but consist entirely of snow hardened by the extreme cold. M. Saussure found that which covered the top of Mount Blanc to be penetrable, though with difficulty, by a stick; but below this hard crust was a soft snow without coherence. The sides are covered with a mixture of ice and snow; by reason of the superior power of the summer sun to dissolve the snow, which afterwards congeals into hard ice.\n\nSeveral conjectures have been made concerning the formation of these extraordinary bodies of ice. Mr Coxe agrees with M. Gruner in opinion, that they are produced by the continual dissolution of the snow in summer, and its congelation by the succeeding frosts. Hence, on the summits of the mountains where the sun has very little power, the glacier is soft, and contains no ice: as we descend the mountains the confluence becomes firmer, because there is a considerable mixture of snow water, the congelation of which augments the hardness; and in the valleys, the glacier is hardest of all, because the portion of water is there much superior to that of the snow. Hence it seems plain that the glaciers derive their origin from the melting of the snow on the upper parts of the mountains, and the congelation of the water as it advances: and to this cause M. Saussure adds the quantity of snow which often rolls down into the valleys, and congeals along with the water just mentioned.\n\nAnother question concerning the glaciers naturally occurs, namely, Whether they are to be considered as in a state of increase or diminution? Mr Coxe is of opinion, that they occasionally increase and decrease; in proof of which he adduces the following observation: \"The borders of the glacier of Montanvert are mostly skirted with trees; towards its base a vast arch of ice rises to near 100 feet in height; under which the river Arveron rushes with considerable force, and in a large body of water. As we approached the ice, we passed through a wood of firs: those trees which stand at a little distance from the arch are about 80 feet high, and are undoubtedly of a very great age. Between these and the glacier the trees are of a later growth; as is evident from their texture and inferior size. Others, still smaller, have been overturned and enveloped in the ice: there seems to be a kind of regular gradation in the age of these several trees, from the largest which are standing to the smallest that lie prostrate.\"\u2014Hence our author concludes, that the glacier once extended as far as the row of small firs; but that upon its gradual dissolution, a number of trees shot up on the spot it had occupied; since which time the ice has again advanced, and overturned the last grown trees before they had attained to any considerable height.\u2014This he thinks also confirmed by the following fact: \"Large stones of granite are usually found at a small distance from the extremities of the glacier. These stones have certainly fallen from the mountains upon the ice; have been carried on in its progress; and have tumbled into the plain upon the dissolution or sinking of the ice which supported them. These stones, which the natives call Moraine, form a kind of border towards the foot of the valley of ice, and have been pushed forward by the glacier in its advances: they extend even to the place occupied by the larger pines.\"\n\nIn opposition to those who maintain that there is a confluent accumulation of ice and snow in the Alpine regions, our author makes the following remarks: 1. Between the years 1776 and 1785 the glacier of Grindelevald\nGlaciers. Grindelevald had diminished to such a degree, that the spot which its extremity occupied in the former year, was at least 400 paces from that occupied by it in the latter. 2. In the year 1785 the Murailles de Glace, which in 1776 he had described as forming the border of the glacier of Besson, no longer existed; and young trees had shot up in the parts which were then covered by the glacier of Montanvert. Still, however, it may be urged, that these changes only take place in the valleys where the power of the sun is considerable; and that from thence we cannot form any adequate idea of what passes in the more elevated regions, where in all probability more snow falls than can be dissolved. In support of this opinion, it is alleged, that the cold produced by the mass of ice already formed ought to augment it still more; and that within the memory of the present generation, many places have been covered with ice which were not so before. To these arguments, however, Mr Coxe replies, that the caules, which diminish the ice in the upper regions, are no less powerful than the cold which tends to augment it. These are, 1. Rain or sleet; which falling upon the lower glaciers, thaw the ice, increase the rills on its surface, excavate channels, and in many ways tend to diminish its quantity. 2. Evaporation, which takes place even from the surface of the ice itself, acts still more powerfully; and its action is not confined to any particular season. 3. The falling of the snow and ice; both that which comes gradually from the clouds, and that which descends from the mountains in great masses, called by the natives avalanches. When these last fall down into milder regions, though sometimes they may resist the influence of the sun and form ice valleys, yet they generally dissolve. They are most common in the upper glaciers, though sometimes they descend upon the lower, while the gradual descent of snow from the clouds, which chiefly takes place in the lower, contributes very much to lessen the mass. 4. All the lower glaciers or valleys of ice rest on an inclined plane, are hollow, and undermined by torrents which are constantly flowing from the upper glaciers, as well as from their own lowermost surface. Their foundation being thus constantly diminishing, the lower glaciers are carried imperceptibly forward into the cultivated fields, where an end is necessarily put to their progress by the heat of the sun. Hence we may see the reason of that strange phenomenon taken notice of by Mr Coxe, that with one hand he could touch ripe corn, and with the other solid ice. This descent of the glacier is demonstrable from the trees overturned by it, and the moraine always observed at the bottom of the lower glaciers. 5. The heat of the sun is an evident cause of the diminution of the glaciers. To this Mr Coxe adds another cause less generally known, viz. the warm winds which blow by night as well as by day both in the upper and lower glaciers. \"These warm winds (says he) are during summer so common in those parts, that I never crossed a glacier without feeling in some particular positions a warmth similar to the air of a hot bath.\" 6. Another cause is the mean temperature of the earth itself; which, where it is not exposed to the piercing cold of the atmosphere, is found to have a temperature always above the freezing point. As the vast thicknesses of the superincumbent ice, therefore, is in the present case abundantly sufficient to prevent the access of the atmosphere, it is plain that the lower surface of it must, by being in contact with the earth, continually decay.\u2014With regard to the other argument drawn from the known increase of the ice in some places, Mr Coxe does not deny it; but infers, that there is no continual increase of the whole, but that if it increases in some places, it diminishes in others; and his opinion in this respect was confirmed by those who frequent the mountains.","sp":396,"ep":398},{"h":"GLACIS","t":"in building, an easy inflexible slope or declivity.\n\nThe descent of the glacis is less steep than that of the talus.

This seemed somewhat less inhuman, because there was a possibility of avoiding death, by an exertion of skill and courage.\n\nThis occasioned the profession of gladiator to become an art; hence arose matters of the art, and men learned to fight and exercise. These matters, whom the Latins called lanifere, bought them slaves to be trained up to this cruel trade, whom they afterwards sold to such as had occasion to present the people with so horrible a show.\n\nThese exhibitions were at first performed near the sepulchre of the deceased, or about the funeral pile; but were afterwards removed to the circus and amphitheatres, and became ordinary amusements.\n\nThe first show of gladiators, called munus gladiatorium, was exhibited at Rome, according to Valerius Maximus, by\nGladiators by M. and D. Brutus, upon the death of their father, in the year of the city 495. On this occasion there were probably only three pair of gladiators. In 537, the three sons of M. \u00c6milius Lepidus the augur, who had been three times consul, entertained the people with the cruel pleasure of seeing 22 gladiators fight in the forum. In 517, the first Africanus diverted his army at New Carthage with a show of gladiators, which he exhibited in honour of his father and uncle, who had begun the reduction of Spain. In process of time, the Romans became so fond of these bloody entertainments, that not only the heir of any great and rich citizen lately deceased, but all the principal magistrates, presented the people with shows of this nature, to procure their affections. The aediles, praetors, consuls, and, above all, the candidates for offices, made their court to the people, by entertaining them frequently with these fights; and the priests were sometimes the exhibitors of the barbarous shows; for we meet with the ludi pontificales in Suetonius, August. cap. 44, and with the ludi sacerdotaes, in Pliny, Epit. lib. vii. As for the emperors, it was so much their interest to ingratiate themselves with the populace, that they obliged them with combats of gladiators almost upon all occasions; and as these increased, the number of combatants increased likewise. Accordingly, Julius Caesar, in his will, diverted the people with 320 couple. Titus exhibited a show of gladiators, wild beasts, and representations of sea fights, which lasted 100 days; and Trajan continued a solemnity of this nature for 123 days; during which time he brought out 1000 pair of gladiators. Before this time, under the republic, the number of gladiators was so great, that when the conspiracy of Catiline broke out, the senate ordered them to be dispersed into the garrisons and secured, lest they should have joined the disaffected party. See GLADIATORS War.\n\nThese sports were become so common, and their consequences in a variety of respects so dangerous, that Cicero preferred a law that no person should exhibit a show of gladiators within two years before he appeared candidate for any office. Julius Caesar ordered, that only a certain number of men of this profession should be in Rome at a time; Augustus decreed, that only two shows of gladiators should be presented in a year, and never above sixty couple of combatants in a show; and Tiberius provided by an order of senate, that no person should have the privilege of gratifying the people with such a solemnity unless he was worth 400,000 sesterces. They were also considerably regulated by Nerva.\n\nThe emperor Claudius restrained them to certain occasions; but he soon afterwards annulled what he decreed, and private persons began to exhibit them at pleasure as usual; and some carried the brutal satisfaction so far as to have them at their ordinary feasts. And not slaves only, but other persons, would hire themselves to this infamous office.\n\nThe matter of the gladiators made them all first swear that they would fight to death; and if they failed, they were put to death either by fire, or swords, clubs, whips, or the like.\n\nIt was a crime for the wretches to complain when they were wounded, or to ask for death or seek to avoid it when overcome; but it was usual for the emperor or the people to grant them life when they gave no signs of fear, but waited the fatal stroke with courage and intrepidity: Augustus even decreed that it should always be granted them.\n\nFrom slaves and freedmen the inhuman sport at length spread to people of rank and condition; so that Augustus was obliged to issue a public edict that none of the senatorian order should become gladiators; and soon after he laid the same restraint on the knights; nevertheless Nero is related to have brought upwards of 400 senators and 600 Roman knights upon the arena; though Lipius takes both these numbers to be falsified, and not without reason reduces them to 40 senators and 60 knights: yet Domitian, that other monster of cruelty, reigned upon Nero, exhibiting combats of women in the night time.\n\nConstantine the Great is said to have first prohibited the combats of gladiators in the East. At least he forbade those who were condemned to death for their crimes to be employed; there being an order still extant to the praefectus praetorii rather to send them to work in the mines in lieu thereof: it is dated at Berytus in Phoenicia, the first of October 325.\n\nThe emperor Honorius forbade them at Rome on occasion of the death of Telemachus, who coming out of the East into Rome at the time of one of these spectacles, went down into the arena, and used all his endeavours to prevent the gladiators from continuing the sport; upon which the spectators of that carnage, fired with anger, stoned him to death. It must be observed, however, that the practice was not entirely abolished, in the West before Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths. Honorius, on the occasion first mentioned, had prohibited them; but the prohibition does not seem to have been executed. Theodoric, in the year 500, abolished them finally.\n\nSome time before the day of combat, the person who presented the people with the shows gave them notice thereof by programmas or bills, containing the names of the gladiators, and the marks whereby they were to be distinguished: for each had his several badge; which was most commonly a peacock's feather, as appears from the scholiast of Juvenal on the 158th verse of the third satire, and Turnebus Adverf. lib. ii. cap. 8. They also gave notice how long the shows would last, and how many couples of gladiators there were; and it even appears, from the 52d verse of the seventh satire of the second book of Horace, that they sometimes made representations of these things in painting, as is practised among us by those who have anything to show at fairs.\n\nThe day being come, they began the entertainment by bringing two kinds of weapons; the first were slaves or wooden foils, called rudes; and the second were effective weapons, as swords, poniards, &c. The first were called arma ludoria, or exercitoria; the second decoriaria, as being given by decree or sentence of the praetor, or of him at whose expense the spectacle was exhibited. They began to fence or skirmish with the first, which was to be the prelude to the battle; and from these, when well warmed, they advanced to the second at the sound of the trumpets, with which they fought naked. Then they were said vertere arma. The terms of striking were petere et repete; of avoiding a blow, exire;\nGladiators; and when one of the combatants received a remarkable wound, his adversary or the people cried out, *Habet*, or *Hoc habet*. The first part of the engagement was called *ventilare*, *pr\u00e6lude*; and the second, *dimicare ad certum*, or *vera armis pugnare*: and some authors think, with much probability, that it is to these two kinds of combat that St Paul alludes in the passage 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27. \"I fight, not as one that beateth the air; but I keep my body, and bring it into subjection.\"\n\nIf the vanquished surrendered his arms, it was not in the victor's power to grant him life; it was the people during the time of the republic, and the prince or people during the time of the empire, that were alone empowered to grant the boon. The reward of the conqueror was a branch of palm tree, and a sum of money, probably collected among the spectators: sometimes they gave him his cong\u00e9, or dismissed him by putting one of the wooden foils or rudes in his hand; and sometimes they even gave him his freedom, putting the pilaeus on his head. The sign or indication, whereby the spectators showed that they granted the favour, was *premere pollicem*, which M. Dacier takes to be a clenching of the fingers of both hands between one another, and so holding the two thumbs upright close together; and, when they would have the combat finished and the vanquished slain, *verterunt pollicem*, they bent back the thumb; which we learn from Juvenal, Sat. iii. ver. 36. The gladiators challenged or defied each other, by showing the little finger; and, by extending this, or some other, during the combat, they owned themselves vanquished, and begged mercy from the people: *Visti offeram digiti veniam a populo postulabant*, says the old scholiast on Perlius.\n\nThere were various kinds of gladiators, distinguished by their weapons, manner, and time of fighting, &c., as, The *andabate*, mentioned under *Andabatae*. The *catervarii*, who always fought in troops or companies, number against number; or, according to others, who fought promiscuously, without any certain order. The *dimache*, who fought armed with two poniards or swords, or with sword and dagger. The *effedarii*, who fought in cars. The *fifcales*, or *Cesariani*, who belonged to the emperor's company; and who, being more robust and dexterous than the rest, were frequently called for, and therefore named also *populatissii*. Several other kinds are mentioned in the ancient authors.\n\n**GLADIATORS War** (*Bellum Gladiatorium* or *Spartacum*), called also the *servile war*, was a war which the Romans sustained about the year of their city 680. Spartacus, Crinis, and Oenomaus, having escaped, with other gladiators to the number of seventy-four, out of the place where they had been kept at Capua, gathered together a body of slaves, put themselves at their head, rendered themselves masters of all Campania, and gained several victories over the Roman praetors. At length they were defeated in the year 682, at the extremity of Italy; having, in vain, attempted to pass over into Sicily.\n\nThis war proved very formidable to the Romans. Cnaffius was not able to finish it: the great Pompey was forced to be sent as general.\n\nThe *Dying Gladiator*, a most valuable monument of ancient sculpture, which is now preserved in the palace of Chigi. This man, when he had received the mortal stroke, is particularly careful *ut procumbat honeste*, \"that he might fall honourably.\" He is seated in a reclining posture on the ground, and has just strength sufficient to support himself on his right arm: and in his expiring moments it is plainly seen, that he does not abandon himself to grief and dejection; but is solicitous to maintain that firmness of aspect which the gladiators valued themselves on preserving in this season of distress, and that attitude which they had learnt of the matters of defence. He fears not death, nor seems to betray any tokens of fear by his countenance, nor to shed one tear: *quis mediocris gladiator ingemuit, quis vulum mutavit unquam, quis non modo flethi, verum etiam decubit turpiter*, says Cicero, in that part of his Tusculan where he is describing the astonishing firmness of those persons. We see, in this instance, notwithstanding his remaining strength, that he has but a moment to live; and we view him with attention, that we may see him expire and fall: thus the ancients knew how to animate marble, and to give it almost every expression of life.","sp":398,"ep":400},{"h":"GLADIOLUS","t":"*Corn flag*, a genus of plants belonging to the triandra clas, and in the natural method ranking under the sixth order *Enateae*.

It is bounded on the south, and part of the west, by Bristol channel; on the north-west, by Caermerthenshire; on the north, by Brecknockshire; and on the east, by Monmouthshire. It extends 48 miles in length from east to west, 27 in breadth from north to south, and is 116 in circumference. It is divided into 10 hundreds, in which are one city, 7 market towns, 118 parishes, about 10,000 houses, and 58,000 inhabitants. It is in the diocese of Llandaff. This county, in the time of the Romans, was part of the district inhabited by the Silures, and had several Roman stations. Thus Boverton, a few miles to the south of Cowbridge, is supposed to be the *Povium* of Antoninus: Neath to be his *Nidum*; and Loghor, to the west of Swansea, to be his *Leucarum*. The principal rivers of this county are the Rhymny, the Taff, the Ogmore, the Avon, the Cleddau, and the Tawe. The air, in the south part, towards the sea, is temperate and healthful; but the northern part, which is mountainous, is cold and piercing, full of thick woods, extremely barren, and thin of inhabitants. The mountains, however, serve to feed herds of cattle, and send forth streams which add greatly to the fertility of the other parts of the county:\ncounty: they have likewise coal and lead ore. The south part is so remarkably fertile, pleasant, and populous, that it is generally styled the garden of Wales; but it has no manufacture. This county was formerly full of cottles, most of which are now fallen to decay. It has many small harbours on the coast for exporting coals and provisions. Of the former it sends large quantities both to England and Ireland; but of the latter, to England almost solely, especially butter.

The word in the Gaelic language signifies a gray smith; from whence it has been inferred, that some spot in the most ancient part of the city was originally the residence of some blacksmith who had become eminent in his profession, so that the place went by his name.\n\nIn the year 565, a bishopric is said to have been founded here by Saint Mungo, or Kentigern, supposed to be the son of Thamates, daughter of Loth king of the Picts; but in what state the town at that time was, is altogether uncertain. Most probably the priests and disciples who attended St Kentigern would contribute considerably towards its advancement; the aged and infirm, who were unfit for the purposes of war, or such as were religiously inclined, would come and settle round the habitation of the holy man, in order to have the benefit of his prayers; and as a number of miracles were laid to have been wrought at his tomb, the same causes would still contribute to the increase of the town.\n\nHistory has not informed us of the name of the prince who founded and endowed the bishopric of Glasgow in favour of St Kentigern. But from an abstract of the life of Kentigern (contained in Mr Innes's Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of Scotland), which was written in the 12th century, we learn, that the saint being ill used by Marken or Marcus, one of the kings of the Britons, retired into Wales. On the invitation of Roderic, however, one of Marken's successors, he returned to Glasgow, and enjoyed the see till 601, when he died. He was buried in the church of Glasgow, where his monument is still to be seen; and we find him marked among the saints in the Roman calendar, January 13. 577.\n\nThe immediate successors of Kentigern were Baldredde and Conwal. The first established a religious house at Inchinnan; the second went into Lothian to preach to the Saxons; and both of them are ranked as saints in the Roman calendar, Baldrede on the 6th of March.\nMarch 608, and Conwal on the 18th of May 612.\n\nFrom this time, however, till the 1115, we have no distinct accounts concerning the city or bishopric of Glasgow. We find then, that David I., king of Scotland made an attempt to retrieve the people from a state of gross barbarity into which they were fallen, and restored to the church those lands of which they had been robbed. The only account we have of the transactions with regard to Glasgow, during that period, is in the inquisition made by David concerning the church lands of Glasgow, and is as follows:\u2014\n\nThis church, by the divine appointment, admitted St Kentigern into the bishopric, who furnished large draughts of knowledge to those thirsting after heavenly things, &c. But a fraudulent destroyer, employing his common wiles, brought in, after a long series of time, unaccountable scandals into the Cumbrian church. For after St Kentigern and many of his successors were removed to heaven, various disturbances everywhere arising, not only destroyed the church and her possessions, but, wasting the whole country, drove the inhabitants into exile. These good men being destroyed, various tribes of different nations flocking in from several quarters, possessed the foreaid deserted country; but being of different origins, and varying from each other in their language and customs, and not easily agreeing among themselves, they followed the manners of the Gentiles, rather than those of the true faith. The inhabitants of which unhappy and abandoned country, though living like brutes, the Lord, who chooseth that none should perish, vouchsafed to visit in mercy,\" &c.\n\nFrom the year 1116 to the Reformation, the records of the bishopric are tolerably complete. The most remarkable particulars furnished by them are the following:\n\nIn 1136, John Achaisus, chosen bishop of Glasgow by David I., built and adorned a part of the cathedral, which he solemnly consecrated on the 9th of July. The king was present at the ceremony; and bestowed on the church the lands of Perdeyk, now Patrick. This prelate also divided the diocese into the two archdeaneries of Glasgow and Teviotdale; and established the offices of dean, subdean, chancellor, treasurer, sacrist, chanter, and successor; and settled a prebendary upon each of them, out of the donatives he received from the king.\n\nIn 1174, Joceline, abbot of Melrose, was elected bishop, and consecrated by Eskilus, bishop of Lundin in Denmark, the pope's legate for that kingdom, on the 1st of June 1175. He rebuilt the cathedral, or rather made an addition to the church already built by John Achaisus. He also procured a charter from William king of Scotland, erecting Glasgow into a royal borough, and likewise a charter for a fair to be held there annually for eight days.\n\nIn 1335, John Lindsay, bishop of Glasgow, was killed in an engagement at sea with the English, as he was returning home from Flanders. His successor, William Rae, built the stone bridge over the Clyde. In the time of Matthew Glendoning, who was elected bishop in 1387, the great spire of the church, which had been built only of wood, was consumed by lightning. The bishop intended to have built another of stone; but was prevented by death, in 1408, from accomplishing his purpose. His successor, William Luder, laid the foundation of the vestry of the cathedral, and built the great tower of stone as far as the first battlement. The great tower of the episcopal palace was founded about the year 1437, on which Bishop Cameron expended a great deal of money.\n\nIn 1447, William Turnbull, a son of the family of Bedrule in Roxburghshire, was chosen bishop. He obtained from King James II., in 1450, a charter erecting the town and the patronage of the bishops into university a regality. He also procured a bull from Pope Nicholas V. for erecting a university within the city, which he endowed, and on which he also bestowed many privileges. He died in 1454, leaving behind him a most excellent character. The establishment of the college contributed more than any thing that had been formerly done towards the enlargement of the town. Before this time the town seems to have been inconsiderable. Mr Gibbon* is of opinion, that the number of its inhabitants did not exceed 1500. But though the establishment of the university greatly increased the number of inhabitants, it in fact destroyed the freedom of the town. Bishop Turnbull seems to have made a point of it with King James II., that the city of Glasgow, with the bishop's forest, should be erected into a regality in his favour; which was accordingly done at the time above mentioned; and this at once took away all power from the citizens, and transferred it to the bishop. As the powers of the bishop, however, were reckoned by Turnbull insufficient to convey to the members of the university all that freedom which he wished to bestow upon them, he therefore obtained from the king a great many privileges for them; and afterwards he himself, with the consent of his chapter, granted them many more.\n\nThe good effects of the establishment of the college were very soon obvious in Glasgow. The number of inhabitants increased exceedingly; the high street, by the union of the convent of the Black Friars, to where the university is now placed, was very soon filled up; the ancient road which led to the common being too far distant for the conveniency of the new inhabitants, the Gallowgate began to be built. Soon after, the collegiate church of the blessed Mary (now the Tron church) being founded by the citizens, occasioned the Trongate street to be carried to the westward as far as the church. The rest of the city increased gradually towards the bridge, by the building of the Saltmarket street. The borough roads, and the cattle that grazed on the commons, were now found insufficient to maintain the increased number of inhabitants; for which reason a greater degree of attention than formerly was paid to the fishing in the river. Many poor people subsisted themselves by this occupation; they were incorporated into a society; and in order that they might be at hand to prosecute their business, they built a considerable part of the street now called the Bridge-gate, but at that time Fishergate.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, however, the city of Glasgow did not for a long time attain the rank among the other towns of Scotland which it holds at present. In 1556, it held only the 11th place among them, as appears by Queen Mary's taxation. The introduction of the reformed religion proved for some time prejudicial to the opulence of the city. The money which had\nGlasgow had formerly been expended among the citizens by the bishop and his clergy, was now diverted into other channels: the advantages resulting from the university were also for a time lost; for as the reformers generally despised human learning, the college was in a manner deserted.\n\nIn the time of the civil wars, Glasgow suffered severely. To the mischief attending intestine discord, were added a pestilence and famine; and to complete their misfortunes, a violent fire broke out in June 1652, which destroyed the greatest part of the Saltmarket, Trongate, and High Street. The fronts of the houses at that time were mostly of wood, so that they became an easy prey to the flames. The fire continued with great violence for the space of 18 hours; by which a great many of the inhabitants were ruined, the habitations of almost 1000 families being totally destroyed. On this account collections were made through different parts of the country; and to prevent such accidents for the future, the fronts were built with freestone, which abounds in the neighbourhood.\n\nBy the charter given to Bishop Turnbull in 1450, the citizens had been deprived of the power of electing their own magistrates, which was thenceforth exercised by the bishop; which, however, was not done without some resistance on the part of the inhabitants. After the Reformation was introduced into Scotland, we find this power exercised by the citizens, the bishop, the earl of Lennox, and others. The idea that the town was a bishop's borough, and not a royal free borough, gave occasion to this unfettered manner of appointing the magistracy; and though, in 1633, they were declared to be a royal free borough by the parliament, yet their freedom of election was afterwards disturbed by the privy council, by Cromwell, and the duke of York.\n\nBut on the 4th of June 1692, the town was declared free by a charter of William and Mary; and in confirmation of this charter it was inserted in the act of parliament, dated June 14th the same year, that they should have power to elect their own magistrates as fully and freely, in all respects, as the city of Edinburgh or any other royal borough within the kingdom; which freedom of election still continues.\n\nBy the affluence of the boroughs in 1695, we find the city of Glasgow reckoned the second in Scotland in point of wealth, which place it still continues to hold. To account for this great increase of wealth, we must observe, that for a long time, even before the restoration of Charles II., the inhabitants of Glasgow had been in possession of the sale both of raw and refined sugars for the greatest part of Scotland; they had a privilege of distilling spirits from their molasses, free of all duty and excise; the herring fishery was also carried on to what was at that time thought a very considerable extent; they were the only people in Scotland who made soap; and they sent annually some hides, linen, &c. to Bristol, from whence they brought back in exchange, a little tobacco, sugar, and goods, of the manufacture of England, with which they supplied a considerable part of the kingdom. From the year 1707, however, in which the union between Scotland and England took place, we may date the prosperity of Glasgow. By the union, the American trade was laid open to the inhabitants: and so sensible were they of their advantageous situation, that they began almost instantly to prosecute that commerce; an assiduous application to which, ever since, hath greatly contributed to raise the city to the pitch of affluence and splendor which it at present enjoys. The city was now greatly enlarged; and as the community were sensible of the inconvenience that attended the want of a sufficiency of water in the river for carrying on their commerce, they resolved to have a port of their own higher the mouth of the river. At first, they thought of making their harbour at Dumbarton; but as this is a royal borough, the magistrates opposed it; because they thought that the influx of sailors and others, occasioned by the harbour, would be so great, that a scarcity of provisions would be occasioned. The magistrates and town council of Glasgow, therefore, purchased some lands on the south side of the Port Glasgow river Clyde for this purpose; and so expeditions were made in making their harbour, and rearing their town, that in 1710 a bailie was appointed for the government of Port-Glasgow. It is now a very considerable parish, and lies 21 miles higher the mouth of Clyde than Glasgow.\n\nIn 1725, Mr Campbell, the member of parliament for Glasgow, having given his vote for having the malt tax extended over Scotland, a riot ensued among the lower classes of people. In this disturbance, Mr Campbell's furniture was destroyed, and some excisemen were maltreated for attempting to take an account of the malt. General Wade, who commanded the forces in Disturbance Scotland, had sent two companies of soldiers, under the command of Captain Buthel, to prevent any disturbance of this kind. Captain Buthel drew up his men in the street, where the multitude pelted them with stones. He first endeavoured to disperse the mob by firing with powder only; but this expedient failing, he ordered his men to load their pieces with ball; and, without the sanction of the civil authority, commanded them to fire four different ways at once. By this discharge about 20 persons were killed and wounded; which enraged the multitude to such a degree, that having procured some arms, they pursued Buthel and his men to the castle of Dumbarton, about 14 miles distant. General Wade being informed of this transaction, assembled a body of forces, and being accompanied by Duncan Forbes, lord advocate, took possession of the town: the magistrates were apprehended and carried prisoners to Edinburgh; but on an examination before the lords, their innocence clearly appeared, upon which they were immediately dismissed. Buthel was tried for murder, convicted, and condemned; but, instead of suffering the penalties of law, he was indulged with a pardon, and promoted in the service. Mr Campbell petitioned the house of commons for an indemnification of his losses: a bill was passed in his favour; and this, together with some other expenses incurred in the affair, cost the town 9000l. sterling.\n\nDuring the time of the rebellion in 1745; the citizens of Glasgow gave proof of their attachment to revolution principles, by raising two battalions of 600 men each, for the service of government. This piece of loyalty, however, had like to have cost them dear. The rebels, in their journey forth, took a resolution to plunder and burn the city: which would probably have been done, had not Mr Cameron of Lochiel threatened, in that case, to withdraw his clan. A heavy contribution,\ntribution, however, was laid on. The city was compelled to pay \u00a35000 in money, and \u00a3500 in goods; and on the return of the rebels from England, they were obliged to furnish them with 12,000 linen shirts, 6000 cloth coats, 6000 pairs of shoes, 6000 pairs of hose, and 6000 bonnets. These goods, with the money formerly paid them, the expense of raising and subsisting the two city battalions, and the charge of maintaining the rebel army in free quarters for ten days, cost the community about \u00a314,000 sterling; \u00a310,000 of which they recovered in 1749, by an application to parliament.\n\nAbout the year 1750, a very considerable change took place in the manner of living among the inhabitants of Glasgow. Till this time, an attentive industry, and a frugality bordering upon parsimony, had been their general characteristic; the severity of the ancient manners prevailed in its full vigour: But now, when an extensive commerce and increased manufactures had produced wealth, the ideas of the people were enlarged, and schemes of trade and improvement were adopted which people would formerly have been denominated madmen if they had undertaken; a new style was introduced in living, dress, building, and furniture; wheel carriages were let up, public places of entertainment were frequented, and an assembly-room, ball-room, and playhouse, were built by subscription; and from this time we may date all the improvements that have taken place, not only in Glasgow, but all over the west of Scotland. The best method, however, of estimating the growing improvement of any town, is by the frequency of their applications for assistance to parliament; we shall therefore enumerate the acts of parliament which have been passed in favour of the city of Glasgow since the year 1750. In 1753, an act passed for repairing several roads leading into the city of Glasgow. In 1756, an act for erecting and supporting a lighthouse in the island of Little Cramay, at the mouth of the Clyde, and for rendering the navigation of the frith and river more safe and commodious.\u2014In 1759, an act for improving the navigation of the river Clyde to the city of Glasgow, and for building a new bridge across the river.\u2014In 1767, the people of Glasgow having proposed to make a small cut or canal from the frith of Forth to that of Clyde, for the convenience of their trade to the eastern side of the island, several gentlemen at Edinburgh, and throughout different parts of the kingdom, proposed that this canal should be executed upon a much larger scale than what had been originally projected. An act was accordingly obtained, and the canal executed in the manner described under the article CANAL.\u2014In 1770, another act was obtained for improving the navigation of the river, building the bridge, &c. being an amendment of the former act for these purposes. In 1771, an act for making and widening a passage from the Saltmarket to St Andrew's church; for enlarging and completing the churchyard of that church, and likewise for building a convenient exchange or square in the city; also for amending and explaining the former act relative to the navigation of the Clyde. An act for making and maintaining a navigable canal and waggon way from the collieries in the parishes of Old and New Monkland, to the city of\n\nGlasgow. This last canal, which was undertaken with a view to reduce the price of coals, has not been attended with the desired effect; but the other improvements have been productive of very great advantages.\n\nThe most ancient part of the city stands on a rising ground. The foundation of the cathedral is 104 feet of the city higher than the bed of the river; and the descent from the high ground reaches to about 100 yards below the college. The rest of the city is built chiefly upon a plain, bounded southward by the Clyde, and northward by a gentle ridge of hills lying in a parallel direction with that river. These grounds, till lately, consisted of gardens and fields; but are now covered with buildings, in consequence of the increasing wealth and population of the city. The streets are all clean and well paved; and several of them intersecting one another at right angles, produce a very agreeable effect. The four principal streets, crossing one another in that manner, divide the city nearly into four equal parts; and the different views of them from the crofs, or centre of intersection, have an air of great magnificence. The houses, consisting of four or five floors in height, are built of hewn stone, generally in an exceeding good taste, and many of them elegant. The most remarkable public buildings are,\n\n1. The Cathedral, or High Church, is a magnificent building, and its situation greatly to its advantage, as the tower stands higher than any part of the city. It has been intended to form a crofs, though the traverse part has never been finished. The great tower is founded upon four large masonry pillars, each of them about 30 feet in circumference. The tower itself is 25 feet square within; and is surrounded by a balustrade, within which rises an octagonal spire terminated by a vane. The tower upon the west end is upon the same level, but appears not to have been finished, though it is covered over with lead. In this tower is a very large bell 11 feet four inches in diameter. The principal entry was from the west; the gate 11 feet broad at the base, and 17 feet in height. The west end of the choir is now appropriated for a place of divine worship; and is divided from the remaining part by a stone partition, which is enclosed by another stone wall parting it from the nave. It is impossible to form an adequate idea of the awful solemnity of the place occasioned by the loftiness of the roof and the range of pillars by which the whole is supported.\n\nThe nave of the church rises four steps higher than the choir; and on the west side stood the organ loft, formerly ornamented with a variety of figures, but now defaced. The pillars here are done in a better taste than those in the choir, and their capitals are ornamented with fruits. The arched roof of the altar is supported by five pillars, over which was a fine terrace walk, and above it a large window of curious workmanship, but now shut up. On the north side of the altar is the vestry, being a cube of 28 feet, the roof arched and vaulted at top, and supported by one pillar in the centre of the house. Arched pillars from every angle terminate in the grand pillar, which is 19 feet high. The lower part of the south crofs is made use of as a burying place for the clergy of the city; and is by much the finest piece of workmanship in the whole building. It is 55 feet long, 28 broad, and\nGlasgow. 15 high; arched and vaulted at top, and supported by a middle range of pillars, with their capitals highly ornamented; corresponding to which are columns adjoining to the walls, which, as they rise, spring into semi-arches, and are everywhere met at acute angles by their opposites, and are ornamented with carvings at the cloising and crossing of the lines. At the east end of the choir you descend by flights of steps upon each side into passageways which, in former times, were the principal entries to the burying vault which is immediately under the nave. It is now made use of as a parish church for the barony of Glasgow; and is full of pillars, some of them very maily, which support the arched roof: but it is a very uncomfortable place for devotion. The space under the altar and vestry, though now made use of as a burying place by the heirs of the barony, was formerly, according to tradition, employed for keeping of the relics; and indeed, from the beautiful manner in which this place is finished, one would imagine that it had not been destined for common use. Here is shown the monument of St Mungo, or Kentigern, with his figure lying in a cumbent posture.\n\nThe whole length of the cathedral within the walls is 284 feet, its breadth 65; the height of the choir, from the floor to the canopy, 90 feet; the height of the nave, 85 feet; the height of the middle tower, 220 feet. This fabric was begun by John Achaius in 1123, and consecrated in 1130; and continued by succeeding bishops till such time as it was finished in the manner in which it stands at present. The wealth of the fee of Glasgow, however, was not sufficient for so great an undertaking, so that they were obliged to have recourse to all the churches of Scotland for assistance in it.\n\nThis venerable edifice was in danger of falling a victim to the frenzy of fanaticism in 1579; and owed its preservation to the spirit and good sense of the tradesmen, who, upon hearing the beat of drum for collecting the workmen appointed to demolish it, flew to arms, and declared that the first man who pulled down a single stone should that moment be buried under it.\n\nNear the cathedral are the ruins of the bishop's palace or castle, enclosed with a wall of hewn stone by Archbishop James Beaton; the great tower built by Archbishop Cameron in 1426.\n\n2. St Andrew's Church was begun by the community in 1739, and finished in 1756. It is the finest piece of modern architecture in the city; and is built after the model of St Martin's in the Fields, London, whose architect was the famous Gibbs. The length of the church is 104 feet, and its breadth 66. It has a fine arched roof, well ornamented with figures in stucco, and sustained by stone columns of the Corinthian order. Correspondent to the model, it has a place for the altar on the east, in which is a very ancient Venetian window; but the altar place being seated, makes this end appear no great advantage. The fronts of the galleries and the pulpit are done in mahogany in a very elegant manner. The spire by no means corresponds with the rest of the building; and, instead of being an ornament, disgraces this beautiful fabric. Its height is 170 feet.\n\nBesides the cathedral (which contains three congregations) and St Andrew's church, there is a number of others, as the College church, Ram's-horn, Tron, Wynd, &c., together with an English chapel, Highland church, several preceding meeting-houses, and others for sectaries of various denominations.\n\n3. The College.\u2014The front of this building extends along the east side of the high street, and is upwards of 330 feet long. The gate at the entrance is decorated with rustics, and over it are the king's arms. The building consists of two principal courts or squares. The first is 88 feet long and 44 broad. The west side is elevated upon stone pillars, on which are placed pilasters supporting the Doric entablature, and ornamented with arches forming a piazza. Above these is the public hall; the ascent to which is by a double flight of steps enclosed by a handsome stone balustrade, upon the right of which is placed a lion, and on the left an unicorn, cut in freestone. The spire stands on the east side, is 135 feet high, and has a very good clock. Under this is the gateway into the inner and largest court, which is 103 feet long and 70 broad. Over the entry, in a niche, is a statue of Mr Zacharias Boyd, who was a benefactor to the university. On the east side of the court is a narrow passage leading into a handsome terrace walk, gravelled, 122 feet long by 64 feet broad. This walk is enclosed to the east by an iron pallade, in the centre of which is a gate leading into the garden. This last consists of seven acres of ground, laid out in walks for the recreation of the students; and there is also a botanic garden. On the south side of the walk stands the library; a very neat edifice, well constructed for the purpose intended, and containing a very valuable collection of books. Underneath are preserved in cases all the Roman inscriptions found on Graham's Dike, together with altars and other antiquities collected from different parts of Scotland. Adjoining there is an observatory, well furnished with astronomical instruments. The college also possesses, by bequest, the late Dr Hunter's famous anatomical preparations, library, and museum. A building is now (1826) preparing for its reception.\n\n4. The Tolbooth, or Town-House, is a magnificent Town-and extremely elegant building. The front is adorned with a range of Ionic pilasters; and is elevated on strong rusticated pillars with arches, forming a piazza for merchants and others to shelter themselves from the weather when met upon buffaloes. One of the apartments was the assembly hall; a neat room, 47 feet long, and 24 in breadth and height, finished in a good taste, though too small for the city. The town hall is a very spacious and lofty apartment, 52 feet long by 27 broad, and 24 in height. It is finished in a very grand manner; the ceiling is divided into different compartments well ornamented. In it are full length portraits of King James VI. and VII., Charles I. and II., William and Mary, Queen Anne, King George I., II., and III., and Archibald duke of Argyll in his judiciary robes. The two last are by Ramsay. Opposite to the front of this building is the exchange walk, which is well paved with freestone, and enclosed from the street by stone pillars. In the middle of this area is an equestrian statue of King William III., placed upon a lofty pedestal, and surrounded with an iron rail.\u2014In 1781, the exchange under the piazzas was greatly enlarged, by taking down the lower part of the town hall and assembly room;\nGlasgow; and at the same time, by a tontine scheme entered into by the inhabitants, a most elegant coffee room was added, with a suite of buildings adjoining for the purposes of a tavern and hotel, assembly room, and offices for notaries and underwriters. The assembly room, however, being found to be still too small, a subscription of above \u00a3500 has been raised by a similar plan of a tontine for building a new one, which is proposed to be erected in the north corner of one of the new streets which join Ingram street to Argyll street.\n\n5. The Guild Hall or Merchants House. This building is situated upon the south side of Bridgegate street; and is in length 82 feet, in breadth 31. The great hall, which is the whole length and breadth of the building, is so capacious, that it is better adapted for the reception of great and numerous assemblies than any other in the city. This house is adorned with a very elegant spire 200 feet high.\n\n6. The Town's Hospital is a very neat building, consisting of two wings and a large front; the length 156 feet, the breadth of the centre 30 feet, and the depth of the wings 68 feet. Behind the building is an infirmary 127 feet long by 25 feet broad, the ascent to which is by a flight of steps. The lower part of this building is appointed for the reception of lunatics. The area between the buildings is large, which, with the agreeable open situation of the hospital on the river, must conduce to the health of the inhabitants.\n\n7. The Grammar School is situated in the new part of the town, to the north-west, and was built in 1787. It is a very handsome building, containing a large hall, and six airy commodious teaching rooms. In this school there are four classes, the course being four years: each class is carried on the whole four years by the same master; so that, there being no rector, each master is head of the school one year in rotation. It is under the direction of a committee of the town council; who, assisted by the professors, clergy, and other persons of learning, frequently visit it during the session; and at an annual examination, prizes of books are distributed to the scholars according to their respective merits. The number of scholars is above 300. The building is not yet entirely finished; and the rooms which are not occupied by the Latin classes are intended for teaching writing, arithmetic, drawing, &c.\n\n8. The New Bridge is built in an elegant manner. It is 32 feet wide; with a commodious footway for passengers, five feet broad, on each side, railed above the road made for carriages, and paved with freestone. This bridge is about 500 feet in length; and consists of seven arches, the faces of which are wrought in rustic, with a strong block cornice above. The arches spring but a little way above low water mark; which, though it renders the bridge stronger than if they sprung from taller piers, diminishes its beauty. Between every arch there is a small circular one: these break the force of the water when the river rises to a flood, and add to the strength of the whole. The parapet wall or breastwork is cut out in the Chinese taste; and the two ends are finished off with a sweep. This bridge was begun in 1768, and finished in 1772.\n\n9. The Markets in King's Street are justly admired, as being the completest of their kind in Britain. They are placed on both sides of the street. That on the east side, appropriated entirely for butcher meat, is 112 feet in length, and 67 in breadth. In the centre is a spacious gateway, decorated on each side with coupled Ionic columns, set upon their pedestals, and supporting an angular pediment. At the north end is a very neat hall belonging to the incorporation of butchers, the front ornamented with rustics and a pediment. The markets upon the west side of the street consist of three courts, set apart for fish, mutton, and cheese. The whole of the front is 173 feet, the breadth 46 feet; in the centre of which, as on the opposite side, is a very spacious gateway of the Doric order, supporting a pediment. This is the entry to the mutton market. Each of the other two has a well proportioned arch faced with rustics for the entrance. All these markets are well paved with freestone; have walks all round them; and are covered over for shelter by roofs standing upon stone piers, under which the different commodities are exposed to sale. They have likewise pump wells within, for cleaning away all the filth; which render the markets always sweet and agreeable. These markets were erected in 1754.\n\n10. The Herb Market is neat and commodious; and the principal entry is decorated with columns. It is situated in the Candleriggs, and is laid out in the same manner with the markets in King's Street.\n\n11. The Guard House is a very handsome building, Guard with a piazza formed by arches, and columns of the house, Ionic order set upon their pedestals. It was originally situated on the High street, at the corner of the Candleriggs street; but has lately been carried near half way up the Candleriggs, where it occupies the ground on which the weigh-house formerly stood, and is made larger and more commodious than it was before. An excellent new weigh-house has been erected at the head of the Candleriggs: And at the foot of the Candleriggs, or corner next the High street, where the guard-house was formerly situated, a superb new hotel has been built, containing 75 fire rooms.\n\nThe most remarkable public charities in Glasgow are,\n\n1. Muirhead's or St Nicholas's Hospital. This was originally appointed to subside 12 old men and a chaplain; but its revenues have, from some unknown causes, been lost; so that no more of them now remains than the paltry sum of \u00a339l. 2s. 5d. Scots money, \u00a328l., of which is annually divided among four old men, at the rate of \u00a31. 13s. 4d. sterling each.\n\n2. Hutchison's Hospital, was founded and endowed in 1639 by George Hutchison of Lambhill, notary public, and Mr Thomas Hutchison his brother, who was bred a preacher, for the maintenance of old men and orphans. The funds of this hospital were increased by James Blair merchant in Glasgow in 1710, and by subsequent donations. From the sale of some of their lands which lay convenient for building, and the rise of the rent, the income is now above \u00a3400, which is distributed in pensions to old people from 3l. to 20l. and in educating about 50 children.\n\n3. The Merchant's House likewise distributes in pensions and other charities about \u00a3800 yearly.\n\n4. The Town's Hospital, above described, was opened for the reception of the poor on the 15th of November 1733. The funds whence this hospital is subsisted are, the general session, the town council, the trades house...\nhouse and merchants house, the interest of money belonging to their funds, which are sums that have been mortified for the use of the house. These supplies, however, are found insufficient to defray the expenses of the house; for which reason an assessment is annually made upon the inhabitants in the following manner. The magistrates nominate 12, 14, or sometimes more gentlemen of known integrity and character, who have a list laid before them of all the inhabitants in town. This list they divide into 16 or 18 columns. Each of these columns contains the names of such inhabitants as carry on trade to a certain extent, or are supposed to be well able to pay the sum affixed to the particular column in which their names are inserted. If it is necessary to raise \u00a3500, for instance, then each name, in every separate column, is valued at as much as the fortunes of the persons in each particular column are supposed to be. If \u00a31000 or more is to be raised, it is only continuing a proportional increase through the whole of the columns. The highest sum that ever was thus raised, was \u00a32s. 6d. upon every thousand pounds that each person was supposed to be worth. The number of people maintained in this hospital are about 620.\n\n5. Wilson's Charity for the education of boys, was founded by George Wilson, who in 1778 left \u00a33000 for that purpose. This fund is now considerably increased, and gives education and clothing to 48 boys, who each continues four years, so that 12 are admitted annually.\n\nBesides these, there are many public schools for the education of children; as well as many institutions of private societies for the purpose of relieving the indigent and instructing youth, such as Graham's Society, Buchanan's Society, the Highland Society, &c. These last put annually 20 boys apprentices to trades, and during the first three years give them clothing and education.\n\nThe university of Glasgow owes its origin, as we have already observed, to Bishop Turnbull. The institution consisted at first of a rector, a dean of faculty, a principal who taught theology, and three professors of philosophy; and, soon after this, the civil and canon laws were taught by some clergymen. From the time of its establishment in 1450 to the Reformation in 1560, the college was chiefly frequented by those who were intended for the church; its members were all ecclesiastics, and its principal support was derived from the church. The Reformation brought the university to the verge of destruction; masters, students, and servants, all forsook it. The magistrates were sensible of the loss which the community had sustained by this defection, that they endeavoured to restore it in 1572, by bestowing upon it considerable funds, and prescribing a set of regulations for its management. These, however, proved insufficient; for which reason King James VI. erected it anew, by a charter called the Nova Erectio, 1577, and bestowed upon it the teinds of the parish of Govan. The persons who were to compose the new university were, a principal, three professors of philosophy, four students bursars, one oeconomus, a principal's servant, a janitor, and cook.\n\nSince the year 1577, the funds of the university have been considerably increased by the bounty of kings and the donations of private persons. The professors have therefore also been increased: so that at present the university of Glasgow consists of a chancellor, rector, dean of faculty, principal, and 14 professors (five of them in the gift of the crown), together with bursars, &c. The archbishop of Glasgow was formerly chancellor of the university ex officio; at present, the chancellor is chosen by the rector, dean of faculty, principal, and maters.\n\nThe chancellor, as being the head of the university, is the fountain of honour, and in his name are all academical degrees bestowed. The office of rector is to exercise that academical jurisdiction in disputes among the students themselves, or between the students and citizens, which is bestowed upon the greater part of the universities in Europe. He is chosen annually in the convivia; that is, in a meeting in which all the students, as well as the other members of the university, have a voice. Immediately after his admission, he has been in use to choose certain persons as his assessors; and counsellors in his capacity of judge; and, in former periods, it was customary to name the ministers of Glasgow, or any other gentlemen who had no connexion with the university; but, for a great while past, the rector has constantly named the dean of faculty, the principal, and maters, for his assessors; and he has always been, and still is, in the daily practice of judging in the causes belonging to him, with the advice of his assessors. Besides these powers as judge, the rector summons and presides in the meetings of the university for the election of his successor; and he is likewise in use to call meetings of the professors for drawing up addresses to the king, electing a member to the general assembly, and other business of the like kind.\n\nThe dean of faculty has, for his province, the giving direction with regard to the course of studies; the judging, together with the rector, principal, and professors, of the qualifications of those who desire to be created maters of arts, doctors of divinity, &c.; and he presides in meetings which are called by him for these purposes. He is chosen annually by the rector, principal, and maters.\n\nThe principal and maters, independent of the rector and dean, compose a meeting in which the principal presides; and as they are the persons for whose behoof chiefly the revenue of the college was established, the administration of that revenue is therefore committed to them. The revenue arises from the teinds of the parish of Govan, granted by King James VI. in 1557; from the teinds of the parishes of Renfrew and Kilbride, granted by the same monarch in 1617, and confirmed by King Charles I. on the 28th of June 1630; from the teinds of the parishes of Calder, Old and New Monkland, conveyed to them by a charter from Charles II. in 1670; from a tack of the archbishopric; and from several donations conferred by private persons.\n\nThe college of Glasgow, for a very considerable time after its erection, followed the mode of public teaching which is common even to this day in Oxford and Cambridge, and in many other universities throughout Europe; that is, each professor gave a few lectures every year, gratis, upon the particular science which he professed; but, in place of this, the professors have, for a great while past, adopted the mode of private teaching; that is, they lecture and examine two hours every...\nGlasgow, every day during the session, viz., from the 10th of October to the 10th of June; a method which comes much cheaper to the student, as he has it in his power, if he is attentive, to acquire his education without being under the necessity of employing a tutor. They have also private classes, in which they teach one hour per day. The number of students who have attended this college for several years past, has been upwards of 500 each season.\n\nThe trade of Glasgow is said to have been first promoted by one Mr William Elphinstone in 1420. This trade was most probably the curing and exporting of salmon; but the first authentic document concerning Glasgow as a trading city is in 1546. Complaints having been made by Henry VIII, king of England, that several English ships had been taken and robbed by vessels belonging to Scotland, an order of council was issued, discharging such captures for the future; and among other places made mention of in this order is the city of Glasgow. The trade which at that time they carried on could not be great. It probably consisted of a few small vessels to France loaded with pickled salmon; as this fishery was, even then, carried on to a considerable extent, by Glasgow, Renfrew, and Dumbarton. Between the years 1630 and 1660, a very great degree of attention seems to have been paid to inland commerce by the inhabitants of Glasgow. Principal Baillie informs us, that the increase of Glasgow arising from this commerce was exceedingly great. The exportation of salmon and of herrings was also continued and increased. In the war between Britain and Holland during the reign of Charles II, a privateer was fitted out in Clyde to cruise against the Dutch. She was called the Lion of Glasgow, Robert M'Allan commander; and carried five pieces of cannon, and 60 hands.\n\nA spirit of commerce appears to have arisen among the inhabitants of Glasgow between the years 1660 and 1707. The citizens who distinguished themselves most during this period were Walter Gibbon and John Anderson. Gibbon cured and packed in one year 300 lasts of herrings, which he sent to St Martin's in France on board of a Dutch vessel called the St Agate of 450 tons burden; his returns were brandy and salt. He was the first who imported iron from Stockholm into Clyde. Anderson is said to have been the first who imported white wines.\n\nWhatever their trade was at this time, it could not be considerable: the ports to which they were obliged to trade lay all to the eastward: the circumnavigation of the island would therefore prove an almost unsurmountable bar to the commerce of Glasgow; and of consequence the people on the east coast would be possessed of almost all the commerce of Scotland. The union with England opened a field for commerce for which the situation of Glasgow, so convenient in respect to the Atlantic, was highly advantageous. Since that time the commerce of the east coast has declined, and that of the west increased to an amazing degree. No sooner was the treaty of union signed, than the inhabitants of Glasgow began to prosecute the trade to Virginia and Maryland; they chartered vessels from Whitehaven, sent out cargoes of goods, and brought back tobacco in return. The method in which they at first proceeded in this trade was certainly a very prudent one. A supercargo went out with every vessel. Glasgow. He bartered his goods for tobacco, until such time as he had either sold off his goods, or procured as much tobacco as was sufficient to load his vessel. He then immediately set out on his return; and if any of his goods remained unsold, he brought them home with him. While they continued to trade in this way, they were of great advantage to the country, by the quantity of manufactures which they exported; their own wealth began to increase; they purchased ships of their own; and, in 1718, the first vessel of the property of Glasgow crossed the Atlantic. Their imports of tobacco were now considerable, and Glasgow began to be looked upon as a considerable port; the tobacco trade at the ports of Bristol, Liverpool, and Whitehaven, was observed to dwindle away; the people of Glasgow began to send tobacco to these places, and to underfill the English even in their own ports. Thus the jealousy of the latter was soon excited, and they took every method in their power to destroy the trade of Glasgow. The people of Bristol presented remonstrances to the commissioners of the customs at London against the trade of Glasgow, in 1717. To these remonstrances the merchants of Glasgow lent such answers to the commissioners, as convinced them that the complaints of the Bristol merchants were without foundation. But in 1721, a most formidable confederacy was entered into by almost all the tobacco merchants in South Britain against the trade of Glasgow. Those of London, Liverpool, and Whitehaven, presented severally to the lords of the treasury, petitions, arraigning the Glasgow merchants of frauds in the tobacco trade. To these petitions the Glasgow people gave in replies; and the lords of the treasury, after a full and impartial hearing, were pleased to dismiss the cause with the following sentence: \"That the complaints of the merchants of London, Liverpool, and Whitehaven, were groundless; and that they proceeded from a spirit of envy, and not from a regard to the interest of trade, or of the king's revenue.\"\n\nBut the efforts of these gentlemen did not stop here. They brought their complaints into the house of commons. Commissioners were sent to Glasgow in 1722, who gave in their reports to the house in 1723. The merchants sent up distinct and explicit answers to these reports; but such was the interest of their adversaries, that these answers were disregarded. New officers were appointed at the ports of Greenock and Port Glasgow, whose private instructions seem to have been to ruin the trade if possible, by putting all imaginable hardships upon it. Hence it languished till the year 1735; but after that time it began to revive, though even after its revival it was carried on but slowly for a considerable space of time.\n\nAt last, however, the active and enterprising spirit of the merchants, seconding the natural advantages of their situation, prevailed over all opposition; and the American trade continued to flourish and increase until the year 1775, infomuch that the importation of tobacco into Clyde that year from the provinces of Virginia, Maryland, and Carolina, amounted to 57,143 hogsheads. But since the breach with America, this trade has now greatly fallen off, and very large sums are said to remain due to the merchants from that quarter of the world.\nWith regard to the manufactures of Glasgow, Mr Gibbon is of opinion that the commerce to America first suggested the idea of introducing them, in any considerable degree at least. The first attempts in this way were about the year 1725, and their increase for some time was very slow, nor did they begin to be considerable till great encouragement was given by the legislature to the linen manufacture in Scotland. The first causes of the success of this manufacture were the act of parliament in 1748, whereby the wearing of French cambrics was prohibited under severe penalties; that of 1751, allowing weavers in flax or hemp to settle and exercise their trades anywhere in Scotland free from all corporation dues; and the bounty of three halfpence per yard on all linens exported at and under 18d. per yard. Since that time a spirit of manufacture has been excited among the inhabitants of Glasgow; and great variety of goods, and in very great quantity, have been manufactured. Checks, linen, and linen and cotton, are manufactured to a great extent. Printed linens and cottons were begun to be manufactured in 1738; but they only made garments till 1754, when handkerchiefs were first printed.\n\nInclines were first made here about the year 1732.\u2014The engine looms used at that time were so inconvenient, and took up so much time in making the goods, that the Dutch, who were the only people possessed of the large incline looms, were almost solely in possession of this manufacture. Mr Hervey, who began this branch in Glasgow, was so sensible of the disadvantages under which it laboured, that he went over to Holland; and in spite of the care and attention which the Dutch took to conceal their methods of manufacturing, he brought over with him from Haarlem two of their looms, and one of their workmen. This Dutchman remained some years in Glasgow; but on some disgust he went to Manchester, and instructed the people there in the method of carrying on the manufacture.\n\nIn 1757, carpets were begun to be made, and are now carried on to a considerable extent. Hunters' cloths, blankets, and other goods of the same kind, are also made.\n\nBesides these, a great variety of articles are manufactured at Glasgow, of which our limits will not permit us to enter into detail, such as soap, refining of sugar, ironmongery, braids, jewellery, glaigs both common and white, pottery, &c. Types for printing are made in this city by Dr Wilson and Sons, equal, if not superior, in beauty to any others in Britain. Printing of books was first begun here by George Anderson about the year 1638. But there was no good printing in Glasgow till the year 1735, when Robert Urrie printed several books in a very elegant manner. The highest perfection, however, to which printing hath yet been carried in this place, or perhaps in any other, was by the late Robert and Andrew Foulis, (who began in the year 1740); as the many correct and splendid editions of books printed by them in different languages sufficiently testify. Some of their classics, it is said, are held in such high esteem abroad, as to sell nearly at the price of ancient MSS. The same gentlemen also established an academy of painting; but the wealth of Scotland being unequal to the undertaking, it has been since given up.\n\nSince the stagnation of the American trade, already noticed, the merchants of Glasgow have turned their attention more to manufactures, which have of late, especially that of cottons and muslins, increased in a very rapid degree, and bid fair for putting the city in a more flourishing condition than ever it was before. The manufacturing houses, the influx of people for carrying on the manufactures, the means and encouragement which these afford to population, and the wealth thence derived by individuals as well as accruing to the community, have all tended lately to increase, and are daily increasing, the extent of the city, and the elegance of the buildings. Besides various improvements in the old streets, several handsome new ones as well as new squares have been added. The site of these new buildings is the tract of rising ground already mentioned as the north boundary of the town previous to its late extension. The western part of it, which is perfectly level, is occupied by a spacious square, denominated George's Square; two sides of which are built and inhabited, and a third begun. The grass plot in the middle is enclosed with a handsome iron railing. The square is deficient in regularity; the houses on the west side being a story higher than those of the east; but in other respects it is very neat. To the east of this square are several new streets laid out and paved, and some of them almost completely built on. The principal, though as yet the most incomplete of those streets, is Ingram Street, which runs from east to west. From this the others begin; some of them being carried northward up the hill, others going southward and joining the main street of the town. One of the finest of these croft streets is Hutcheon Street.\n\nThe south boundary of the city was mentioned to be the Clyde. Over this river there are two bridges, &c. One of them, the Old Bridge, built about 400 years ago by Archbishop Rae, but since repaired and partly rebuilt, consists of eight arches; and connects the suburb of Gorbals, situated on the opposite side of the river, with the city. The other is the New Bridge, described above.\u2014On the banks of the river, eastward, is the Green, a spot appropriated to the use of the inhabitants, with conveniences for washing and drying linens, and with agreeable and extensive walks for recreation.\n\nOn the same or south side of the town, westward, is the Broomielaw, where the quay is situated. Till within these few years, the river here and for several miles distance, was so shallow and so obstructed by shoals, as to admit only of small craft from Greenock, Port Glasgow, and the Highlands; but of late it has been cleared and deepened so as to admit vessels of considerable burden; and it is intended to make the depth as nearly equal as possible to that of the canal, in order that the vessels from Ireland and the west coast may not be induced exclusively to ascend the west end of the canal and deliver their goods at Canal basin, but may come up Clyde and unload at the Broomielaw.\n\nThe government of the city of Glasgow is vested in a provost and three bailies, a dean of guild, deacon, reeve, conveener, and a treasurer, with a common council of 13 merchants and 12 mechanics. The provost and two of the bailies must, by the act of the borough, be elected from the merchant rank, and the other bailie from...\nfrom the trades rank, i.e. the mechanics. The provost is, from courtesy and custom, styled lord provost. He is properly lord of the police of the city, president of the community, and is ex officio a justice of the peace for both the borough and county.\n\nMany of the inhabitants of Glasgow were convinced of the necessity of a new system of police, a number of years before the sanction of parliament was obtained for that purpose, which was granted in the year 1800. The act vested the management of the police in the lord provost, bailies, dean of guild, deacon conveyer, and 24 commissioners, one being chosen out of each ward into which the city is divided. The object of the bill was to procure an extension of the royalty, to pave, light, and clean the streets, for regulating the police, and nominating officers and watchmen, appointing commissioners, raising funds, and granting certain powers to the magistrates and council, town and dean of guild courts, and for several other purposes.\n\nIn the framing of this system of police, it has been wisely provided that the commissioners shall not enjoy the office for life; nor even for a long period, but upon the supposition of being re-elected, and that every person properly qualified may have a chance for the office, and by consequence be entitled to a voice in the management of the funds, and in the direction of everything which respects the institution.\n\nIn order to raise funds for defraying the expense of the police establishment, the lord provost, magistrates and commissioners, on the first Monday of September, annually assess all occupiers, renters, or possessors of dwelling houses, cellars, shops, warehouses, and other buildings within the royalty, in proportion to the rent of the different subjects, of which the following table gives an accurate statement.\n\n| Rent of Subjects valued at | 4l. and under 6l. sterling annually | 4d. per pound |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| At 6l. and under 10l.     | 6d. do.                            |\n| At 10l. and under 15l.    | 9d. do.                            |\n| At 15l. and upwards       | 10d. do.                           |\n\nAs soon as the act passed, those gentlemen who were appointed to carry it into execution, began the discharge of their duty according to the spirit of said act, and the following office-bearers were nominated for that purpose; a master of police, a clerk of ditto, collector, treasurer, surveyor, together with other 15 officers of police, and 74 watchmen. These have power to bring to justice persons guilty of street robberies, house-breakings, assaults, thefts, shop-lifting, picking pockets, frequenters of disorderly houses; to suppress mobs and riots; to assist in extinguishing fires, in guarding and watching the streets, and in assuring the magistrates in every thing which relates to the police, peace, and good order of the city. These officers have hitherto given general satisfaction in the discharge of their duty, by seeing that the streets are kept clean, well lighted and guarded. In a word, property and personal safety are put beyond the reach of danger, and the institution promises to be of the most unapproachable advantage to the inhabitants at large.\n\nMany whole and elegant streets have of late years been added to it, so that its rapid extension, increasing population, and flourishing commerce, justly entitle it to rank with some of the first cities in Scotland, or perhaps in the British empire.\n\nThe revenue of the town arises from a duty upon all grain and meal brought into the city (which tax is denominated the laddie); from the rents of lands and houses the property of the community; from an impost of two pennies Scots upon every Scots pint of ale or beer brewed, inbrought, or sold within the city; from certain duties payable out of the markets; from the rents of the feasts in churches; from the dues of crannage at the quay, at the weigh-house, &c. As to the tonnage on the river, the portage of the bridge, and flatrate work; these, making no part of the city revenue, are kept separate and distinct under the management of commissioners appointed by act of parliament.\n\nAbout the time of the Union, the number of inhabitants in Glasgow was reckoned about 14,000. In 1765, when a new division of the parishes took place, they were estimated at 28,000. In 1785, when an accurate survey was made, the number was about 36,000; besides the suburbs, containing the Calton, Gorbals, and Anderston, reckoned about 1,000. Since that time new buildings, as above noticed, have been erected, and the city has become considerably more populous, but no exact estimate has been made; though it is generally thought that the number of inhabitants cannot at present (1806) be computed at much less than 86,630, and accordingly they are more than doubled since 1791, at which time they only amounted to 41,777.\n\nThe climate of Glasgow, similar to that of most other parts of the island, is variable; but there are some circumstances peculiar to its local situation which tend to affect it more than that of some other places nearer the middle of the country. That part of the county in which Glasgow is situated, is almost in the narrowest part of the isthmus between the Forth and Clyde, from which position the air is frequently refreshed by temperate breezes from the sea. The wind is south-west and west for nearly two-thirds of the year, which is saturated with vapour in its passage across the Atlantic; and the sky being frequently clouded with it, the heats of summer are not so intense as in some other places. Fogs are not so common as in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and severe frosts are seldom of long continuance, nor are snows either very deep, nor do they lie long. Thunder and lightning are rare about Glasgow, and seldom destructive.\n\nThe soil in the vicinity is partly a rich clay and partly a light sand. The grain raised round the city is not sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, but vast quantities are brought from Ireland, Ayrshire, and the east country. While digging the foundation for the Town buildings in the midst of the city, a piece of a boat was found several feet below the surface of the ground, imbedded in sand and gravel, from which it would appear that the channel of the river had once run in that direction. In August 1801, while repairing a division of the cathedral, below the pavement opposite to the pulpit, about two feet deep, part of a human skeleton was found, and a gold chain about 30 inches long lying above the bones of the leg. The date on the stone was 1599, but the inscription in the Saxon character was wholly effaced.\nThe general character of the people is that of industry and attention to business, by which many of them have arisen to a state of independence. They were formerly said to be remarkable for severity and apparent sanctity of manners; but at present they are not more distinguished in this respect than any of their neighbours. The crimes of robbery and house-breaking were much more frequent at a former period than they are now; but as these were for the most part committed by strangers, it would be uncandid on that account to attach blame to the inhabitants; the recent regulations, however, respecting the internal police of the city, have nearly put a stop to such depredations.","sp":401,"ep":411},{"h":"GLASS","t":"a transparent, brittle, factitious body, produced from sand melted in a strong fire with fixed alkaline salts, lead, flax, &c. till the whole becomes perfectly clear and fine. The word is formed of the Latin glaftum, a plant called by the Greeks jasitis, by the Romans vitrum; by the ancient Britons guadum, and by the English wood. We find frequent mention of this plant in ancient writers, particularly C\u00e6sar, Vitruvius, Pliny, &c., who relate, that the ancient Britons painted or dyed their bodies with glaftum, guadum, vitrum, &c., i.e., with the blue colour procured from this plant. And hence, the factitious matter we are speaking of came to be called glaftum; as having always something of this blue tinge in it.\n\nAt what time the art of glaft-making was first invented, is altogether uncertain. Some imagine it to have been invented before the flood; but of this we have no direct proof, though there is no improbability in the supposition; for we know, that it is almost impossible to excite a very violent fire, such as is necessary in metallurgical operations, without vitrifying part of the bricks or stones wherewith the furnace is built. This indeed might furnish the first hints of glaft-making; though it is also very probable, that such imperfect vitrifications would be observed a long time before people thought of making any use of them.\n\nNeri traces the antiquity of glaft as far back as the time of Job. That writer, speaking of the value of wisdom (chap. xxviii. verse 17), says, that gold and crystal cannot equal it. But this word, which Neri will have to signify factitious glaft, is capable of a great many different interpretations, and properly signifies only whatever is beautiful or transparent. Dr Merret will have the art to be as ancient as that of pottery or the making of bricks, for the reasons already given, viz., that by all vehement heat some imperfect vitrifications are produced. Of this kind undoubtedly was the fossil glaft mentioned by Ferant. Imperator, to have been found under ground where great fires had been. But it is evident, that such imperfect vitrifications might have passed unnoticed for ages; and consequently we have no reason to conclude from thence, that the art of glaft-making is of such high antiquity.\n\nThe Egyptians boast, that this art was taught them by their great Hermes, Ariftophanes, Ariftotle, Alexander Aphrodites, Lucretius, and St John the divine, put it out of all doubt, that glaft was used in their days. Pliny relates, that it was first discovered accidentally in Syria, at the mouth of the river Belus, by certain merchants driven thither by a storm at sea; who being obliged to continue there, and drew their victuals by making a fire on the ground, where there was great plenty of the herb kali; that plant, burning to ashes, its salts mixed and incorporated with the sand, or stones fit for vitrification, and thus produced glaft; and that, this accident being known, the people of Sidon in that neighbourhood employed the work, and brought glaft into use; since which time the art has been continually improving. Be this as it will, however, the first glaft-houses mentioned in history were erected in the city of Tyre, and here was the only staple of the manufacture for many ages. The sand which lay on the shore for about half a mile round the mouth of the river Belus was peculiarly adapted to the making of glaft, as being neat and glittering; and the wide range of the Tyrian commerce gave an ample vent for the productions of the furnace.\n\nMr Nixon, in his observations on a plate of glaft found at Herculaneum, which was destroyed A.D. 82, on which occasion Pliny lost his life, offers several probable conjectures as to the uses to which such plates might be applied. Such plates, he supposes, might serve for specula or looking glafts; for Pliny, in speaking of Sidon, adds, quidem etiam specula excoctinverat: the reflection of images from these ancient specula being effected by befmeering them behind, or tingling them through with some dark colour. Another use in which they might be employed, was for adorning the walls of their apartments, by way of wainscot, to which Pliny is supposed to refer by his vitreae camerae, lib. xxxvi. cap. 25. \u00a7 64. Mr Nixon farther conjectures, that these glaft plates might be used for windows, as well as the laminae of lapis specularis and phengites, which were improvements in luxury mentioned by Seneca and introduced in his time, Ep. xc. However, there is no positive authority relating to the usage of glaft windows earlier than the close of the third century: Maneficius eff (says Laetanius*), mentem effe, qua per oculos ea que sunt opposita, De opiftransficiat, quae per feneftras lucente vitro aut spectari Dei, cap. 5. lapide obdulatas.\n\nThe first time we hear of glaft made among the Romans was in the reign of Tiberius, when Pliny relates that an artist had his house demolished for making glaft malleable, or rather flexible; though Petronius Arbiter, and some others, assure us, that the emperor ordered the artist to be beheaded for his invention.\n\nIt appears, however, that before the conquest of Britain by the Romans, glaft-houses had been erected in this island, as well as in Gaul, Spain, and Italy.\u2014Hence, in many parts of the country are to be found annulets of glaft, having a narrow perforation and thick rim, denominated by the remaining Britons gleineu naid-reedl, or glaft adders, and which were probably in former times used as amulets by the druids+. It can scarcely be questioned that the Britons were sufficiently well versed in the manufacture of glaft, to form out of it many more useful intruments than the glaft beads. History indeed affirms us, that they did manufacture a considerable quantity of glaft vessels. These, like their annulets, were most probably green, blue, yellow, or black, and many of them curiously streaked with other colours. The process in the manufacture would be nearly the same with that of the Gauls or Spaniards. The sand of their shores being reduced to a sufficient degree of fineness by art, was mixed with three-fourths\nof its weight of their nitre (much the same with our kelp), and both were melted together. The metal was then poured into other vessels, where it was left to harden into a mass, and afterwards replaced in the furnace, where it became transparent in the boiling, and was afterwards figured by blowing, or modelling in the lath, into such vessels as they wanted.\n\nIt is not probable that the arrival of the Romans would improve the glass manufacture among the Britons. The taste of the Romans at that time was just the reverse of that of the inhabitants of this island. The former preferred silver and gold to glass for the composition of their drinking vessels. They made indeed great improvements in their own at Rome, during the government of Nero. The vessels then formed of this metal rivalled the bowls of porcelain in their cleanness, and equalled the cups of crystal in their transparency. But these were far too costly for common use; and therefore, in all probability, were never attempted in Britain. The glass commonly made use of by the Romans was of a quality greatly inferior; and, from the fragments which have been discovered at the stations or towns of either, appear to have consisted of a thick, sometimes white, but mostly blue green, metal.\n\nAccording to venerable Bede, artificers skilled in making glass for windows were brought over into England in the year 674, by Abbot Benedict, who were employed in glazing the church and monastery of Wearmouth. According to others, they were first brought over by Wilfrid, bishop of Worcester, about the same time. Till this time the art of making such glass was unknown in Britain; though glass windows did not begin to be common before the year 1180; till this period they were very scarce in private houses, and considered as a kind of luxury, and as marks of great magnificence. Italy had them first, next France, from whence they came into England.\n\nVenice, for many years, excelled all Europe in the fineness of its glasses; and in the thirteenth century, the Venetians were the only people that had the secret of making crystal looking glasses. The great glass works were at Muran, or Murano, a village near the city, which furnished all Europe with the finest and largest glasses.\n\nThe glass manufacture was first begun in England in 1557: the finer sort was made in the place called Cruched Friars, in London; the fine flint glass, little inferior to that of Venice, was first made in the Savoy house, in the Strand, London. This manufacture appears to have been much improved in 1635, when it was carried on with sea coal or pit coal instead of wood, and a monopoly was granted to Sir Robert Manfell, who was allowed to import the fine Venetian flint glasses for drinking, the art of making which was not brought to perfection before the reign of William III. But the first glass plates, for looking glasses and coach windows, were made, 1673, at Lambeth, by the encouragement of the duke of Buckingham; who, in 1670, introduced the manufacture of fine glass into England, by means of Venetian artists, with amazing success. So that within a century past, the French and English have not only come up to, but even surpassed the Venetians, and we are now no longer supplied from abroad.\n\nThe French made a considerable improvement in the art of glass, by the invention of a method to cast very large plates, till then unknown, and scarce practised yet by any but themselves and the English. That court applied itself with a laudable industry to cultivate and improve the glass manufacture. A company of glassmen was established by letters patent; and it was provided by an act, not only that the working in glass should not derogate anything from nobility, but even that none but nobles should be allowed to work therein.\n\nAn extensive manufactory of this elegant and valuable branch of commerce was first established in Lancashire, about the year 1773, through the spirited exertions of a very respectable body of proprietors, who were incorporated by an act of parliament. From those various difficulties constantly attendant upon new undertakings, when they have to contend with powerful foreign establishments, it was for some time considerably embarrassed; but government, of late, having taken off some restrictions that bore hard upon it, and made some judicious regulations relative to the mode of levying the excise duty, it now bids fair to rival, if not surpass, the most celebrated continental manufactures, both with respect to the quality, brilliancy, and size of its productions.\n\nWith regard to the theory of vitrification, we are almost totally in the dark. In general, it seems to be uncertain what state in which solid bodies are, by the vehement action of fire, fitted for being dissipated or carried off in vapour. In all vitrifications there is a plentiful evaporation; and if any solid substance is carried off in vapour by the intense heat of a burning speculum, a vitrification is always observed previously to take place. The difference, then, between the state of fusion and vitrification of a solid body we may conceive to be, that in the former the element of fire acts upon the parts of the solid in such a manner as only to disjoin them, and render the substance fluid; but in vitrification the fire not only disjoins the particles, but combines with them in a latent state into a third substance; which, having now as much fire as it can contain, can receive no further change from that element except being carried off in vapour.\n\nBut though we are unable to effect this change upon solid bodies without a very violent heat, it is otherwise in the natural processes. By what we call crystallisation, nature produces more perfect glasses than we can make with our furnaces. These are called precious stones; but in all trials they discover the essential properties of glass, and not of stones. The most distinguishing property of glass is its resisting the force of fire, so that this element cannot calcine or change it as it does other bodies, but can only melt it, and then carry it off in vapours. To this last all the precious stones are subject. The diamond (the hardest of them all) may be dissipated in a less degree of heat than what would dissipate common glass. Nor can it be any objection to this idea, that some kinds of glass are capable of being converted into a kind of porcelain by a long-continued cementation with certain materials. This change happens only to those kinds of glass which are made of alkaline feldspar and sand; and Dr Lewis hath shown that this change is produced by the dissipation of the saline principle, which is the least fixed of the two. Glass, therefore, we may still consider as a substance upon which the fire has\nGlas, has no other effect than either to melt or dissipate it in vapour.\n\nThe other properties of glas are very remarkable, some of which follow:\n\n1. It is one of the most elastic bodies in nature. If the force with which glas balls strike each other be reckoned 16, that whereewith they recede by virtue of their elasticity will be nearly 15.\n\n2. When glas is suddenly cooled, it becomes exceedingly brittle; and this brittleness is sometimes attended with very surprising phenomena. Hollow balls made of unannealed glas, with a small hole in them, will fly to pieces by the heat of the hand only, if the hole by which the internal and external air communicate be stopped with a finger. Some vessels, however, made of such unannealed glas have been discovered, which have the remarkable property of resisting very hard strokes given from without, though they shiver to pieces by the shocks received from the fall of very light and minute bodies dropped into their cavities. These glases may be made of any shape: all that needs be observed in making them is, that their bottom be thicker than their sides. The thicker the bottom is, the easier do the glases break. One whose bottom is three fingers breadth in thickness flies with as much ease at least as the thinnest glas. Some of these vessels have been tried with strokes of a mallet sufficient to drive a nail into wood tolerably hard, and have held good without breaking. They have also resisted the shock of several heavy bodies, let fall into their cavities, from the height of two or three feet; as musket balls, pieces of iron, or other metal pyrites, jasper, wood, bone, &c. But this is not surprising, as other glases of the same shape and size will do the same: but the wonder is, that taking a flake of flint of the size of a small pea, and letting it fall into the glas only from the height of three inches, in about two seconds the glas flies, and sometimes at the very moment of the shock; nay, a bit of flint no larger than a grain, dropped into several glases successively, though it did not immediately break them, yet when set by, they all flew in less than three quarters of an hour. Some other bodies produce the same effect with flint; as sapphire, diamond, porcelain, hard tempered steel; also marbles such as boys play with, and likewise pearls.\n\nThese experiments were made before the Royal Society; and succeeded equally when the glases were held in the hand, when they were refted on a pillow, put in water, or filled with water. It is also remarkable, that the glases broke upon having their bottoms slightly rubbed with the finger, though some of them did not fly till half an hour after the rubbing. If the glases are everywhere extremely thin, they do not break in these circumstances.\n\nSome have pretended to account for these phenomena, by saying, that the bodies dropped into the vessels cause a concussion which is stronger than the cohesive force of the glas, and consequently that a rupture must ensue. But why does not a ball of iron, gold, silver, or copper, which are perhaps a thousand times heavier than the flint, produce the same effect? It is because they are not elastic, but purely iron is more elastic than the end of one's finger. Mr Euler has endeavoured to account for these appearances from his principles of percussion. He thinks that this experiment entirely overthrows the opinion of those who measure the force of percussion by the *vis viva*, or absolute apparent strength of the stroke. According to his principles, the great hardnesses and angular figure of the flint, which makes the space of contact with the glas extremely small, ought to cause an impression on the glas vastly greater than lead, or any other metal; and this may account for the flint's breaking the vessel, though the bullet, even falling from a considerable height, does no damage. Hollow cups made of green bottle glas, some of them three inches thick at the bottom, were instantly broken by a flake of flint weighing about two grains, though they had resisted the shock of a musket ball from the height of three feet.\n\nThat Mr Euler's theory cannot be conclusive more than the other, must appear evident from a very slight consideration. It is not by angular bodies alone that the glases are broken. The marbles with which children play are round, and yet they have the same effect with the angular flint. Besides, if it was the mere force of percussion which broke the glases, undoubtedly the fracture would always take place at the very instant of the stroke; but we have seen that this did not happen sometimes till a very considerable space of time had elapsed. It is evident, therefore, that this effect is occasioned by the putting in motion some volatile fluid with which the substance of the glas is filled; and that the motions of this fluid, when once excited in a particular part of the glas, soon propagate themselves through the whole or greatest part of it, by which means the cohesive power becomes at last too weak to resist them. There can be little doubt that the fluid just now mentioned is that of electricity. It is known to exist in glas in very great quantity; and it also is known to be capable of breaking glases even when annealed with the greatest care, if put into too violent a motion. Probably the cooling of glas hasty may make it more electric than is consistent with its cohesive power, so that it is broken by the least increase of motion in the electric fluid by friction or otherwise. This is evidently the case when it is broken by rubbing with the finger; but why it should also break by the mere contact of flint and the other bodies above mentioned, has not yet been satisfactorily accounted for.\n\nA most remarkable phenomenon also is produced in rotation of glas tubes placed in certain circumstances. When these glas tubes are laid before a fire in a horizontal position, having before their extremities properly supported, they acquire a rotatory motion round their axis, and also a progressive motion towards the fire, even when their supports are declining from the fire, so that the tubes will move a little way up hill towards the fire. When the progressive motion of the tubes towards the fire is stopped by any obstacle, their rotation still continues. When the tubes are placed in a nearly upright posture, leaning to the right hand, the motion will be from east to west; but if they lean to the left hand, their motion will be from west to east; and the nearer they are placed to the perfectly upright posture, the less will the motion be either way.\n\nIf the tube is placed horizontally on a glas pane, the fragment, for instance, of coach window-glas, in-\nstead of moving towards the fire, it will move from it, and about its axis in a contrary direction to what it had done before; nay, it will recede from the fire, and move a little up hill when the plane inclines towards the fire. These experiments are recorded in the Philosophical Transactions*. They succeeded best with tubes about 20 or 22 inches long, which had in each end a pretty strong pin fixed in cork for an axis.\n\nThe reason given for these phenomena, is the swelling of the tubes towards the fire by the heat, which is known to expand all bodies. For, say the adopters of this hypothesis, granting the existence of such a swelling, gravity must pull the tube down when supported near its extremities; and a fresh part being exposed to the fire, it must also swell out and fall down, and so on.\u2014But without going farther in the explanation of this hypothesis, it may be here remarked, that the fundamental principle on which it proceeds is false; for though fire indeed make bodies expand, it does not increase them in weight; and therefore the sides of the tube, though one of them is expanded by the fire, must still remain in equilibrium; and hence we must conclude, that the causes of these phenomena remain yet to be discovered.\n\n4. Glass is less dilatable by heat than metallic substances, and solid glass sticks are less dilatable than Phil. Trans./tubes. This was first discovered by Col. Roy, in making experiments in order to reduce barometers to a greater degree of exactness than hath hitherto been found practicable; and since his experiments were made, one of the tubes 18 inches long, being compared with a solid glass rod of the same length, the former was found by a pyrometer to expand four times as much as the other, in a heat approaching to that of boiling oil.\u2014On account of the general quality which glass has of expanding less than metal, M. de Luc recommends it to be used in pendulums; and he says it has also this good quality, that its expansions are always equable, and proportioned to the degrees of heat; a quality which is not to be found in any other substance yet known.\n\n5. Glass appears to be more fit for the condensation of vapours than metallic substances. An open glass filled with water, in the summer time, will gather drops of water on the outside, just as far as the water in the inside reaches; and a person's breath blown on it manifestly moistens it. Glass also becomes moist with dew, when metals do not. See Dew.\n\n6. A drinking glass partly filled with water, and rubbed on the brim with a wet finger, yields musical notes, higher or lower as the glass is more or less full; and will make the liquor frisk and leap. See Harmonica.\n\n7. Glass is possessed of very great electrical virtues. See Electricity, passim.\n\nMaterials for Making of Glass. The materials whereof glass is made, we have already mentioned to be salt and sand or stones.\n\n1. The salt here used is procured from a sort of ashes brought from the Levant, called polverine, or rochetto; which ashes are those of a sort of water plant called kelp\u2020, cut down in the summer, dried in the sun, and burnt in heaps, either on the ground or on iron grates; the ashes falling into a pit, grow into a hard mass, or stone, fit for use. It may also be procured from common kelp, or the ashes of the fucus vesiculosus. See Kelp.\n\nTo extract the salt, these ashes, or polverine, are powdered and sifted, then put into boiling water, and there kept till one third of the water be consumed; the whole being stirred up from time to time, that the ashes may incorporate with the fluid, and all its salts be extracted; then the vessel is filled up with new water, and boiled over again, till one half be consumed; what remains is a sort of ley, strongly impregnated with salt. This ley, boiled over again in fresh coppers, thickens in about 24 hours, and floats its salt; which is to be ladled out, as it floats, into earthen pans, and thence into wooden vats to drain and dry. This done, it is grossly pounded, and thus put in a fort of oven, called calcare, to dry. It may be added, that there are other plants, besides kali and fucus, which yield a salt fit for glass: such are the common way thistle, bramble, hops, wormwood, wood, tobacco, fern, and the whole leguminous tribe, as peas, beans, &c.\n\nPearl ashes form a leading flux in the manufacture of glass, and mostly supply the place of the Levant ashes, the barillas of Spain, and many other kinds, which were formerly brought here for making both glass and soap.\n\nThere are other fluxes used for different kinds of glass, and for various purposes, as calcined lead, nitre, sea salt, borax, arsenic, smiths clinkers, and wood-ashes, containing the earth and lixiviate salts as produced by incineration. With regard to these several fluxes, we may observe, in general, that the more calx of lead, or other metallic earth, enters into the composition of any glass, so much the more fusible, soft, coloured, and dense this glass is, and reciprocally.\n\nThe colours given to glass by calces of lead, are shades of yellow: on the other hand, glasses that contain only saline fluxes partake of the properties of salts; they are less heavy, less dense, harder, whiter, more brilliant, and more brittle than the former; and glasses containing both saline and metallic fluxes do also partake of the properties of both these substances. Glasses too saline are easily susceptible of alteration by the action of air and water; especially those in which alkalies prevail; and they are also liable to be injured by acids. Those that contain too much borax and arsenic, though at first they appear very beautiful, quickly tarnish and become opaque when exposed to air. By attending to these properties of different fluxes, phlogistic or saline, the artist may know how to adjust the proportions of these to sand, or powdered flints, for the various kinds of glass. See the article Vitrification.\n\n2. The sand or stone, called by the artists tarso, is the second ingredient in glass, and that which gives it the body and firmness. These stones, Agricola observes, must be such as will fuse; and of these such as are white and transparent are best; so that crystal challenges the precedence of all others.\n\nAt Venice they chiefly use a sort of pebble, found in the river Tegino, resembling white marble, and called cinogola. Indeed Ant. Neri assures us, that all stones which will strike fire with steel, are fit to vitrify; but Dr Morret shows, that there are some exceptions from this\nGlass. this rule. Flints are admirable; and when calcined, powdered, and feared, make a pure white crystalline metal; but the expense of preparing them makes the matters of our glass-houses sparing of their use. Where proper stones cannot be so conveniently had, sand is used. The best for this purpose is that which is white, small, and thinning; examined by the microscope, it appears to be small fragments of rock crystal. For green glass, that which is of a loft texture, and more gritty; it is to be well washed, which is all the preparation it needs. Our glass-houses are furnished with white sand for their crystal glasses from Lynn in Norfolk and Maidstone in Kent, and with the coarser for green glass from Woolwich.\n\nSome mention a third ingredient in glass, viz. manganese, a kind of pseudo leadstone, dug up in Germany, Italy, and even in Mendip hills in Somersetshire. But the proportion hereof to the rest is very inconsiderable; beside, that it is not used in all glasses. Its office is to purge off the natural greenish colour, and give it some other tincture required.\n\nFor this purpose it should be chosen of a deep colour, and free from specks of metallic appearance, or a lighter cast; manganese requires to be well calcined in a hot furnace, and then to undergo a thorough levigation. The effect of manganese in destroying the colours of glass, and hence called the soap of glass, is accounted for by M. Montamy, in his Trait\u00e9 des Couleurs pour la Peinture en Email, in the following manner: the manganese destroys the green, olive, and blue colours of glass, by adding to them a purple tinge, and by the mixture producing a blackish brown colour; and as blackness is caused merely by an absorption of the rays of light, the blackish tinge given to the glass by the mixture of colours, prevents the reflection of so many rays, and thus renders the glass less coloured than before. But the black produced by this substance suggests an obvious reason for using it very sparingly in those compositions of glass which are required to be very transparent. Nitre or saltpetre is also used with the same intention; for by destroying in a certain degree the phlogiston which gives a strong tinge of yellow to glass prepared with lead as a flux, it serves to free it from this coloured tinge; and in saline glasses, nitre is requisite in a smaller proportion to render them sufficiently transparent, as in the case of looking glasses and other kinds of plates.\n\nKinds of Glass. The manufactured glasses now in use may be divided into three general kinds; white transparent glasses, coloured glasses, and common green or bottle glasses. Of the first kind there is a great variety; as the flint glasses, as it is called with us, and the German crystal glasses, which are applied to the same uses; the glasses for plates, for mirrors, or looking glasses; the glasses for windows and other lights; and the glasses for phials and small vessels. And these again differ in the substances employed as fluxes in forming them, as well as in the coarseness or fineness of such as are used for their body. The flint and crystal, mirror and best window glasses, not only require such purity in the fluxes, as may render it practicable to free the glasses perfectly from all colour; but for the same reason likewise, either the white Lynn sand, calcined flints, or white pebbles, should be used. The others do not demand the same nicety in the choice of the materials; though the second kind of window glass, and the best kind of phial, will not be so clear as they ought, if either too brown sand or impure salts be suffered to enter into their composition.\n\nOf coloured glasses there is a great variety of sorts, differing in their colour or other properties according to the occasions for which they are wanted. The differences in the latter kind depend on the accidental preparation and management of the artists by whom they are manufactured, as will be afterwards explained.\n\nFurnaces for the Making of Glass. In this manufacture there are three sorts of furnaces; one called calcar is for the frit; the second is for working the glasses; the third serves to anneal the glasses, and is called the leer. See Plate CCXLVII.\n\nThe calcar resembles an oven ten feet long, seven feet broad, and two deep; the fuel, which in Britain is sea coal, is put into a trench on one side of the furnace; and the flame reverberating from the roof upon the frit calcines it. The glasses furnace, or working furnace, is round, of three yards diameter, and two high: or thus proportioned. It is divided into three parts, each of which is vaulted. The lower part is properly called the crown, and is made in that form. Its use is to keep a brisk fire, which is never put out. The mouth is called the bocca. There are several holes in the arch of this crown, through which the flame passes into the second vault or partition, and reverberates into the pots filled with the ingredients above mentioned. Round the insides are eight or more pots placed, and piling pots on them. The number of pots is always double that of the bocca mouths, or of the number of workmen, that each may have one pot refined to work out of, and another for metal to refine in while he works out of the other. Through the working holes the metal is taken out of the pots, and the pots are put into the furnace; and these holes are flopped with moveable covers made of lute and brick, to screen the workmen's eyes from the scorching flames. On each side of the bocca or mouth is a bocarella or little hole, out of which coloured glasses or finer metal is taken from the piling pot. Above this oven there is the third oven or leer, above five or six yards long, where the vessels or glasses are annealed or cooled; this part consists of a tower, besides the leer, into which the flame ascends from the furnace. The tower has two mouths, through which the glasses are put in with a fork, and set on the floor or bottom; but they are drawn out on iron pans called fraches, through the leer, to cool by degrees; so that they are quite cold by the time they reach the mouth of the leer, which enters the farofel or room where the glasses are to be flowed.\n\nBut the green-glass furnace is square; and at each angle it has an arch for annealing or cooling glasses. The metal is wrought on two opposite sides, and on the other two they have their colours, into which are made linen holes for the fire to come from the furnace to bake the frit, and to discharge the smoke. Fires are made in the arches to anneal the work, so that the whole process is done in one furnace.\n\nThese furnaces must not be of brick, but of hard sandy stones. In France, they build the outside of brick; and the inner part, to bear the fire, is made of a fort.\nsort of fullers earth, or tobacco-pipe clay, of which earth they also make their melting pots. In Britain the pots are made of Stourbridge clay.\n\nMr Blancourt observes, that the worst and roughest work in this art is the changing the pots when they are worn out or cracked. In this case, the great working hole must be uncovered; the faulty pot must be taken out with iron hooks and forks, and a new one must be speedily put in its place, through the flames, by the hands only. For this work, the man guards himself with a garment made of skins, in the shape of a pantaloon, that covers him all but his eyes, and is made as wet as possible; the eyes are defended with a proper sort of glass.\n\n**Instruments for Making of Glass.** The instruments made use of in this work may be reduced to these that follow. A blowing pipe, made of iron, about two feet and a half long, with a wooden handle. An iron rod to take up the glass after it is blown, and to cut off the former. Scissors to cut the glass when it comes off from the first hollow iron. Shears to cut and shape great glasses, &c. An iron ladle, with the end of the handle caled with wood, to take the metal out of the refining pot, to put it into the workmen's pots. A small iron ladle caled in the same manner, to skim the alkaline salt that swims at top. Shovels, one like a peel, to take up the great glasses; another like a fire-shovel, to feed the furnace with coals. A hooked iron fork, to stir the matter in the pots. An iron rake for the same purpose, and to stir the frit. An iron fork, to change or pull the pots out of the furnace, &c.\n\n**Compositions for White and Crystal Glass.**\n\n1. To make crystal glass, take of the whiter tarbo, pounded finall, and scarred as fine as flour, 200 pounds; of the salt of pulverine 150 pounds; mix them together, and put them into the furnace called the calcar, first heating it. For an hour keep a moderate fire, and keep stirring the materials with a proper rake, that they may incorporate and calcine together; then increase the fire for five hours; after which take out the matter; which being now sufficiently calcined, is called frit. From the calcar put the frit in a dry place, and cover it up from the dust for three or four months. Now to make the glass or crystal: take of this crystal frit, called also bullio; set it in pots in the furnace, adding to it a due quantity of magnesia or manganese: when the two are fused, cast the flour into fair water, to clear it of the salt called sandiver; which would otherwise make the crystal obscure and cloudy. This lotion must be repeated again and again, as often as needful, till the crystal be fully purged; or this scum may be taken off by means of proper ladles. Then set it to boil four, five, or six days; which done, see whether it have manganese enough; and if it be yet greenish, add more manganese, at discretion, by little and little at a time, taking care not to overdose it, because the manganese inclines it to a blackish hue. Then let the metal clarify, till it becomes of a clear and shining colour; which done, it is fit to be blown or formed into vessels at pleasure.\n\n2. Flint glass, as it is called by us, is of the same general kind with that which in other places is called crystal glass. It has this name from being originally made with calcined flints, before the use of the white sand was understood; and retains the name, though no flints are now used in the composition of it. This flint glass differs from the other, in having lead for its flux, and white sand for its body; whereas the fluxes used for the crystal glass are salts or arsenic, and the body consists of calcined flints or white river pebbles, tarbo, or such stones. To the white sand and lead a proper proportion of nitre is added, to burn away the phlogiston of the lead, and also a small quantity of magnesia; and in some works they use a proportional quantity of arsenic to aid the fluxing ingredients. The most perfect kind of flint glass may be made by fusing with a very strong fire 120 pounds of the white sand, 50 pounds of red lead, 40 pounds of the best pearl ashes, 20 pounds of nitre, and five ounces of magnesia. Another composition of flint glass, which is said to come nearer to the kind now made, is the following: 120 pounds of sand, 54 pounds of the best pearl ashes, 36 pounds of red lead, 12 pounds of nitre, and 6 ounces of magnesia. To either of these a pound or two of arsenic may be added, to increase the flux of the composition. A cheaper composition for flint glass may be made with 120 pounds of white sand, 35 pounds of the best pearl ashes, 40 pounds of red lead, 13 pounds of nitre, 6 pounds of arsenic, and 4 ounces of magnesia; or instead of the arsenic may be substituted 15 pounds of common salt; but this will be more brittle than the other. The cheapest composition for the worst kind of flint glass consists of 120 pounds of white sand, 50 pounds of red lead, 20 pounds of the best pearl ashes, 10 pounds of nitre, 15 pounds of common salt, and 5 pounds of arsenic. The best German crystal glass is made of 120 pounds of calcined flints or white sand, 70 pounds of the best pearl ashes, 10 pounds of saltpetre, half a pound of arsenic, and five ounces of magnesia. And a cheaper composition is formed of 120 pounds of calcined flints or white sand, 46 pounds of pearl ashes, 7 pounds of nitre, 6 pounds of arsenic, and 5 ounces of magnesia.\n\nA glass much harder than any prepared in the common way, may be made by means of borax in the following method: Take four ounces of borax, and an ounce of fine sand; reduce both to a subtile powder, and melt them together in a large close crucible set in a wind furnace, keeping up a strong fire for half an hour; then take out the crucible, and when cold break it, and there will be found at the bottom a pure hard glass capable of cutting common glasses like a diamond. This experiment, duly varied, says Dr Shaw, may lead to several useful improvements in the arts of glasses, enamels, and fictitious gems, and shows an expeditious method of making glasses without any fixed alkali, which has been generally thought an essential ingredient in glasses, and it is not yet known whether calcined crystal or other substances being added to this salt instead of sand, it might not make a glass approaching to the nature of a diamond.\n\nThere are three principal kinds of glasses, distinguished by the form or manner of working them; viz. I. Round glasses, as those of our vessels, phials, drinking glasses, &c. II. Table or window glasses, of which there are divers kinds; viz. crown glasses, jealous glasses, &c. III. Plate glasses, or mirror glasses.\n\n1. Working or Blowing Round Glass. The working furnace, we have observed, is round, and has six boecas or\nor apertures; at one of these, called the great bocca, the furnace is heated, and the pots of frit are at this jet in the furnace; two other small holes, called boceletiar, serve to ladle or take out the melted metal, at the end of an iron, to work the glas. At the other holes they put in pots of fusible ingredients, to be prepared, and at last emptied into the lading pot.\n\nThere are six pots in each furnace, all made of tobacco-pipe clay, proper to sustain not only the heat of the fire, but also the effect of the pulverine, which penetrates every thing else. There are only two of these pots that work: the rest serve to prepare the matter for them. The fire of the furnace is made and kept up with dry hard wood, cast in without intermission at five apertures.\n\nWhen the matter contained in the two pots is sufficiently vitrified, they proceed to blow or fashion it. For this purpose the workman dips his blowing pipe into the melting pot; and by turning it about, the metal sticks to the iron more firmly than turpentine. This he repeats four times, at each time rolling the end of his instrument, with the hot metal thereon, on a piece of plate iron; over which is a vessel of water which helps to cool, and so to consolidate and to dispose that matter to bind more firmly with what is to be taken next out of the melting pot. But after he has dipped a fourth time, and the workman perceives there is metal enough on the pipe, he claps his mouth immediately to the other end of it, and blows gently through the iron tube, till the metal lengthens like a bladder about a foot. Then he rolls it on a marble stone a little while to polish it; and blows a second time, by which he brings it to the shape of a globe of about 18 or 20 inches diameter. Every time he blows into the pipe, he removes it quickly to his cheek; otherwise he would be in danger, by often blowing, of drawing the flame into his mouth: and this globe may be flattened by returning it to the fire; and brought into any form by stamp irons, which are always ready.\n\nWhen the glass is thus blown, it is cut off at the collet or neck; which is the narrow part that stuck to the iron. The method of performing this is as follows: the pipe is refted on an iron bar, close by the collet; then a drop of cold water being laid on the collet, it will crack about a quarter of an inch, which, with a slight blow or cut of the shears will immediately separate the collet.\n\nAfter this is done, the operator dips the iron rod into the melting pot, by which he extracts as much metal as serves to attract the glass he has made, to which he now fixes this rod at the bottom of his work, opposite to the opening made by the breaking of the collet. In this position the glass is carried to the great bocca or mouth of the oven, to be heated and calcined; by which means it is again put into such a soft state, that, by the help of an iron instrument, it can be pierced, opened, and widened, without breaking. But the vessel is not finished till it is returned to the great bocca; where being again heated thoroughly, and turned quickly about with a circular motion, it will open to any size, by the means of the heat and motion.\n\nIf there remain any superfluities, they are cut off with the shears; for till the glass is cool, it remains in a soft flexible state. It is therefore taken from the bocca, and carried to an earthen bench, covered with brands, which are coals extinguished, keeping it turning; because that motion prevents any settling, and preserves an evenness in the face of the glass, where, as it cools, it comes to its consistence; being first cleared from the iron rod by a slight stroke by the hand of the workman.\n\nIf the vessel conceived in the workman's mind, and whose body is already made, requires a foot, or a handle, or any other member or decoration, he makes them separately; and now essays to join them with the help of hot metal, which he takes out of the pots with his iron rod; but the glass is not brought to its true hardness till it has passed the leer or annealing oven, described before.\n\nII. Working or blowing of Window or Table Glass.\n\nThe method of working round glass, or vessels of any sort, is in every particular applicable to the working of window or table glass, till the blowing iron has been dipped the fourth time. But then instead of rounding it, the workman blows, and so manages the metal upon the iron plate, that it extends two or three feet in the form of a cylinder. This cylinder is put again to the fire, and blown a second time, and is thus repeated till it is extended to the dimensions required, the side to which the pipe is fixed diminishing gradually till it ends in a pyramidal form; so that, to bring both ends nearly to the same diameter, while the glass is thus flexible, he adds a little hot metal to the end opposite the pipe, and draws it out with a pair of iron pincers, and immediately cuts off the same end with the help of a little cold water as before.\n\nThe cylinder being now open at one end, is carried back to the bocca; and there, by the help of cold water, it is cut about eight or ten inches from the iron pipe or rod; and the whole length at another place, by which also it is cut off from the iron rod. Then it is heated gradually on an earthen table, by which it opens in length; while the workman, with an iron tool, alternately lowers and raises the two halves of the cylinder; which at last will open like a sheet of paper, and fall into the same flat form in which it serves for use; in which it is preserved by heating it over again, cooling it on a table of copper, and hardening it 24 hours in the annealing furnace, to which it is carried upon forks. In this furnace an hundred tables of glass may lie at a time, without injury to each other, by separating them into tents, with an iron shiver between, which diminishes the weight by dividing it, and keeps the tables flat and even.\n\nOf window or table glass there are various sorts, made in different places, for the use of building. Those most known among us are given us by the author of the Builder's Dictionary, as follows:\n\n1. Crown, of which, says Neri, there are two kinds, distinguished by the places where they are wrought; viz. Ratcliff crown glass, which is the best and clearest, and was first made at the Bear garden, on the Bankside, Southwark, but since at Ratcliff: of this there are 24 tables to the cafe, the tables being of a circular form, about three feet six inches in diameter. The other kind, or Lambeth crown glass, is of a darker colour than the former, and more inclining to green.\n\nThe best window or crown glass is made of white sand 60 pounds, of purified pearl ashes 30 pounds, of saltpetre...\nGlas. saltpetre 13 pounds, of borax one pound, and of arsenic half a pound. If the glas should prove yellow, magnesia must be added. A cheaper composition for window glas consists of 60 pounds of white sand, 25 pounds of unpurified pearl ashes, 10 pounds of common salt, 5 pounds of nitre, 2 pounds of arsenic, and one ounce and a half of magnesia. The common or green window glas is composed of 60 pounds of white sand, 30 pounds of unpurified pearl ashes, 10 pounds of common salt, 2 pounds of arsenic, and 2 ounces of magnesia. But a cheaper composition for this purpose consists of 120 pounds of the cheapest white sand, 30 pounds of unpurified pearl ashes, 60 pounds of wood ashes, well burnt and sifted, 20 pounds of common salt, and 5 pounds of arsenic.\n\n2. French glas, called also Normandy glas, and formerly Lorraine glas, because made in those provinces. At present it is made wholly in the nine glas works; five whereof are in the forest of Lyons, four in the county of Eu; the last at Beaumont near Rouen. It is of a thinner kind than our crown glas; and when laid on a piece of white paper, appears of a dirtyish green colour. There are but 25 tables of this to the case.\n\n3. German glas is of two kinds, the white and the green: the first is of a whitish colour, but is subject to those small curved streaks observed in our Newcastle glas, though free from the spots and blemishes thereof. The green, besides its colour, is liable to the same streaks as the white, but both them are straighter and less warped than our Newcastle glas.\n\n4. Dutch glas is not much unlike our Newcastle glas either in colour or price. It is frequently much warped like that, and the tables are but small.\n\n5. Newcastle glas is that most used in England. It is of an ash colour, and much subject to specks, streaks, and other blemishes; and besides is frequently warped. Leybourn says, there are 45 tables to the case, each containing five superficial feet: some say there are but 35 tables, and five feet in each table.\n\n6. Phial glas is a kind between the flint glas and the common bottle or green glas. The best kind may be prepared with 120 pounds of white sand, 50 pounds of unpurified pearl ashes, 10 pounds of common salt, 5 pounds of arsenic, and 5 ounces of magnesia. The composition for green or common phial glas consists of 120 pounds of the cheapest white sand, 80 pounds of wood ashes well burnt and sifted, 20 pounds of pearl ashes, 15 pounds of common salt, and 1 pound of arsenic.\n\nThe common bottle or green is formed of sand of any kind fluxed by the ashes of burnt wood, or of any parts of vegetables; to which may be added the scoriae or clinkers of forges. When the softest sand is used, 200 pounds of wood ashes will suffice for 100 pounds of sand, which are to be ground and mixed together. The composition with the clinkers consists of 170 pounds of wood ashes, 100 pounds of sand, and 50 pounds of clinkers or scoriae, which are to be ground and mixed together. If the clinkers cannot be ground, they must be broke into small pieces, and mixed with the other matter without any grinding.\n\nIII. Working of Plate or Mirror Glass. 1. The materials of which this glas is made are much the same as those of other works of glas, viz. an alkali, salt and sand.\n\nThe alkali, however, should not be that extracted from pulverine or the ashes of the Syrian kali, but that from barilla, growing about Alicant in Spain. It is very rare that we can have the barilla pure; the Spaniards in burning the herb make a practice of mixing another herb along with it, which alters its quality; or of adding sand to it to increase the weight, which is easily discovered if the addition be only made after the boiling of the ashes, but next to impossible if made in the boiling. It is from this adulteration that those threads and other defects in plate glas arise. To prepare the salt, they clean it well of all foreign matters; pound or grind it with a kind of mill, and finally sift it pretty fine.\n\nPearl ashes, properly purified, will furnish the alkali salt requisite for this purpose; but it will be necessary to add borax or common salt, in order to facilitate the fusion, and prevent the glas from stiffening in that degree of heat in which it is to be wrought into plates. For purifying the pearl ashes, dissolve them in four times their weight of boiling water, in a pot of cast iron, always kept clean from rust. Let the solution be removed into a clean tub, and remain there 24 hours or longer. Having decanted the clear part of the fluid from the dregs or sediment, put it again in the iron pot, and evaporate the water till the salts are left perfectly dry. Preserve them in stone jars, well secured from air and moisture.\n\nPearl ashes may also be purified in the highest degree, so as to be proper for the manufacture of the most transparent glas, by pulverizing three pounds of the best pearl ashes with six ounces of saltpetre in a glas or marble mortar, till they are well mixed; and then putting part of the mixture into a large crucible, and exposing it in a furnace to a strong heat. When this is red hot, throw in the rest gradually; and when the whole is red hot, pour it out on a moistened stone or marble, and put it into an earthen or clean iron pot, with ten pints of water; heat it over the fire till the salts be entirely melted; let it then stand to cool, and filter it through paper in a pewter cullender. When it is filtered, put the fluid again into the pot, and evaporate the salt to dryness, which will then be as white as snow; the nitre having burnt all the phlogistic matter that remained in the pearl ashes after their former calcination.\n\nAs to the sand, it is to be sifted and washed till such time as the water come off very clear; and when it is well dried again, they mix it with the salt, passing the mixture through another sieve. This done, they lay them in the annealing furnace for about two hours; in which time the matter becomes very light and white; in this state they are called frit or fritta; and are to be laid up in a dry clean place, to give them time to incorporate: they lie here for at least a year.\n\nWhen they would employ this frit, they lay it for some hours in the furnace, adding to some the fragments or sherds of old and ill made glasses; taking care first to calcine the sherds by heating them red hot in the furnace, and thus casting them into cold water. To the mixture must likewise be added\nThe best composition for looking glass plates consists of 60 pounds of white sand cleansed, 25 pounds of purified pearl ashes, 15 pounds of saltpetre, and 7 pounds of borax. If a yellow tinge should affect the glass, a small proportion of magnesia, mixed with an equal quantity of arsenic, should be added. An ounce of the magnesia may be first tried; and if this proves insufficient, the quantity should be increased.\n\nA cheaper composition for looking glass plate consists of 60 pounds of the white sand, 20 pounds of pearl ashes, 10 pounds of common salt, 7 pounds of nitre, 2 pounds of arsenic, and 1 pound of borax. The matter of which the glasses are made at the famous manufacture of St Gobin in France, is a composition of folder and of a very white sand, which are carefully cleaned of all heterogeneous bodies; afterwards washed for several times, and dried so as to be pulverized in a mill, consisting of many pettles, which are moved by horses. When this is done, the sand is sifted through silk sieves and dried.\n\nThe matter thus far prepared is equally fit for plate glasses, to be formed either for blowing or by casting.\n\nThe largest glasses at St Gobin are run; the middle sized and small ones are blown.\n\n2. Blowing the plates. The workhouses, furnaces, &c., used in the making of this kind of plate glass, are the same, except that they are smaller, and that the carquailles are dispensed in a large covered gallery, over against the furnace, as those in the following article, to which the reader is referred.\n\nAfter the materials are vitrified by the heat of the fire, and the glass is sufficiently refined, the workman dips his blowing iron, six feet long, and two inches in diameter, sharpened at the end which is put in the mouth, and widened at the other, that the matter may adhere to it. By this means he takes up a small ball of matter, which sticks to the end of the tube by constantly turning it. He then blows into the tube, that the air may well the annexed ball; and carrying it over a bucket of water, which is placed on a support at the height of about four feet, he sprinkles the end of the tube to which the matter adheres, with water, still turning it, that by this cooling the matter may coalesce with the tube, and be fit for sustaining a greater weight. He dips the tube again into the same pot, and proceeds as before; and dipping it into the pot a third time, he takes it out, loaded with matter, in the shape of a pear, about ten inches in diameter, and a foot long, and cools it at the bucket; at the same time blowing into the tube, and with the assistance of a labourer, giving it a balancing motion, he causes the matter to lengthen; which, by repeating this operation several times, attains the form of a cylinder, terminating like a ball at the bottom, and in a point at the top. The assistant is then placed on a stool three feet and a half high; and on this stool there are two upright pieces of timber, with a cross beam of the same, for supporting the glass and tube, which are kept in an oblique position by the assistant, that the matter workman may with a puncheon set in a wooden handle, and with a mallet, make a hole in the mass; this hole is drilled at the centre of the ball that terminates the cylinder, and is about an inch in diameter.\n\nVol. IX. Part II.\ncarquaille or annealing furnace with a small iron raker, and ranged there with a little iron hook. When the carquaille is full, it is stopped and cemented as in the case of run glaisses, and the glaiss remains there for a fortnight to be annealed; after which time they are taken out to be polished. A workman can make but one glaiss in an hour, and he works and rests for six hours alternately.\n\nSuch was the method formerly made use of for blowing plate glaisses, looking glaisses, &c.; but the workmen, by this method, could never exceed 50 inches in length, and a proportional breadth, because what were larger were always found to warp, which prevented them from reflecting the objects regularly, and wanted substance to bear the necessary grinding. These imperfections have been remedied by the following invention of the Sieur Abraham Thevart, in France, about the year 1688.\n\n3. Casting or Running of Large Mirror Glass Plates.\n\nThe furnace is of a very large dimension, environed with several ovens, or annealing furnaces, called carquailles, besides others for making of frit and calcining old pieces of glaiss. This furnace, before it is fit to run glaiss, costs 3500l. It seldom lasts above three years, and even in that time it must be refitted every six months. It takes six months to rebuild it, and three months to refit it. The melting pots are as big as large hogheads, and contain about 2000 weight of metal. If one of them bursts in the furnace, the loss of the matter at once amounts to 250l. The materials in these pots are the same as described before. When the furnace is red hot, these materials are put in at three different times, because that helps the fusion; and in 24 hours they are vitrified, refined, settled, and fit for casting. A is the boca, or mouth of the furnace; B is the cistern that conveys the liquid glaiss it receives out of the melting pots in the furnace to the casting table. These cisterns are filled in the furnace, and remain therein six hours after they are filled; and then are hooked out by the means of a large iron chain, guided by a pulley, placed upon a carriage with four wheels marked C, by two men. This carriage has no middle piece; so that when it has brought the cistern to the casting table D, they flip off the bottom of the cistern, and out rushes a torrent of flaming matter upon the table: this matter is confined to certain dimensions by the iron rulers EE, which are moveable, retain the fluid matter, and determine the width of the glaiss; while a man, with the roller F resting on the edge of the iron rulers, reduces it as it cools to an equal thickness, which is done in the space of a minute. This table is supported on a wooden frame, with trusses for the convenience of moving to the annealing furnace; into which, strewn with sand, the new plate is shoved, where it will harden in about 10 days.\n\nWhat is most surprising throughout the whole of this operation, is the quickness and address wherewith such massy cisterns, filled with a flaming matter, are taken out of the furnace, conveyed to the table, and poured therein, the glaiss spread, &c. The whole is inconceivable to such as have not been eye witnesses of that surprising manufacture.\n\nAs fast as the cisterns are emptied, they carry them back to the furnace and take fresh ones, which they empty as before. Thus they continue to do so long as there are any full cisterns; laying as many plates in each carquaille as it will hold, and stopping them up with doors of baked earth, and every chunk with cement, as soon as they are full, to let them anneal, and cool again, which requires about 14 days.\n\nThe first running being dispatched, they prepare another, by filling the cisterns anew from the matter in the pots; and after the second, a third; and even a fourth time, till the melting pots are quite empty.\n\nThe cisterns at each running should remain at least six hours in the furnace to whiten; and when the first annealing furnace is full, the casting table is to be carried to another. It need not here be observed, that the carquailles, or annealing furnaces, must first have been heated to the degree proper for them. It may be observed, that the oven full, or the quantity of matter commonly prepared, supplies the running of 18 glaisses, which is performed in 18 hours, being an hour for each glaiss. The workmen work six hours, and are then relieved by others.\n\nWhen the pots are emptied, they take them out, as well as the cisterns, to scrape off what glaiss remains, which otherwise would grow green by continuance of fire, and spoil the glaisses. They are not filled again in less than 36 hours; so that they put the matter into the furnace, and begin to run it every 54 hours.\n\nThe manner of heating the large furnaces is very singular; the two tifors, or persons employed for that purpose, in their shirts, run swiftly round the furnace without making the least stop: as they run along, they take two billets, or pieces of wood, which are cut for the purpose; these they throw into the first tiffart; and continuing their course, do the same for the second. This they hold without interruption for six hours successively; after which they are relieved by others, &c. It is surprising that two such small pieces of wood, and which are consumed in an instant, should keep the furnace to the proper degree of heat; which is such, that a large bar of iron, laid at one of the mouths of the furnace, becomes red hot in less than half a minute.\n\nThe glaiss, when taken out of the melting furnace, needs nothing farther but to be ground, polished, and foliated.\n\n4. Grinding and Polishing of Plate Glass.\n\nGlaiss is made transparent by fire; but it receives its lustre by the skill and labour of the grinder and polisher; the former of whom takes it rough out of the hands of the maker.\n\nIn order to grind plate glaiss, they lay it horizontally upon a flat stone table made of a very fine grained freestone; and for its greater security they plaster it down with lime or stucco; for otherwise the force of the workmen, or the motion of the wheel with which they grind it, would move it about.\n\nThis stone table is supported by a strong frame A, made of wood, with a ledge quite round its edges, rising about two inches higher than the glaiss. Upon this glaiss to be ground is laid another rough glaiss not above half so big, and so loose as to slide upon it; but cemented to a wooden plank, to guard it from the injury it must otherwise receive from the scraping of the wheel to which this plank is fastened, and from the weights laid upon it to promote the grinding or triture of the glaisses. The whole is covered with a wheel B, made\nGlass made of hard light wood, about six inches in diameter, by pulling of which backwards and forwards alternately, and sometimes turning it round, the workmen, who always stand opposite to each other, produce a constant attrition between the two glasses, and bring them to what degree of smoothness they please, by first pouring in water and coarse sand; after that, a finer sort of sand, as the work advances, till at last they must pour in the powder of flint. As the upper or incumbent glass polishes and grows smoother, it must be taken away, and another from time to time put in its place.\n\nThis engine is called a mill by the artists, and is used only in the largest fixed glasses; for in the grinding of the lesser glasses, they are content to work without a wheel, and to have only four wooden handles fastened to the four corners of the stone which loads the upper plank, by which they work it about.\n\nWhen the grinder has done his part, who finds it very difficult to bring the glass to an exact plainness, it is turned over to the polishers; who, with the fine powder of tripoli stone or emery, brings it to a perfect evenness and lustre. The instrument made use of in this branch is a board, &c., furnished with a felt, and a small roller, which the workman moves by means of a double handle at both ends. The artist, in working this roller, is assisted with a wooden hoop or spring, to the end of which it is fixed; for the spring, by constantly bringing the roller back to the same points, facilitates the action of the workman's arm.\n\nColouring of Glass. That the colours given to glass may have their full beauty, it must be observed, that every pot when new, and first used, leaves a foulness in the glass from its own earthy parts; so that a coloured glass made in a new pot can never be bright or perfectly fine. For this reason, the larger of these, when new, may be glazed with white glass; but the second time of using the pots lose this foulness. The glazing may be done by reducing the glass to powder, and moistening the inside of the pot with water; while it is yet moist, put in some of the powdered glass, and shake it about, till the whole inner surface of the pot be covered by as much as will adhere to it, in consequence of the moisture. Throw out the redundant part of the powdered glass; and the pot being dry, let it in a furnace sufficiently hot to vitrify the glass adhering to it, and let it continue there some time; after which, care must be taken to let it cool gradually. Those pots which have served for one colour must not be used for another; for the remainder of the old matter will spoil the colour of the new. The colours must be very carefully calcined to a proper degree; for if they are calcined either too much or too little, they never do well; the proper proportion, as to quantity, must also carefully be regarded, and the furnaces must be fed with dry hard wood. And all the processes succeed much the better if the colour be used dividedly, that is, a part of it in the frit, and the rest in the melted metal.\n\nA hard glass, proper for receiving colours, may be prepared by pulverizing 12 pounds of the best sand, cleansed by washing in a glass or flint mortar, and mixing seven pounds of pearl ashes or any fixed alkaline salt purified with nitre, one pound of saltpetre, and half a pound of borax, and pounding them together. A glass less hard may be prepared of twelve pounds of white sand cleansed, seven pounds of pearl ashes purified with saltpetre, one pound of nitre, half a pound of borax, and four ounces of arsenic prepared as before.\n\nAmethyst colour. See Purple below, and the article AMETHYST.\n\nBalas colour. Put into a pot crystal frit, thrice washed in water; tinge this with manganese, prepared into a clear purple; to this add aluminae cativum, sifted fine, in small quantities, and at several times: this will make the glass grow yellowish, and a little reddish, but not blackish, and always dissipates the manganese. The last time you add manganese give no more of the aluminae cativum, unless the colour be too full. Thus will the glass be exactly of the colour of the balas ruby. See Ruby Glass.\n\nThe common black colour. The glassmakers take old broken glass of different colours, grind it to powder, and add to it, by different parcels, a sufficient quantity of a mixture of two parts zaffer and one part manganese: when well purified, they work it into vessels, &c.\n\nGlass beads are coloured with manganese only.\n\nBlack velvet colour. To give this deep and fine colour to glass, take of crystalline and pulverine frit, of each 20 pounds; of calx of lead and tin, four pounds; set all together in a pot in the furnace, well heated; when the glass is formed and pure, take steel well calcined and powdered, scales of iron that fly off from the smith's anvil, of each an equal quantity; powder and mix them well; then put six ounces of this powder to the above described metal while in fusion: mix the whole thoroughly together, and let them all boil strongly together; then let it stand in fusion 12 hours to purify, and after this work it. It will be a most elegant velvet black.\n\nThere is another way of doing this, which also produces a very fair black. It is this: take a hundred weight of rochetta frit, add to this two pounds of tar- tar and five pounds of manganese, both in fine powder; mix them well; and put them to the metal while in fusion, at different times, in several parcels; let it stand in fusion after this for four days, and then work it.\n\nA glass perfectly black may also be formed to ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glass above described, one ounce of zaffer, six drachms of manganese, and an equal quantity of iron strongly calcined.\n\nBlue colour. A full blue may be made by adding six drachms of zaffer and two drachms of manganese to ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glass, described above. For a very cool or pure blue glass, half an ounce of calcined copper may be used instead of the manganese, and the proportion of zaffer diminished by one half. Glasses resembling sapphire may be made with ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glass, three drachms and one scruple of zaffer, and one drachm of the calx caffii or precipitation of gold by tin; or, instead of this latter ingredient, two drachms and two scruples of manganese. Or a sapphire-coloured glass may be made by mixing with any quantity of the hard glass one eighth of its weight of flint. A beautiful blue glass is also produced from the oxide of cobalt.\n\nVenetian brown, with gold pangles, commonly called\nthe philosopher's stone, may be prepared in the following manner: take of the second composition for hard glass above described, and of the composition for pate, of each five pounds, and of highly calcined iron an ounce; mix them well, and fuse them till the iron be perfectly vitrified, and has tinged the glass of a deep transparent yellow brown colour. Powder this glass, and add to it two pounds of powdered glass of antimony; grind them together, and thus mix them well. Take part of this mixture, and rub into it 80 or 100 leaves of the counterfeit leaf gold called Dutch gold; and when the parts of the gold seem sufficiently divided, mix the powder containing it with the other part of the glass. Fuse the whole with a moderate heat till the powder run into a vitreous mass, fit to be brought into any of the figures or vessels into which it is usually formed; but avoid a perfect liquefaction, because that in a short time destroys the equal diffusion of the spangles, and vitrifies, at least in part, the matter of which they are composed; converting the whole into a kind of transparent olive coloured glass. This kind of glass is used for a great variety of toys and ornaments with us, who at present procure it from the Venetians.\n\nChalcedony. A mixture of several ingredients with the common matter of glass, will make it represent the semi-opaque gems, the jaspers, agates, chalcedonies, &c. The way of making these seems to be the same with the method of making marbled paper, by several colours dissolved in several liquors, which are such as will not readily mix with one another when put into water, before they are cast upon the paper which is to be coloured. There are several ways of making these variously coloured glasses, but the best is the following:\n\nDissolve four ounces of fine leaf silver in a glass vessel in strong aquafortis; stop up the vessel, and let it stand.\u2014In another vessel, dissolve five ounces of quicksilver in a pound of aquafortis, and let this stand.\u2014In another glass vessel, dissolve in a pound of aquafortis three ounces of fine silver, first calcined in this manner: amalgamate the silver with mercury, mix the amalgam with twice its weight of common salt well purified; put the mixture in an open fire in a crucible, that the mercury may fly off, and the silver be left in form of powder. Mix this powder with an equal quantity of common salt well purified, and calcine this for six hours in a strong fire; when cold, wash off the salt by repeated boilings in common water, and then put the silver into the aquafortis. Set this solution aside.\n\n\u2014In another vessel, dissolve in a pound of aquafortis three ounces of sal ammoniac; pour off the solution and dissolve in it a quarter of an ounce of gold. Set this aside.\u2014In another vessel, dissolve three ounces of sal ammoniac in a pound of aquafortis; then put into the solution cinnabar, crocus martis, ultramarine, and ferretto of Spain, of each half an ounce. Set this aside.\u2014In another vessel, dissolve in a pound of aquafortis three ounces of sal ammoniac; then put into it crocus martis made with vinegar, calcined tin, zaffer, and cinnabar, of each half an ounce; let each of these be powdered very fine, and put gently into the aquafortis. Set this aside.\u2014In another vessel, dissolve three ounces of sal ammoniac in a pound of aquafortis, and add to it brats calcined with brimstone, brats thrice calcined, manganese, and scales of iron which fall from the smith's anvil, of each half an ounce; let each be well powdered, and put gently into the vessel. Then set this aside.\u2014In another vessel, dissolve two ounces of sal ammoniac in a pound of aquafortis, and put to it verdigris an ounce, red lead, crude antimony, and the caput mortuum of vitriol, of each half an ounce; put these well powdered leisurely into the vessel, and let this also stand.\u2014In another vessel, dissolve two ounces of sal ammoniac in a pound of aquafortis, and add orpiment, white arsenic, painters lake, of each half an ounce.\n\nKeep the above nine vessels in a moderate heat for 15 days, shaking them well at times. After this pour all the matters from these vessels into one large vessel, well luted at its bottom; let this stand five days, shaking it at times; and then set it in a very gentle heat, and evaporate all the liquor, and there will remain a powder of a purplish green.\n\nWhen this is to be wrought, put into a pot very clear metal, made of broken crystalline and white glass that has been used; for with the virgin frit, or such as has never been wrought, the chalcedony can never be made, as the colours do not stick to it, but are consumed by the frit. To every pot of 20 pounds of this metal put two or three ounces of this powder at three several times; incorporate the powder well with the glass; and let it remain an hour between each time of putting in the powders. After all are in, let it stand 24 hours; then let the glass be well mixed, and take an assay of it, which will be found of a yellowish blue; return this many times into the furnace; when it begins to grow cold, it will show many waves of different colours very beautifully. Then take tartar eight ounces, foot of the chimney two ounces, crocus martis made with brimstone, half an ounce; let these be well powdered and mixed, and put them by degrees into the glass at six times, waiting a little while between each putting in. When the whole is put in, let the glass boil and settle for 24 hours; then make a little glass body of it; which put in the furnace many times, and see if the glass be enough, and whether it have on the outside veins of blue, green, red, yellow, and other colours, and have, beside these veins, waves like those of the chalcedonies, jaspers, and oriental agates, and if the body kept within looks as red as fire.\n\nWhen it is found to answer this, it is perfect, and may be worked into toys and vessels, which will always be beautifully variegated: these must be well annealed, which adds much to the beauty of their veins. Mallets of this may be polished at the lapidary's wheel as natural stones, and appear very beautiful. If in the working the matter grows transparent, the work must be stopped, and more tartar, foot, and crocus martis, must be put to it, which will give it again the necessary body and opacity, without which it does not show the colours well.\n\nChrysolite colour may be made of ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glass described above, and fix drachms of calcined iron.\n\nRed cornelian colour may be formed by adding one pound of glass of antimony, two ounces of the calcined vitriol called scarlet ochre, and one drachm of manganese or magnesia, to two pounds of either of the compositions.\npositions for hard glaifs. The glaifs of antimony and magnesia are first fused with the other glaifs, and then powdered and ground with the scarlet ochre: the whole mixture is afterwards fused with a gentle heat till all the ingredients are incorporated. A glaif resembling the white cornelian may be made of two pounds of either of the compositions for hard glaifs, and two drachms of yellow ochre well washed, and one ounce of calcined bones: grind them together, and fuse them with a gentle heat.\n\nEmerald colour. See Green below.\n\nCarnet colour. To give this colour to glaifs, the workmen take the following method. They take equal quantities of crystal and rochetta frit, and to every hundred weight of this mixture they add a pound of manganese and an ounce of prepared zaffer: these are to be powdered separately, then mixed and added by degrees to the frit while in the furnace. Great care is to be taken to mix the manganese and zaffer very perfectly; and when the matter has stood 24 hours in fusion, it may be worked.\n\nGlaifs of this kind may be made by adding one pound of glaifs of antimony, one drachm of manganese, and the same quantity of the precipitate of gold by tin, to two pounds of either of the compositions for hard glaifs; or the precipitate of gold may be omitted, if the quantities of the glaifs of antimony and manganese be doubled.\n\nGold colour. This colour may be produced by taking ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glaifs, omitting the saltpetre; and for every pound adding an ounce of calcined borax, or, if this quantity doth not render the glaif sufficiently fusible, two ounces; ten ounces of red tartar of the deepest colour; two ounces of magnesia; and two drachms of charcoal of fallow, or any other foit kind. Precipitates of silver baked on glaif will stain it yellow, and likewise give a yellow colour on being mixed and melted with 45 or 50 times their weight of vitreous compositions; the precipitate from aquafortis by fixed alkali seems to answer best. Yellow glaifs may also be obtained with certain preparations of iron, particularly with Prussian blue. But Dr Lewis observes, that the colour does not constantly succeed, nor approach to the high colour of gold, with silver or with iron. The nearest imitations of gold which he has been able to produce have been effected with antimony and lead. Equal parts of the glaifs of antimony, of flint calcined and powdered, and of minium, formed a glaif of a high yellow; and with two parts of glaifs of antimony, two of minium, and three of powdered flint, the colour approached still more to that of gold. The last composition exhibited a multitude of small sparkles interpersed throughout its whole substance, which gave it a beautiful appearance in the mass, but were really imperfections, owing to air bubbles.\n\nNeri directs, for a gold yellow colour, one part of red tartar and the same quantity of manganese, to be mixed with a hundred parts of frit. But Kunckel observes, that these proportions are faulty; that one part, or one and a quarter, of manganese, is sufficient for a hundred of frit; but that six parts of tartar are hardly enough, unless the tartar is of a dark red colour, almost blackish; and that he found it expedient to add to the tartar about a fourth of its weight of powdered charcoal. He adds, that the glaif swells up very much in melting, and that it must be left unfurled, and worked as it stands in fusion. Mr Samuel More, in repeating and varying this process in order to render the colour more perfect, found that the manganese is entirely unessential to the gold colour; and that the tartar is no otherwise of use than in virtue of the coaly matter to which it is in part reduced by the fire, the phlogiston or inflammable part of the coal appearing in several experiments to be the direct tinging substance. Mr Pott also observes, that common coals give a yellow colour to glaifs; that different coaly matters differ in their tinging power; that caput mortuum of foot and lamp black answer better than common charcoal; and that the sparkling coal, which remains in the retort after the rectification of the thick empyreumatic animal oils, is one of the most active of these preparations. This preparation, he says, powdered, and then burnt again a little in a close vessel, is excellent for tinging glaifs, and gives yellow, brown, reddish, or blackish colours, according to its quantity; but the frit must not be very hard of fusion, for in this case the strong fire will destroy the colouring substance before the glaif melts: and he has found the following composition to be nearly the best; viz. sand two parts, alkali three parts; or sand two, alkali two, calcined borax one; or sand two, alkali two, calcined borax one: and though saltpetre is hardly used at all, or very sparingly, for yellow glaifs, as it too much volatilizes the colouring substance; yet here for the most part a certain proportion of it, easily determined by trial, is very necessary; for without it the concentrated colouring matter is apt to make the glaif too dark, and even of an opake pitchy blackness. It does not certainly appear that there is any material diversity in the effects of different coals, the difference being probably owing to the different quantities of the inflammable matter which they contain; so that a little more shall be required of one kind than of another for producing the same degree of colour in the glaif. Nor does the loftness or fusibility of the frit appear to be in any respect necessary.\n\nGold-coloured spangles may be diffused through the substance of glaifs, by mixing the yellow talcs with powdered glaifs, and bringing the mixture into fusion.\n\nGreen. This colour may be imparted to glaifs by adding three ounces of copper precipitated from aquafortis, and two drachms of precipitated iron to nine pounds of either of the compositions for hard glaifs. The finest method of giving this beautiful colour to glaifs is this: Take five pounds of crystalline metal that has been palled several times through water, and the same quantity of the common white metal of pulverine, four pounds of common pulverine frit, and three pounds of red lead; mix the red lead well with the frit, and then put all into a pot in a furnace. In a few hours the whole mass will be well purified: then cast the whole into water, and separate and take out the lead; then return the metal into the pot, and let it stand a day longer in fusion; then put in the powder of the residuum of the vitriol of copper, and a very little crocus martis; there will be produced a most lively and elegant green, scarce inferior to that of the oriental emerald. There are many ways of giving a green to glaifs, but all are greatly inferior to this.\u2014To make a sea green, the finest crystalline glaifs only must be used, and no manganese must\nmust be added at first to the metal. The crystal frit must be melted thus alone; and the salt, which swims like oil on its top, must be taken off with an iron ladle very carefully. Then to a pot of twenty pounds of this metal add six ounces of calcined brafis, and a fourth part of the quantity of powdered zaffer: this powder must be well mixed, and put into the glafs at three times; it will make the metal swell at first, and all must be thoroughly mixed in the pot. After it has stood in fusion three hours, take out a little for a proof: if it be too pale, add more of the powder. Twenty-four hours after the mixing the powder the whole will be ready to work; but must be well stirred together from the bottom, lest the colour should be deeper there, and the metal at the top less coloured, or even quite colourless. Some use for this purpose half crystal frit and half rochetta frit, but the colour is much the finest when all crystal frit is used.\n\nLapis lazuli colour. See Lapis Lazuli.\n\nOpal colour. See Opal.\n\nPurple of a deep and bright colour may be produced by adding to ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glafs, above described, six drachms of zaffer and one drachm of gold precipitated by tin; or to the same quantity of either composition one ounce of manganese and half an ounce of zaffer. The colour of amethyst may be imitated in this way.\n\nRed. A blood red glafs may be made in the following manner: Put five pounds of glafs of lead, and ten pounds of common glafs, into a pot glazed with white glafs. When the whole is boiled and refined, add by small quantities, and at small distances of time, copper calcined to a redness as much as on repeated proofs is found sufficient; then add tartar in powder by small quantities at a time, till the glafs becomes as red as blood; and continue adding one or other of the ingredients till the colour is quite perfect.\n\nRuby. The way to give the true fine red of the ruby, with a fair transparency, to glafs, is as follows: Calcine in earthen vessels gold dissolved in aqua regia; the menstruum being evaporated by distillation, more aqua regia added, and the abstraction repeated five or six times, till it becomes a red powder. This operation will require many days in a hot furnace. When the powder is of a proper colour, take it out: and when it is to be used, melt the finest crystal glafs, and purify it by often casting it into water; and then add, by small quantities, enough of this red powder to give it the true colour of a ruby, with an elegant and perfect transparency.\n\nThe process of tinging glafs and enamels by preparations of gold was first attempted about the beginning of the last century. Libavius, in one of his tracts entitled Alchymia, printed in 1606, conjectures that the colour of the ruby proceeds from gold, and that gold dissolved and brought to redness might be made to communicate a like colour to fictitious gems and glafs. On this principle Neri, in his Art of Glafs, dated in 1611, gives the process above recited. Glauber in 1648 published a method of producing a red colour by gold, in a matter which is of the vitreous kind, though not perfect glafs. For this purpose he ground powdered flint or sand with four times its weight of fixed alkaline salt: this mixture melts in a moderately strong fire, and when cool looks like glafs, but exposed to the air runs into a liquid state. On adding this liquor to solution of gold in aqua-regia, the gold and flint precipitate together in form of a yellow powder, which by calcination becomes purple. By mixing this powder with three or four times its weight of the alkaline solution of flint, drying the mixture, and melting it in a strong fire for an hour, a mass is obtained of a transparent ruby colour and of a vitreous appearance; which nevertheless is soluble in water, or by the moisture of the air, on account of the redundancy of the salt. The Honourable Mr Boyle, in a work published in 1680, mentions an experiment in which a like colour was introduced into glafs without fusion; for having kept a mixture of gold and mercury in digestion for some months, the fire was at last immoderately increased, so that the glafs burst with a violent explosion; and the lower part of the glafs was found tinged throughout of a transparent red colour, hardly to be equalled by that of rubies.\n\nAbout the same time Cassius is said to have discovered the precipitation of gold by tin, and that glafs might be tinged of a ruby colour by melting it with this precipitate; though he does not appear, says Dr Commercy Lewis, from his treatise De Aura, to have been the discoverer of either. He describes the preparation of the precipitate and its use; but gives no account of the manner of employing it, only that he says one drachm of gold duly prepared will tinge ten pounds of glafs.\n\nThis process was soon after brought to perfection by Kunckel; who says, that one part of the precipitate is sufficient to give a ruby colour to 1280 parts of glafs, and a sensible redness to upwards of 1900 parts; but that the success is by no means constant. Kunckel also mentions a purple gold powder, resembling that of Neri; which he obtained by infusing solution of gold to dryness; abstracting from it fresh aqua-regia three or four times, till the matter appears like oil; then precipitating with strong alkaline ley, and washing the precipitate with water. By dissolving this powder in spirit of salt and precipitating again, it becomes, he says, extremely fair; and in this state he directs it to be mixed with a due proportion of Venice glafs.\n\nOrfchial, in a treatise entitled Sol fine Vege, gives the following process for producing a very fine ruby. He directs the purple precipitate made by tin to be ground with six times its quantity of Venice glafs into a very fine powder, and this compound to be very carefully mingled with the frit or vitreous composition to be tinged. His frit consists of equal parts of borax, nitre, and fixed alkaline salt, and four times as much calcined flint as of each of the salts; but he gives no directions as to the proportion of the gold precipitate or mode of fusion. Hellot describes a preparation, which, mixed with Venice glafs, was found to give a beautiful purple enamel. This preparation consists of equal parts of solution of gold and of solution of zinc in aqua-regia mixed together, with the addition of a volatile salt prepared from sal ammoniac by quicklime, in sufficient quantity to precipitate the two metals. The precipitate is then gradually heated till it acquires a violet colour. However, though a purple or red colour, approaching to that of ruby, may, by the methods above recited, be baked on glafs or enamels, and introduced into the mass by fusion, the way of equally diffusing such-\nsuch a colour through a quantity of fluid glaas is still, says Dr Lewis, a secret. The following process for making the ruby glaas was communicated to Dr Lewis by an artist, who ascribed it to Kunckel. The gold is directed to be dissolved in a mixture of one part of spirit of salt and three of aquafortis, and the tin in a mixture of one part of the former of these acids with two of the latter. The solution of gold being properly diluted with water, the solution of tin is added, and the mixture left to stand till the purple matter has settled to the bottom. The colourless liquor is then poured off, and the purple sediment, while moist and not very thick, is thoroughly mixed with powdered flint or sand. This mixture is well ground with powdered nitre, tartar, borax, and arsenic, and the compound melted with a suitable fire. The proportions of the ingredients are 256 parts of sand, 384 of nitre, 240 of tartar, 240 of borax, 28 of arsenic, five of tin, and five of gold.\n\nTopaz Colour. Glaas resembling this stone may be made by pulverizing ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glaases with an equal quantity of the gold-coloured glaas, and fusing them together.\n\nWhite opake and semitransparent glaas may be made of ten pounds of either of the compositions for hard glaas, and one pound of well calcined horn, ivory, or bone; or an opake whitening may be given to glaas by adding one pound of very white arsenic to ten pounds of flint glaas. Let them be well powdered and mixed by grinding them together, and then fused with a moderate heat till they are thoroughly incorporated. A glaas of this kind is made in large quantities at a manufactory near London; and used not only for different kinds of vessels, but as a white ground for enamel in dial plates and snuff boxes, which do not require finishing with much fire, because it becomes very white and fusible with a moderate heat.\n\nYellow. See Gold colour above.\n\nPainting in Glass. The ancient manner of painting in glaas was very simple: it consisted in the mere arrangement of pieces of glaas of different colours in some sort of symmetry, and constituted what is now called mosaic work. See Mosaic.\n\nIn process of time they came to attempt more regular designs, and also to represent figures heightened with all their shades: yet they proceeded no farther than the contours of the figures in black with water colours, and hatching the draperies after the same manner on glaases of the colour of the object they designed to paint. For the carnation, they used glaas of a bright red colour; and upon this they drew the principal lineament of the face, &c. with black.\n\nAt length, the taste for this kind of painting improving considerably, and the art being found applicable to the adorning of churches, basilicas, &c. they found out means of incorporating the colours in the glaas itself, by heating them in the fire to a proper degree; having first laid on the colours. A French painter at Marseilles is said to have given the first notion of this improvement, upon going to Rome under the pontificate of Julius II.; but Albert Durer and Lucas of Leyden were the first that carried it to any height.\n\nThis art, however, has frequently met with much interruption, and sometimes been almost totally lost; of which Mr Walpole gives us the following account, in his Anecdotes of Painting in England.\n\n\"The first interruption given to it was by the reformation, which banished the art out of churches; yet it was in some measure kept up in the escutcheons of the nobility and gentry in the windows of their seats. Towards the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign it was omitted even there; yet the practice did not entirely cease. The chapel of our Lady at Warwick was ornamented anew by Robert Dudley earl of Leicester, and his counsellors, and the cipher of the glaas-painter's name yet remains, with the date 1574: and in some of the chapels at Oxford the art again appears, dating itself in 1622, by the hand of no contemptible master.\n\n\"I could supply even this gap of 48 years by many dates on Flemish glaas; but no body ever supposed that the secret was lost so early as the reign of James I. and that it has not perished since will be evident from the following series, reaching to the present hour.\n\n\"The portraits in the windows of the library at All Souls, Oxford. In the chapel at Queen's College there are twelve windows dated 1518. P.C. a cipher on the painted glaas in the chapel at Warwick, 1574. The windows at Wadham's College; the drawing pretty good, and the colours fine, by Bernard Van Linge, 1622. In the chapel at Lincoln's Inn, a window, with the name Bernard, 1623. This was probably the preceding Van Linge. In the church of St Leonard, Shoreditch, two windows by Baptista Sutton, 1634. The windows in the chapel at University College, Hen. Giles pinxit, 1687. At Christ Church, Isaac Oliver, aged 84, 1700. Window in Merton Chapel, William Price 1700. Windows at Queen's New College, and Maunlin, by William Price, the son, now living, whose colours are fine, whose drawing is good, and whole taste in ornaments and mosaic is far superior to any of his predecessors; is equal to the antique, to the good Italian masters, and only surpassed by his own singular modelly.\n\n\"It may not be unwelcome to the curious reader to see some anecdotes of the revival of taste for painted glaas in England. Price, as we have said, was the only painter in that style for many years in England. Afterwards one Rowell, a plumber at Reading did some things, particularly for the late Henry earl of Pembroke; but Rowell's colours soon vanished. At last he found out a very durable and beautiful red; but he died in a year or two, and the secret with him. A man at Birmingham began the same art in 1756 or 1757, and fitted up a window for Lord Lyttleton, in the church of Hagley; but soon broke. A little after him, one Peckitt at York began the same business, and has made good proficiency. A few lovers of that art collected some dispersed panes from ancient buildings, particularly the late Lord Cobham, who erected a Gothic temple at Stowe, and filled it with arms of the old nobility, &c. About the year 1753, one Asciotti, an Italian, who had married a Flemish woman, brought a parcel of painted glaas from Flanders, and sold it for a few guineas to the Honourable Mr Bateman, of Old Windsor. Upon that I sent Asciotti again to Flanders, who brought me 450 pieces, for which, including the expense of his journey, I paid him thirty-six guineas. His wife made more journeys for the same pur-\npoise; and sold her cargoes to one Palmer, a glazier in St Martin's lane, who immediately raised the price to one, two, or five guineas for a single piece, and fitted up entire windows with them, and with mosaics of plain glass of different colours. In 1761, Paterson, an auctioneer at Essex house in the Strand, exhibited the two first auctions of painted glass, imported in like manner from Flanders. All this manufacture consisted in rounds of Scripture stories, stained in black and yellow, or in small figures of black and white; birds and flowers in colours, and Flemish coats of arms.\n\nThe colours used in painting or staining of glass are very different from those used in painting either in water or oil colours.\n\nFor black, take scales of iron, one ounce; scales of copper, one ounce; jet, half an ounce; reduce them to powder, and mix them. For blue, take powder of blue, one pound; sal nitre, half a pound; mix them and grind them well together. For carnation, take red chalk, eight ounces; iron scales, and litharge of silver, of each two ounces; gum arabic, half an ounce; dissolve in water; grind all together for half an hour as stiff as you can; then put it in a glass and stir it well, and let it stand to settle 14 days. For green, take red lead one pound; scales of copper, one pound; and flint, five pounds; divide them into three parts; and add to them as much sal nitre; put them into a crucible, and melt them with a strong fire; and when it is cold, powder it, and grind it on a porphyry. For gold colour, take silver, an ounce; antimony, half an ounce; melt them in a crucible; then pound the mass to powder, and grind it on a copper plate; add to it yellow ochre, or brick dust calcined again, 15 ounces; and grind them well together with water. For purple, take minium, one pound; brown stone, one pound; white flint, five pounds; divide them into three parts, and add to them as much sal nitre as one of the parts; calcine, melt, and grind it as you did the green. For red, take jet, four ounces; litharge of silver, two ounces; red chalk, one ounce; powder them fine, and mix them. For white, take jet, two parts; white flint, ground on a glass very fine, one part; mix them. For yellow, take Spanish brown, ten parts; leaf silver, one part; antimony, half a part; put all into a crucible, and calcine them well.\n\nIn the windows of ancient churches, &c., there are to be seen the most beautiful and vivid colours imaginable, which far exceed any of those used by the moderns, not so much because the secret of making those colours is entirely lost, as that the moderns will not go to the charge of them, nor be at the necessary pains, by reason that this sort of painting is not now so much in esteem as formerly. Those beautiful works which were made in the glass houses were of two kinds.\n\nIn some, the colour was diffused through the whole substance of the glass. In others, which were the more common, the colour was only on one side, scarce penetrating within the substance above one third of a line; though this was more or less according to the nature of the colour, the yellow being always found to enter the deepest. These last, though not so strong and beautiful as the former, were of more advantage to the workmen, by reason that on the same glass, though already coloured, they could show other kinds of colours where there was occasion to embroider draperies, enrich them with foliages, or represent other ornaments of gold, silver, &c.\n\nIn order to this, they made use of emery, grinding or wearing down the surface of the glass till such time as they were got through the colour to the clear glass. This done, they applied the proper colours on the other side of the glass. By these means, the new colours were hindered from running and mixing with the former, when they exposed the glasses to the fire, as will appear hereafter.\n\nWhen indeed the ornaments were to appear white, the glass was only bared of its colour with entry, without tinging the place with any colour at all; and this was the manner by which they wrought their light and heightenings on all kinds of colour.\n\nThe first thing to be done, in order to paint or thin glass, in the modern way, is to design, and even colour, the whole subject on paper. Then they choose such pieces of glass as are clear, even, and smooth, and proper to receive the several parts; and proceed to distribute the design itself, or papers it is drawn on, into pieces suitable to those of the glass; always taking care that the glasses may join in the contours of the figures and the folds of the draperies; that the carnations, and other finer parts, may not be impaired by the lead with which the pieces are to be joined together. The distribution being made, they mark all the glasses as well as papers, that they may be known again; which done, applying every part of the design upon the glass intended for it, they copy or transfer the design upon this glass with the black colour diluted in gum water, by tracing and following all the lines and strokes as they appear through the glass with the point of a pencil.\n\nWhen these strokes are well dried, which will happen in about two days, the work being only in black and white, they give a slight wash over with urine, gum arabic, and a little black; and repeat it several times, according as the shades are desired to be heightened; with this precaution, never to apply a new wash till the former is sufficiently dried.\n\nThis done, the lights and risings are given by rubbing off the colour in their respective places with a wooden point, or the handle of the pencil.\n\nAs to the other colours above mentioned, they are used with gum water, much as in painting in miniature; taking care to apply them lightly, for fear of effacing the outlines of the design; or even, for the greater security, to apply them on the other side; especially yellow, which is very pernicious to the other colours, by blending therewith. And here too, as in pieces of black and white, particular regard must always be had not to lay colour on colour, or lay on a new lay, till such time as the former are well dried.\n\nIt may be added that the yellow is the only colour that penetrates through the glass, and incorporates therewith by the fire; the rest, and particularly the blue, which is very difficult to use, remaining on the surface, or at least entering very little. When the painting of all the pieces is finished, they are carried to the furnace or oven to anneal or bake the colours.\n\nThe furnace here used is small, built of brick, from 18 to 30 inches square. At six inches from the bottom is an aperture to put in the fuel and maintain the fire.\nfire. Over this aperture is a grate made of three square bars of iron, which traverse the furnace, and divide it into two parts. Two inches above this partition is another little aperture, through which they take out pieces to examine how the coction goes forward. On the grate is placed a square earthen pan, fix or seven inches deep, and five or six inches less every way than the perimeter of the furnace. On the other side hereof is a little aperture, through which to make trials, placed directly opposite to that of the furnaces destined for the same end. In this pan are the pieces of glass to be placed in the following manner: First, The bottom of the pan is covered with three strata or layers of quicklime pulverized; those strata being separated by two others of old broken glass, the design whereof is to secure the painted glass from the too intense heat of the fire. This done, the glasses are laid horizontally on the last or uppermost layer of lime.\n\nThe first row of glasses they cover over with a layer of the same powder an inch deep; and over this they lay another range of glasses, and thus alternately till the pan is quite full; taking care that the whole heap always end with a layer of the lime powder.\n\nThe pan being thus prepared, they cover up the furnace with tiles, on a square table of earthen ware, closely luted all round; only leaving five little apertures, one at each corner, and another in the middle, to serve as chimneys. Things thus disposed, there remains nothing but to give the fire to the work. The fire for the two first hours must be very moderate, and must be increased in proportion as the coction advances, for the space of ten or twelve hours; in which time it is usually completed. At last the fire, which at first was charcoal, is to be of dry wood, so that the flame covers the whole pan, and even issues out at the chimneys.\n\nDuring the last hours, they make essays, from time to time, by taking out pieces laid for the purpose through the little aperture of the furnace and pan, to see whether the yellow be perfect, and the other colours in good order. When the annealing is thought sufficient, they proceed with great haste to extinguish the fire, which otherwise would soon burn the colours, and break the glasses.\n\nGlass Balls, which are circular, or otherwise shaped hollow vessels of glass, may be coloured within, so as to imitate the semipellucid gems. The method of doing it is this: make a strong solution of ichthyocolla, or fishglasses, in common water, by boiling; pour a quantity of this while warm into the hollow of a white glass vessel; shake it thoroughly about, that all the sides may be wetted, and then pour off the rest of the moisture. Immediately after this, throw in red lead, shake it and turn it about, throw it into many places with a tube, and the moisture will make it stick and run in waves and pretty figures. Then throw in some of the painters blue smalt, and make it run in waves in the ball as the red lead; then do the same with verdigris, next with orpiment, then with red lake, all well ground; always casting in the colours in different places, and turning the glass, that the moisture within may run them into the waves. Then take fine plaster of Paris, and put a quantity of it into the ball; shake it all nimbly about; this will everywhere stick firmly to the glass, and give it a strong inner coat, keeping all the colours on very fairly and strongly. These are set on frames of carved wood, and much esteemed as ornaments in many places.\n\nGlass Drops. See Rupert's Drops.\n\nEngraving on Glass. Professor Beckmann has proved, that so early as the year 1670 the art of etching upon glass was discovered by Henry Schwanhard, son of George Schwanhard, who was a celebrated glass-cutter, patronized by the emperor Ferdinand III., about the middle of the last century. At the time of his death, 1667, the father practised his art at Prague and Ratibon. Whether the son followed the same business at the same towns, or removed to Nuremberg, is not very evident; but in the year above mentioned, some aqua regia (nitro-muriatic acid) having accidentally fallen on his spectacles, he was surprised to find the glass corroded by it, and become quite soft. He thus, it is said, found himself in possession of a liquid by which he could etch writing and figures upon plates of glass.\n\nBut it is probable, as Beckmann seems to think, that he had discovered the fluoric acid itself; for in the year 1725 there appeared in a periodical work the following receipt for making a powerful acid, by which figures of every kind can be etched upon glass.\n\n\"When the spiritus nitri per distillationem has palled into the recipient, ply it with a strong fire, and when well dephlegmated, pour it, as it corrodes ordinary glass, into a Weldenburg flask. Then throw into it a pulverized green Bohemian emerald, otherwise called heliophorus (which, when reduced to powder, and heated, emits in the dark a green light), and place it in warm sand for 24 hours. Take a piece of glass well cleaned, and freed from all grease by means of a ley; put a border of wax round it, about an inch in height, and cover it all over with the above acid. The longer you let it stand so much the better; and at the end of some time the glass will be corroded, and the figures which have been traced out with sulphur and varnish will appear as if raised above the pane of glass.\"\n\nThat the Bohemian emerald or heliophorus mentioned in this receipt is green sparry fluor, cannot, says the professor, be doubted; and he seems to have as little doubt of the receipt itself having palled from Schwanhard and his scholars to the periodical work of 1725, from which it was inserted in the \"Ekonometrische Encyclopedic of Krunitz.\" This supposition certainly acquires a considerable degree of probability from the similarity of Schwanhard's method of etching to that which is here recommended, and which is so different from what is now followed. At present, the glass is covered with a varnish either of fishglass dissolved in water, or of turpentine oil mixed with a little white lead, through which the figures to be etched are traced as on copper; but Schwanhard, when he had drawn his figures, covered them with varnish, and then by his liquid corroded the glass around them. His figures, therefore, when the varnish was removed, remained smooth and clear, appearing raised from a dim or dark ground; and M. Beckmann, who persuaded some ingenious artists to make trial of this ancient method of etching, declares, that such figures have a much better effect than those which are cut into the glass.\n\nFoliating of Glass. See Foliating and Looking-glass.\n\nGilding\nGlass\n\nGilding of Glass. See Gilding.\n\nImpressions of antique Gems taken in Glass. See Gems.\n\nGlass of Lead, a glass made with the addition of a large quantity of lead, of great use in the art of making counterfeit gems. The method of making it is this: Put a large quantity of lead into a potter's kiln, and keep it in a state of fusion with a moderate fire, till it is calcined to a gray loofe powder; then spread it in the kiln, and give it a greater heat, continually stirring it to keep it from running into lumps; continue this several hours, till the powder become of a fair yellow; then take it out, and sift it fine: this is called calcined lead. Take of this calcined lead 15 pounds, and crystalline or other frit 12 pounds; mix these as well as possible together; put them into a pot, and set them in the furnace for ten hours; then cast the whole, which will be now perfectly melted, into water; separate the loofe lead from it, and return the metal into the pot; and after standing in fusion 12 hours more, it will be fit to work. It is very tender and brittle, and must be worked with great care, taking it slowly out of the pot, and continually wetting the marble it is wrought upon.\n\nIt is well known that ceruse or white lead, minium, litharge, and all the other preparations and calces of lead, are easily fused by a moderate fire, and formed into a transparent glass of a deep yellow colour. But this glass is so penetrating and powerful a flux, that it is necessary to give it a greater consistence, in order to render it fit for use. With this view, two parts of calx of lead, e.g. minium, and one part of sand or powdered flints, may be put into a crucible of refractory clay, and baked into a compact body. Let this crucible, well closed with a luted lid, be placed in a melting furnace, and gradually heated for an hour or an hour and a half; and afterwards let the heat be increased so as to obtain a complete fusion, and continued in that state for the same time: let the crucible remain to cool in the furnace; and when it is broken a very transparent yellow coloured glass will be found in it. Some add nitre and common salt to the above mixture, because these salts promote the fusion and the more equal distribution of the sand. This glass of lead has a considerable specific gravity, and its lowest part is always the heaviest. It is an important flux in the affays of ores to facilitate their scoriafication.\n\nGlass of lead is capable of all the colours of the gems in very great perfection. The methods of giving them are these: for green, take pulverine frit 20 pounds, lead calcined 16 pounds; sift both the powders very fine; then melt them into a glass, separating the unmixed lead, by plunging the mass in water; after this return it into the pot, and add bras thrice calcined six ounces, and one pennyweight of crocus martis made with vinegar; put this in at six different times, always carefully mixing it together, and take a proof of it; when the colour is right, let it stand eight hours, and then work it. If instead of the calcined bras the same quantity of the caput mortuum of the vitriolium veneris be used, the green is yet much finer.\n\nFor topaz colour, take crystal frit 15 pounds, calcined lead 12 pounds; mix them well together, by lifting the powders through a fine sieve; then let them in a furnace not too hot, and separate the superfluous unmixed lead, by casting the whole into water; repeat this twice; then add half gold yellow glass, and let them incorporate and purify, and they will be of the true and exact colour of the oriental topazes.\n\nFor sea green, take crystal frit 16 pounds, calcined lead 10 pounds; mix and sift them together, and set them in a pot in a furnace; in 12 hours the whole will be melted; then cast it into water, and separate it from the loofe lead; put them into the furnace again for eight hours; then separate the loofe lead by washing a second time, and return it to the pot for eight hours more.\n\nMuffle Glass. See Mica, Mineralogy Index.\n\nPainting on Glass by means of Prints. See Back-painting.\n\nGlass Porcelain, the name given by many to a modern invention of imitating the china ware with glass. The method given by M. Reaumur, who was the first that carried the attempt to any degree of perfection, is shortly this: The glass vessels to be converted into porcelain are to be put into a large earthen vessel, such as the common fine earthen dines are baked in, or into sufficiently large crucibles; the vessels are to be filled with a mixture of fine white sand, and of fine gypsum or plaster stone burnt into what is called platter of Paris, and all the interstices are to be filled up with the same powder, so that the glass vessels may nowhere touch either one another, or the sides of the vessel they are baked in. The vessel is to be then covered down and luted, and the fire does the rest of the work; for this is only to be put into a common potter's furnace, and when it has stood there the usual time of the baking the other vessels, it is to be taken out, and the whole contents will be found no longer glass, but converted into a white opaque substance, which is a very elegant porcelain, and has almost the properties of that of China.\n\nThe powder which has served once will do again as well as fresh, and that for a great many times: nay, it seems, ever so often. The cause of this transformation, says Macquer, is probably that the vitriolic acid of the gypsum quits its basis of calcareous earth, and unites with the alkaline salt and saline earth of the glass, with which it forms a kind of salt, different from the calcareous selenite, by the interpolation of which matter the glass acquires the qualities of porcelain.\n\nGlass Pots, the vessels in the glass trade used for melting the glass. Those for the white glass works are made of a tobacco pipe clay, brought from the Isle of Wight, which is first well washed, then calcined, and afterwards ground to a fine powder in a mill; which being mixed with water, is then trod with the bare feet till it is of a proper consistence to mould with the hands into the proper shape of the vessels. When these are thus made, they are afterwards annealed over the furnace. Those for the green glass work are made of the nonfuch, and another sort of clay from Staffordshire; they make these so large as to hold three or four hundred weight of metal. And besides these, they have a small sort called piling pots, which they set upon the larger, and which contain a finer and more nice metal fit for the nicest works.\n\nThe clay that is used for this purpose should be of the purest and most refractory kind, and well cleansed from all sandy, ferruginous, and pyritous matters; and\nto this it will be proper to add ground crucibles, white sand, calcined flints duly levigated, or a certain proportion of the same clay baked, and pounded not very finely. The quantity of baked clay that ought to be mixed with the crude clay, to prevent the pots from cracking when dried, or exposed to a great heat, is not absolutely determined, but depends on the quality of the crude clay, which is more or less fat. M. D'Antic, in a memoir on this subject, proposes the following method of ascertaining it: The burnt and crude clay, being mixed in different proportions, should be formed into cakes, one inch thick, and four inches long and wide. Let these cakes be slowly dried, and exposed to a violent heat, till they become as hard and as much contracted as possible, and in this state be examined; and the cake, he says, which has suffered a diminution of its bulk equal only to an eighteenth part, is made of the best proportions. He observes, in general, that most clays require that the proportion of the burnt should be to the fresh as four to five.\n\nTin Glass, the same with Bismuth. See Bismuth, Chemistry Index.\n\nGlasses are distinguished, with regard to their form, use, &c., into various kinds, as drinking glasses, optical glasses, looking glasses, burning glasses, &c.\n\nDrinking Glasses, are simple vessels of common glass or crystal, usually made in form of an inverted cone.\n\nEach glass consists of three parts, viz. the bowl, the bottom, and the foot; which are all wrought or blown separately.\n\nNothing can be more dexterous and expeditious than the manner of blowing these parts: two of them opened, and all three joined together. An idea is only to be had thereof, by seeing it actually done. For the method of gilding the edges of drinking glasses, see Gilding on Enamel and Glass.\n\nOptical Glasses. See Optics.\n\nThe improvements hitherto made in telescopes by means of combining lenses made of different kinds of glass, though very great, are yet by no means adequate to the expectations that might reasonably be formed if opticians could fall on any method of obtaining pieces of glass sufficiently large for pursuing the advantages of Mr Dollond's discovery. Unfortunately, however, though the board of longitude have offered a considerable reward for bringing this art to the requisite perfection, no attempt of any consequence has hitherto been made. Mr Keir is of opinion, that the accomplishment of this is by no means an easy task; as it requires not only a competent knowledge of the properties of glass fitted for the purpose (the faults not being evident to common inspection), but a considerable degree of chemical knowledge is also necessary in order to invent a composition by which these faults may be avoided; and lastly, a kind of dexterity in the execution of the work, which can only be acquired by practice. Our author, however, thinks, that if the subject were more generally understood, and the difficulties more fully pointed out, for which purpose he makes the following remarks, the end may be more easily accomplished.\n\n1. The rays of light passing through a glass lens or prism, or through any other medium of unequal thicknesses, are refracted; but not in an equal manner, the blue, violet, &c., being more refracted than the red.\n\n2. Hence it happens, that the rays of light, when refracted by a common lens, do not all unite in one focus, but in reality form as many different foci as there are colours; and hence arise the prismatic colours, or irides, which appear towards the borders of the image formed by the common convex lens, and which render the vision extremely indistinct.\n\n3. The indistinctness of vision produced by this cause, which is sensible in telescopes of a small aperture, increases in so great a proportion, viz. as the cubes of the diameters, that it seemed impossible to increase the power of dioptric telescopes greatly, without extending them to a very inconvenient length, unless this confusion of colours could be corrected.\n\n4. It was known that different transparent bodies possessed different degrees of refractive power; and until Mr Dollond discovered the contrary, it was supposed, that the refractions of the coloured rays were always in a determined ratio to one another. On this supposition it seemed impossible to correct the faults of refracting telescopes: for it was supposed, that if the dispersion of light produced by a convex lens were counteracted by another lens or medium of a concave form, the refraction would be totally destroyed; and this indeed would be the case, if the two mediums were made of the same matter; and from some experiments made by Sir Isaac Newton, this was supposed to be actually the case in all substances whatever.\n\n5. From considering that the eyes of animals are formed of mediums of different colours, it occurred first to Mr David Gregory, the celebrated professor of astronomy at Oxford, and then to Mr Euler, that, by a combination of mediums which had different refractive powers, it might be possible to remedy the imperfections of dioptric telescopes. It does not, however, appear, that either of these gentlemen understood the true principle on which these phenomena depend. Mr Euler executed his idea by forming a compound object lens from two glass lenses with water interposed, but his attempt was not attended with success. Mr Dollond, however, was led by some arguments adduced by Mr Klingenstierna of Sweden, to repeat one of Sir Isaac Newton's experiments, and which had induced even that great philosopher himself to suppose that the improvement afterwards executed by Mr Dollond was impossible. This experiment was made by Sir Isaac Newton, by placing a glass prism within a prismatic vessel filled with water, in such a manner that the rays of light which were refracted by the glass prism should pass through and be refracted in a contrary direction by the water prism. In this manner the refraction of the light was entirely destroyed. But when Mr Dollond repeated the experiment, he found, that contrary to his own expectations, when the angles of the two prisms were so proportioned that they counteracted each other's mean refraction, their colours appeared; and on the other hand, when they were so proportioned that the dispersion of the coloured rays was counteracted, the mean refraction still subsisted; which evidently proved, that the mean refractive and dispersive powers of glass and water were not proportional to one another.\n\n6. To apply this to the proposed improvement, Mr Dollond examined several kinds of glass. Crown glass was found to possess the smallest dispersive power in proportion to its refraction; while flint glass possessed\nthe greatest dispersive power in proportion to its refraction, which was also very great. On comparing these two exactly together, he found, that a wedge of white flint glass whose angle was about 25 degrees, and another of crown glass whose angle was 29 degrees, refracted very nearly alike. He found also, that when the wedges were ground to such angles, the refraction produced by the flint glass was to that produced by the crown glass nearly as two or three; the refracted light was then free from colour. On measuring the general refracting powers of these two glasses, he found, that in flint glass, the fine of incidence of the rays was to the fine of mean refraction as 1 to 1.583; and that in crown glass, the fine of incidence was to the fine of mean refraction as 1 to 1.53.\n\nThe methods of determining the different refractive powers of glasses are given under the article Optics. Here we shall only observe, that two kinds of glasses are necessary for the construction of achromatic teleopes; one of which shall possess as small, and the other as great, dispersive powers, relative to their mean refracting powers, as can be produced. The difference of glasses in this respect depends on the quality of the ingredients employed in their composition. Crown glass, which is composed of sand melted by means of the ashes of sea weeds, barilla, or kelp, both which fluxes are known to confit of vegetable earth, alkali, and neutral salt, is found to give the smallest dispersive power. Plate glass, which consists of sand melted by means of fixed vegetable alkali, with little or no vegetable earth, gives a greater dispersive power; but both these give much less than flint glass, which consists of sand melted by means of minium and fixed alkali. It appears, therefore, that the dispersion of the rays is greatest when minium, or probably other metallic calcines, are made use of; and that alkalies give a greater power of dispersion than vegetable or other earths. Mr Zieher of Peterburgh, however, informs us, that he has made a kind of glass, much superior in this respect to flint glass; but it does not as yet appear whether it be more fit for optical purposes than that commonly made use of. There seems no difficulty in augmenting the dispersive power, as that is found to depend on the quantity of minium or other flux: but thus we unfortunately increase also the capital fault to which flint glass and all compositions of that kind are subject; namely, the being subject to veins or small threads running through it. By these, even when so small as to be imperceptible to the naked eye, the rays which fall on them are diverted from their proper direction, and thereby render the images confused. This is owing to the greater density of the veins, as appears by their image being received on white paper, when the glass is held between the paper and the sun or a candle at a proper distance. The rays of light being then made to converge by the superior density of the veins, their images will appear as bright lines bordered with obscure edges on the paper. Flint glass is so much subject to this kind of imperfection, that it is with difficulty the opticians can pick out pieces of the size commonly used from a large quantity of the glass. It is farther to be regretted, that the minium which produces the greatest dispersive power, is likewise the very substance which renders flint glass much more subject to these imperfections than any other. The reason is, that the sand and earthly matters mix uniformly in fusion; and having not only a considerable degree of affinity towards each other, but also being not much different from each other, they are not apt to separate. On the other hand, when such a heavy substance as minium is added to these earthly substances, though it has a pretty strong tendency to unite with the earthly substances, it has none with the fixed alkali, which is another ingredient in this glass. Hence some parts of the glass will contain more metallic matter than the rest; particularly that near the bottom of the pot, which is so full of large veins as to be applied only to the making of wares of little value. The veins in this case are formed by the descent of the minium at the bottom, which in its passage forms threads or veins by dragging other parts of the glass along with them.\n\nThe correction of this fault appears therefore to be very difficult. M. Macquer informs us, that he had in vain tried to remove it by very long fusion and a fierce fire; which indeed others have found by experience not to correct, but to augment the evil. Mr Keir is of opinion that some new composition must be discovered, which, along with a sufficient dispersive power, should possess a greater uniformity of texture; but he is likewise of opinion, that scarce any alteration in this respect could be made without injuring the colour of the glass. For optical purposes, however, our author does not think that an alteration in the colour of the ingredients would be very detrimental. \"I am convinced (says he), that glasses finely tinged with colour, might transmit as much or more light than the best flint glass. For the colourless appearance of flint glass is an optical deception. The minium gives it a considerable tinge of yellow, and the alkali inclines it to a bluish cast, besides the colour arising from a greater or less impurity of the materials; so that the glass would actually be very finely coloured, unless by the addition of manganese, which is known to give a purplish red. Thus the other tinges are counteracted, but not effaced or destroyed as has been frequently imagined. By the mixture of the three principal colours, red, yellow, and blue, more or less exactly counterpoised, a certain dark shade is introduced, in which, as not any one of the colours predominates, no coloured tinge appears, but the effect is merely a diminution of the transparency of the glass, which, however, is too small for ordinary observation.\" Mr Keir is even of opinion, that a certain tinge of yellow would in many cases be of service, because it would exclude some of the blue rays, which being most refrangible are most injurious to the distinctness of vision.\n\nVery considerable difficulties, however, must arise in attempting improvements of this kind; as the experiments must all be tried on a very large scale. This is not only attended with a very heavy expense in itself on account of the quantity of materials employed, but from the heavy duty of excise which is rigorously exacted whether the glass be manufactured into saleable articles or not. It is observed in the manufacture of every kind of glass, that the glass in the middle of the area or transverse section of a pot is much purer and freer from veins and other imperfections than the part which is near the sides, and that the glass at the bottom is the worst of all. Consequently it is chiefly in large pots, such as are used in manufactures, that there\nis a probability of success. Very fine and beautiful glasfs, called past\u00e9 and artificial gems, may be made in smaller pots or crucibles; but this glass is suffered to cool and subside in the vessel, by which means the contiguous parts are more uniform in their texture than can be expected in a piece of glass taken out of the pot while hot in the common way, by making it adhere and twist round an iron rod or pipe. But although the method of allowing the glass to cool in the pots is very advantageous for the purposes of the jeweller, it is by no means applicable to those of the optician. Glass cooled in that gradual manner, suffers some degree of crystallization or peculiar arrangement of its parts; the consequence of which is, that the rays of light undergo certain refractions independent on the form of the glass, which greatly affect the distinctness of vision in telescopes.\n\nMusical Glasses.

The king of the West Saxons erected a church here, which he, and the succeeding kings enriched to such a degree, that the abbot lived like a prince, had the title of lord, and sat among the barons in parliament; and no person, not even a bishop or prince, durst set foot on the isle of Avalon, in which the abbey stands, without his leave. The revenue of the abbey was above 40,000l. per ann. besides seven parks well stocked with deer. The last abbot (Richard Whiting), who had 100 monks, and 300 domestics, was hanged in his pontificals, with two of his monks, on the Tor, a high hill in the neighbourhood, for refusing to take the oath of supremacy to Henry VIII. and surrender his abbey when required. Edgar and many other Saxon kings were buried here; and, as some will have it, Arthur the British king. Every cottage here has part of a pillar, a door, or a window of this fabric; of which there still remain the ruins of the choir, the middle tower and the chapels. The walls that remain of the abbey are overgrown with ivy, and the aspect of the whole is both melancholy and venerable. Here are two parish churches. This town, while under the protection of its abbots, was a parliamentary borough, but it lost that and its privilege of a corporation; the latter of which was, however, restored by Queen Anne, who granted it a new charter for a mayor and burgesses. The only manufactory here is stocking. At a little distance from the old church, and facing the monk's churchyard, are two remarkable pyramids, with inscriptions, that are in characters unintelligible, and an image in bishop's vestments. The story of the Glastonbury thorn, and of its budding upon Christmas day, is well known. This is not correctly true; but if the winter is mild, it always buds about the latter end of December, but later if the weather is severe.","sp":433,"ep":433},{"h":"GLATZ","t":"a strong town of Bohemia, capital of a county of the same name, seated on the river Neisse; and well fortified with a castle.

See Glass of Lead.\n\nThe workers of common earthen ware, however, are not...\nnot at the trouble of thus previously making a pure glaas of lead. Their usual composition for glazing their ware is formed of white sand 40 pounds, of red lead 20 pounds, of pearl ashes 20 pounds, and of common salt 12 pounds. Powder the lead by grinding it, and then add it to the other ingredients and grind them together; after which calcine them for some time with a moderate heat, and when the mixture is cold, pound it to powder; and when wanted for use temper it with water. The proportion of these ingredients may be occasionally varied. The ware after being turned on the wheel and dried in the open air, is covered over with the above composition by means of a brush; and when set in the furnace the violent heat soon reduces it to a perfect glaas, covering the whole internal and external surface of the vessel.\n\nWe may observe, however, in general, that lead ought to be excluded from the composition of glazings, and other fluxes substituted in its stead. A transparent glazing may be prepared without lead, by calcining 40 pounds of white sand, 25 pounds of pearl ashes, and 15 pounds of common salt; and proceeding as before; and a more perfect transparent glazing may be made of sand 40 pounds, of wood ashes perfectly burnt 50 pounds, of pearl ashes 10 pounds, and of common salt 12 pounds. The following receipts are taken for the most part from Kunckel, who says, that they are the true glazings used at Delft and other Dutch manufactories.\n\nBlack is made of eight parts of red lead, iron filings three, copper ashes three, and zaffer two measures. This when melted will make a brown black; and if you want it blacker, add more zaffer to it.\n\nBlue is thus prepared: Take lead ashes or red lead one pound, clear sand or powdered flints two pounds, common salt two pounds, white calcined tartar one pound, Venice or other glaas half a pound, zaffer half a pound; mix them well together and melt them for several times, quenching them always in cold water. If you would have it fine and good, it will be proper to put the mixture into a glaas furnace for a day or two.\n\nAnother blue glazing may be formed of one pound of tartar, a quarter of a pound of red lead, half an ounce of zaffer, and a quarter of a pound of powdered flints, which are to be fused and managed as in the last receipt. Or, take two pounds of calcined lead and tin, add five pounds of common salt, five pounds of powdered flints, and of zaffer, tartar, and Venetian glaas, each one pound. Calcine and fuse the mixture as before. Or, again, take of red lead one part, of sand three parts, and of zaffer one part. For a violent blue glazing, take four ounces of tartar, two ounces of red lead, five ounces of powdered flints, and half a drachm of manganese.\n\nBrown is made of red lead and flints of each 14 parts, and of manganese two parts fused; or of red lead 12 parts, and manganese one part fused. A brown glazing, to be laid on a white ground, may be made of manganese two parts, and of red lead and white glaas of each one part, twice fused.\n\nFleeb coloured is made of 12 parts of lead ashes, and one of white glaas.\n\nGold coloured. Take of litharge three parts, of sand of calcined flint one part; pound and mix these very well together, then run them into a yellow glaas with a strong fire. Pound this glaas, and grind it into a subtile powder, which moisten with a well saturated solution of silver; make it into a paste, which put into a crucible, and cover it with a cover. Give at first a gentle degree of fire; then increase it, and continue it till you have a glaas, which will be green. Pound this glaas again, and grind it to a fine powder; moisten this powder with some beer, so that by means of a hair pencil you may apply it upon the vessels or any piece of earthen ware. The vessels that are painted or covered over with this glazing must be first well heated, then put under a muffle; and as soon as the glaas runs, you must smoke them, by holding them over burning vegetables, and take out the vessels. Mr Heinsius of Peterburgh, who sent this receipt to the Royal Society, uses the words afflare debet fumum, which is rendered smoke them, in the Transactions. Phil. Transf. No 465, \u00a7 6.\n\nKunckel gives several preparations for a gold coloured yellow glazing. This may be produced by fusing a mixture of three parts of red lead, two parts of antimony, and one part of saffron of Mars; by again melting the powdered mass, and repeating the operation four times, or by fusing four or five times a composition of red lead and antimony of each an ounce, and of scales of iron half an ounce; or by calcining and fusing together eight parts of red lead, fix parts of flints, one part of yellow ochre, one part of antimony, and one part of white glaas. A transparent gold coloured glazing may be obtained by twice fusing red lead and white flints, of each 12 parts, and of filings of iron one part.\n\nGreen may be prepared of eight parts of litharge or red lead, eight parts of Venice glaas, four parts of brafs dust or filings of copper; or of ten parts of litharge, twelve of flint or pebble, and one of aes ystium or copper ashes.\u2014A fine green glazing may be produced by fusing one part of the Bohemian granate, one part of filings of copper, one part of red lead, and one part of Venetian glaas; or by fusing one part of white glaas, the same quantity of red lead, and also of filings of copper; powdering the mass, and adding one part of Bohemian granate to two parts of this powder. A fine green may be obtained by mixing and grinding together any of the yellow glazings with equal quantities of the blue glazings; and all the shades and teints of green will be had by varying the proportion of the one to the other, and by the choice of the kind of yellow and blue.\n\nSea green is made of five pounds of lead ashes, one pound of tin ashes, three pounds of flint, three quarters of a pound of salt, half a pound of tartar, and half a pound of copper dust.\n\nIron colour is prepared of 15 parts of lead ashes or red lead, 15 of white sand or flints, and five of calcined copper. This mixture is to be calcined and fused.\n\nLiver colour is prepared of 12 parts of litharge, eight of salt, six of pebble or flint, and one of manganese.\n\nPurple brown consists of lead ashes 15 parts, clean sand or powdered flints 18 parts, manganese one part, and white glaas 15 measures, to which some add one measure of zaffer.\nGlazing. Red is made of antimony three pounds, litharge or red lead three, and rust of iron one: grind them to a fine powder. Or, take two pounds of antimony, three of red lead, and one of calcined saffron of Mars, and proceed as before.\n\nWhite. The white glazing for common ware is made of 40 pounds of clear sand, 75 pounds of litharge or lead ashes, 26 of pot ashes, and ten pounds of salt; these are three times melted into a cake, quenching it each time in clear cold water. Or it may be made of 30 pounds of clean sand, 70 of lead ashes, 30 of wood ashes, and 12 of salt.\n\nFor a fine white: Take two pounds of lead and one of tin; calcine them to ashes: of this take two parts, calcined flint, white sand, or broken white glass, one part, and salt one part; mix them well together and melt them into a cake for use. The trouble of calcining the tin and lead may be prevented by procuring them in a proper state.\n\nA very fine white glazing may be obtained by calcining two parts of lead and one part of tin; and taking one part of this mass, and of flints and common salt of each one part, and fusing the mixture.\n\nA white glazing may be also prepared by mixing 100 pounds of mastic, 65 pounds of red lead, 20 pounds of calcined tin or putty, and 10 pounds of common salt, and calcining and powdering the mixture several times.\n\nYellow is prepared of red lead three pounds; calcined antimony and tin, of each two pounds; or, according to some, of equal quantities of the three ingredients. These must be melted into a cake, then ground fine; and this operation repeated several times; or it may be made of 15 parts of lead ore, three parts of litharge of silver, and 15 parts of sand.\u2014A fine yellow glazing may be procured by mixing five parts of red lead, two parts of powdered brick, one part of sand, one part of the white glazings, and two parts of antimony, calcining the mixture and then fusing it. Or, take four parts of white glass, one part of antimony, three parts of red lead, and one part of iron scales, and fuse the mixture; or fuse 16 parts of flints, one part of iron filings, and 24 parts of litharge. A light yellow glazing may be produced with ten parts of red lead, three parts of antimony, and three of glass, and two parts of calcined tin. See Gold colour, above.\u2014A citron yellow is made of six parts of red lead, seven parts of fine red brick dust, and two parts of antimony. This mixture must be calcined day and night for the space of four days, in the ash hole of a glass-house furnace, and at last urged to fusion.\n\nFor the glazing of Delft ware, Porcelain, Stone-ware, &c. see the articles Delft Ware, Porcelain, and Pottery.\n\nThe Romans had a method of glazing their earthen vessels, which in many respects appears to have been superior to ours. The common brown glazing easily scales off, cracks, and in a short time becomes disagreeable to the eye. Besides, it is very easily destroyed by acids; nor can vessels glazed in this manner be even employed to hold water, without part of it oozing through their pores. Lead is also very destructive to the human body; and if acids are unwarily put into vessels glazed with lead, the liquors will receive a very dangerous impregnation from the metal. The Roman glazing, which is yet to be seen upon urns dug up in several places, appears to have been made of some kind of varnish; and Pliny gives us a hint that it was made of bitumen. He tells us that it never lost its beauty, and that at length it became customary to glaze over statues in this manner. As this varnish sunk deep into the substance of the ware, it was not subject to those cracks and flaws which disfigure our vessels; and as it was not liable to be corroded by acids, it could not be subject to any of the accidents which may ensue from the use of vessels glazed with lead.\n\nGlead, or Glade, a name used in the northern parts of the kingdom for the kite.

The name signifies \"the valley of the two lakes.\" In this valley, surrounded by high and almost inaccessible mountains, St Kevin or Cavan, called also St Coemgene, about the middle of the 6th century, founded a monastery, which in a short time from the sanctity of its founder was much resorted to, and at length became a bishoprick and a religious city. St Kevin died 3d June 618, aged 120; and on that day annually numbers of persons flock to the Seven Churches to celebrate the festival of that venerated saint. During the middle ages the city of Glenalagh, called by Hovedon Episcopatus Biflagratus, was held in great esteem, and received several valuable donations and privileges, its episcopal jurisdiction extending to the walls of Dublin.\u2014About the middle of the 12th century, on some account or other, it was much neglected by the clergy; and became, instead of a holy city, a den of thieves, wherefore Cardinal Papiro, in 1214, united it to the see of Dublin, which union was confirmed by King John. The O'Tools, chiefs of\nGlendalagh of Firthal, however, by the affiance of the Pope, continued long after this period to elect bishops and abbots to Glendalagh, though they had neither revenues or authority, beyond the district of Tuathal, which was the western part of the county of Wicklow; in consequence of which the city was suffered to decay, and had become nearly a desert, in 1497, when Dennis White, the last titular bishop, surrendered his right in the cathedral church of St Patrick, Dublin. From the ruins of this ancient city still remaining, it appears to have been a place of consequence, and to have contained seven churches and religious houses; small indeed but built in a neat elegant style, in imitation of the Greek architecture: the cathedral, the walls of which are yet standing, was dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. South of the cathedral stands a small church roofed with stone, nearly entire; and in several parts of the valley are a number of stone crosses, some of which are curiously carved, but without any inscriptions. In the north-west corner of the cemetery belonging to the cathedral stands a round tower, 95 feet high, and 15 in diameter; and in the cemetery of a small church, on the south side of the river, near the great lake, called the Rheaert church, are some tombs, with Irish inscriptions, belonging to the O'Tools. In a perpendicular projecting rock on the south side of the great lake, 30 yards above the surface of the water, is the celebrated bed of St Kevin, hewn out of the rock, exceedingly difficult of access and terrible of prospect. Amongst the ruins have been discovered a number of stones, curiously carved, and containing inscriptions in the Latin, Greek, and Irish languages. As this city was in a valley, surrounded on all sides, except the east, by high, barren, and inaccessible mountains, the artificial roads leading thereto are by no means the least curious part of the remains; the principal is that leading into the county of Kildare through Glendalon. This road for near two miles is yet perfect, composed of stones placed on their edges, making a firm and durable pavement, about 10 feet broad. At a small distance from St Kevin's bed, on the same side of the mountain, are to be seen the ruins of a small stone building called Saint Kevin's cell.\n\nGlenoides, the name of two cavities, or small depressions, in the inferior part of the first vertebra of the neck.\n\nGlimmer, or Glist.

It is an ancient city; and by Antoninus is called Clevum, or Glevum, which Camden thinks was formed from the British Caer-Glew, signifying \"a fair city.\" It was one of the 28 cities built by the Britons before the arrival of the Romans, who made it one of their colonies, and in the eighth century it was esteemed one of the noblest cities in the kingdom. It has suffered considerably by fire at different periods. It stands upon a hill; and from the middle of the city, where the four principal streets meet, there is a descent every way, which makes it not only clean and healthy, but adds to the beauty of the place. Forging of iron seems to have been its manufacture so early as the time of William the Conqueror. King Henry VIII. made it the see of a bishop, with a dean and six prebends. Its castle which was erected in the time of William the Conqueror, is very much decayed; part of it is leased out by the crown; and the rest serves for a prison, one of the best in England. In its cathedral, which is an ancient but magnificent fabric, and has a tower reckoned one\nGlocester, one of the most curious pieces of architecture in England, are the tombs of Robert duke of Normandy, son to William the Conqueror, and of Edward II, and there is a whispering place like to that of St Paul's at London. In the chapter house lies Strongbow who conquered Ireland. There are 12 chapels in it, with the arms and monuments of many great persons. King John made it a borough to be governed by two bailiffs. Henry III, who was crowned here, made it a corporation. By its present charter from Charles I, it is governed by a steward, who is generally a nobleman; a mayor; a recorder; 12 aldermen, out of whom the mayor is chosen; a town clerk; two sheriffs, chosen yearly out of 26 common councilmen; a sword-bearer; and four sergeants-at-mace. Here are 12 incorporated trading companies, whose matters attend the mayor on all public occasions, &c. Besides the cathedral, there are five parish churches in this city; which is likewise well provided with hospitals, particularly an infirmary upon the plan of those at London, Winchester, Bath, &c. Here is a good stone bridge over the river Severn, with a quay, wharf, and customhouse; but most of its bulwarks is engrossed by Bristol. King Edward I held a parliament here in 1272, wherein some good laws were made, now called the Statutes of Glocester; and he erected a gate on the fourth side of the abbey, still called by his name, though almost demolished in the civil wars. King Richard II also held a parliament here; and King Richard III, in consideration of his having (before his accession to the crown) borne the title of Duke of Glocester, added the two adjacent hundreds of Dudston and King's Barton to it, gave it his sword and cap of maintenance, and made it a county of itself by the name of the county of the city of Glocester. But after the Restoration the hundreds were taken away by act of parliament, and the walls pulled down; because the city shut the gates against Charles I when he besieged it in 1643; by which, though the siege was raised by the earl of Essex, it had suffered 20,000 damage, having 241 houses destroyed, which reduced it so much that it has scarce recovered its former size and grandeur. Before that time it had 11 parish churches, but six of them were then demolished. Here are abundance of crofies, and statues of the English kings, some of whom kept their Christmas here; several market houses supported with pillars; and large remains of monasteries, which were once so numerous, that it gave occasion to the monkish proverb, As sure as God is in Glocester. Here is a barley market; and a hall for the assizes, called the Booth Hall. Its chief manufacture is pins. Under the bridge is a water engine to supply the town, and it is served with it also from Robin Hood's well, to which is a fine walk from the city. Camden says, that the famous Roman way, called Ermin Street, which begins at St David's in Pembroke-shire, and reaches to Southampton, passes through this city. Sudmead in the neighbourhood is noted for horse races. Here is a charity school for above 80 children, of whom above 70 are also clothed; and a well endowed blue coat school. The city sends two members to parliament.\n\nGlocester is also the name of two counties and of several towns in America; such as the county of Glocester in New Jersey, bounded on the north by Burlington, on the south by Salem and Cumberland, on the east by the Atlantic ocean, and on the west by the river Delaware. It contains 13,172 inhabitants, besides 191 slaves. Glocester in Virginia is a well cultivated and fruitful county, about 55 miles long and 30 broad, with a population of 13,408 souls, among whom are included 7,663 slaves.","sp":436,"ep":437},{"h":"GLOCESTERSHIRE","t":"a county of England, is bounded on the west by Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, on the north by Worcestershire, on the east by Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, and on the south by Wiltsire, and part of Somersetshire. It is sixty miles in length, twenty-five in breadth, and one hundred and sixty in circumference; containing 1,100,000 acres, 26,760 houses, 162,560 inhabitants, 290 parishes, 140 are impropriations, 1,220 villages, 2 cities, and 28 market towns. It sends only 8 members to parliament, 6 for three towns, viz. Glocester, Tewkesbury, and Cirencester; and two for the county. Its manufactures are woollen cloths of various kinds, men's hats, leather, pens, paper, bar iron, edge tools, nails, wire, tinned plates, bras, &c.; and of the principal articles of commerce of the county, it exports cheese 8,000 tons; bacon, grain, cider, 5,000l. worth; perry, 5th, 4,000l. worth, &c. It lies in the diocese that takes its name from the capital, and in the Oxford circuit. The air of the county is very wholesome, but the face of it is very different in different parts: for the eastern part is hilly, and is called Cotswold; the western woody, and called the Forest of Dean; and the rest is a fruitful valley, through which runs the river Severn. This river is in some places between two and three miles broad; and its course through the country, including its windings, is not less than seventy miles. The tide of flood, called the Boar, rises very high, and is very impetuous. It is remarkable, that the greatest tides are one year at the full moon, and the other at the new; one year the night tides, and the next the day. This river affords a noble conveyance for goods and merchandise of all sorts to and from the county; but it is watered by several others, as the Wye, the Avon, the Ivis, the Leyden, the Frome, the Stroud, and Windrush, besides lesser streams, all abounding with fish, the Severn in particular with salmon, conger eels, and lampreys. The soil is in general very fertile, though pretty much diversified, yielding plenty of corn, pasture, fruit, and wood. In the hilly part of the county, or Cotswold, the air is sharper than in the lowlands; and the soil, though not so fit for grain, produces excellent pasture for sheep; so that of the four hundred thousand that are computed to be kept in the county, the greater part are fed here. Of these sheep the wool is exceeding fine; and hence it is that this shire is so eminent for its manufacture of cloth, of which fifty thousand pieces are said to have been made yearly, before the practice of clandestinely exporting English wool became so common. In the vale, or lower part of the county, through which the Severn passes, the air and soil are very different from those of the Cotswold: for the former is much warmer, and the latter richer, yielding the most luxuriant pastures; in consequence of which, numerous herds of black cattle are kept, and great quantities of that excellent cheese, for which it is so much celebrated, made in it. The remaining part of the county, called the\nGlochidion Forest of Dean, was formerly almost entirely overrun with wood, and extended 20 miles in length, and 10 in breadth. It was then a nest of robbers, especially towards the Severn; but now it contains many towns and villages, consisting chiefly of miners, employed in the coal pits, or in digging for or forging iron ore, with both which the forest abounds. These miners have their particular laws, customs, courts, and judges; and the king, as in all royal forests, has a swain-mote for the preservation of the vert and venison. This forest was anciently, and is still noted for its oaks, which thrive here surprisingly; but as there is a prodigious consumption of wood in the forges, it is continually dwindling away.

The love of renown, or desire of fame and reputation, appears to be one of the principal springs of action in human society. Glory, therefore, is not to be contemned, as some of the ancient philosophers affected to teach; but it imports not to regulate our pursuit after it by the dictates of reason; and if the public approbation will not follow us in that course, we must leave her behind.\u2014We ought to have our judgments well instructed as to what actions are truly glorious; and to remember, that in every important enterprise, as Seneca observes, *Recte facti fecisse merces est; officii fructus, ipsum officium est.* \"The reward of a thing well done, is to have done it; the fruit of a good office, is the office itself.\" Those who by other methods scatter their names into many mouths, show they rather hunt after a great reputation than a good one, and their reward is oftener infamy than fame.\n\nMen generally, and almost instinctively, affix glory only to such actions as have been produced by an innate desire for public good; and we measure it by that degree of influence which any thing done has upon the common happiness.\n\nIf the actions of the hero conduct soonest to glory and with the greatest splendour, and if the victorious general is so great after a signal engagement; it is because the service he has done is for the moment, and for all; and because we think without reflecting, that he has saved our habitations, our wealth, and our children, and every thing that attaches us to life. If the man of science, who in his study has discovered and calculated the motions of the heavenly bodies, who in his alchemics has unveiled some of the secrets of nature, or who has exhibited to mankind a new art, rises to fame with less noise; it is because the utility which he procures is more widely diffused, and is often of less service to the present than to succeeding generations.\n\nThe consequences, therefore, of these two advantages are as opposite as the causes are different; and while the benefits procured by the warrior appear to have no more influence, and while his glory becomes obscure, that of a celebrated writer or inventor still increases, and is more and more enlarged. His works every day bring back his name to that age which uses them, and thus still add to his celebrity and fame.\n\nThis posthumous fame indeed has been decried by some writers. In particular, the author of the Religion of Nature delineated has treated it as highly irrational and absurd. \"In reality (says he) the man is not known ever the more to posterity, because his name is transmitted to them: He doth not live, because his name does. When it is said, Julius Caesar subdued Gaul, conquered Pompey, &c. it is the same thing as to say, the conqueror of Pompey was Julius Caesar; i.e. Caesar and the conqueror of Pompey is the same thing; Caesar is as much known by one designation as by the other. The amount then is only this, that the conqueror of Pompey conquered Pompey; or somebody conquered Pompey; or rather, since Pompey is as little known now as Caesar, somebody conquered somebody. Such a poor business is this boasted immortality! and such is the thing called glory among us! To discerning men this fame is mere air, and what they despise if not thun.\"\n\nBut surely it were to consider too curiously (as Horatio says to Hamlet) to consider thus. For (as the elegant author of Fitzforsborne's Letters observes) although fame with posterity should be, in the strict analysis of it, no other than what is here described, a mere uninteresting proposition, amounting to nothing more than that somebody acted meritoriously; yet it would not necessarily follow, that true philosophy would banish the desire of it from the human breast: for this passion may be (as most certainly it is) wisely implanted in our species, notwithstanding the corresponding object should in reality be very different from what it appears in imagination. Do not many of our most refined and even contemplative pleasures owe their existence to our mistakes? It is but extending some of our senses\nto a higher degree of acuteness than we now possess them, to make the fairest views of nature, or the noblest productions of art, appear horrid and deformed. To see things as they truly and in themselves are, would not always, perhaps, be of advantage to us in the intellectual world, any more than in the natural. But, after all, who shall certainly assure us, that the pleasure of virtuous fame dies with its possessor, and reaches not to a farther scene of existence? There is nothing, it should seem, either absurd or unphilosophical in supposing it possible at least, that the praises of the good and the judicious, the sweetest music to an honest ear in this world, may be echoed back to the mansions of the next; that the poet's description of Fame may be literally true, and though he walks upon earth, she may yet lift her head into heaven.\n\nTo be convinced of the great advantage of cherishing this high regard to posterity, this noble desire of an after-life in the breath of others, one need only look back upon the history of the ancient Greeks and Romans. For what other principle was it which produced that exalted strain of virtue in those days, that may well serve, in too many respects, as a model to thee? Was it not the confentium laus bonorum, the incorrupta vox bene judicantum (as Tully calls it), \"the concurrent approbation of the good, the uncorrupted applause of the wise,\" that animated their most generous pursuits?\n\nIn short, can it be reasonable to extinguish a passion which nature has universally lighted up in the human breast, and which we constantly find to burn with most strength and brightness in the noblest and best formed souls? Accordingly revelation is so far from endeavoring to eradicate the seed which nature has thus deeply planted, that the rather seems, on the contrary, to cherish and forward its growth. To be exalted with honour, and to be had in everlasting remembrance, are in the number of those encouragements which the Jewish dispensation offered to the virtuous; and the person from whom the sacred Author of the Christian system received his birth, is herself represented as rejoicing that all generations should call her blest.","sp":438,"ep":439},{"h":"GLOSS","t":"a comment on the text of any author, to explain his sense more fully and at large, whether in the same language or any other.

Their usual colours are black, bluish, whitish, yellowish, or brown; and in shape they usually approach to a triangular figure.

He very early showed a strong propensity to and genius for poetry; and while at school, he wrote, amongst other pieces, a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, prefixed to the view of that incomparable author's philosophy, published in 4to, in 1728, by his intimate friend Dr Pemberton. But though possessed of talents which were calculated to excel in the literary world, he was content to devote his attention to commerce, and at a proper period commenced a Hamburgh merchant. He still, however, cultivated literature, and associated with those who were eminent in science. One of his earliest friends was Matthew Green, the ingenious but obscure author of some admirable poems, which in 1737, after his death, were collected and published by Mr Glover. In 1737, Mr Glover married Miss Nunn, with whom he received a handsome fortune; and in the same month published Leonidas, a poem in 4to, which in this and the next year passed through three editions. This poem was inscribed to Lord Cobham; and on its first appearance was received by the world with great approbation, though it has since been unaccountably neglected. Lord Lyttelton, in a popular publication called Common Sense, and in a poem addressed to the author, praised it in the warmest terms; and Dr Pemberton published, Observations on Poetry, especially epic, occasioned by the late poem upon Leonidas, 1738, 12mo, merely with a view to point out its beauties. In 1739, Mr Glover published \"London, or the Progress of Commerce,\" 4to; and a ballad entitled, Holier's Ghost. Both these pieces seem to have been written with a view to incite the public to resent the misbehaviour of the Spaniards; and the latter had a very considerable effect. The political divisions at this period raged with great violence, and more especially in the metropolis; and at different meetings of the livery on those occasions, Mr Glover was always called to the chair, and acquitted himself in a very able manner, his conduct being patriotic and his speeches masterly. His talents for public speaking, his knowledge of political affairs, and his information concerning trade and commerce, soon afterwards pointed him out to the merchants of London as a proper person to conduct their application to parliament on the subject of the neglect of their trade. He accepted the office; and in summing up the evidence gave very striking proofs of his oratorical powers. This speech was pronounced Jan. 27. 1742.\n\nIn the year 1744 died the duchess of Marlborough, and by her will left to Mr Glover and Mr Mallet 500l. each, to write the History of the Duke of Marlborough's Life. This bequest, however, never took place. It is supposed that Mr Glover very early renounced his share of it; and Mallet, though he continued to talk of performing the task almost as long as he lived, is now known never to have made the least progress in it. About this period Mr Glover withdrew a good deal from public notice, and lived a life of retirement. He had been unsuccessful in his business; and with a very laudable delicacy had preferred an obscure retreat to popular observation, until his affairs should put on a more prosperous appearance. He had been honoured with the attention of Frederick prince of Wales, who once presented him with a complete set of the classics, elegantly bound; and, on his abstaining himself for some time on account of the embarrassment in his circumstances, sent him, it is said, 500l. The prince died in March 1751; and in May following Mr Glover was once more drawn from his retreat by the importunity of his friends, and stood candidate for the place of chamberlain of London. It unfortunately happened that he did not declare himself until most of the livery had engaged their votes; by which means he lost his election.\n\nIn 1753, Mr Glover produced at Drury Lane his tragedy of Boadicea; which was acted nine nights, in the month of December. It had the advantage of the performance of Mr Garrick, Mr Molesworth, Mrs Cibber, and Mrs Pritchard. From the prologue it seems to have been patronized by the author's friends in the city; and Dr Pemberton wrote a pamphlet to recommend it.\u2014In 1761, Mr Glover published Medea, a tragedy written on the Greek model; but it was not acted until 1767, when it appeared for the first time on the stage at Drury Lane for Mrs Yates's benefit. At the accession of his present majesty, he appears to have surmounted the difficulties of his situation. In the parliament which was then called, he was chosen member for Weymouth, and continued to sit as such until the dissolution of it. He, about this time, interested himself about India affairs, at one of Mr Sullivan's elections; and in a speech introduced the fable of the man, horse, and bear; and drew this conclusion, that, whenever merchants make use of armed forces to maintain their trade, it would end in their destruction.\n\nIn 1770, the poem of Leonidas requiring a new edition, it was republished in two volumes 12mo, corrected throughout, and extended from nine books to twelve. It had also several new characters added, besides placing the old ones in new situations. The improvements made in it were very considerable; but we believe the public curiosity, at this period, was not sufficiently alive to recompense the pains bestowed on this once popular performance. The calamities arising from the wounds given to public credit, in June 1772, by the failure of the bank of Douglas, Heron, and Co., in Scotland, occasioned Mr Glover's taking a very active part in the settling those complicated concerns, and in stopping the distresses then so universally felt. In February 1774, he called the annuants of that banking-house together, at the King's Arms tavern, and laid proposals before them for the security of their demands, with which they were fully satisfied. He also undertook to manage the interests of the merchants and\nand traders of London concerned in the trade to Germany and Holland, and of the dealers in foreign linens, in their application to parliament in May 1774. Both the speeches made on these occasions were published in a pamphlet in that year. In the succeeding year he engaged on behalf of the West India merchants in their application to parliament, and examined the witnesses and summed up the evidence in the same matterly manner he had done on former occasions. For the affluence he afforded the merchants in this business, he was complimented by them with a service of plate, of the value of \u00a3300. The speech which he delivered in the house was in the same year printed. This, we believe, was the last opportunity he had of displaying his oratorical talents in public. Having now arrived at a period of life which demanded a recollection from business, Mr. Glover retired to ease and independence, and wore out the remainder of his days with dignity and with honour. It is probable that he still continued his attention to his mule, as we are informed that, besides an epic poem of considerable length, he has left some tragedies and comedies behind him in manuscript. After experiencing for some time the infirmities of age, he departed this life 25th November 1785; leaving behind him a most estimable character as a man, a citizen, and a writer.\n\nGLOW-WORM.

According to this author, glue was at first principally prepared from the membranous, tendinous, and cartilaginous parts of animals, and after being dried, they were melted into tablets. It is certain, however, that every animal substance containing jelly, may be used in the manufacture of glue; and, according to Du Hamel himself, a strong, but black-colored glue may be obtained from bones and hart-horn, after they are dissolved in Papin's digester. Of the truth of this fact Papin himself likewise attires us, for he prepared a jelly from bones, and even from ivory, by which he glued together some pieces of broken glass; and subsequent experiments made by other chemists, have confirmed his assertion.\n\nTo the information contained on this subject in the works of Papin, Spielman has added many valuable remarks. He not only extracted glue from bones, but also from all the solid parts of animals, by boiling alone, as well as from the teeth of the sea horse, the wild boar, the wood-louse, and the viper.\n\nThe glue manufactured in Europe is of different kinds; but that which is made in England is esteemed the best. Its colour is of a brownish red. The Flanders glue is considered as of an inferior quality to that made in England, while the glue manufactured in France is not so good as either. The reason assigned for this difference of quality is, that bones and sinews are made use of by the Flemish and French in the manufacture of this article, while the English employ skins, which yield a much stronger glue. Dr. Lewis informs us that the English steep and wash the cuttings of the hides in water, then boil them in fresh water till the liquor becomes of a proper consistence, after which they strain it through baskets, allow it to settle, then expose it to further evaporation, and pour it into flat moulds, where it unites. When thoroughly cooled, it is converted into solid cakes, which are cut into pieces, and dried on a kind of net.\n\nGrenet for many years turned his attention to the manufacturing of glue. Having made a number of experiments on every substance formerly employed for this purpose, he found that bones afford the most abundant quantity of glue, and yield it with facility. Having deprived them of the fat they contain, he procured a jelly by simply boiling them, which, when dried, and thus changed into glue, he found superior to that which was prepared in France, and nearly equal to the best glue of commerce.\n\nFrom the experiments of Parmentier, it appears that five pounds of button-makers raspings yielded a pound of excellent glue, not inferior to that which is manufactured in England. The glue which he obtained from the filings of ivory was equally as good, but more highly coloured. The filings of horn yielded none of this substance.\n\nTo obtain glue as colourless as possible, a very small quantity of water should be employed for extracting the jelly, by which means it may be concentrated without long evaporation, as exposure to heat has always a greater or less influence on the colour in proportion to the time. The whiteness and transparency of the Flanders glue are said to originate from an adherence to this plan.\n\nIn their consistence, colour, taste, smell, and solubility, glues are found to differ from each other. Some glues will dissolve by agitation in cold water, while others are only soluble at the point of ebullition. It is generally admitted that the best glue is transparent, of a brownish yellow colour, and having neither taste nor smell. It is perfectly soluble in water, forming a viscous fluid, which, when dry, preserves its tenacity and transparency in every part, and has more solidity, colour, and viscosity, in proportion to the age and strength of the animal from which it is produced.\n\nFor the following account of the manufacture of glue we are indebted, to Mr. John Clemen of Newcastle. \"The improvement (he observes) of any manufacture depends upon its easy access to men of science, and a prudential theorist can never be better employed than in attempting to reduce to regularity or to system the manufactures that may fall under his attention. In conformity to the first principle, I made some notes whilst visiting a glue manufactory a few years ago in Southwark, and those, interwoven with the remarks on that subject of some chemists of the first respectability, I take the liberty of sending.\"\nGlue. sending you: at the same time I must beg of you, or your correspondents, that where it may be corrected in any manner, it may be done, and I shall feel myself obliged by the attention.\n\n\"Glue is an inspissated jelly, made of the parings of hides or horns of any kind, the pelts obtained from furriers, and the hoofs and ears of horses, oxen, calves, sheep, &c., quantities of all which are imported in addition to the home supply, by many of the great manufacturers of this article: these are first digested in lime water, to cleanse them as far as it can from the grease or dirt they may have contracted; they are then steeped in clean water, taking care to stir them well from time to time; afterwards they are laid in a heap, and the superabundant water pressed out; then they are boiled in a large brass caldron with clean water, skimming off the dirt as it rises, and further cleansed by putting in, after the whole is dissolved, a little melted alum or lime finely powdered, which, by their detergent properties, still further purge it: the skimming is continued for some time, when the mass is strained through baskets, and suffered to settle, that the remaining impurities, if any, may subside; it is then poured gently into the kettle again, and further evaporated by boiling a second time, and skimming, until it becomes of a clear but darkish brown colour: when it is thought to be strong enough (which is known either by the length of time a certain quantity of water and materials have boiled, or by its appearance during ebullition), it is poured into frames or moulds of about six feet long, one broad, and two deep, where it hardens gradually as the heat decreases: out of these troughs or receivers it is cut, when cold, by a spade, into square pieces or cakes, and each of these placed within a sort of wooden box, open in three divisions to the back; in this the glue, as yet soft, is taken to a table by women, where they divide it into three pieces (A) with an instrument not unlike a bow, having a brass wire for its string; with this they stand behind the box and cut by its openings, from front to back: the pieces thus cut are taken out into the open air, and dried on a kind of coarse net work, fastened in moveable sheds of about four feet square, which are placed in rows in the gluemaker's field (every one of which contains four or five rows of net work); when perfectly dry and hard, it is fit for sale.\n\n\"That is thought the best glue which swells considerably without melting, by three or four days immersion in cold water, and recovers its former dimensions and properties by drying. Glue that has got froth, or that looks thick and black, may be melted over again and refined, with a sufficient quantity added of fresh to overcome any injury it may have sustained; but it is generally put into the kettle after what is in it has been purged in the second boiling. To know good from bad glue, it is necessary for the purchaser to hold it between his eye and the light, and if it appears of a strong dark brown colour, and free from cloudy or black spots, the article is good.\"\n\nA glue that is colourless and of superior quality, is obtained from the skins of eels, and known by the name of size. It is even procured from vellum, parchment, and some of the white species of leather; but for common purposes this is by far too expensive, and is only made use of in those cases of delicate workmanship where glue would be too gross. The skins of the rabbit, hare, and cat, are made use of in the manufacturing of size, by those who are employed in gilding gold, polishing, and painting, in various colours.\n\nFrom the experiments of Mr Hatchett it appears, that membrane yields different quantities of gelatine, the solutions of which evaporated to dryness, afforded him an opportunity of observing the different degrees of viscidity and tenacity of mucilage, size, and glue. He also found that the more viscous glues are obtained with greater difficulty than such as are less so. When a cake of glue has been steeped three or four days in cold water, it is considered of the best quality, if it swell much without being dissolved, and if, when taken out, it recovers its original figure and hardness by drying.\n\nOn comparing the skins of different animals, Mr Hatchett found, that such as were most flexible more readily yielded their gelatine, and that produced from the skin of the rhinoceros was by far the most viscous of any. The true skin of any animal was most affected by long boiling; but the hide of the rhinoceros was the most insoluble.\n\nHe found that hair was not so much affected as skin; but the cartilages of the joints, when boiled long in water, were as perfectly soluble as the cuts, which is not the case with the other cartilages, as they afford little or no gelatine. The horns of the ox, ram, and goat, are very different from those of the stag; and the small quantity of gelatine they are found to contain, is produced more gradually, and with greater difficulty.\n\nAccording to Hatchett, the effects of diluted nitric acid on the substances commonly employed in the manufacturing of glue, were exactly analogous to those of boiling water, and were always most powerful on those substances which contained the greatest quantity of gelatine. Almost all animal substances are convertible either into glue or soap, with this additional advantage, that those parts of them which would not be employed in making the one, are the most proper in the manufacture of the other.\n\nAnother fine species of glue, known by the name of ifinglaf, is the produce of certain fish, very common in the Russian seas, found on entering the rivers Wolga, Lyak, Don, and Danube. In Mofovy it is prepared of the sturgeon and the florled, which yield the most beautiful ifinglaf. The fish from fresh water are esteemed the best, as they afford an ifinglaf more flexible and transparent than any other.\n\nWhen the bladder is extracted, it is washed in water to free it from the blood, if any adheres to it, but not otherwise. It is then cut longitudinally, and the outer membrane taken off, the colour of which is brown, while the other membrane is so fine and white as to be\n\n(A) When the women, by mistake, cut only two, that which is double the size is called a bishop, and thrown into the kettle again.\nwith difficulty separated from the fish. They are formed into rolls of the size of the finger, with the fine membrane in the middle, and hung in the air to dry by degrees. Good ifinglafs is white, perfectly dry, semitransparent, and without smell. It is soluble in water with a gentle heat, but is easily dissolved in alcohol, in which it differs essentially from common glue. That which is made from different parts of sea wolves, sea cows, sharks, and whales, is employed in the clarifying of different wines and other liquors. Ifinglafs is of all shades of colour, from pure transparency to black; but such as are large and yellow are reckoned the worst. They are opaque, and their smell is disagreeable.\n\nFrom 500 grains of ifinglafs Mr Hatchett obtained 56 grains of coal, from which 1\u00bd grain of earthy retiduum were obtained by reducing it to ashes. Of consequence there were only 54\u00bd grains of pure coal, and the remaining 1\u00bd he found to be phosphate of soda, with an extremely small proportion of phosphate of lime.\n\nGLUME (gluma), among botanists, a species of calyx, consisting of two or three membranous valves, which are often pelucid at the edges.

For which reason, people think King James I. was in the right, when a man being presented to him that could eat a whole sheep at one meal, he asked \"What he could do more than another man?\" and being answered \"He could not do so much,\" said \"Hang him then; for it is unfit a man should live that eats so much as 20 men, and cannot do so much as one.\"\n\nThe emperor Clodius Albinus would devour more apples at once than a butchel would hold.

Such was his diligence while at school, that he was qualified to attend the academical lectures at the age of 14, and was created doctor of medicine when only 19. He paid a visit about this time to the metropolis of the Russian empire, that he might have the pleasure of seeing some of his former teachers. There he became acquainted with Blumentrost, director of the academy, who introduced him to the meetings of the members, and procured for him an annual pension. At Peterburgh he was so much esteemed, that when he intimated a wish in 1729 to return to Tubingen, he was honoured with a place among the regular members of the academy, and chosen professor of chemistry and natural history in the year 1731. In order to carry into execution a plan which had been formed by Peter the Great, for exploring a passage to China and Japan along the coast of the Russian empire,\nGmelin was selected along with two others, as properly qualified for that undertaking, and likewise to ascertain the boundaries of Siberia. The department of natural history was assigned to our author. He had with him and his companions, six students, two draughtsmen, two hunters, two miners, four land-surveyors, and 12 soldiers, with a sergeant and drummer. They began their journey on the 19th of August 1733; and in 1736, Steller and a painter joined their society, in order to assist Gmelin in his arduous labours.\n\nBy exploring Kamtschatka, they hoped to accomplish their mission in a satisfactory manner, for which purpose Steller proceeded to this place, and the rest of the society continued their travels through Siberia. In February 1743 Gmelin returned to Peterburgh in safety after a dangerous journey which lasted nine years and a half, but proved of the utmost importance to various branches of science. He returned the offices which he had filled before; and having paid a visit in 1747 to his native country, he was chosen professor, while absent, in the room of Bachmeister deceased. He was seized with a violent fever in May 1755, which put a period to his valuable life, in the 43rd year of his age. He was undoubtedly one of the most eminent botanists of the last century, and has rendered his name immortal by his Flora Sibirica, seu historia plantarum Siberiae, in four parts, large quarto. He determined the boundaries between Europe and Asia, which every celebrated geographer has adopted since his day. Through all his works the traces of great modesty, a sacred regard to truth, and the most extensive knowledge of nature, are remarkably conspicuous.\n\nGmelin, Dr Samuel, was born in 1743 at Tubingen, where he also studied, and became doctor in medicine in 1763. He was afterwards admitted a member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg. He commenced his travels in June 1768; and having traversed the provinces of Moscow, Voronez, New Russia, Azof, Caffa, and Astracan, he visited, in 1770 and 1771, the different harbours of the Caspian, and examined with peculiar attention those parts of the Persian provinces which border upon that sea, of which he has given a circumstantial account in the three volumes of his travels already published. Actuated by a zeal for extending his observations, he attempted to pass through the western provinces of Persia, which are in a perpetual state of warfare, and infested by numerous banditti. Upon this expedition, he quitted, in April 1772, Einzillee, a small trading place in Ghilan, upon the southern shore of the Caspian; and, on account of many difficulties and dangers, did not, until December 2, 1773, reach Sallian, a town situated upon the mouth of the river Koor. Thence he proceeded to Baku and Kuba, in the province of Shirvan, where he met with a friendly reception from Ali Feth Khan, the sovereign of that district. After he had been joined by 20 Uralian Cossacks, and when he was only four days' journey from the Russian fortress Kiljar, he and his companions were, on the 5th of February 1774, arrested by order of Ulmei Khan, a petty Tartar prince, through whose territories he was obliged to pass. Ulmei urged as a pretence for this arrest, that 30 years ago several families had escaped from his dominions, and had found an asylum in the Russian territories; adding, that Gmelin should not be released until these families were restored. The professor was removed from prison to prison; and at length, wearied out with continued persecutions, he expired, July 27th, at Achmet-Kent, a village of Mount Caucasus. His death was occasioned partly by vexation for the loss of several papers and collections, and partly by disorders contracted from the fatigues of his long journey. Some of his papers had been sent to Kiljar during his imprisonment, and the others were not without great difficulty rescued from the hands of the barbarian who had detained him in captivity. The arrangement of these papers, which will form a fourth volume of his travels, was at first confided to the care of Guildenstaedt, but upon his death has been transferred to the learned Pallas.","sp":443,"ep":444},{"h":"GMELINA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the dianthus class; and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, Perforate.

Accordingly, they looked on all other Christians as simple, ignorant, and barbarous persons, who explained and interpreted the sacred writings in a too low, literal, and unedifying signification.\n\nAt first the Gnostics were only the philosophers and wits of those times, who formed for themselves a peculiar system of theology, agreeable to the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato; to which they accommodated all their interpretations of Scripture. But Gnostics afterwards became a general name, comprehending divers sects and parties of heretics, who rose in the first centuries, and who, though they differed among themselves as to circumstances, yet all agreed in some common principles. They were such as corrupted the doctrine of the gospel by a profane mixture of the tenets of the oriental philosophy, concerning the origin of evil and the creation of the world, with its divine truths. Such were the Valentinians, Simonians, Carpocratians, Nicolaitans, &c.\n\nGnostics was sometimes also more particularly attributed to the successors of the first Nicolaitans and Carpocratians, in the second century, upon their laying aside the names of the first authors. Such as would be thoroughly acquainted with all their doctrines, reveries, and visions, may consult St Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, and St Epiphanius; particularly the first of these writers, who relates their sentiments at large, and confutes them at the same time: indeed, he dwells more expressly on the Valentinians than any other sort of Gnostics; but he shows the general principles whereon all their mistaken opinions were founded, and the method they followed in explaining scripture. He accuses them of introducing into religion certain vain and ridiculous genealogies, i.e., a kind of divine processions or emanations, which had no other foundation but in their own wild imaginations.\n\nIn effect, the Gnostics confessed, that these aeons or emanations were nowhere expressly delivered in the sacred writings; but insisted at the same time, that Jesus Christ had intimated them in parables to such as could understand him. They built their theology not only on the gospels and the epistles of St Paul, but also on the law of Moses and the prophets. These last laws were peculiarly serviceable to them, on account of the allegories and allusions with which they abound, which are capable of different interpretations: Though their doctrine, concerning the creation of the world by one or more inferior beings of an evil or imperfect nature, led them to deny the divine authority of the books of the Old Testament, which contradicted this idle fiction, and filled them with an abhorrence of Moses and the religion he taught; alleging, that he was actuated by the malignant author of this world, who consulted his own glory and authority, and not the real advantage of men. Their persuasion that evil reigned in matter, as its centre and source, made them treat the body with contempt, discourage marriage, and reject the doctrine of the resurrection of the body and its reunion with the immortal spirit. Their notion, that malevolent genii presided in nature, and occasioned diseases and calamities, wars, and defolations, induced them to apply themselves to the study of magic, in order to weaken the powers or suspend the influence of their malignant agents.\n\nThe Gnostics considered Jesus Christ as the Son of God, and consequently inferior to the Father, who came into the world for the rescue and happiness of miserable mortals, opprested by matter and evil beings; but they rejected our Lord's humanity, on the principle that every thing corporeal is essentially and intrinsically evil; and therefore the greatest part of them denied the reality of his sufferings. They set a great value on the beginning of the gospel of St John, where they fancied they saw a great deal of their aeons, or emanations, under the Word, the Life, the Light, &c. They divided all nature into three kinds of beings, viz., hylic, or material; psychic, or animal; and pneumatic, or spiritual. On the like principle they also distinguished three sorts of men; material, animal, and spiritual. The first, who were material and incapable of knowledge, inevitably perished, both soul and body; the third, such as the Gnostics themselves pretended to be, were all certainly saved; the psychic, or animal, who were the middle between the other two, were capable either of being saved or damned, according to their good or evil actions.\n\nWith regard to their moral doctrines and conduct, they were much divided. The greatest part of the sect adopted very austere rules of life, recommended rigorous abstinence, and prescribed severe bodily mortifications, with a view of purifying and exalting the mind. However, some maintained, that there was no moral difference in human actions; and thus, confounding right with wrong, they gave a loose rein to all the passions, and asserted the innocence of following blindly all their motions, and of living by their tumultuous dictates. They supported their opinions and practice by various authorities: some referred to fictitious and apocryphal writings of Adam, Abraham, Zoroaster, Christ, and his apostles; others boasted, that they had deduced their sentiments from secret doctrines of Christ, concealed from the vulgar; others affirmed, that they arrived at superior degrees of wisdom by an innate vigour of mind; and others asserted, that they were instructed in these mysterious parts of theological science by Theudas, a disciple of St Paul, and by Matthias, one of the friends of our Lord. The tenets of the ancient Gnostics were revived in Spain, in the fourth century, by a sect called the Priscillianists.\n\nThe appellation Gnostic sometimes also occurs in a good sense, in the ancient ecclesiastical writers, and particularly Clemens Alexandrinus, who, in the person of his Gnostic, describes the characters and qualities of a perfect Christian. This point he labours in the seventh book of his Stromata, where he shows that none but the Gnostic, or learned person, has any true religion. He affirms, that were it possible for the knowledge\nledge of God to be separated from eternal salvation, the Gnostic would make no scruple to choose the knowledge; and that if God would promise him impunity in doing of any thing he has once spoken against, or offer him heaven on those terms, he would never alter a whit of his measures. In this sense the father uses Gnostics, in opposition to the heretics of the same name; affirming, that the true Gnostic is grown old in the study of the holy scriptures; and that he preserves the orthodox doctrine of the apostles and of the church; whereas the false Gnostic abandons all the apostolical traditions, as imagining himself wiser than the apostles. At length the name Gnostic, which originally was the most glorious, became infamous, by the idle opinions and delusive lives of the persons who bore it.","sp":444,"ep":446},{"h":"GOA","t":"a large and strong town of Asia, in the peninsula on this side the Ganges, and on the Malabar coast. It was taken by the Portuguese in 1508, and is the chief town of all their settlements on this side the Cape of Good Hope. It stands on an island of the same name, about 12 miles in length, and six in breadth; and the city is built on the north side of it, having the conveniency of a fine salt-water river, capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden, where they lie within a mile of the town. The banks of the river are beautified with a great number of handsome structures; such as churches, castles, and gentlemen's houses. The air within the town is wholesome, for which reason it is not so well inhabited now as it was formerly. The viceroy's palace is a noble building; and stands at a small distance from the river, over one of the gates of the city, which leads to a spacious street, terminated by a beautiful church. This city contains a great number of handsome churches, convents, and cloisters, with a stately large hospital; all well endowed, and kept in good repair. The market place takes up an acre of ground; and in the shops about it may be had the produce of Europe, China, Bengal, and other countries of less note. Every church has a set of bells, some of which are continually ringing. There are a great many Indian converts; but they generally retain some of their old customs, particularly they cannot be brought to eat beef. The clergy are very numerous and illiterate; but the churches are finely embellished, and have great numbers of images. In one of these churches, dedicated to Bon Jesus, is the chapel of St Francisco de Xavier, whose tomb it contains; this chapel is a most superb and magnificent place; the tomb of the saint is entirely of fine black marble brought from Lisbon; on the four sides of it the principal actions of the life of the saint are most elegantly carved in baso relievo; these represent his converting the different nations to the Catholic faith: the figures are done to the life, and most admirably executed: it extends to the top in a pyramidal form, which terminates with a coronet of mother-of-pearl. On the sides of this chapel are excellent paintings, done by Italian masters; the subjects chiefly from Scripture. This tomb and the chapel pertaining to it, must have cost an immense sum of money; the Portuguese justly esteem it the greatest rarity in the place. The houses are large, and make a fine show: but within they are but poorly furnished. The inhabitants are contented with greens, fruits, and roots; which, with a little bread, rice, and fish, is their principal diet, though they have hogs and fowls in plenty. The river's mouth is defended by several forts and batteries, well planted with large cannon on both sides; and there are several other forts in different places.\n\nGoa is the residence of a captain general, who lives in great splendour. He is also commander in chief of all the Portuguese forces in the East Indies. They have here two regiments of European infantry, three legions of sepoys, three troops of native light horse, and a militia; in all about five thousand men. Goa is at present on the decline, and in little or no estimation with the country powers; indeed their bigotry and superstitious attachment to their faith is so general, that the inhabitants, formerly populous, are now reduced to a few thinly inhabited villages; the chief part of whom have been baptized; for they will not suffer any Mussulman or Gentoo to live within the precincts of the city: and these few are unable to carry on the husbandry or manufactures of the country. The court of Portugal is obliged to send out annually a very large sum of money, to defray the current expenses of the government; which money is generally swallowed up by the convents and soldiery.\n\nThere was formerly an inquisition at this place, but it is now abolished; the building still remains, and by its black outside appears a fit emblem of the cruel and bloody transactions that passed within its walls!

Thus men themselves, according to their system, might be come gods after death; inasmuch as their souls might attain to a degree of excellence superior to what they were capable of in life.\n\nThe first divines, Father Bossu observes, were the poets: the two functions, though now separated, were originally combined; or, rather, were one and the same thing.\n\nNow the great variety of attributes in God, that is, the number of relations, capacities, and circumstances, wherein they had occasion to consider him, put these poets, &c., under a necessity of making a partition, and of separating the divine attributes into several persons; because the weakness of the human mind could not conceive so much power and action in the simplicity of one single divine nature. Thus the omnipotence of God came to be represented under the person and appellation of Jupiter; the wisdom of God, under that of Minerva; the justice of God, under that of Juno.\n\nThe first idols or false gods that are said to have been adored, were the stars, sun, moon, &c., on account of the light, heat, and other benefits, which we derive from them.

Magog signifies the country or people, and Gog the king of that country. The generality of the ancients made Magog the father of the Scythians and Tartars; and several interpreters discovered many footsteps of their name in the provinces of Great Tartary. Others have been of opinion that the Persians were the descendants of Magog; and some have imagined that the Goths were descended from Gog and Magog; and that the wars described by Ezekiel, and undertaken by Gog against the saints, are no other than those which the Goths carried on in the fifth age against the Roman empire.\n\nBochart has placed Gog in the neighbourhood of Caucasia.

It is the heaviest of all known bodies, platinum only excepted. See Chemistry and Mineralogy Index.\n\nMethod of Recovering Gold from Gilt Works. The solubility of gold, and the indissolubility of silver, in aqua regia, affords a principle on which gold may be separated from the surface of silver; and, on this foundation, different processes have been contrived, of which the two following appear to be the best.\u2014Some powdered sal ammoniac, moistened with aquafortis into the consistence of a paste, is spread upon the gilt silver, and the piece heated till the matter smokes and becomes nearly dry: being then thrown into water, it is rubbed with a scratch brush composed of fine brafs wire bound together; by which the gold easily comes off. The other way is, by putting the gilt silver into common aqua regia, kept so hot as nearly to boil, and turning the metal frequently till it becomes all over black; it is then to be washed with a little water, and rubbed with the scratch brush, to get off what gold the aqua regia may have left. This last method appears preferable to the other; as the same aqua regia may be made to serve repeatedly till it becomes saturated with the gold, after which the gold may be recovered pure by precipitation with sulphate of iron.\n\nFor separating gold from gilt copper, some direct a solution of borax to be applied on the gilt parts, but nowhere else, with a pencil, and a little powdered sulphur to be sprinkled on the places thus moistened; the principal use of the solution of borax seems to be to make the sulphur adhere; the piece being then made red hot, and quenched in water, the gold is said to be so far loosened, as to be wiped off with a brush. Others mix the sulphur with nitre and tartar, and form the mixture with vinegar into a paste, which is spread upon the gilt parts.\n\nSchluter recommends mechanical means, as being generally the least expensive, for separating gold from the surface both of silver and copper. If the gilt vessel is round, the gold is conveniently got off by turning it in a lathe, and applying a proper tool, a skin being placed underneath for receiving the shavings: he says it is easy to collect into two ounces of shavings all the gold of a gilt vessel weighing thrice as many pounds. Where the figure of the piece does not admit of this method, it is to be properly fixed, and scrapers applied of different kinds according to its size and figure; some large, and furnished with two handles, one at each end; others small and narrow, for penetrating into depressed parts. If the gold cannot be got off by either of these ways, the file must be had recourse to, which takes off more of the metal underneath than the turning tool or the scraper, particularly than the former. The gold scrapings or filings may be purified from the silver or copper they contain, by the methods described under the article Metallurgy.\n\nThe editors of the Encyclopaedia give a method of recovering the gold from wood that has been gilt on a water-size: this account is extracted from a memoir on the same subject, presented to the Academy of Sciences by M. de Montamy. The gilt wood is steeped for a quarter of an hour in a quantity of water sufficient to cover it, made very hot: the size being thus softened, the wood is taken out, and scrubbed piece by piece, in a little warm water, with short stiff bristle brushes of different sizes, some small for penetrating into the carvings, and others large for the greater dispatch in flat pieces. The whole mixture of water, size, gold, &c. is to be boiled to dryness, the dry matter made red hot in a crucible to burn off the size, and the remainder ground with mercury, either in a mortar, or, where the quantity is large, in a mill.\n\nGold-Coat. See Guinea.\n\nGold-Wire, a cylindrical ingot of silver, superficially gilt or covered with gold at the fire, and afterwards drawn successively through a great number of little round holes, of a wire-drawing iron, each less than the other, till it becomes sometimes no bigger than a hair of the head. See Wire-Drawing.\n\nIt may be observed that, before the wire be reduced to this excellent fineness, it is drawn through above 140 different holes; and that each time they draw it, it is rubbed afresh over with new wax, both to facilitate its passage, and to prevent the silver's appearing through it.\n\nGold-Wire flattened, is the former wire flattened between two rollers of polished steel, to fit it to be spun on a stick, or to be used flat, as it is, without spinning, in certain stuffs, laces, embroideries, &c. See Stuff, &c.\n\nGold-Thread, or Spun-gold, is flattened gold, wrapped or laid over a thread of silk, by twisting it with wheel and iron bobbins.\n\nTo dispose the wire to be spun on silk, they pass it between two rollers of a little mill: these rollers are of nicely polished steel, and about three inches in diameter. They are set very close to each other, and turned by means of a handle fastened to one of them, which gives motion to the other. The gold wire in passing between the two is rendered quite flat, but without losing anything of its gilding; and is rendered exceedingly thin and flexible, that it is easily spun on silk-thread, by means of a hand-wheel, and so wound on a spool or bobbin. See Wire-Drawing.\n\nGold-Leaf, or Beaten Gold, is gold beaten with a hammer into exceeding thin leaves, so that it is computed, that an ounce may be beaten into 1600 leaves, each three inches square, in which state it takes up more than 159,052 times its former surface.\n\nThe preparation of gold leaf, according to Dr Lewis, is as follows:\n\n\"The gold is melted in a black-lead crucible, with...\"\nsome borax, in a wind furnace, called by the workmen a wind hole: as soon as it appears in perfect fusion, it is poured out into an iron ingot mould, six or eight inches long, and three quarters of an inch wide, previously greased, and heated, so as to make the tallow run and smoke, but not to take flame. The bar of gold is made red hot, to burn off the unctuous matter, and forged on an anvil into a long plate, which is further extended, by being passed repeatedly between polished steel rollers, till it becomes a ribbon as thin as paper. Formerly the whole of this extension was procured by means of the hammer, and some of the French workmen are still said to follow the same practice: but the use of the flating mill both abridges the operation, and renders the plate of more uniform thicknesses. The ribbon is divided by compasses, and cut with sheers into equal pieces, which consequently are of equal weights: these are forged on an anvil till they are an inch square; and afterwards well nealed, to correct the rigidity which the metal has contracted in the hammering and flattening. Two ounces of gold, or 650 grains, the quantity which the workmen usually melt at a time, make 150 of these squares, whence each of them weighs six grains and two fifths; and as 902 grains of gold make a cubic inch, the thickness of the square plates is about the 766th part of an inch.\n\nIn order to the further extension of these pieces into fine leaves, it is necessary to interpose some smooth body between them and the hammer, for softening its blow, and defending them from the rudeness of its immediate action: also to place between every two of the pieces some proper intermedium, which, while it prevents their uniting together, or injuring one another, may suffer them freely to extend. Both these ends are answered by certain animal membranes.\n\nThe goldbeaters use three kinds of membranes; for the outside cover, common parchment made of sheep skin; for interlaying with the gold, first the smoothest and closest vellum, made of calf skin; and afterwards the much finer skins of ox gut, stript off from the large straight gut stript open, curiously prepared on purpose for this use, and hence called gold-beater's skin. The preparation of these last is a distinct business, practised by only two or three persons in the kingdom, some of the particulars of which I have not satisfactorily learned. The general process is said to consist, in applying one upon another, by the smooth sides, in a moist state, in which they readily cohere and unite inseparably; stretching them on a frame, and carefully scraping off the fat and rough matter, so as to leave only the fine exterior membrane of the gut; beating them between double leaves of paper, to force out what uncleanness may remain in them; moistening them once or twice with an infusion of warm spices; and lastly, drying and prelling them. It is said, that some calcined gypsum, or plaster of Paris, is rubbed with a hare's foot both on the vellum and the ox gut skins, which fills up such minute holes as may happen in them, and prevents the gold leaf from sticking, as it would do to the simple animal membrane. It is observable, that notwithstanding the vast extent to which the gold is beaten between these skins, and the great tenacity of the skins themselves, yet they sustain continual repetitions of the process for several months, without extending or growing thinner. Our workmen find, that, after 70 or 80 repetitions, the skins, though they contract no flaw, will no longer permit the gold to extend between them; but that they may be again rendered fit for use by impregnating them with the virtue which they have lost, and that even holes in them may be repaired by the dexterous application of fresh pieces of skin: a microscopic examination of some skins that had been long used plainly showed these repairs. The method of restoring their virtue is said in the Encyclop\u00e9die to be, by interlaying them with leaves of paper moistened with white wine vinegar, beating them for a whole day, and afterwards rubbing them over as at first with plaster of Paris. The gold is said to extend between them more easily, after they have been used a little, than when they are new.\n\nThe beating of the gold is performed on a smooth block of black marble, weighing from 200 to 600 pounds, the heavier the better; about nine inches square on the upper surface, and sometimes less, fitted into the middle of a wooden frame, about two feet square, so that the surface of the marble and the frame form one continuous plane. Three of the sides are furnished with a high ledge; and the front, which is open, has a leather flap fastened to it, which the gold-beater takes before him as an apron, for preserving the fragments of gold that fall off. Three hammers are employed, all of them with two round and somewhat convex faces, though commonly the workman uses only one of the faces: the first, called the cutch hammer, is about four inches in diameter, and weighs 15 or 16 pounds, and sometimes 20, though few workmen can manage those of this last size: the second, called the floddering hammer, weighs about 12 pounds, and is about the same diameter: the third, called the gold hammer, or finishing hammer, weighs 10 or 11 pounds, and is nearly of the same width. The French use four hammers, differing both in size and shape from those of our workmen: they have only one face, being in figure truncated cones. The first has very little convexity, is near five inches in diameter, and weighs 14 or 15 pounds: the second is more convex than the first, about an inch narrower, and scarcely half its weight: the third, still more convex, is only about two inches wide, and four or five pounds in weight: the fourth or finishing hammer is near as heavy as the first, but narrower by an inch, and the most convex of all. As these hammers differ so remarkably from ours, I thought proper to insert them, leaving the workmen to judge what advantage one set may have above the other.\n\nA hundred and fifty of the pieces of gold are interlaid with leaves of vellum, three or four inches square, one vellum leaf being placed between every two of the pieces, and about 20 more of the vellum leaves on the outsides; over these is drawn a parchment case, open at both ends, and over this another in a contrary direction, so that the assemblage of gold and vellum leaves is kept tight and close on all sides. The whole is beaten with the heaviest hammer, and every now and then turned upside down, till the gold is stretched to the extent of the vellum; the case being from time to time opened for discovering how the extension goes on, and the packet, at times, bent and rolled...\nrolled as it were between the hands, for procuring sufficient freedom to the gold, or, as the workmen say, to make the gold work. The pieces, taken out from between the vellum leaves, are cut in four with a steel knife; and the divisions, hence resulting, are interlaid, in the same manner, with pieces of the ox-gut skins five inches square. The beating being repeated with a lighter hammer till the golden plates have again acquired the extent of the skins, they are a second time divided in four: the instrument used for this division is a piece of cane cut to an edge, the leaves being now so light, that the moisture of the air or breath condensing on a metallic knife would occasion them to stick to it. These last divisions being so numerous, that the skins necessary for interposing between them would make the packet too thick to be beaten at once, they are parted into three parcels, which are beaten separately, with the smallest hammer, till they are stretched for the third time to the size of the skins: they are now found to be reduced to the greatest thinness they will admit of; and indeed many of them, before this period, break or fail. The French workmen, according to the minute detail of this process given in the Encyclop\u00e9die, repeat the division and the beating once more; but as the squares of gold, taken for the first operation, have four times the area of those used among us, the number of leaves from an equal area is the same in both methods, viz. 16 from a square inch. In the beating, however simple the process appears to be, a good deal of address is requisite, for applying the hammers so as to extend the metal uniformly from the middle to the sides: one improper blow is apt not only to break the gold leaves, but to cut the skins.\n\n\"After the last beating, the leaves are taken up by the end of a cane instrument, and, being blown flat on a leather cushion, are cut to a size, one by one, with a square frame of cane made of a proper sharpness, or with a frame of wood edged with cane: they are then fitted into books of 25 leaves each, the paper of which is well smoothed, and rubbed with red bole to prevent their sticking to it. The French, for sizing the leaves, use only the cane knife; cutting them first straight on one side, fitting them into the book by the straight side, and then paring off the superfluous parts of the gold about the edges of the book. The size of the French gold leaves is from somewhat less than three inches to three and three quarters square; that of ours, from three inches to three and three-eighths.\n\n\"The process of gold-beating is considerably influenced by the weather. In wet weather, the skins grow somewhat damp, and in this state make the extension of the gold more tedious: the French are said to dry and press them at every time of using; with care not to overdry them, which would render them unfit for farther service. Our workmen complain more of frost, which appears to affect the metallic leaves themselves: in frost, a gold leaf cannot easily be blown flat, but breaks, wrinkles, or runs together.\n\n\"Gold leaf ought to be prepared from the finest gold; as the admixture of other metals, though in too small a proportion to affect sensibly the colour of the leaf, would displace it to lose its beauty in the air. And indeed there is little temptation to the workman to use any other; the greater hardness of alloyed gold occasioning as much to be lost in point of time and labour, and in the greater number of leaves that break, as can be gained by any quantity of alloy that would not be at once discoverable by the eye. All metals render gold harder and more difficult of extension. Even silver, which in this respect seems to alter its quality less than any other metal, produces with gold a mixture sensibly harder than either of them separately, and this hardness is in no art more felt than in the goldbeater's. The French are said to prepare what is called the green gold leaf, from a composition of one part of copper and two of silver with eighty of gold. But this is probably a mistake: for such an admixture gives no greenness to gold: and I have been informed by our workmen, that this kind of leaf is made from the same fine gold as the highest gold-coloured fort, the greenish hue being only a superficial tint induced upon the gold in some part of the process: this greenish leaf is little otherwise used than for the gilding of certain books.\n\n\"But though the goldbeater cannot advantageously diminish the quantity of gold in the leaf by the admixture of any other substance with the gold, yet means have been contrived, for some particular purposes, of saving the precious metal, by producing a kind of leaf called party-gold, whose basis is silver, and which has only a superficial coat of gold upon one side: a thick leaf of silver and a thinner one of gold, laid flat on one another, heated and pressed together, unite and cohere; and being then beaten into fine leaves, as in the foregoing process, the gold, though its quantity is only about one fourth of that of the silver, continues everywhere to cover it, the extension of the former keeping pace with that of the latter.\n\n\"But it is observed by Mr Nicholson, that pure gold is too ductile to be worked between the goldbeater's skin. The newest skins will work the finest gold, and make the thinnest leaf, because they are the smoothest. Old skins, being rough or foul, require coarser gold. The finer the gold, the more ductile; infomuch that pure gold, when driven out by the hammer, is too soft to force itself over the irregularities, but would pass round them, and by that means become divided into narrow slips. The finest gold for this purpose has three grains of alloy in the ounce, and the coarsest twelve grains. In general, the alloy is six grains, or one-eightieth part. That which is called pale gold contains three pennyweights of silver in the ounce. The alloy of leaf gold is silver, or copper, or both, and the colour is produced of various tints accordingly. Two ounces and two pennyweights of gold is delivered by the master to the workman, who, if extraordinarily skilful, returns two thousand leaves, or eighty books of gold, together with one ounce and six pennyweights of waste cuttings. Hence one book weighs 4.8 grains; and as the leaves measure 3.3 inches in the side, the thickness of the leaf is one two hundred and eighty-two thousandth part of an inch.\n\nThe yellow metal called Dutch gold is fine brass. It is said to be made from copper plates, by cementation with calamine, without subsequent fusion. Its thickness, compared with that of leaf gold, proved as 19 to 4, and under equal surfaces it is considerably more than twice as heavy as the gold. [Footnote: vol. i.]\nIt must be observed, however, that gold is beaten more or less, according to the kind or quality of the work it is intended for; that for the gold-wire-drawers to gild their ingots withal, is left much thicker than that for gilding the frames of pictures, &c.

See Enamelling.\n\nShell-Gold is that used by the gilders and illuminers, and with which gold letters are written. It is made by grinding gold leaves, or gold-beaters fragments, with a little honey, and afterwards separating the honey from the powdered gold by means of water. When the honey is washed away, the gold may be put on paper or kept in shells; whence its name. When it is used, it is diluted with gum-water or soap-suds.\u2014The German gold-powder, prepared from the Dutch gold-leaf in the same manner, is generally used; and when it is well scoured with varnish, answers the end in japanners gilding as well as the genuine.\n\nGold Size for burnished gilding is prepared of one pound and a half of tobacco-pipe clay, half an ounce of red chalk, a quarter of an ounce of black lead, forty drops of sweet oil, and three drams of pure tallow; grind the clay, chalk, and black lead, separately, very fine in water; then mix them together, add the oil and tallow, and grind the mixture to a due consistence.\n\nGold size of japanners may be made by pulverizing gum animi and asphaltum, of each one ounce; red lead, litharge of gold, and umber, of each one ounce and a half; mixing them with a pound of linseed oil, and boiling them, observing to stir them till the whole be incorporated, and appears on growing cold of the consistence of tar; strain the mixture through a flannel, and keep it stoppered up in a bottle for use. When it is used, it must be ground with as much vermilion as will give it an opake body, and diluted with oil of turpentine, so that it may be worked freely with the pencil. A simple preparation consists of one pound of linseed oil and four ounces of gum animi; powder the gum, and mix it gradually with the boiling oil; let it continue to boil till it becomes of the consistence of tar; strain it through a coarse cloth; keep and use it as the other.\n\nGold-Finch.

The commentators have been divided on this article: the pulverizing of gold, and rendering it potable, is a very difficult operation in chemistry. Many, therefore, suppose it done by a miracle; and the rest, who allow of nothing supernatural in it, advance nothing but conjectures as to the manner of the process. Moses could not have done it by simple calcination, nor amalgamation, nor antimony, nor calcination; nor is there one of those operations that quadrates with the text.\n\nM. Stahl has endeavoured to remove this difficulty. The method Moses made use of, according to this author, was by dissolving the metal with hepatic sulphuris only, instead of the vegetable alkali, he made use of the Egyptian natron, which is common enough throughout the east.\n\nGolden-Fleece, in the ancient mythology, was the skin or fleece of the ram upon which Phryxus and Hella are supposed to have swum over the sea to Colchis; and which being sacrificed to Jupiter, was hung upon a tree in the grove of Mars, guarded by two brazen-hoofed bulls, and a monstrous dragon that never slept; but was taken and carried off by Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nMany authors have endeavoured to show that this fable is an allegorical representation of some real history, particularly of the philosophers stone. Others have explained it by the profit of the wool trade to Colchis, or the gold which they commonly gathered there with fleeces in the rivers. See Argonauts.\n\nOrder of the Golden Fleece, is a military order instituted by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1429. It took its denomination from a representation of the golden fleece, borne by the knights on their collars, which consisted of flints and steels. The king of Spain is now grand-master of the order, in quality of duke of Burgundy: the number of knights is fixed to thirty-one.\n\nIt is usually said to have been instituted on occasion of an immense profit which that prince made by wool; though others will have a chemical mystery couched under it, as under that famous one of the ancients, which the adepts contend to be no other than the secret of the elixir, wrote on the fleece of a sheep.\n\nOliver de la Marche writes, that he had suggested to Philip I. archduke of Austria, that the order was instituted by his grandfather Philip the Good duke of Burgundy, with a view to that of Jason; and that John Germain bishop of Chalons, chancellor of the order, upon this occasion made him change his opinion, and assured the young prince that the order had been instituted with a view to the fleece of Gideon. William bishop of Tournay, chancellor likewise of the order, pretends that the duke of Burgundy had in view both the golden fleece of Jason and Jacob's fleece; i.e. the speckled sheep belonging to this patriarch, according to agreement made with his father-in-law Laban. Which sentiment gave birth to a great work of this prelate, in two parts: in the first, under the symbol of the fleece of Jason, is represented the virtue of magnanimity, which a knight ought to profess; and under the symbol of the fleece of Jacob he represents the virtue of justice.\nParadin is of the same mind; and tells us, that the duke designed to infinuate that the fabulous conquest which Jalon is said to have made of the golden fleece in Colchis, was nothing else but the conquest of virtue, which gains a victory over those horrible monsters vice and our evil inclinations.\n\nGolden Number, in Chronology, a number showing what year of the moon's cycle any given year is.

His attachment to the drama became conspicuous even in childhood, which his father was fond of countenancing, erecting a theatre in his own house, where young Goldoni and some of his companions were the actors. It is said that he even drew the outlines of a comedy of his own invention when he was no more than 8 years of age,\u2014a most extraordinary indication of his future eminence. He studied rhetoric at Perugia, in the college of the Jesuits, and prosecuted his philosophical studies at Rimini. The stage, however had too many charms to allow him to pay much attention to Aristotle or Quintilian, and he eloped from Rimini with a company of comedians when they removed to Chioggia. In vain did his father attempt to make him fall in love with physic, or the study of the law; yet his ardent imagination was so forcibly struck with a particular church ceremony, that he formed the resolution of commencing capuchin, but the dissipation of Venice soon destroyed this resolution. After the demise of his father, he was prevailed upon by his surviving parent to take up the profession of the law for immediate support, but some unknown reasons induced him to quit the bar, after which he went to Milan, where he was appointed secretary to the Venetian resident.\n\nAt Milan he brought out his first performance, under the title of Il Gondoliere Veneziano. He removed afterwards to Verona, where he joined himself to a company of players; and here too he entered into a state of wedlock. He composed a number of pieces for the players to whom he attached himself. While at Venice, he formed the laudable resolution of reforming the Italian stage, which at that time was disgraced by contemptible farce and low buffoonery. He made himself acquainted with the true nature of comedy, and kept within the limits of nature and decorum. Such was the fertility of his genius, and such his indefatigable industry, that he produced no fewer than fifteen comedies and 42 other theatrical pieces in the course of Goldoni's twelve months! And what is most astonishing, some of these hasty performances are deemed his masterpieces.\n\nHis works in 10 vols. 8vo. were first printed in 1753, and in 1761 his new pieces amounted to 59. About this time he was invited to Paris by the manager of the Italian theatre in that city, to compose pieces for the stage, of which invitation he accepted. His first attempt was unsuccessful, because he had to contend with the pantomime drollery, which was most agreeable to the depraved taste of the times. When about to leave Paris on the expiration of his engagement, he was introduced to the court, and appointed teacher of the Italian language to the princesses. He had lodgings in Versailles, but his pension was not sufficient to keep him from writing for the stage. When 62 years old, he ventured to compose in a foreign language, his La Bourru Bienfaisant, which was received in the court theatre with extraordinary applause. He was deprived of his pension in consequence of the revolution, and reduced to indigence. It ought to be confessed, however, that this versatile nation was just about to make him amends when he expired in 1792, and in the 85th year of his age. If the rapidity with which Goldoni composed was such as to prevent him from ranking with authors of the first class, it cannot be denied that his talent for comedy was very great. Some have given him the appellation of the Moli\u00e8re of Italy, but this perhaps is too flattering a title. His whole works were printed at Leghorn about the years 1788 and 1791, in 31 volumes 8vo.\n\nGoldsmith, or, as some choose to express it, silversmith, an artist who makes vessels, utensils, and ornaments, in gold and silver.\n\nThe goldsmith's work is either performed in the mould, or beat out with the hammer or other engine. All works that have raised figures are cast in a mould, and afterwards polished and finished; plates or dishes, of silver or gold, are beat out from thin flat plates; and tankards, and other vessels of that kind, are formed of plates soldered together, and their mouldings are beat, not cast. The business of the goldsmiths formerly required much more labour than it does at present; for they were obliged to hammer the metal from the ingot to the thinnest they wanted; but there are now invented flattening-mills, which reduce metals to the thinness that is required, at a very small expense. The goldsmith is to make his own moulds; and for that reason, ought to be a good designer, and have a taste in sculpture: he ought also to know enough of metallurgy to be able to assay mixed metals, and to mix the alloy.\n\nThe goldsmiths in London employ several hands under them for the various articles of their trade; such are the jeweller, the snuff-box and toy-maker, the silver-turner, the gilder, the burnisher, the chaser, the refiner, and the gold-beater.\n\nGoldsmiths are superior tradesmen; their wares must be assayed by the wardens of the company of this name in London, and marked; and gold is to be of a certain touch. No goldsmith may take above one thilling the ounce of gold, besides what he has for the fashioning, more than the buyer may be allowed for it at the king's exchange; and here any false metal shall be seized and forfeited to the king. The cities\nGoldsmith, of York, Exeter, Bristol, &c., are places appointed for the assaying wrought plate of goldsmiths; also a duty is granted on silver-plate of sixpence an ounce, &c. Plate made by goldsmiths shall be of a particular fineness, on pain of forfeiting 10l. and if any parcel of plate sent to the assayers is discovered to be of a coarser alloy than the respective standards, it may be broken and defaced; and the fees for assaying are particularly limited.\n\nGoldsmith, Oliver, a celebrated English writer, was born at Rofcommon in Ireland in the year 1731. His father, who possessed a small estate in that county, had nine sons, of whom Oliver was the third. He was originally intended for the church; and with that view, after being well instructed in the classics, was, with his brother the Rev. Henry Goldsmith, placed in Trinity-college, Dublin, about the latter end of the year 1749. In this seminary of learning he continued a few years, when he took a bachelor's degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, Oliver, by the advice of Dean Goldsmith of Cork, turned his thoughts to the study of physic; and, after attending some courses of anatomy in Dublin, proceeded to Edinburgh in the year 1751, where he studied the several branches of medicine under the different professors in that university. His beneficent disposition soon involved him in unexpected difficulties; and he was obliged precipitately to leave Scotland, in consequence of engaging himself to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellow-student.\n\nA few days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at Sunderland, near Newcastle, where he was arrested at the suit of a tailor in Edinburgh, to whom he had given security for his friend.\n\nBy the good offices of Laughlan Maclean, Esq., and Dr Sleigh, who were then in the college, he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff; and took his passage on board a Dutch ship to Rotterdam, where, after a short stay, he proceeded to Brussels; he then visited great part of Flanders; and after passing some time at Strauburg and Louvain, where he obtained a degree of bachelor of physic, he accompanied an English gentleman to Berne and Geneva.\n\nIt is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious unfortunate man travelled on foot most part of his tour. He had left England with very little money; and being of a philosophical turn, and at that time possessing a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily terrified at danger, he became an enthusiast to the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different countries. He had some knowledge of the French language and of music, and he played tolerably well on the German flute; which, from an amusement, became at some times the means of subsistence. His learning produced him a hospitable reception at most of the religious houses; and his music made him welcome to the peasants of Flanders and other parts of Germany. \"Whenever I approached,\" he used to say, \"a peasant's house towards night-fall, I played one of my most merry tunes; and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day: but in truth (his constant expression), I must own, whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to please them.\"\n\nOn Mr Goldsmith's arrival at Geneva, he was recommended as a proper person for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a considerable sum of money by his uncle Mr S\u2014\u2014, formerly an eminent pawnbroker near Holborn. This youth, who had been articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune determined to see the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a proviso that he should be permitted to govern himself; and Goldsmith soon found his pupil understood the art of directing in money-concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing passion. His questions were usually how money might be saved, and which was the least expensive course of travelling; whether anything could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again in London? Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them was to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told they were not worth seeing. He never paid a bill that he would not observe how amazingly expensive travelling was; and all this, though he was not yet twenty-one. During Goldsmith's continuance in Switzerland, he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given some striking proofs while at the college of Edinburgh. It was here he sent the first sketch of his delightful poem called the Traveller, to his brother the clergyman in Ireland, who, giving up fame and fortune, had retired with an amiable wife to happiness and obscurity, on an income of only 40l. a-year.\n\nFrom Geneva Mr Goldsmith and his pupil visited the south of France; where the young man, upon some disagreement with his preceptor, paid him the small part of his salary which was due, and embarked at Marseilles for England. Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and passed through a variety of difficulties in traversing the greatest part of France. At length his curiosity being satiated, he bent his course towards England, and arrived at Dover the beginning of the winter 1758. When he came to London, his stock of cash did not amount to two livres. An entire stranger in this metropolis, his mind was filled with the most gloomy reflections on his embarrassed situation. With some difficulty he discovered that part of the town in which his old acquaintance Dr Sleigh resided. This gentleman received him with the warmest affection, and liberally invited him to share his purse till some establishment could be procured for him. Goldsmith, unwilling to be a burden to his friend, a short time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to assist the late Rev. Dr Milner in instructing the young gentlemen at the academy at Peckham; and acquitted himself greatly to the Doctor's satisfaction for a short time; but having obtained some reputation by the criticisms he had written in the Monthly Review, Mr Griffith, the proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, resolving to pursue the profession of writing, he returned to London, as the mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward. As his finances were by no means in a good state, he determined to adopt a plan of the strictest economy: and took\nGoldsmith took lodgings in an obscure court in the Old Bailey, where he wrote several ingenious little pieces. The late Mr Newberry, who at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author; and introduced him as one of the writers in the Public Ledger, in which his Citizen of the World originally appeared, under the title of Chinese Letters.\n\nFortune now seemed to take some notice of a man she had long neglected. The simplicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of respectable families; and he emerged from his shabby apartments in the Old Bailey to the politest air of the Temple, where he took handsome chambers, and lived in a genteel style. The publication of his Traveller, and his Vicar of Wakefield, was followed by the performance of his comedy of the Good-natured Man at Covent Garden theatre, and placed him in the first rank of the poets of the present age.\n\nAmong many other persons of distinction who were desirous to know him was the duke of Northumberland; and the circumstance that attended his introduction to that nobleman is worthy of being related, in order to show a striking trait of his character. \"I was invited,\" said the Doctor (as he was then universally called) by my friend Mr Piercy, to wait upon the duke, in consequence of the satisfaction he had received from the perusal of one of my productions. I dressed myself in the best manner I could; and, after studying some compliments I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland-house, and acquainted the servants that I had particular business with his Grace. They showed me into an antechamber; where, after waiting some time, a gentleman very genteelly dressed made his appearance. Taking him for the duke, I delivered all the fine things I had composed in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when, to my great astonishment, he told me I had mistaken him for his master, who would see me immediately. At that instant the duke came into my apartment; and I was so confused on the occasion, that I wanted words barely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the duke's politeness, and went away extremely chagrined at the blunder I had committed.\"\n\nAnother feature of his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his Deserted Village, the bookseller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy, which the Doctor mentioned a few hours after to one of his friends: who observed, it was a very great sum for so short a performance. \"In truth,\" replied Goldsmith, \"I think so too; I have not been easy since I received it; therefore I will go back and return him his note;\" which he absolutely did; and left it entirely to the bookseller to pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the piece, which turned out very considerable.\n\nDuring the last rehearsal of his comedy intitled She Stoops to Conquer, which Mr Coleman had no opinion would succeed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of Tony Lumpkin's speeches, being apprehensive it might injure the play, the manager with great keenness replied, \"Psha, my dear Doctor, do not be fearful of squibs, when we have been fitting almost these two hours upon a barrel of gunpowder.\" The piece, however, contrary to Mr Coleman's expectation, was received with uncommon applause by the audience; and Goldsmith's pride was so hurt by the severity of the above observation, that it entirely put an end to his friendship for the gentleman that made it.\n\nNotwithstanding the great success of his pieces, by some of which it is asserted, upon good authority, he cleared \u00a31800l. in one year, his circumstances were by no means in a prosperous situation; which was partly owing to the liberality of his disposition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had contracted of gaming; the arts of which he knew very little of, and consequently became the prey of those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his simplicity.\n\nJust before his death he had formed a design for executing an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, the prospectus of which he actually published. In this work several of his literary friends (particularly Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr Johnson, Mr Beauchamp, and Mr Garrick), had undertaken to furnish him with articles upon different subjects. He had entertained the most sanguine expectations from the success of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly receive; and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his existence.\n\nHe had been for some years afflicted, at different times, with a violent strangury, which contributed not a little to embitter the latter part of his life; and which, united with the vexations which he suffered upon other occasions, brought on a kind of habitual delusion. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, terminated in his dissolution on the 4th of April 1774.\n\nAs to his character, it is strongly illustrated by Mr Pope's line,\n\nIn wit a man, simplicity a child.\n\nThe learned leisure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by difficulties which arose from the liberality of his temper, and which sometimes threw him into loud fits of passion; but this impetuosity was corrected upon a moment's reflection; and his servants have been known, upon these occasions, purposely to throw themselves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved, was certain of being rewarded for it. The universal esteem in which his poems were held, and the repeated pleasure they give in the perusal, is a striking test of their merit. He was a studious and correct observer of nature; happy in the selection of his images, in the choice of his subjects, and in the harmony of his versification; and, though his embarrassed situation prevented him from putting the last hand to many of his productions, his Hermit, his Traveller, and his Deserted Village, bid fair to claim a place among the most finished pieces in the English language.\n\nBesides the works already mentioned, he wrote, 1. History of the earth and animated nature, 6 vols 8vo. 2. History of England, 4 vols 8vo. 3. History of Rome, 2 vols. 4.

Among them it has been very ancient; for there are statutes prohibiting it as early as the year 1457; left it should interfere with the sport of archery. It is commonly played on rugged broken ground, covered with short grass, in the neighbourhood of the sea shore. A field of this sort is in Scotland called links. The game is generally played in parties of one or two on each side. Each party has an exceeding hard ball, somewhat larger than a hen's egg. This they strike with a slender and elastic club, of about four feet long, crooked in the head, and having lead run into it, to make it heavy. The ball being struck with this club, will fly to the distance of 200 yards, and the game is gained by the party who puts his ball into the hole with the fewest strokes. But the game does not depend solely upon the striking of the longest ball, but also upon measuring the strength of the stroke, and applying it in such direction as to lay the ball in smooth ground, whence it may be easily moved at the next stroke. To encourage this amusement, the city of Edinburgh, A.D. 1744, gave to the company of golfers a silver club, to be played for annually by the company, the victor to append a gold or silver piece to the prize. It has been played for every year since, except the years 1746 and 1747.\n\nFor their better accommodation, 22 members of the company subscribed \u00a330 each in the year 1768, for building a house, where their meetings might be held. The spot chosen for this purpose was the south-west corner of Leith Links, where an area was taken in feet from the magistrates of Edinburgh, and a commodious house and tavern built upon it.","sp":455,"ep":456},{"h":"GOLIUS","t":"JAMES, a celebrated professor of Arabic and the mathematics at Leyden, was descended from a very honourable family, and born at the Hague in the year 1596.

He afterwards travelled into Africa and Asia; and became greatly esteemed by the king of Morocco, and the sultan of the Turks. He at length returned to Leyden, loaded with manuscripts; and in 1624, succeeded Erpinus in the Arabic chair. As he had been an eyewitness of the wretched state of Christianity in the Mahometan countries, he was filled with the compassion of a fellow-christian; and none ever solicited for a place of honour and profit with greater eagerness, than he for procuring a new edition of the New Testament, in the original language, with a translation into the vulgar Greek, by an Archimandrite; and as there are some of these Christians who use the Arabic tongue in divine service, he also took care to have dispersed among them an Arabic translation of the Confession of the Protestants, together with the Catechism and Liturgy. In 1626, he was also chosen professor of mathematics; and discharged the functions of both professorships with the greatest applause during 40 years. He was likewise appointed interpreter in ordinary to the states for the Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and other eastern languages, for which he had an annual pension, Golzius, and a present of a gold chain, with a very beautiful medal, which he wore as a badge of his office.

He was taught the art of engraving by Theodore Cuenenbert; and succeeded very wonderfully in it, notwithstanding the disadvantage of a lame hand, which was occasioned by his falling into the fire whilst young. He was first employed by his master, and afterward he worked for Philip Galle. Domestic troubles and ill health occasioned him to travel. He went through Germany into Italy; and passed under a feigned name, that his studies might not be interrupted. He visited Bologna, Florence, Naples, and Venice, constantly applying himself to drawing from the antique statues, and the works of the great masters. At Rome he resided the longest; and there he produced several excellent engravings from Polidoro Raphael, and other eminent painters. On his return to his native country he established himself at Haarlem, where he engraved many of the drawings which he had made during his abode in Italy. He died at Haarlem in 1617, aged 59. He is said to have been 40 years old before he began to paint; yet his pictures are spoken of with great commendation; but as he did not produce any great number of them, they are rarely to be met with. As an engraver, he deserves the highest commendation. No man ever surpassed, and few have equalled, him in the command of the graver and freedom of execution. He copied the style of Albert Durer, Lucas of Leyden, and other old masters, with astonishing exactness. Sometimes his engravings are neat in the extreme; at other times they are performed in a bold open manner, without the least restraint. He also engraved several of his own designs on wood, in that manner which is distinguished by the appellation of chiaro-scuro. Of his prints, which are very numerous, it may here suffice to specify two or three of the most celebrated: 1. Six large upright plates, known by the name of his masterpieces. These, it is said, he engraved to convince the public that he was perfectly capable of imitating the styles of Albert Durer, Lucas Van Leyden, and other masters, whose works were then held in higher estimation than his own; for he had adopted a new manner, which he pursued because he thought it superior, and not because he was incapable of following the others. It is reported that with one of them, the Circumcision, which he smoked to give it the more plausible air of antiquity, he actually deceived some of the most capital connoisseurs of the day; by one of whom it was bought for an original engraving of Albert Durer. The subjects of these plates are, The Annunciation of the Virgin; the Meeting of the Virgin with Elizabeth, called the Visitation; the Nativity of Christ; the Circumcision of Christ; the Adoration of the Wise Men; the Holy Family. 2. The Judgment of Midas, a large plate lengthwise. 3. The Venetian Ball, a large plate lengthwise, from Theodore Bernard. 4.

Long. 55\u00b0 30'. The name of Gombroon, or Comerong, Captain Hamilton tells us, it had from the Portuguese; because it was remarkable for the number of prawns and shrimps caught on its coasts, by them called come-rong. This city owes its wealth and grandeur to the demolition of Ormus, and the downfall of the Portuguese empire in the East Indies. It is now justly accounted one of the greatest marts in the East, was built by the great Shah Abbas, and from him, as some think, obtained the name of Bandar Abafi, which signifies the court of Abbas. It stands on a bay about nine leagues to the northward of the east end of the island of Kishmish, and three leagues from the famous Ormus. The English began to settle here about the year 1631, when, in consideration of their services against the Portuguese, Shah Abbas granted them half the customs of that port. This was confirmed by a firman, and duly regarded, till the English began to neglect the services they had stipulated. Whether the company has any emolument from the customs at present, is what we cannot pretend to ascertain. The town is large, but its situation bad; wanting almost every thing that contributes to the happiness and even support of life. Towards the land it is encompassed by a fort of wall; and towards the sea are several small forts, with a platform, and a castle or citadel, mounted with cannon to secure it and the road from the attempts of an enemy by sea. The houses in most of the streets are so out of repair, some half down, others in a heap of rubbish, that a stranger would imagine the town had been sacked and ravaged by a barbarous people; not a vestige of the wealth really contained in the place appearing in view. The bazars and shops round them are kept, for the most part, by Banians, whose houses are generally in good order. Most of the houses are built with earth and lime, but some of the best with stone. Many of them have a fort of ventilators at top, which contributes greatly to the health of the inhabitants in the hot seasons of the year. The most sickly months here are April, May, September, and October. With fish and mutton the inhabitants are well supplied. Rice is imported from India; and wheat is so plenty, that the poor subsist chiefly on bread and dates. The country hereabouts abounds in the most delicious fruits, as apricots, peaches, pomegranates, pears, mangoes, grapes, quinces, plums, sweet quinces, and water melons. The apricots, however, are finall, and extremely dangerous if eaten to excess.\n\nThose conveniences are more than overbalanced by the scarcity of fresh water, with which the inhabitants are supplied from Aseen, a place seven miles distant, Gombroon, there not being a spring or well in the town. Persons of condition keep a camel constantly employed in bringing fresh and wholesome water. Captain Hamilton gives it as his opinion, that one cause of the unwholeness of this city is the reflection of the rays of light from a high mountain to the north of it. He says, that when the beams are reflected from this mountain, they almost fire the air, and, for two or three months in the year, render the situation intolerable. For this reason the people of condition retire into the country, to pass the heats of June, July, and August. The very sea, during this season, is affected, inasmuch that the fish is no less disagreeable than that of putrid carcases; and this is increased by the quantities of shell-fish left on the shore, from which an exhalation arises that tarnishes gold and silver, and is less tolerable than the bilge-water of a tight ship. At Aseen the English factory have a country house and gardens, to which they retire occasionally. Here they have whole groves of Seville orange trees, which, though not natural to the country, thrive very well, and are always verdant, bearing ripe and green fruit, with blossoms, all at the same time. They have likewise tanks and ponds of fine fresh water, with every thing else that can moderate the heat of the climate, and render life agreeable and elegant. About ten miles from Aseen is a place called Minoa, where are cold and hot natural baths, reckoned infallible in the cure of all febrile disorders, rheumatism, and other diseases, by bathing.\n\nGombroon is extremely populous, on account of the commerce carried on by the Dutch and English factories, as well as the natives. The English factory is close by the sea, at some distance from the Dutch, which is a commodious and fine new building. A great part of the company's profits arises from freights. As the natives have not one good ship of their own, and are extremely ignorant of navigation, they freight their goods for Surat, and other Indian marts, in English and Dutch bottoms, at an exorbitant rate. The commodities of the Gombroon market are, fine wines of different kinds, raisins, almonds, kish-mishes, prunellas, dates, pitachio-nuts, ginger, silks, carpets, leather, tatty, galbanum, ammoniac, aflaketida, tragacanth, with other gums, and a variety of shop medicines. These are in a great measure the produce of Carmania, which they bring to Gombroon in caravans. The English company had once a small factory in the province of Carmania, chiefly for the sake of a fine wool produced there, and used by the hatters. The said company had once a project of carrying a breed of the Persian goats to St Helena; but whether it was executed, or what success it met with, we cannot say. Although the company pay no customs, yet they usually make a present to the habanader, to avoid the trouble he has it in his power to give them. All private traders with the company's packets, enjoy the same privileges, on paying two per cent. to the company, one to the agent, and one to the broker. All private trade, either by European or country ships, has long been engrossed by the company's servants.","sp":457,"ep":457},{"h":"GOMERA","t":"one of the Canary islands, lying between Ferro and Teneriffe.

It lies upon the top of a hill of considerable height, and consists of about 10,000 families in times of peace. The houses are chiefly of clay, with roofs thatched in the form of cones. At the west end of the town is the king's palace; formerly, as Mr Bruce informs us, a structure of considerable consequence, being a large square building four stories high, flanked with square towers, and affording from the top of it a magnificent view of all the country southward to the lake Tzana. It was built in the time of Facilides, by masons from India, and by such Abyssinians as had been instructed in architecture by the Jesuits before their expulsion. Great part of it is now in ruins, having been burnt at different times; but there is still ample lodging in the two lowest floors, the audience chamber being above 120 feet long. By the side of this structure there have been built by different kings apartments of clay only, in the fashion of their own country. The palace, with all its contiguous buildings, is surrounded by a double stone wall thirty feet high and a mile and a half in circumference, with battlements upon the outer wall, and a parapet roof between the outer and inner, by which you can go along the whole and look into the street. The hill on which the town is built rises in the middle of a deep valley, through which run two rivers: one of which, the Kakhia, coming from the Mountain of the Sun, flanks all the south of the town; while the other, called the Angrab, falling from the mountain Woggora, encompasses it on the north and north-east; and both rivers unite at the bottom of the hill about a quarter of a mile south of the town. Upon the bank opposite to Gondar, on the other side of the river, is a large town of Mahometans; a great part of whom are employed in taking care of the king's and nobility's equipage, both when they take the field and when they return from it. They are formed into a body under proper officers; but never fight on either side, being entirely confined to the occupation just mentioned, in which by their care and dexterity in pitching and striking the tents, and in leading and conducting the baggage-waggons, they are of great service.\u2014The valley of Gondar is described as having three outlets; one south, to Dembea, Maittha, and the Agows; another on the north-west, towards Sennaar, from which it is distant 180 miles, over the Mountain of the Sun; and the third north, leading to Woggora, over the high mountain Lamalmon, and so on through Tigre to the Red Sea.","sp":458,"ep":458},{"h":"GONDI","t":"JOHN FRANCIS PAUL, Cardinal de Retz, was the son of Philip Emanuel de Gondi, Count de Joigny, lieutenant-general, &c., and was born in 1613. From a doctor of the Sorbonne, he first became coadjutor to his uncle John Francis de Gondi, whom he succeeded in 1654 as archbishop of Paris; and was finally made a cardinal. This extraordinary person has drawn his own character in his memoirs with impartiality. He was a man who, from the greatest degree of debauchery, and still languishing under its consequences, made himself adored by the people as a preacher. At the age of 23, he was at the head of a conspiracy against the life of Cardinal Richelieu; he precipitated the parliament into cabals, and the people into sedition; he was (says M. Voltaire) the first bishop who carried on a civil war without the mask of religion. However, his intrigues and schemes turned out so ill, that he was obliged to quit France; and he lived the life of a vagrant exile for five or six years, till the death of his great enemy Cardinal Mazarin, when he returned on certain stipulated conditions. After afflicting in the conclave at Rome, which chose Clement IX., he retired from the world, and ended his life like a philosopher in 1679; which made Voltaire say, that in his youth he lived like Catiline, and like Atticus in his old age.

M. de Lagny's method of goniometry consists in measuring the angles with a pair of compasses, and that without any scale whatever, except an undivided semicircle. Thus, having any angle drawn...\nGonorrhea drawn upon paper, to be measured; produce one of the sides of the angle backwards behind the angular point; then with a pair of fine compasses describe a pretty large semicircle from the angular point as a centre, cutting the sides of the proposed angle, which will intercept a part of the semicircle. Take then this intercepted part very exactly between the points of the compasses, and turn them successively over upon the arc of the semicircle, to find how often it is contained in it, after which there is commonly some remainder: then take this remainder in the compasses, and in like manner find how often it is contained in the last of the integral parts of the first arc, with again some remainder: find in like manner how often this last remainder is contained in the former; and so on continually, till the remainder become too small to be taken and applied as a measure. By this means he obtains a series of quotients, or fractional parts, one of another, which being properly reduced into one fraction, give the ratio of the first arc to the semicircle, or of the proposed angle to two right angles, or 180 degrees, and consequently that angle itself in degrees and minutes. *Hutton's Math.

It is observed on the Friday in holy or passion week; and it is called, by way of eminence, good, because of the blessed effects of our Saviour's sufferings, which were a propitiatory or expiating sacrifice for the sins of the world. The commemoration of our Saviour's sufferings has been kept from the very first ages of Christianity, and was always observed as a day of the strictest fasting and humiliation. Among the Saxons it was called Long-Friday; but for what reason, except on account of the long fastings and offices then used, is uncertain. On Good Friday the pope sits on a plain form; and, after service is ended, when the cardinals wait on him back to his chamber, they are obliged to keep a deep silence, as a testimony of their sorrow. In the night of Good-Friday, the Greeks perform the obsequies of our Saviour round a great crucifix, laid on a bed of state, adorned with flowers; these the bishops distribute among the assistants when the office is ended. The Armenians, on this day, set open a holy sepulchre, in imitation of that of Mount Calvary.\n\n**Good Hope**, or Cape of Good Hope, a promontory of Africa, where the Dutch have built a good town and fort. It is situated in the country of the Hottentots: for an account of whom, and of the country at large, with its first discovery, see the article HOTTENTOTS.\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope has been generally esteemed the most southerly point of Africa, though it is not truly so. In Philipps's Voyage to Botany Bay *, we are *P. 39* told, that the land which projects farthest to the south is a point to the east of it, called by the English Cape Lagallus; a name corrupted from the original Portuguese das Aguilar, which, as well as the French appellation des Aiguelles, is descriptive of its form, and would rightly be translated Needle cape.\n\nOn approaching the cape, a very remarkable emi-\nGood Hope, hence may in clear weather be discovered at a considerable distance; and is called the Table-mountain from its appearance, as it terminates in a flat horizontal surface, from which the face of the rock descends almost perpendicularly. In the mild or summer season, which commences in September, and continues till March, the Table Land or Mountain, is sometimes suddenly capped with a white cloud, by some called the spreading of the Table-cloth. When this cloud seems to roll down the steep face of the mountain, it is a sure indication of an approaching gale of wind from the south-east; which generally blows with great violence, and sometimes continues a day or more, but in common is of short duration. On the first appearance of this cloud, the ships in Table Bay begin to prepare for it, by striking yards and top-masts, and making every thing as snug as possible.\u2014A little to the westward of the Table Land, divided by a small valley, stands on the right hand side of Table Bay a round hill, called the Sugar Loaf; and by many the Lion's Head, as there is a continuance from it contiguous to the sea, called the Lion's Rump; and when you take a general view of the whole, it very much resembles that animal with his head erect. The Sugar Loaf or Lion's Head, and the Lion's Rump, have each a flag flown on them, by which the approach of ships is made known to the governor, particularizing their number, nation, and the quarter from which they come. To the eastward, separated by a small chain from the Table Land, stands Charles's Mount, well known by the appellation of the Devil's Tower, or Devil's Head; and so called from the violent gusts of wind supposed to issue from it when it partakes of the cap that covers the Table Land, though these gusts are nothing more than a degree of force the wind acquires in coming through the chain. When this phenomenon appears in the morning, which is by no means so frequent as in the evening, the sailors have a saying, as the Devil's Tower is almost contiguous to the Table Land, that the old gentleman is going to breakfast; if in the middle of the day, that he is going to dinner; and if in the evening, that the cloth is spread for supper. Table-mountain rises about 3567 feet above the level of the sea; the Devil's Tower, about 3368; and the Lion's Head, 2764. In the neighbourhood of the latter lies Constantia, a district consisting of two farms, wherein the famous wines of that name are produced.\n\nThe above described high lands form a kind of amphitheatre about the Table-valley, where the Cape-town stands. This is situated at the bottom of the middle height, or Table-mountain; and almost in the centre of the Table Bay, so called from that mountain.\u2014This bay, it is observed in Phillips's Voyage, \"cannot properly be called a port, being by no means a station of security; it is exposed to all the violence of the winds which set into it from the sea; and is far from sufficiently secured from those which blow from the land. The gusts which descend from the summit of Table-mountain are sufficient to force ships from their anchors, and even violently to annoy persons on the shore, by destroying any tents or other temporary edifices, which may be erected, and raising clouds of fine dust, which produce very troublesome effects. A gale of this kind, from the south-east, blew for three days successively when Captain Cook lay here in his first voyage; at which time, he informs us, the Good Hope-Resolution was the only ship in the harbour that had not dragged her anchor. The storms from the sea are still more formidable; so much so, that ships have frequently been driven by them from their anchorage, and wrecked at the head of the bay. But these accidents happen chiefly in the quadra mousson, or winter months, from May 14th to the same day of August; during which time few ships venture to anchor here. Our fleet arriving later, lay perfectly unmolested as long as it was necessary for it to remain in this station.\u2014False Bay, on the south-east side of the Cape, is more secure than Table Bay during the prevalence of the north-west winds, but still less so in strong gales from the south-east. It is, however, less frequented, being 24 miles of very heavy road distant from Cape Town, whence almost all necessaries must be procured. The most sheltered part of False Bay is a recess on the west side, called Simon's Bay.\"\n\nMr White, in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, thus describes Cape Town. From the shipping, he observes*, the town appears pleasantly situated, but at the same time small; a deception that arises from its being built in a valley with such stupendous mountains directly behind it. On landing, however, you are surprized, and agreeably disappointed, to find it not only extensive, but well built, and in a good style; the streets spacious, and intersecting each other at right angles with great precision. This exactness in the formation of the streets, when viewed from the Table Land, is observed to be very great. The houses in general are built of stone, cemented together with a glutinous kind of earth which serves as mortar, and afterwards neatly plastered and whitewashed with lime. As to their height they do not in common exceed two stories, on account of the violence of the wind, which at some seasons of the year blows with great strength and fury. For the same reason thatch has been usually preferred to tiles or shingles; but the bad effects that have proceeded from this mode when fires happen, has induced the inhabitants in all their new buildings to give the preference to slates and tiles. The lower parts of the houses, according to the custom of the Dutch nation, are not only uncommonly neat and clean in appearance, but they are really so; and the furniture is rather rich than elegant. But this is by no means the case with the bedrooms or upper apartments; which are very barely and ill furnished. The streets are rough, uneven, and unpaved. But many of the houses have a space flagged before the door; and others have trees planted before them, which form a pleasant shade, and give an agreeable air to the streets.\n\nThe only landing-place is at the east end of the town, where there is a wooden quay running some paces into the sea, with several cranes on it for the convenience of loading and unloading the scows that come alongside. To this place excellent water is conveyed by pipes, which makes the watering of ships both easy and expeditious. Closer to the quay, on the left hand, stands the castle and principal fortres; a strong extensive work, having excellent accommodations for the troops, and for many of the civil officers belonging to the company. Within the gates, the company have their principal stores; which are spacious as well as convenient. This fort covers and defends the east part of the town and harbour.\nGood Hope-bour, as Amsterdam fort does the west part. The latter, which has been built since Commodore Johnstone's expedition, and wherein both French and Dutch judgment have been united to render it effectual and strong, is admirably planned and calculated to annoy and harass ships coming into the bay. Some smaller detached fortifications extend along the coast, both to the east and west, and make landing, which was not the case before the late war, hazardous and difficult. In a word, Cape Town is at this time fortified with strength, regularity, and judgment.\n\nThe governor's house is delightfully situated, nearly in the centre of an extensive garden, the property of the Dutch East India company, tastefully planted, and at the same time elegantly laid out. The governor's family make what use they please of the produce of the garden, which is various and abundant; but the original intention of the company in appropriating so extensive a piece of ground to this purpose was, that their hospital, which is generally pretty full when their ships arrive after long voyages, may be well supplied with fruits and vegetables, and likewise that their ships may receive a similar supply. This garden is as public as St James's park; and for its handsome, pleasant, and well-shaded walks, is much frequented by persons of every description, but particularly by the fashionable and gay. At the upper end of the principal walk is a small space walled in for the purpose of confining some large ostriches and a few deer; and a little to the right of this is a small menagerie, in which the company have half a dozen wild animals and about the same number of curious birds.\n\nThere are two churches in the town; one large, plain, and unadorned, for the Calvinists, the prevailing sect; and a smaller one for the Lutherans. The hospital, which is large and extensive, is situated at the upper end of the town, close to the company's garden; where the convalescents reap the benefit of a wholesome pure air, perfumed with the exhalations of a great variety of rich fruit trees, aromatic shrubs, and odoriferous plants and flowers; and likewise have the use of every production of it.\n\nBesides their hospital, the Dutch East India company have several other public buildings, which tend to improve the appearance of the town. The two principal of these are, the stables and a house for their slaves. The former is a handsome range of buildings, capable of containing an incredible number of horses. Those they have at the Cape are small, spirited, and full of life. The latter is a building of considerable extent, where the slaves, both male and female, have separate apartments, in a very comfortable style, to reside in after the fatigues and toil of the day; and there are several officers placed over them, who have commodious apartments, and treat them humanely.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Cape, though in their persons large, stout, and athletic, have not all that phlegm about them which is the characteristic of Dutchmen in general. The physical influence of climate may in some degree account for this; for it is well known that in all southern latitudes the temper and disposition of the people are more gay, and that they are more inclined to luxury and amusements of every kind, than the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere. The ladies are lively, good natured, and familiar; and from a peculiar gay turn, they admit of liberties that would be thought prehensible in England, though perhaps they as seldom overleap the bounds of virtue as the women of other countries.\n\nThe heavy draft work about the Cape is mostly performed by oxen; which are here brought to an uncommon degree of usefulness and docility. It is not uncommon to see 14, 16, and sometimes 18, in one of their teams; when the roads are heavy, they sometimes, though rarely, yoke 25; all which the Hottentots, Malays, and Cape slaves, have in the most perfect subjection and obedience. One of these fellows places himself on the fore part of the waggon, or, when loaded, on the top of the load, and with a tremendous long whip, which from its size he is obliged to hold in both his hands, manages these creatures with inexpressible address. When he finds expedition needful, he can make them keep whatever pace he chooses, either trot or gallop, (a gait performed or kept up with difficulty by European oxen), and that with as much ease as if he was driving horses. They likewise manage horses with the same dexterity; and to see one of them driving three, four, five, and sometimes six pair, in hand, with one of these long whips, would make the most complete master of the whip in England cut a despicable figure. Carriages are not very numerous at the Cape, as the inhabitants in general travel in covered waggons, which better suit the roughness of the country. The governor and some few of the principal people keep coaches, which are a good deal in the English style, and always drawn by six horses.\n\nThe Cape of Good Hope was taken by the British on 17th August 1796, with little or no difficulty, and afterwards given up at the peace of 1801. It has been since retaken, and is at present (1806) in the possession of the British.\n\nWhen the news of the capture of this important settlement reached England, it was considered as of incalculable value to the East India Company in particular, forming a barrier or grand outwork to their immense possessions in India. They obtained the unconditional grant of supplying the Cape with India and China goods, and care was taken to defeat every attempt that could be made to undermine their interest. Aware of its great importance, it was the resolution of ministry, \"that no foreign power, directly or indirectly, should obtain possession of the Cape of Good Hope, for that it was the physical guarantee of the British territories in India.\" While all were convinced of its political importance, none disputed its commercial advantages.\n\nIts geographical position on the globe is so commanding a feature, that the mere looking at a map, independent of any other information, must shew its value and importance in various respects. Its distance from the coast of Brazil is a month's voyage; from the Dutch colonies of Surinam, Berbice, and Essequibo, it is a voyage of six weeks; it is about equally distant from the Red sea, and two months from Coromandel and Malabar. It is half way between Britain and India, in a temperate climate, and productive of every species of refreshment in great abundance.\n\nConsidered in the light of a naval station, the importance of the Cape is equally conspicuous. It may serve as a port for refreshing and refitting the ships of\nGood Hope, the East India Company; a station, for ships of war keeping the entrance into the Indian seas, and affording by its geographical position, a ready communication with every part of the globe. There is no place in the homeward bound voyage from India, so proper or convenient for the valuable fleets of the East India Company, to assemble at for convoy, as the Cape of Good Hope. Their crews might be refreshed with fruits, vegetables, and fresh provisions, at a very reasonable rate. Salt beef for the remainder of the voyage might there be laid in. An establishment for curing salt provisions, would be an incalculable saving to the Company, as well as a singular convenience. The moderate expense at which a fleet could here be maintained, is a circumstance that deserves attention. At the Cape a sailor may be furnished his ration of fresh beef or mutton, biscuit and wine, for one-fourth of what the same ration of salt beef costs the government when sent out from Britain. He can have a pint of wine for threepence, and were it not for the monopoly of that article, he might purchase it for half the sum.\n\nIf a naval establishment was formed at Saldanha bay, many coasting vessels and fishing ships would be constructed in it, as it abounds with every convenience that could be required for building ships, which would be the means of very much increasing the coasting trade.\n\nTo what extent the Cape might have been rendered advantageous to the British empire as an emporium of eastern produce, as furnishing articles of export for consumption in Europe and the West Indies, and taking articles of British growth and manufacture in exchange for colonial produce, it may be proper to enquire. The chief objection against this use of the Cape is the prejudice it would occasion to the fairs of Leadenhall street, and the diminution of his majesty's customs; for though the East India Company might be made responsible to the crown for the duties on the amount of its sales at the Cape, yet the intention of the emporium would be entirely defeated, if the duties demanded there so far enhanced the value of the Indian commodities, as to make it equally eligible for foreign shipping to proceed to India, or to resort to the London market. The East India Company could supply their emporium at the Cape with the produce and manufacture of Great Britain to any amount, and at so cheap a rate as to undersell any other nation.\n\nShould the Cape become a commercial depot in the hands of the East India Company, the consumption in Spanish and Portuguese America, of eastern produce, would increase to a very great extent, for all which they would pay in specie, of which the Company stand in the greatest need for their China trade.\n\nA new branch of traffic might be opened between the Cape and New South Wales, the latter supplying the former with coals, of which they have abundant mines, in exchange for cattle, butter, wine, and articles of clothing.\n\nThe Cape may also be considered as of advantage to the British nation, by furnishing articles of export for general consumption in Europe and the West Indies. These are grain and pulse, wine and brandy, wool, hides, and skins, whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap and candles, aloes, ivory, and tobacco.\n\nWere a depot for the southern whale fishery established at the Cape, it might be attended with beneficial consequences. By promoting navigation, the strength and security of the British empire are also promoted, and its very existence as an independent nation is owing to the superiority of its navy. A nation of fishermen implies a nation of seamen, a race of bold and hardy warriors. The cultivation of the fisheries would afford a never-failing supply of men so instructed, increase our conveniency, and promote our commerce.\n\nThe colony of the Cape comprehends at least 120,000 square miles, yet the whole population of whites, blacks, and Hottentots, does not exceed 60,000 souls, or a single individual for every two square miles. The upper regions of the mountains are masses of sandstone, and where the waters break out in springs upon the surface of the plains, vegetation is very luxuriant. In the vicinity of the Cape, where the soil is coloured with iron, or oxide of iron combined with clay, the most luxuriant crops of grapes are produced. The climate in general is friendly to vegetation, but being within the influence of the periodical winds, the rains are very unequal.\n\nThe chief rivers on the south coast are the Gauritz, Knyfna, Keurboom, Camtoos, Zwartkops, Sunday, and Great Fish rivers, and the two principal rivers on the western coast are the Berg, or mountain river, and the Oliphant river, which falls into the Southern Atlantic in 31\u00b0 30' S.

He came young to London; where he supported himself by teaching languages, until he procured employment under the earl of Oxford in Queen Anne's time, but in what capacity is not now known. He first distinguished himself in the defence of Dr Hoadley in the Bangorian controversy; which recommended him to Mr Trenchard, in conjunction with whom he wrote the well-known Cato's Letters, upon a variety of important public subjects. These were followed by another periodical paper, under the title of the Independent Whig; which was continued some years after Mr Trenchard's death, by Gordon alone, against the hierarchy of the church; but with more acrimony than was shown in Cato's Letters. At length Sir Robert Walpole retained him to defend his administration, to which end he wrote several pamphlets. At the time of his death, July 28th 1750, he was first commissioner of the wine licences, an office which he had enjoyed many years. He was twice married. His second wife was the widow of his great friend Trenchard, by whom he had children.\u2014He published English translations of Sallust and Tacitus, with additional discourses to each author, which contain much good matter. Also, two collections of his tracts have been preserved: the first entitled, A Cordial for Low-spirits, in three volumes; and the second, The Pillars of Priestcraft and Orthodoxy shaken, in two volumes. But these, like many other pious things, had better have been suppressed. In his translations as well as his other works he places the verbs at the ends of sentences, according to the Latin idiom, in a very stiff and affected manner.","sp":463,"ep":463},{"h":"GORDONIA","t":"a genus of plants, belonging to the monadelphous clasps.

Linnaeus and Dr Pallas consider them as of a mixed nature in their growth, between animals and vegetables; but Mr Ellis shows them to be true animals of the polype kind, growing up in a branched form resembling a shrub, and in no part vegetable. They differ from the fresh water polype in many of their qualities, and particularly in producing from their own substance a hard and solid support, serving many of the purposes of the bone in other animals. This is formed by a concreting juice thrown out from a peculiar set of longitudinal parallel tubes, running along the internal surface of the fleshy part: in the coats of these tubes are a number of small orifices, through which the osseous liquor exudes, and concreting, forms the layers of that hard part of the annular circles, which some, judging from the confluence rather than the texture, have erroneously denominated wood. The surface of the gorgonia is composed of a kind of scales, so well adapted to each other as to serve for defence from external injuries: and the flesh, or, as some have called it, the bark or cortex, consists of proper muscles and tendons for extending the openings of their cells; for lending forth from thence their polype suckers in search of food; and for drawing them in suddenly, and contracting the sphincter muscles of these starry cells, in order to secure these tender parts from danger; and also of proper secretory ducts, to furnish and deposit the osseous matter that forms the stem and branches as well as the base of the bone.

They are described with wings on their shoulders, with serpents round their heads, their hands were of braids, and their teeth of a prodigious size, so that they were objects of terror to mankind.

The queen was passionately fond of hunting and war, so that she laid the neighbouring countries quite waste. At last, Perseus having made war on them, and killed the queen herself, when he came to take a view of the field of battle, he found the queen's corpse of extremely beautiful, that he ordered her head to be cut off, which he carried with him to show his countrymen the Greeks, who could not behold it without being struck with astonishment.\n\nOthers represent them as a kind of monstrous women, covered with hair, who lived in woods and forests.

Gossypium, belonging to the monadelphia class, and in the natural method ranking under the 37th order, Colummiferae. See Botany Index.\n\nThe American islands produce cotton shrubs of various sizes, which rise and grow up without any culture; especially in low and marshy grounds. Their produce is of a pale red; some paler than others; but so short that it cannot be spun. None of this is brought to Europe, though it might be usefully employed in making of hats. The little that is picked up, serves to make matrasses and pillows.\n\nThe cotton-shrub that supplies our manufactures, requires a dry and stony soil, and thrives best in grounds that have already been tilled. Not but that the plant appears more flourishing in fresh lands than in those which are exhausted; but while it produces more wood, it bears less fruit.\n\nA western exposure is fitted for it. The culture of it begins in March and April, and continues during the first spring-rains. Holes are made at seven or eight feet distance from each other, and a few seeds thrown in. When they are grown to the height of five or six inches, all the stems are pulled up, except two or three of the strongest. These are cropped twice before the end of August. This precaution is the more necessary, as the wood bears no fruit till after the second pruning; and, if the shrub was suffered to grow more than four feet high, the crop would not be the greater, nor the fruit so easily gathered. The same method is pursued for three years; for so long the shrub may continue, if it cannot conveniently be renewed often with the prospect of an advantage that will compensate the trouble.\n\nThis useful plant will not thrive if great attention is not paid to pluck up the weeds that grow about it. Frequent rains will promote its growth; but they must not be incessant. Dry weather is particularly necessary in the months of March and April, which is the time of gathering the cotton, to prevent it from being discoloured and spotted.\n\nWhen it is all gathered in, the seeds must be picked out from the wool with which they are naturally mixed. This is done by means of a cotton-mill; which is an engine composed of two rods of hard wood, about 18 feet long, 18 lines in circumference, and fluted two lines deep. They are confined at both ends, so as to leave no more distance between them than is necessary for the seed to slip through. At one end is a kind of little millstone, which, being put in motion with the foot, turns the rods in contrary directions. They separate the cotton, and throw out the seed contained in it.","sp":465,"ep":465},{"h":"GOTHA","t":"a town of Germany, in the circle of Upper Saxony, and capital of the duchy of Saxe-Gotha, in E.

Some fancy this town had its name from the Goths, and that they fortified it in their march to Italy; but it was only a village till surrounded with walls by the bishop of Mentz in 964. It is situated in a fine plain on the river Leina, well built and strongly fortified. Here are two handsome churches and a very good hospital. Its chief trade is in dyers wood, of which they have three crops, but the third grows wild. The neighbouring country produces a vast deal of corn. The castle or ducal palace\nGothard of Gotha was rebuilt in the 16th century by duke Ernest, farnamed the Pious, who caused both that and the town to be encompassed with ditches and ramparts; and gave it the name of Friederichstein, or the Castle of Peace, in opposition to its ancient name of Grimmerstein, or the Castle of the Furies. It is situated on a neighbouring eminence, from whence there is a vast prospect of a fruitful plain. In one of the apartments there is a collection of valuable rarities, and a noble library.\n\nThe dukedom of Saxe Gotha is about 30 miles long, and 12 broad. The reigning duke is Lewis Ernest, born in 1745, and married to the princess Maria Charlotte of Saxe Meningen, by whom he has issue.

He has several other principalities besides that of Saxe Gotha; and his revenues are computed at 200,000l. a-year, with which he maintains about 3000 regular troops.

According to the most probable accounts they were the first inhabitants of those countries; and from thence sent colonies into the islands of the Baltic, the Cimbrian Chertonefus, and the adjacent places yet destitute of inhabitants. The time of their first settling in Scandinavia, and the time when they first peopled with their colonies the above-mentioned islands and Chertonefus, are equally uncertain; though the Gothic annals suppose the latter to have happened in the time of Serug the great grandfather of Abraham. This first migration of the Goths is said to have been conducted by their king Eric; in which all the ancient Gothic chronicles, as well as the Danish and Swedish ones, agree. Their second migration is supposed to have happened many ages after; when, the above-mentioned countries being overstocked with people, Berig, at that time king of the Goths, went out with a fleet in quest of new settlements. He landed in the country of the Ulmerugians, now Pomerania, drove out the ancient inhabitants, and divided their lands among his followers. He fell next upon the Vandals, whose country bordered on that of the Ulmerugians, and overcame them; but instead of forcing them to abandon their country, he only made them share their possessions with the Goths.\n\nThe Goths who had settled in Pomerania and the adjacent parts of Germany being greatly increased, inasmuch that the country could no longer contain them, they undertook a third migration in great numbers, under Fillimer farnamed the Great, their fifth prince after leaving Scandinavia; and taking their route eastward, entered Scythia, advanced to the Cimmerian Bosphorus, and driving out the Cimmerians, settled in the neighbourhood of the Palus Maeotis. Thence in process of time, being greatly increased in Scythia, they resolved to seek new settlements; and, accordingly taking their route eastward, they traversed several countries, and at length returned into Germany.\n\nTheir leader in this expedition was the celebrated Woden, called also Woden, Othen, Oden, Godan, and Guadan. Of this Woden many wonderful things are related in the Sueo-gothic chronicles. He was king of the Afgardians, whom the northern writers will have to be the same with a people called Alpurgians mentioned by Strabo and Ptolemy. By Strabo they are placed near the Cimmerian Bosphorus. Apurgia was the metropolis of a province which Strabo calls Asia; and Woden and his followers are styled by the ancient Gothic writers Afa, Aflana, and Afsota. The kings of Apurgia were masters of all that part of Scythia which lay to the westward of Imaus, and was by the Latins called Scythia intra Imaum, or \"Scythia within Imaus.\"\n\nAt what time Woden reigned in this country, is quite uncertain; but all historians agree, that he went out in quest of new settlements with incredible numbers of people following him. He first entered Roxolania, comprehending the countries of Prussia, Livonia, and great part of Mucovoy. From thence he went by sea into the north parts of Germany; and having reduced Saxony and Jutland, he at last settled in Sweden, where he reigned till his death, and became so famous that his name reached all countries, and he was by the northern nations worshipped as a god. He is supposed to have brought with him the Runic characters out of Asia, and to have taught the northern nations the art of poetry; whence he is styled the father of the Scaldi or Scaldr, their poets, who described in verse the exploits of the great men of their nation, as the bards did among the Gauls and Britons.\n\nThe Romans distinguished the Goths into two classes; the Ostrogoths and Visigoths. These names they received before they left Scandinavia, the Visigoths being\ning softened by the Latins from Westerogoths, or those who inhabited the western part of Scandinavia, as the Ostrogoths were those who inhabited the eastern part of that country. Their history affords nothing of moment till the time of their quarrelling with the Romans; which happened under the reign of the emperor Caracalla, son to Severus. After that time their history becomes so closely interwoven with that of the Romans, that for the most remarkable particulars of it we must refer to the article ROME. After the destruction of the Roman empire by the Heruli, the Ostrogoths, under their king Theodoric, became masters of the greatest part of Italy, having overcome and put to death Odoacer king of the Heruli in 494. They retained their dominion in this country till the year 553; when they were finally conquered by Narfes, the emperor Justinian's general. See (History of) ITALY.\n\nThe Visigoths settled in Spain in the time of the emperor Honorius, where they founded a kingdom which continued till the country was subdued by the Saracens. See SPAIN.\n\nThe Goths were famous for their hospitality and kindness to strangers, even before they embraced the Christian religion. Nay, it is said, that from their being eminently good, they were called Goths by the neighbouring nations; that name, according to Gratus and most other writers, being derived from the German word goten, which signifies \"good.\" They encouraged, says Dio, the study of philosophy above all other barbarous or foreign nations, and often chose kings from among their philosophers. Polygamy was not only allowed but countenanced among them; every one being valued or respected according to the number of his wives. By so many wives they had an incredible number of children, of whom they kept but one at home, sending out the rest in quest of new settlements; and hence those swarms of people which overran so many countries. With them adultery was a capital crime, and irremissibly punished with death. This severity, and likewise polygamy, prevailed among them when they were known to the Romans only by the name of Get\u00e6 (their most ancient name); as appears from the poet Menander, who was himself one of that nation; and from Horace, who greatly commends the chastity of their women. Their laws fell little short of those of the ancient Romans. Their government was monarchical; their religion was much the same with that of the ancient Germans or Celtes; and their dress is described by Apollinaris Sidonius in the following words: \"They are shod (says he) with high shoes made of hair, and reaching up to their ankles; their knees, thighs, and legs, are without any covering; their garments of various colours scarce reaching to the knee; their sleeves only cover the top of their arms; they wear green callocks with a red border; their belts hang on their shoulder; their ears are covered with twisted locks; they use hooked lances and missile weapons.\"","sp":466,"ep":467},{"h":"IK","t":"\\( \\frac{AB^4}{IK^4} : \\frac{IK^4}{Y^4} \\); \\( \\frac{AB^4}{IK^4} : \\frac{IK^4}{Y^4} \\); \\( \\frac{AB^4}{IK^4} : \\frac{IK^4}{Y^4} \\); but \\( \\frac{Y^4}{IK^4} \\) (8. 4.) therefore \\( \\frac{AB^4}{IK^4} : \\frac{IK^4}{Y^4} \\); \\( \\frac{AB^4}{IK^4} : \\frac{IK^4}{Y^4} \\); therefore, prism AG : prism IP :: AB\u00b3 : IK\u00b3.\n\n**Theorem XIII.**\n\nIf a triangular pyramid ABCD be cut by a plane Fig. 144.\nbcd parallel to its base, the section bcd is fi-\nmilar to the base BCD.\n\nFor because the planes bcd, BCD are parallel, their\nintersections bc, BC with a third plane BAC are pa-\nrallel (7. 7.); and, for a like reason, cd is parallel to","sp":314,"ep":314},{"h":"MARCH","t":"Sect.

Kitchen Garden.\n\nWe need not here give a detailed account of the methods of performing many of the things mentioned under this head, in the two preceding months, though most of them might be performed now with better prospect of success, as this is the principal month in the year for sowing and planting full crops of the greater part of kitchen-garden vegetables. We shall, therefore, merely enumerate them. Make hot-beds. Sow cucumbers and melons. Transplant and sow cauliflower. Transplant and sow cabbage. Transplant and sow lettuce. Sow spinach, onions, leeks, radishes, carrots, parsnips, beets, beans, peas, turnips, celery, small salad, parsley, fennel, and Hamburg parsley. Plant thistle, garlic, scorzonera, and rockambole.\n\nSome seed of the early purple and cauliflower broccoli should be sown, both about the beginning and towards the end of the month, in a bed of rich earth, in an open situation, to raise plants to be fit for the table the following autumn. For the subsequent management, see April, May, June, and July.\n\nThe seeds of the sea cabbage (Crambe maritima) may be sown any time this month, in narrow beds of light earth, about four feet wide, for the convenience of weeding. They may either be sown all over the surface of the bed, tolerably thick, when they are to be transplanted, or in drills a foot and a half or two feet apart, where they are to remain. Those plants are perennial, and every year push up thick succulent shoots. They should be covered, some time during the course of the winter, with dry earth, to the depth of a few inches, by which the young shoots, as they come up in spring, are blanched and become fit for use. They should be cut as soon as they appear above ground, or very soon after, in the manner of asparagus.\n\nSow brown and green cole, or bore cole.\n\nAny time in the course of the month some seeds of brown and green cole (kale) may be sown in an open situation, for when they are shaded they are apt to grow up tall and weak. The plants raised now will be fit for planting out in summer, and may be cut for use any time from autumn to spring.\n\nAbout the beginning of this month asparagus seed may be sown in narrow beds of good earth in an open situation. The seed may be scattered regularly all over the surface of the bed, raked in, and then receive a slight covering of earth from the alleys, or in drills, about an inch deep, at the distance of six inches from one another. The plants will appear above ground in March or five weeks, when they ought to be kept clear of weeds, and watered occasionally during dry weather. The plants raised now will be fit for transplanting next spring into beds, where they are to remain and produce crops, or into plots, to remain for a year or two till they be fit for forcing.\n\nThis is a proper season for making plantations of asparagus, for which purpose young plants of one or two years old are commonly used. They succeed best in a deep light soil, and in an exposed situation. The ground should be well manured, dug to the depth of 12 or 15 inches, and divided into beds of the breadth of four feet and a half, in which the asparagus may be planted in rows, 10 or 12 inches apart, and about the same distance from each other in the rows. The usual mode of planting them is to stretch a garden line along the bed, and to form a drill with a spade, to the depth of about six inches, in which the asparagus roots are placed with their crowns or buds uppermost.\n\nA crop of onions may be sown in beds when it is an object to make the most of the ground.\n\nThe surface of asparagus beds should be loosened or dressed, turned over with a fork, in the course of this month. The instrument commonly made use of for this purpose, is a fork with three flat blunt prongs. Care must be taken not to dig too deep, lest the tops of the asparagus roots should receive injury. Immediately after the surfaces of the beds have been loosened, they should be raked over; for if the raking were to be deferred for some time till the buds of the asparagus approach the surface of the ground, they might be broken by the teeth of the rake. Asparagus beds will continue to produce good crops for 10 or 12 years, if properly managed. They ought not to be cut till the third or fourth year after they have been planted in rich soils; however, a few of the strongest shoots may be cut even in the second, but it should be done sparingly. When asparagus has advanced to the height of three or four inches above ground, it should be collected for the table; but as the shoots are commonly cut about three inches under the surface of the ground, care must be taken not to injure the rising buds (for several buds rise in succession from the same root), for this reason, it is commonly cut with an instrument made on purpose, called an asparagus knife, which should be introduced close by the shoot to the requisite depth, and directed so as to cut it off obliquely.\n\nArtichoke plants, that were earthed up during winter to protect them from frost, should now be exaderted, mined; and if their stems appear to push up vigorously, and the earth ought to be removed and levelled. The foil should likewise be loosened from the plants, and if many shoots proceed from the same root, they should all be taken away except three of the strongest. The redundant shoots, if carefully detached from the main roots, may be employed to form new plantations; the earth, therefore, should be so far removed as to allow the hand to be introduced to slip them close to their insertion.\n\nPlantations of young artichokes are made towards the end of this or in the course of next month, as soon, indeed, as the offsets (the only way in which this plant is propagated) can be procured. For this purpose choose a plot of good ground, dig in a good quantity of\nMarch. of rotten dung, and plant the offsets with a dibble after their tops and roots have been trimmed a little (if it appear necessary), in rows about four feet and a half asunder, and at the distance of from two to three feet in the rows. A crop of spinach, lettuce, radishes, &c., may be got from the ground the first year, without injuring the artichokes. This plantation will produce heads in September and October, and will continue to produce plentiful crops for five or seven years. Whenever artichokes are required late in the season, young plantations ought to be formed every year, as it is from them alone that heads may be expected late in autumn; for the old plantations generally produce them in June, July, and August. There are two sorts, the large globe, and the French or green oval artichoke; the former is commonly preferred, on account of the size of the head and the quantity of eatable matter they afford.\n\nPot-herbs propagated.\n\nSow skirrets.\n\nKidney beans, and carrots.\n\nJerusalem artichokes.\n\nMarch. Kitchen Garden.","sp":52,"ep":53},{"h":"MAY","t":"Sect. I. Kitchen Garden.\n\nMelons require attention, particularly when their fruit are setting. The heat of the hot-beds must be of melons, kept up by proper linings; water must be given moderately, and air admitted regularly. In warm weather when the sun shines bright, the plants should be shaded from its rays for an hour or two about mid-day, by a covering of mats or something of that nature. A piece of tile or slate should be placed under each fruit after it is set, to prevent it from coming into contact with the moist earth of the bed, which would injure it, and cause it to drop off. Ridges may be formed for the reception of the melon and cucumber plants, which were sown last, or preceding month, to be raised under hand or bell glases. These ridges should be about four feet wide, and are to be constructed in the same manner as hot-beds. See January. The dung should be raised to the height of two feet and half, and covered with six or eight inches of rich light earth, and may be made either in trenches about a foot deep or on the surface of the ground. When more than one ridge is to be constructed, they should be placed parallel to one another at the distance of about four feet, which interval should afterwards be filled up with fresh horse dung when the heat in the ridges begins to decline; this will both revive the heat, and when earthened over, will afford room to extend the advancing runners of the plants. As soon as the ridges are earthened over, the hand or bell glases may be put on along the middle of the bed, at the distance of four feet, when intended for melons, and three feet when for cucumbers; and the following day, or as soon after as the earth under the glases has become warm, a hole should be made under each, into which two melon or three cucumber plants are to be put with the ball of earth about their roots; the earth should then be well closed about the ball and stem of the plant, a little water given, and the glases put on. Shade them for a day or two, and give air during the day by raising the glases. When the plants have filled the glases, the runners must be trained out from under them, but this should not take place till the end of the month, or some time in June. Oil paper frames are sometimes used for covering the ridges. These frames...\nframes are made of thin slips of wood covered with paper, rendered transparent and water proof by means of oil. Melons reared in this way will produce plentifully in August and September, and cucumbers from the middle of June, till the cold weather in autumn set in. If no cucumber plants were raised in March or April for this purpose, some seeds may be sown in the ridges. Some may likewise be sown about the end of the month in the open ground, to produce a crop for pickling; but should cold weather prevail at that time, it should be deferred till June. Gourds and pumpkins may be sown in the open ground in a warm situation, or in a hot-bed, to be afterwards transplanted.\n\nA full crop of kidney beans may be planted both of the dwarf and tall running sorts: the former, viz., black speckled, Battersea and Canterbury white, should be planted in drills about an inch deep, and two feet and a half asunder, at the distance of two or three inches from each other; the latter, viz., the scarlet and large Dutch white, should be sown in drills, about an inch and a half deep, and three feet and a half or four asunder. These running kinds must have tall sticks, or some support of that nature.\n\nThe capsicum and love apples which were raised last or the preceding month in hot-beds, may be planted out into well sheltered situations exposed to the south.\n\nSome spinach plants, both of the smooth and prickly seeded, should be allowed to run up for seed; and some of the different kinds of radishes should be transplanted for the same purpose.\n\nThe different crops should be kept clear of weeds, and thinned with the hoe. Turnips may be left at the distance of seven or eight inches from each other; carrots, six or eight; parsnips, eight to ten or twelve; onions, four or five; Hamburg parsley, scorzonera, and salsify, six or seven; and cardoons, five or six; that they may acquire strength for final transplantation.\n\nPlant out cabbages, savoys, cauliflower, broccoli, and bore cole.\n\n**Sect. II. Fruit Garden.**\n\nAs wall trees will now have made vigorous shoots, a sufficient quantity of the best placed lateral, and all the terminal ones, should be trained to the wall, and all foreright, ill placed, superfluous, and very luxuriant shoots, should be removed. None of the young branches should be shortened, unless where a supply of new wood is wanted to fill up some vacant space. When the fruit stands too thick on wall trees, they should be thinned. When wall trees are infested with insects, means should be made use of to destroy them; the curled leaves should be picked off with a view to check their propagation: tobacco dust may be sometimes employed with advantage; but water sprinkled plentifully over the branches with an engine constructed on purpose, is the most efficacious remedy.\n\nLet vines both on walls and in vineyards be looked over; and let all superfluous branches, which proceed from the old wood or lateral shoots, which are pushed out by the young branches, be rubbed off; indeed this must be done constantly during the summer.\n\n**Sect. III. The Flower Garden, or Pleasure Ground.**\n\nTender annuals should be transplanted into newly formed hot-beds, when they are wished to flower early and in full perfection, particularly balsams and cocklecombs.\n\nLet the auricula plants in pots, which are past flowering, be placed in some situation where they may enjoy the free air and the sun till about ten o'clock in the morning.\n\nSome wallflower and stock gillyflower seed may be sown about the beginning of the month; cuttings also of flower, &c., double wall-flowers and stocks may be planted under bell and hand glasses, or in a shady border.\n\nPerennial and biennial plants that were sown last March, will be fit for transplanting about the end of biennials, the month into beds, where they may remain to acquire &c., strength.\n\n**Sect. IV. Nursery.**\n\nTowards the end of the month, the clay should be newly removed from newly grafted trees, and the bandages grafted loosed, because they might check the growth of the trees. grafts which will now shoot freely, and all buds under the graft should be carefully removed.\n\n**Sect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.**\n\nAbout the end of the month, if the weather should be favourable, the greater part of the plants may be removed from the green-house, and placed in some well-sheltered situation in the open air. The plants in the air-hot-house should receive water and air freely, particularly in bright weather.\n\n**June.**\n\n**Sect. I. Kitchen Garden.**\n\nThe same care of cucumbers and melons which was recommended for last month, is necessary now; the cucumbers sown in the open ground last month should be thinned, when they begin to push out their first rough leaves, and a few more seeds may be sown for the same purpose, but the earlier in the month the better. Transplant celery for blanching. For this purpose, form trenches, about a spade deep and three feet apart; lay the earth which comes out of the trenches regularly along each side; lay into each trench some well-rotten dung, and dig it in; put the plants in a row along the middle of the trench at the distance of four or five inches from one another. About a month or six weeks after they have been planted, when they have acquired the height of six or eight inches, a quantity of earth should be laid about their stems, to blanch them and prepare them for the table; this should be done during dry weather, and repeated once a fortnight, or according as the plants advance in growth, till they are blanched to the height of a foot or fifteen inches. The earlier sown celery will be fit for transplanting about the beginning of the month; the later sown, about the end.\n\nAbout the latter end of the month transplant endive.\nfor blanching; which should be planted out in rows, a foot apart, and at the same distance from one another in the row. Some endive seed should be sown for a principal crop; the green curled is commonly sown for this purpose, because it is least apt to be injured by rain or cold.\n\nThe cauliflower, broccoli, and bore-cole plants which were sown last month, should be planted out at the distance of about three inches from one another, into beds where they may remain, to acquire strength to fit them for final transplantation in July. Some of the early cauliflower plants, which have formed good heads, should be allowed to stand for seed, which will ripen in September.\n\nAbout the middle of this month is the best season for sowing a principal crop of turnips; the different kinds commonly sown, are the yellow, white Dutch, round white, stone-turnip, Swedish, black Rutland, small French round. The large white Norfolk, green topped, and red-topped, are chiefly used for field culture.\n\nPlant out leeks in rows nine inches asunder, and about six inches from one another in the row; it is an usual practice to trim off the extremities of their leaves and of their roots before they are planted.\n\nPlant out pot-herbs, such as thyme, savory, sweet-marjoram and hyssop; likewise angelica, marigolds, clary, &c. A rainy or dull day should be chosen, and the plants put in at the distance of six inches from one another; occasional watering will be necessary, till they have taken root. Cuttings or slips of sage, hyssop, rue, rosemary, lavender, &c. may be planted in a shady situation, and occasionally watered.\n\n**Sect. II. Fruit Garden.**\n\nWall trees, and vines in the vineyard, require the same attention this month that was recommended last. When plantations of strawberries are wanted, the young plants that are produced at the joints of the runners, that are furnished with good roots, should be taken up about the end of this month, and planted in a shady border at the distance of about six inches from one another; by September they will be fit to be planted out at the distance of a foot or fifteen inches from each other.\n\n**Sect. III. Flower Garden, or Pleasure Ground.**\n\nThe roots of hyacinths, jonquils, ranunculuses, &c. should be taken up after their stalks begin to decay, dried and preserved till planting season; the roots of narcissus, crocus, snow-drop, &c. may likewise be taken up and separated, and either planted again immediately or kept till autumn.\n\nTake up also autumnal flowering bulbs, such as colchicum, autumnal crocuses and narcissus, Guernsey and belladona lilies, cyclamens, &c.; take off the offsets, and plant them again immediately, or keep them till next month.\n\nPerennial plants, such as double scarlet lychnis, double rocket, &c. may be propagated by cuttings of their stalks; each cutting should consist of three or four joints, two of which, (or more than one half the length of the cutting), should be inserted into the ground; they may be either planted into a shady border, three or four inches apart, or more closely together, and covered with bell or hand glasses.\n\nPropagate carnations, pinks, and double sweet-williams, by layers. Select young shoots about five or six inches long for this purpose; strip off the leaves from the lower part of the stalks, and trim off the tops of those placed at its extremity; make a slanting cut with a sharp knife on the under part of the stalk, which should commence at a joint near the middle of the shoot, and extend upwards almost half way to the next; make a hole in the earth about an inch or an inch and a half deep, immediately under the shoot, for its reception; fix it down with a small hooked stick, and cover it with earth, except an inch or two at its extremity. A little water should be given in dry weather, which will make the layers strike root more readily. Pinks and carnations may likewise be propagated by cuttings or pipings. These pipings are formed of the extremities of the young shoots, taken off immediately under the third joint, which should be inserted into light earth almost to their tops, (the extremities of their leaves being previously trimmed off.) They should receive a little water to make the earth settle closely about them, and should be covered with a bell or hand glass. The earth is sometimes rendered quite wet, and reduced to a state resembling mortar, before the pipings are introduced.\n\nAbout the end of the month hedges should receive their first clipping.\n\n**Sect. IV. Nursery.**\n\nAbout the end of the month you may inoculate peaches, nectarines, apricots, and roses; for the method, inoculated, see July.\n\nIf any of the trees that were budded last summer, or grafted last spring, have made very vigorous shoots, stakes should be fixed into the ground close to the stocks, to which both the stocks and shoots must be fixed.\n\nPropagate both deciduous and evergreen shrubs by layers, particularly such as do not push out roots freely except from the new wood.\n\n**Sect. V. Green-house and Hot-house.**\n\nIf the greenhouse plants were not placed in the open air last month, on account of the coldness of the weather, they may be safely trusted out now. These plants may be propagated this month by cuttings, layers,arching, &c.\n\nHot-house plants may likewise be propagated now, and should receive a plentiful allowance of air and water; pine apple plants which are approaching to maturity should be sparingly watered, because too much water would injure the flavour of the fruit.\n\n**JULY.**\n\n**Sect. I. Kitchen Garden.**\n\nPlant out cabbages, savoys, broccoli, bore-cole, endive cabbages, and celery; for the methods see the former months. &c. planted.

Now let us suppose, if possible, that the lines when produced separate from each other at a point $C$, the one becoming ACD, and the other ACE. At the point $C$ let CF be drawn, so as to make the angle ACF a right angle; then, ACE being a straight line, the angle FCE is a right angle (1. cor. 1.); and because ACD is a straight line, the angle...\nFirst angle FCD is also a right angle, therefore the angle FCE is equal to FCD, a part to the whole, which is impossible; therefore the straight lines which have the common points A, B cannot separate when produced, therefore they must form one and the same straight line.\n\n**Theorem III.**\n\nIf two adjacent angles ACD, DCB make together two right angles, the two exterior lines AC, CB, which form these angles, are in the same straight line.\n\nFor if CB is not the line AC produced, let CE be that line produced, then ACE being a straight line, the angles ACD, DCE are together equal to two right angles (1.); but, by hypothesis, the angles ACD, DCB are together equal to two right angles, therefore \\(ACD + DCB = ACD + DCE\\).

For if the triangle ABC be applied to the triangle DEF, so that the equal sides BC, EF may coincide; then because the angle B is equal to E, the side BA shall coincide with ED, and therefore the point A shall be somewhere in ED; and because the angle C is equal to F, the side CA shall coincide with FD, and therefore the point A shall be somewhere in FD; now the point A being somewhere in the lines ED, and FD, it can only be at D their intersection; therefore the two triangles ABC, DEF must entirely coincide, and be equal to one another.\n\nCor. Hence it appears that the remaining angles A, D of the triangles are equal, and the remaining sides AB, AC of the one are equal to the remaining sides DE, DF of the other, each to each, viz. those to which the equal angles are opposite.\n\n**Theorem VII.**\n\nAny two sides of a triangle are together greater than the third.\n\nFor the side BC, for example, being the shortest way between the points B, C, (def. 4.) must be less than \\(BA + AC\\).\n\n**Theorem VIII.**\n\nIf from a point O, within a triangle ABC, there be drawn straight lines OB, OC to the extremities of BC one of its sides, the sum of these lines shall be less than that of AB, AC the two other sides.\n\nLet BO be produced to meet CA in D; because the straight line OC is less than OD + DC, to each of these add BO, and \\(BO + OC < BO + OD + DC\\); that is \\(BO + OC < BD + DC\\).\n\nAgain, since \\(BD < BA + AD\\), to each of these add DC and we have \\(BD + DC < BA + AC\\), but it has been shewn that \\(BO + OC < BD + DC\\), much more then is \\(BO + OC < BA + AC\\).\n\n**Theorem IX.**\n\nIf two sides AB, AC of a triangle ABC are equal to two sides DE, DF of another triangle DEF, each to each; but if the angle BAC contained\nby the former is greater than the angle EDF contained by the latter; the third side BC of the first triangle shall be greater than the third side EF of the second.\n\nSuppose AG drawn so that the angle CAG = D, take AG = DE and join CG; then the triangle GAC is equal to the triangle ELF, (6.) and therefore GC = EF. Now there may be three cases, according as the point G falls without the triangle BAC, or on the side BC, or within the same triangle.\n\n**Case I.** Because GC = GI + IC, and AB = AI + IB, (7.) therefore GC + AB = GI + IA + IC + IB, that is, GC + AB = AG + BC, from each of these unequal quantities take away the equal quantities AB, AG, and there remains GC = BC, therefore EF = BC.\n\n**Case II.** If the point G fall upon the side BC, then it is evident that GC, or its equal EF, is less than BC.\n\n**Case III.** Lastly, if the point G fall within the triangle BAC, then AG + GC < AB + BC, (8.) therefore, taking away the equal quantities AG, AB, there remains GC < BC or EF < BC.\n\nCor. Hence, conversely, if EF be less than BC, the angle EDF is less than BAC; for the angle EDF cannot be equal to BAC, because then (5.) EF would be equal to BC; neither can the angle EDF be greater than BAC, for then (by the theor.) EF would be greater than BC.\n\n**Theorem X.**\n\nTwo triangles are equal, when the three sides of the one are equal to the three sides of the other, each to each.\n\nLet the side AB = DE, AC = DF, and BC = EF; then shall the angle A = D, B = E, C = F.\n\nFor if the angle A were greater than D, as the sides AB, AC, are equal to DE, DF, each to each, it would follow, (9.) that BC would be greater than EF, and if the angle A were less than the angle D, then BC would be less than EF; but BC is equal to EF, therefore the angle A can neither be greater nor less than the angle D, therefore it must be equal to it. In the same manner it may be proved, that the angle B = E, and that the angle C = F.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nIt may be remarked, as in Theorem V. and Theorem VI. that the equal angles are opposite to the equal sides.\n\n**Theorem XI.**\n\nIn an isosceles triangle the angles opposite to the equal sides are equal to one another.\n\nLet the side AB = AC, then shall the angle C = B. Suppose a straight line drawn from A the vertex of the triangle to D the middle of its base; the two triangles ABD, ACD have the three sides of the one equal to the three sides of the other, each to each, namely AD common to both, AB = AC, by hypothesis, and BD = DC, by construction, therefore (preced. theor.) the angle B is equal to the angle C.\n\nCor. Hence every equilateral triangle is also equiangular.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nFrom the equality of the triangles ABD, ACD, it follows, that the angle BAD = DAC, and that the angle BDA = ADC; therefore these two last are right angles. Hence it appears, that a straight line drawn from the vertex of an isosceles triangle to the middle of its base is perpendicular to that base, and divides the vertical angle into two equal parts.\n\nIn a triangle that is not isosceles, any one of its three sides may be taken indifferently for a base; and then its vertex is that of the opposite angle. In an isosceles triangle, the base is that side which is not equal to the others.\n\n**Theorem XII.**\n\nIf two angles of a triangle are equal, the opposite sides are equal, and the triangle is isosceles.\n\nLet the angle ABC = ACB, the side AC shall be equal to the side AB. For if the sides are not equal, let AB be the greater of the two; take BD = AC, and join CD; the angle DBC is by hypothesis equal to ACB, and the two sides DB, BC are equal to the two sides AC, BC, each to each; therefore the triangle DBC is equal to the triangle ACB; (5.) but a part cannot be equal to the whole; therefore the sides AB, AC cannot be unequal, that is, they are equal, and the triangle is isosceles.\n\n**Theorem XIII.**\n\nOf the two sides of a triangle, that is the greater which is opposite to the greater angle; and conversely, of the two angles of a triangle, that is the greater which is opposite to the greater side.\n\nFirst, let the angle C > B, then shall the side AB opposite to C be greater than the side AC opposite to B. Suppose CD drawn, so that the angle BCD = B; in the triangle BDC, BD is equal to DC, (12.) but AD + DC > AC, and AD + DC = AD + DB = AB, therefore AB > AC.\n\nNext, let the side AB > AC, then shall the angle C opposite to AB, be greater than the angle B, opposite to AC. For if C were less than B, then, by what has been demonstrated, AB > AC, which is contrary to the hypothesis of the proposition, therefore C is not less than B; and if C were equal to B, then it would follow that AC = AB, (12.) which is also contrary to the hypothesis; therefore C is not equal to B, therefore it is greater.\n\n**Theorem XIV.**\n\nFrom a given point A without a straight line DE, no more than one perpendicular can be drawn to that line.\n\nFor suppose it possible to draw two, AB, and AC; produce\nproduce one of them \\( AB \\), so that \\( BF = AB \\), and join \\( CF \\). The triangle \\( BCF \\) is equal to the triangle \\( ABC \\); for the right angle \\( CBF = CBA \\), as well as \\( CBA \\), and the side \\( BF = BA \\); therefore the triangles are equal, (5.) and hence the angle \\( BCF = BCA \\); but the angle \\( BCA \\) is by hypothesis a right angle; therefore the angle \\( BCF \\) is also a right angle; hence \\( AC \\) and \\( CF \\) lie in a straight line, (3.) and consequently two straight lines \\( ACF, ABF \\) may be drawn between two points \\( A, F \\), which is impossible, (ax. 4.) therefore it is equally impossible that two perpendiculars can be drawn from the same point to the same straight line.\n\n**Theorem XV.**\n\nIf from a point \\( A \\), without a straight line \\( DE \\), a perpendicular \\( AB \\) be drawn upon that line, and also different oblique lines \\( AE, AC, AD, \\&c. \\) to different points of the same line.\n\nFirst, The perpendicular \\( AB \\) shall be shorter than any one of the oblique lines.\n\nSecondly, The two oblique lines \\( AC, AE \\), which meet the line \\( DE \\) on opposite sides of the perpendicular, and at equal distances \\( BC, BE \\) from it, are equal to one another.\n\nLastly, Of any two oblique lines \\( AC, AD, \\) or \\( AE, AD \\), that which is more remote from the perpendicular is the greater.\n\nProduce the perpendicular \\( AB \\), so that \\( BF = BA \\), and join \\( FC, FD \\).\n\n1.

The perpendicular measures the distance of any point from a straight line.\n\nCor. 2. From the same point, three equal straight lines cannot be drawn to terminate in a given straight line; for if they could be drawn, then, two of them would be on the same side of the perpendicular, and equal to each other, which is impossible.\n\n**Theorem XVI.**\n\nIf from \\( C \\), the middle of a straight line \\( AB \\), a perpendicular \\( CD \\) be drawn to that line.

Let \\( D \\) be any point in \\( CD \\), then, because the two oblique lines \\( DA, DB \\) are equally distant from the perpendicular, they are equal to one another (15.), therefore every point in \\( CD \\) is equally distant from the extremities of \\( AB \\).\n\n2.

But there are quantities which cannot have a common measure, and which are therefore said to be incommensurable; such, for example, are the sides of two squares one of which has its surface double that of the other.\n\nAlthough the ratio of two incommensurable quantities cannot be expressed in numbers, yet we can always assign a ratio in numbers which shall be as near to that ratio as we please. For let A and B be any two quantities whatever, and suppose that x is such a part of A that \\( A = p \\cdot x \\); then if q denote the number of times that x can be taken from B, and d the remainder, we have \\( B = q \\cdot x + d \\), and \\( q \\cdot x = B - d \\); and because \\( p : q :: p \\cdot x : q \\cdot x \\), therefore \\( p : q :: A : B - d \\). Now as d is less than x, by taking x sufficiently small d may be less than any proposed quantity, so that B - d may differ from B by less than any given quantity; therefore two numbers p and q may always be assigned, such that the ratio of p to q shall be the same as the ratio of A to a quantity that differs less from B than by any given quantity, however small that quantity may be.\n\nHence we may conclude, that whatever has been delivered in this section relating to commensurable quantities, may be considered as applying equally to such as are incommensurable.\n\nSect. IV. THE PROPORTIONS OF FIGURES.\n\nDefinitions.\n\nI. Equivalent Figures are such as have equal surfaces.\n\nTwo figures may be equivalent, although very dissimilar; thus a circle may be equivalent to a square, a triangle to a rectangle, and so of other figures.\n\nWe shall give the denomination of equal figures to\nProportions those which, being applied the one upon the other, coincide entirely; thus, two circles having the same radius are equal; and two triangles having three sides of the one equal to three sides of the other, each to each, are also equal.\n\nII. Two figures are similar, when the angles of the one are equal to the angles of the other, each to each; and the homologous sides proportional. The homologous sides are those which have the same position in the two figures; or which are adjacent to the equal angles. The angles themselves are called homologous angles.\n\nTwo equal figures are always similar, but similar figures may be very unequal.\n\nIII. In two different circles, similar sectors, similar arches, similar segments, are such as correspond to equal angles at the centre. Thus the angle A being equal to the angle O, the arch BC is similar to the arch DE, and the sector ABC to the sector ODE, &c.\n\nIV. The Altitude of a parallelogram is the perpendicular which measures the distance between the opposite sides or bases AB, CD.\n\nV. The Altitude of a triangle is the perpendicular AD drawn from the vertical angle A upon the base BC.\n\nVI. The Altitude of a trapezoid is the perpendicular EF drawn between its two parallel bases AB, CD.\n\nVII. The Area and the surface of a figure are terms of nearly the same signification. The term area, however, is more particularly used to denote the superficial quantity of the figure in respect of its being measured, or compared with other surfaces.\n\n**Theorem I.**\n\nParallelograms which have equal bases and equal altitudes are equivalent.\n\nLet AB be the common base of the parallelograms ABCD, EBAF, which being supposed to have the same altitude, the sides DC, FE opposite to the bases will lie in DE a line parallel to AB. Now, from the nature of a parallelogram, AD = BC, and AF = BE; for the reason DC = AB, and FE = AB; therefore, DC = FE, and taking away DC and FE from the same line DE, the remainders CE and DF are equal; hence the triangles DAF, CBE have three sides of the one equal to three sides of the other, each to each; and consequently are equal (10. i.). Now if from the quadrilateral ABED, the triangle ADF be taken away, there will remain the parallelogram ABEF; and if from the same quadrilateral ABED, the triangle CBE, equal to the former, be taken away, there will remain the parallelogram ABCD; therefore the two parallelograms ABCD, ABEF, which have the same base, and the same altitude, are equivalent.\n\nCor. Every parallelogram is equivalent to a rectangle of the same base and altitude.\n\n**Theorem II.**\n\nEvery triangle ABC is the half of a parallelogram ABCD, having the same base and altitude.\n\nFor the triangles ABC, ACD are equal (28. i.).\n\nCor. 1. Therefore a triangle ABC is the half of a rectangle BCEF of the same base and altitude.\n\n**Cor. 2.** All triangles having equal bases, and equal altitudes, are equivalent.\n\n**Theorem III.**\n\nTwo rectangles of the same altitude are to each other as their bases.\n\nLet ABCD, AEFD be two rectangles, which have a common altitude AD; the rectangle ABCD shall have to the rectangle AEFD the same ratio that the base AB has to the base AE.\n\nLet the base AB have to the base AE the ratio of the number p (which we shall suppose 7) to the number q (which may be 4); that is, let AB contain p (7), such equal parts as AE contains q (4); then, if perpendiculars be drawn to AB and AE at the points of division, the rectangles ABCD and AEFD will be divided, the former into p, and the latter into q rectangles, which will be all equal (1.) for they have equal bases, and the same altitude; thus the rectangle ABCD will also contain p such equal parts as the rectangle AEFD contains q; therefore, the rectangle ABCD is to AEFD as the number p to the number q (Ax. 4.3.) that is, as the base AB to AE.\n\n**Theorem IV.**\n\nAny two rectangles are to each other as the products of any numbers proportional to their sides.\n\nLet the numbers m, n, p, q, have among themselves the same ratios that the sides of the rectangles ABCD, AEFG have to each other; that is, let AB contain m such equal parts, whereof AD contains n; and AE contains p, and AF contains q; then shall ABCD : AEFG :: mn : pq.\n\nLet the rectangles be so placed that the sides AB, AE may be in a straight line, then AD and AG will also lie in a straight line (3. i.). Now (3.)\n\n\\[ \\text{ABCD} : \\text{AEHD} :: \\text{AB} : \\text{AE} :: \\text{m} : \\text{p}, \\]\n\nbut \\( m : p :: nm : np \\) (1. 3.)\n\ntherefore \\( \\text{ABCD} : \\text{AEHD} :: nm : np \\).\n\nAgain, \\( \\text{AEHD} : \\text{AEFG} :: \\text{AD} : \\text{AG} :: \\text{n} : \\text{q}; \\)\n\nbut \\( n : q :: pn : pq; \\)\n\ntherefore, \\( \\text{AEHD} : \\text{AEFG} :: pn : pq; \\)\n\nand it was shewn that\n\n\\[ \\text{ABCD} : \\text{AEHD} :: nm : np \\text{ or } pn, \\]\n\ntherefore, (6. 3.) \\( \\text{ABCD} : \\text{AEFG} :: mn : pq. \\)\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nHence it appears, that the product of the base by the altitude of a rectangle may be taken for its measure, observing that by such product is meant that of the number of linear units in the base by the number of linear units in the altitude. This measure is however not absolute, but relative, for it must be supposed, that in comparing one rectangle with another, the sides of both are measured by the same linear unit. For example, if the base of a rectangle, A, be three units, and its altitude 10, the rectangle is represented by \\( 3 \\times 10 \\) or 30; this number considered by itself has no meaning.\nSec.

Therefore the two triangles are equivalent, if the rectangle AB \u00d7 AC = AD \u00d7 AE, or (8.) if AB : AD :: AE : AC, in which case, the sides about the equal angles are said to be reciprocally proportional.\n\nScholium.\n\nWhat has been proved of triangles is also true of parallelograms, they being the doubles of such triangles.\n\nTheorem XXV.\n\nTwo similar triangles are to each other as the squares of their homologous sides.\nLet the angle A = D, the angle B = E, and therefore the angle C = F,\n\nthen (20.) \\( \\frac{AB}{DE} : \\frac{AC}{DF} \\);\n\nnow \\( \\frac{AB}{DE} : \\frac{AB}{DE} \\),\n\nfor the two ratios are identical, therefore, (9)\n\n\\( AB^2 : DE^2 :: AB \\times AC : DE \\times DF \\);\n\nbut \\( ABC : DEF :: AB \\times AC : DE \\times DF \\), (24.)\n\ntherefore \\( ABC : DEF :: AB^2 : DE^2 \\) (Ax. 3. 3.)\n\ntherefore the two similar triangles ABC, DEF, are to each other as the squares of the homologous sides AB, DE, or as the squares of any of the other homologous sides.\n\n**Theorem XXVI.**\n\nSimilar polygons are composed of the same number of triangles which are similar and similarly situated.\n\nIn the polygon ABCDE, draw from one of the angles A the diagonals AC, AD to all the other angles. In the polygon FGHIK, draw in like manner from the angle F, homologous to A, the diagonals FH, FI to the other angles.\n\nBecause the polygons are similar, the angle ABC is equal to its homologous angle FGH (Def. 2.), also the sides AB, BC are proportional to FG, GH, so that \\( \\frac{AB}{FG} :: \\frac{BC}{GH} \\), therefore the triangles ABC, FGH are similar (22.), therefore the angle BCA = GHF, and these being taken from the equal angles BCD, GHI, the remainders ACD, FHI are equal; but the triangles ABC, FGH being similar, \\( AC : FH :: BC : GH \\), besides, because of the similarity of the polygons, BC : GH :: CD : HI; therefore AC : FH :: CD : HI; now it has been already shown that the angle ACD = FHI, therefore the triangles ACD, FHI are similar (22.).\n\nIt may be demonstrated in the same manner that the remaining triangles are similar, whatever be the number of sides of the polygon; therefore two similar polygons are composed of the same number of triangles, similar to each other, and similarly situated.\n\n**Theorem XXVII.**\n\nThe perimeters of similar polygons are as the homologous sides, and the polygons themselves are as the squares of the homologous sides.\n\nFor, since by the nature of similar figures \\( \\frac{AB}{FG} :: \\frac{BC}{GH} :: \\frac{CD}{HI}, \\ldots \\), therefore, (2. cor. 8. 3.) \\( AB + BC + CD, \\ldots \\), the perimeter of the first figure, is to \\( FG + GH + HI, \\ldots \\), the perimeter of the second, as the side AB to its homologous side FG.\n\nAgain, because the triangles ABC, FGH are similar, \\( ABC : FGH :: AC^2 : FH^2 \\) (25.), in like manner \\( ACD : FHI :: AC^2 : FH^2 \\), therefore,\n\n\\[ ABC : FGH :: ACD : FHI. \\]\n\nBy the same manner of reasoning,\n\n\\[ ACD : FHI :: ADE : FIK, \\]\n\nand so on if there be more triangles; hence, from this series of equal ratios, it follows (2. cor. 8. 3.) that the figures ABC + ACD + ADE, or the polygon ABCDE, is to FGH + FHI + FIK, or the polygon FGHIK, as one of the antecedents ABC is to its consequent FGH, or as \\( AB^2 \\) to \\( FG^2 \\); therefore, similar polygons are to each other as the squares of their homologous sides.\n\n**Cor. I.** If three similar figures have their homologous sides equal to the three sides of a right-angled triangle, the figure having the greatest side shall be equal to the two others; for these three figures are proportional to the squares of their homologous sides, and the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides.\n\n**Cor. 2.** Similar polygons have to each other the duplicate ratio of their homologous sides. For let L be a third proportional to the homologous sides AB, FG, then (Def. 11. 3.) \\( AB \\) has to \\( L \\) the duplicate ratio of \\( AB \\) to \\( FG \\); but \\( AB : L :: AB^2 : XL \\) (3.), or, since \\( AB \\times L = FG^2 \\) (Cor. to 8.) \\( AB : L :: AB^2 : FG^2 :: ABCDE : FGHIK \\), therefore the figure ABCDE has to the figure FGHIK, the duplicate ratio of \\( AB \\) to \\( FG \\).\n\n**Theorem XXVIII.**\n\nThe segments of two chords AB, CD, which cut each other within a circle, are reciprocally proportional, that is \\( AO : DO :: CO : OB \\).\n\nJoin AC and BD; and because the triangles AOC, BOD have the angles at O equal (4. 1.), and the angle A = D and the angle C = B (15. 2.), the triangles are similar; therefore the homologous sides are proportional, (20.) that is, \\( AO : DO :: CO : BO \\).\n\n**Cor.** Hence \\( AO \\times BO = CO \\times DO \\) (8.), that is, the rectangle contained by the segments of the one chord is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other.\n\n**Theorem XXIX.**\n\nIf from a point O without a circle, two straight lines be drawn, terminating in the concave arch BC; the whole lines shall be reciprocally proportional to the parts of them without the circle, that is \\( OB : OC :: OD : OA \\).\n\nJoin AC, BD; then the triangles OAC, OBD have the common angle O, also the angle B = C (15. 2.), therefore the triangles are similar, and the homologous sides are proportional, that is, \\( OB : OC :: OD : OA \\).\n\n**Cor.** Therefore (8.) \\( OA \\times OB = OC \\times OD \\), that is, the rectangles contained by the whole lines, and the parts of them without the circle, are equal to one another.\n\n**Theorem XXX.**\n\nIf from a point O without a circle a straight line OA be drawn touching the circle, and also a straight line OC cutting it, the tangent shall be a mean proportional between the whole line...\nwhich cuts the circle, and the part of it without the circle, that is, \\( OC : OA :: OA : OD \\).\n\nFor if \\( AC, AD \\) be joined, the triangles \\( OAD, OCA \\), have the angle at \\( O \\) common to both, also the angle \\( ACD \\) or \\( ACO \\) is equal to \\( DAO \\) (18.2.), therefore the triangles are similar (20.) and consequently \\( CO : OA :: OA : OD \\).\n\nCor.

But if the given point A be without the circle, (fig. 103.) draw AC to the centre, and bisect AC in O, and on O as a centre, with OA or OC as a radius, describe a circle which will cut the given circle in two points D and D'; join AD and AD', and each of the lines AD, AD', will be a tangent to the circle.\n\nFor, draw the radii CD, CD', then each of the angles ADC, AD'C is a right angle, (17.2.) therefore AD and AD' are both tangents to the circle, (9.2.).\n\nCor. The two tangents AD, AD' are equal to one another.

Through the extremity A draw an indefinite line AG, take AC of any magnitude, and take CD, DE, EF, and FG, each equal to AC, that is, take AG equal to five times AC; join GB, and draw CI parallel to GB, the line AI shall be one-fifth part of AB, and AI being taken five times in AB, the line AB shall be divided into five equal parts.\n\nFor since CI is parallel to GB, the sides AG and AB are cut proportionally in C and I; but AC is the fifth part of AG; therefore AI is the fifth part of AB.\n\nNext, let it be proposed to divide AB (fig. 107.) into parts, having to each other the ratios that the lines P, Q, R, have. Through A draw AG, and in AG take AC = P, CD = Q, DE = R; join EB, and draw CI and DK parallel to EB; the line AB shall be divided as required.\n\nFor, because of the parallels CI, DK, EB, the parts AI, IK, KB, have to each other the same ratios that the parts AC, CD, DE, have, (17.4.) which parts are by construction equal to the given lines P, Q, R.\n\n**Problem XIV.**\n\nTo find a fourth proportional to three given lines, A, B, C.\n\nDraw two straight lines DE, DF, containing any angle; on DE take DA = A, and DB = B, and on DF take DC = C; join AC, and draw BX parallel to AC; then, BX shall be the fourth proportional required.\n\nFor, because BX is parallel to AC, DA : DB :: DC : DX (17.4.) that is, A : B :: C : DX, therefore DX is a fourth proportional to A, B, and C.\n\nCor. The same construction serves to find a third proportional to two lines A and B; for it is the same as a fourth proportional to the lines A, B, and B.\n\n**Problem XV.**\n\nTo find a mean proportional between two straight lines, A, B.\n\nUpon any straight line DF take DE = A, and EF = B; and on DF as a diameter describe a semicircle Problems. DGF; draw EG perpendicular to DF, meeting the circle in G; the line EG shall be the mean proportional required.\n\nFor, if DG, FG, be joined, the angle DGF is a right angle, (17.2.) therefore, in the right-angled triangle DGF, GE is a mean proportional between DE and EF, (23.4.)\n\n**Problem XVI.**\n\nTo divide a given straight line AB into two parts, Fig. 108. so that the greater may be a mean proportional between the whole line and the other part.\n\nAt B, one of the extremities of the line, draw BC perpendicular to AB, and equal to the half of AB; on C as a centre, with CB as a radius, describe a circle; join AC, meeting the circle in D; make AF = AD, and AB shall be divided at F in the manner required.\n\nFor since AB is perpendicular to the radius, it is a tangent to the circle (9.2.), and if AC be produced to meet the circle in E, AB : AF :: AE : AB, (30.4.) and by division, AB - AF : AF :: AE - AB : AB; but AB - AF = BF, and since DE = 2BC = AB, therefore AE - AB = AD = AF, therefore BF : AF :: AF : AB.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nWhen a line is divided in this manner it is said to be divided in extreme and mean ratio.\n\n**Problem XVII.**\n\nTo make a square equivalent to a given parallelogram or to a given triangle.\n\nFirst, let ABCD be a given parallelogram, (fig. 112.) the base of which is AB, and altitude DE; find XY a mean proportional between AB and DE, (by problem 15.) and XY shall be the side of the square required.\n\nFor since by construction AB : XY :: XY : DE, therefore, XY\u00b2 = AB \u00d7 DE (8.4.) = parallelogram ABCD (5.4.)\n\nNext, let ABC be a given triangle (fig. 113.) BC its base, and AD its altitude; find XY a mean proportional between half the base and the altitude, and XY shall be the side of the square required.\n\nFor since \u00bdB : XY :: XY : AD; therefore (8.4.) XY\u00b2 = \u00bdBC \u00d7 AD = triangle ABC (6.4.)\n\n**Problem XVIII.**\n\nUpon a given line EF, to construct a rectangle Fig. 114.

EF \u00d7 EX = AB \u00d7 AD, that is, the rectangle EFGX is equal to the rectangle ABCD.\n**Problem XIX.**\n\nTo make a triangle equivalent to a given polygon ABCDE.\n\nFirst, draw the diagonal CE, so as to cut off the triangle CDE; draw DG parallel to CE, to meet AE produced in G; join CG, and the given polygon ABCDE shall be equivalent to another polygon ABCG which has one side fewer.\n\nFor since DG is parallel to CE, the triangle CGE is equivalent to the triangle CDE, (2. cor. 2. 4.) to each add the polygon ABCE, and the polygon ABCDE shall be equivalent to the polygon ABCG.\n\nIn like manner, if the diagonal CA be drawn, also BF parallel to CA, meeting EA produced, and CF be joined, the triangle CFA is equivalent to the triangle CBA, and thus the polygon ABCDE is transformed to the triangle CFG.\n\nIn this way a triangle may be found equivalent to any other polygon, for by transforming the figure into another equivalent figure that has one side fewer, and repeating the operation, a figure will at last be found which has only three sides.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nAs a square may be found equivalent to a triangle, by combining this problem with Prob.

Again, on FH construct in like manner a triangle FIH, similar to ADC and similarly situated; and on FI construct a triangle FKI similar to AED and similarly situated; and these triangles FGH, FHI, FIK shall form a polygon FGHIK similar to ABCDE (26. 4.).\n\n**Problem XXI.**\n\nTo inscribe a square in a given circle.\n\nDraw two diameters AC, BD, so as to intersect each other at right angles; join the extremities of the diameters A, B, C, D, and the figure ABCD shall be a square inscribed in the circle.\n\nFor the angles AOB, BOC, &c. being all equal, the chords AB, BC, CD, DA are equal; and as each of the angles of the figure ABCD is in a semicircle, it is a right angle, (17. 2.) therefore the figure is a square.\n\n**Problem XXII.**\n\nTo inscribe a regular hexagon and also an equilateral triangle in a given circle.\n\nFrom any point A in the circumference, apply AB and BC each equal to AO the radius; draw the three diameters AD, BE, CF, and join their adjacent extremities by the lines AB, BC, &c. and the figure ABCDEF thus formed is the hexagon required.\n\nFor the triangles AOB, BOC being by construction equilateral, each of the angles AOB, BOC is one-third of two right angles, (4. cor. 24. 1.) and since AOB + BOC + COD = two right angles, therefore, COD = one-third of two right angles, therefore the three angles AOB, BOC, COD, are equal, and as these are equal to the angles AOF, FOE, FOD; the six angles at the centre are all equal; therefore, the chords AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are all equal; thus the figure is equilateral. It is also equiangular, for the angles FAB, ABC, &c. are in equal segments, each having for its base the chord of two-sixths of the circumference, therefore, the angles A, B, &c. are equal (15. 2.)\n\nIf straight lines be drawn joining A, C, E, the vertices of the alternate angles of the hexagon, there will be formed an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, as is sufficiently evident.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nAs the form of reasoning by which it has been shewn that an equilateral hexagon inscribed in a circle is also equiangular, will apply alike to any equilateral polygon; it may be inferred, that every equilateral polygon inscribed in a circle is also equiangular.\n\n**Problem XXIII.**\n\nTo inscribe a regular pentagon in a given circle.\n\nDraw any radius AO, and divide it into two parts AF, FO, such that AO : OF :: OF : AF; (16.) from A place AG in the circumference equal to OF; join OG, and draw the chord AHB perpendicular to OG, the chord AB shall be a side of the pentagon required.\n\nJoin GF; and because AO : OF :: OF : AF, and that AG = OF, therefore, AO : AG :: AG : AF; now the angle A is common to the two triangles OAG, GAF, and it has been shewn that the sides about that angle in the two triangles are proportional; therefore (22. 4.) the triangles are similar, and the triangle AOG being isosceles, the triangle AGF is also isosceles; so that AG = GF; but AG = FO, (by construction) therefore, GF = FO, and the angle FOG = FGO, and FOG + FGO = 2 FOG; but AFG = FOG + FGO, (23. 1.) and APG = FAG, therefore, FAG = 2 FOG; hence in the isosceles triangle AOG, each of the angles at the base is double the vertical angle AOG, therefore the sum of all the angles is equal to five times the vertical angle AOG; but the sum of all the angles is equal to two right angles, (24. 1.) therefore the angle AOG is one-fifth of two right angles, and consequently AOB = 2 AOG = two-fifths of two right angles equal one-fifth of four right angles, therefore the arch AB is one-fifth of the whole circumference. If we now suppose straight lines BC, CD, DE, to be applied in the circle each equal to AB, the chord of one-fifth of the circumference, and AE to be joined, the figure thus formed will be an equilateral pentagon, and it is also equiangular (Schol. 22.)\nProblem XXIV.\n\nHaving given ABCD, &c. a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, to describe a regular polygon of the same number of sides about the circle.\n\nDraw GH a tangent to the circle at T the middle of the arch AB; do the same at the middle of each of the other arches BC, CD, &c. these tangents shall form a regular polygon GHIK, &c. described about the circle.\n\nJoin OG, OH, &c. also OT and ON. In the triangles OTH, ONH, the side OT = ON, and OH is common to both, and OTH, ONH, are right angles, therefore the triangles are equal (17. i.) and the angles TOH = NOH; now B is the middle of the arch TN, therefore OH passes through B; and in the same manner it appears that I is in the line OC produced, &c. Now because OT bisects the arch AB it is perpendicular to the chord AB (6. 2.), therefore GH is parallel to AB (9. 2. and 18. i.), and HI to BC, therefore the angle GHO = ABO, and IHO = CBO, and hence GHI = ABC; and in like manner it appears, that HIK = BCD, &c. therefore the angles of the circumscribed polygon are equal to those of the inscribed polygon. And because of the parallels, GH : AB :: OH : OB, and HI : BC :: OH : OB, therefore, GH : AB :: HI : BC; but AB = BC; therefore GH = HI. For the same reason HI = IK, &c. therefore, the polygon is regular, and similar to the inscribed polygon.\n\nSECT. VI. OF THE QUADRATURE OF THE CIRCLE.\n\nAxiom.\n\nIf ABC be an arch of a circle, and AD, CD be two tangents at its extremities, intersecting each other in D; the sum of the tangents AD, DC is greater than the arch ABC.\n\nCor. Hence the perimeter of any polygon described about a circle, is greater than the circumference of the circle.\n\nProposition I. Theorem.\n\nEquilateral polygons, ABCDEF, GHKLM, of the same number of sides inscribed in circles are similar, and are to one another as the squares of the radii of the circles.\n\nAs each of the polygons is by hypothesis equilateral, it will also be equangular (Schol. 22. 5.). Let us suppose, for example, that the polygons are hexagons; then, as the sum of the angles is the same in both, viz. eight right angles (25. i.), the angle A will be one-sixth part of eight right angles, and the angle G will be the same; therefore A = G; in like manner B = H, C = K, &c. and as the figures are equilateral, AB : GH :: BC : HI :: CD : IK, &c. therefore (2. def. 4.) the figures are similar. Draw AO, BO, GP, HP to the centres of the circles; then, because the angle AOB is the same part of four right angles that the arch AB is of the whole circumference; and the angle GPH the same part of four right angles that GH is of the whole circumference (13. 2.) the angles AOB, GPH are each the same part of four right angles; therefore they are equal; the isosceles triangles AOB, GPH are therefore similar, (22. 4.) and consequently AB : GH :: AO : GP, therefore (9. and 27. 4.) polygon ABCDEF : polygon GHKLM :: AO\u00b2 : GP\u00b2.\n\nProp.

Theorem.\n\nA circle being given, two similar polygons may be found, the one inscribed in the circle, and the other described about it, which shall differ from each other by a space less than any given space.\n\nLet AG be the side of a square equal to the given space; and let ABG be such an arch of the given circle, that AG is its chord. Bisect the fourth part of the circumference, (5. 5.) then bisect one of its halves, and proceed in this manner, till, by repeated bisections, there will at length be found an arch AB less than AG. As the arch thus found will be contained in the circumference a certain number of times exactly, its chord AB is the side of a regular figure inscribed in the circle; apply lines in the circle, each equal to AB, thus forming the regular figure ABC, &c. and describe a regular figure DEF, &c. of the same number of sides about the circle. Then, the excess of the circumscribed figure above the inscribed figure shall be less than the square upon AG. For draw lines from D and E to O the centre; these lines will pass through A and B (24. 5.); also, a line drawn from O to H the point of contact of the line DE, will bisect AB, and be perpendicular to it; and AB will be parallel to DE. Draw the diameter AL, and join BL, which will be parallel to HO (18. 4.). Put P for the circumscribed polygon, and p for the inscribed polygon; then, because the triangles ODH, OAK are evidently like parts of P and p, P : p :: ODH : OAK (1. 3.); but the triangles ODH, OAK being similar, ODH : OAK :: OH\u00b2 : OK\u00b2 (25. 4.), and on account of the similar triangles OAK, LAB, OA\u00b2 or OH\u00b2 : OK\u00b2 :: LA\u00b2 LB\u00b2 (20. and 9. 4.); therefore, P : p :: LA\u00b2 : LB\u00b2; and by division and inversion, P : p :: LA\u00b2 : LB\u00b2, or AB\u00b2; but LA\u00b2, that is, the square described about the circle, is greater than the equilateral polygon of eight sides described about the circle, because it contains that polygon, and for the same reason the polygon of eight sides is greater than the polygon of fifteen sides, and so on; therefore LA\u00b2 > P, and as it has been proved that P : p :: LA\u00b2 : AB\u00b2, of which proportion, the first term P is less than the third LA\u00b2; therefore (2. 3.) the second P - p is less than the fourth AB\u00b2, but AB\u00b2 < AG\u00b2, therefore P - p < AG\u00b2.\n\nCor. 1. Because the polygons P and p differ from one another more than either of them differs from the circle, the difference between each of them, and the circle, is less than the given space, viz. the square of AG. And therefore, however small any space may be,\nbe, a polygon may be inscribed in the circle, and another described about it, each of which shall differ from the circle by less than the given space.\n\nCor. 2. A space which is greater than any polygon that can be inscribed in a circle, but which is less than any polygon that can be described about it, is equal to the circle itself.\n\nProp. III. Theorem.\n\nThe area of any circle is equal to a rectangle contained by the radius, and a straight line equal to half the circumference.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\), &c., be any equilateral polygon inscribed in the circle, and \\(DEF\\), &c., a similar polygon described about it; draw lines from the extremities of \\(AB\\) and \\(DE\\) a side of each polygon to \\(O\\) the centre; and let \\(OKH\\) be perpendicular to these sides. Put \\(P\\) for the perimeter of the polygon \\(DEF\\), &c., and \\(p\\) for the perimeter of the polygon \\(ABC\\), &c., and \\(n\\) for the number of the sides of each. Then, because \\(n \\times \\frac{1}{2} DE = \\frac{1}{2} P\\), \\(n \\times \\frac{1}{2} DE \\times OH = \\frac{1}{2} P \\times OH\\), but \\(n \\times \\frac{1}{2} DE \\times OH = n \\times \\text{triangle } DOE = \\text{polygon } DEF\\), &c.; and in like manner it appears, that \\(Q \\times OK = \\text{polygon } ABC\\), &c. Now let \\(Q\\) denote the circumference of the circle, then, because \\(Q = p\\), and \\(OH = OK\\), therefore \\(Q \\times OH = p \\times OH\\), that is \\(Q \\times OH\\) is greater than the inscribed polygon. Again, because \\(Q < \\frac{1}{2} P\\) (axiom), therefore \\(Q \\times OH < \\frac{1}{2} P \\times OH\\), that is, \\(Q \\times OH\\) is less than the circumscribed polygon: Thus it appears that \\(Q \\times OH\\) is greater than any polygon inscribed in the circle, but less than any polygon described about it; therefore, \\(Q \\times OH\\) is equal to the circle (2).\n\nProp. IV. Theorem.\n\nThe areas of circles are to one another as the squares of their radii.\n\nLet \\(ABCDEF\\) and \\(GHIKLM\\) be equilateral polygons of the same number of sides inscribed in the circles, and \\(OA, PG\\) their radii; and let \\(Q\\) be such a space, that \\(AO^2 : GP^2 :: \\text{circle } ABD : Q\\); then, because \\(AO^2 : GP^2 :: \\text{polygon } ABCDEF : \\text{polygon } GHIKLM\\), and \\(AO^2 : GP^2 :: \\text{circle } ABE : Q\\), therefore \\(Q = \\text{polygon } GHIKLM :: \\text{circle } ABE : Q\\); but circle \\(ABE = \\text{polygon } ABCDEF\\), therefore \\(Q = \\text{polygon } GHIKLM\\); that is, \\(Q\\) is greater than any polygon inscribed in the circle \\(GHL\\). In the same manner it is demonstrated that \\(Q\\) is less than any polygon described about the circle \\(GHL\\); therefore \\(Q\\) is equal to the circle \\(GHL\\) (2). And because \\(AO^2 : GP^2 :: \\text{circle } ABD : Q\\), therefore \\(AO^2 : GP^2 :: \\text{circle } ABE : \\text{circle } GHL\\).\n\nCor. 1. The circumferences of circles are to one another as their radii. Put \\(M\\) for half the circumference of the circle \\(ABE\\) and \\(N\\) for half the circumference of \\(GKL\\); then, circle \\(ABE : \\text{circle } GHL :: AO^2 : GP^2\\); but \\(M \\times AO = \\text{circle } ABE\\), also \\(N \\times GP = \\text{circle } GHL\\), (3.) therefore \\(M \\times AO : N \\times GP :: AO^2 : GP^2\\); and by alternation \\(M \\times AO : N \\times GP :: N \\times GP : GP^2\\), therefore \\(M : N :: AO : GP\\), and again by alternation \\(M : N :: AO : GP\\), therefore \\(M : N :: AO : GP\\).\n\nCor. 2. A circle described with the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle as a radius, is equal to two circles described with the other two sides as radii. Let the sides of the triangle be \\(a, b\\) and the hypotenuse \\(h\\), and let the circles described with these lines as radii be \\(A, B\\) and \\(H\\).\n\nbecause \\(A : H :: a^2 : h^2\\)\nand \\(B : H :: b^2 : h^2\\),\ntherefore \\(A + B : H :: a^2 + b^2 : h^2\\) (8, 3.)\nbut \\(a^2 + b^2 = h^2\\) (13, 4.), therefore \\(A + B = H\\).\n\nProp. V. Problem.\n\nHaving given the area of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, and also the area of a similar polygon described about it; to find the areas of regular inscribed and circumscribed polygons, each of double the number of sides.\n\nLet \\(AB\\) be the side of the given inscribed polygon, and \\(EF\\) parallel to \\(AB\\) that of the similar circumscribed polygon, and \\(C\\) the centre of the circle; if the chord \\(AM\\), and the tangents \\(AP, BQ\\) be drawn, the chord \\(AM\\) shall be the side of the inscribed polygon of double the number of sides; and \\(PQ\\) or \\(2P\\) that of the similar circumscribed polygon. Put \\(A\\) for the area of the polygon, of which \\(AB\\) is a side, and \\(B\\) for the area of the circumscribed polygon; also \\(a\\) for the area of the polygon of which \\(AM\\) is a side, and \\(b\\) for the area of the similar circumscribed polygon; then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are by hypothesis known, and it is required to find \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nI. The triangles \\(ACD, ACM\\), which have a common vertex \\(A\\), are to one another as their bases \\(CD, CM\\); besides, these triangles are to one another as the polygons, of which they form like parts, therefore \\(A : a :: CD : CM\\). The triangles \\(CAM, CME\\), which have a common vertex \\(M\\), are to each other as their bases \\(CA, CE\\); they are also to one another as the polygons \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), of which they are like parts; therefore, \\(a : B :: CA : CE\\); but because of the parallels \\(DA, ME, CD, CM :: CA : CE\\); therefore, \\(A : a :: a : B\\); therefore, the polygon \\(a\\), which is one of the two required, is a mean proportional between the two known polygons \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), so that \\(a = \\sqrt{A \\times B}\\).\n\nII. The triangles \\(CPM, CPE\\), having the same altitude \\(CM\\), are to one another as \\(PM\\) to \\(PE\\). But as \\(CP\\) bisects the angle \\(MCE\\), \\(PM : PE :: CM : CE\\) (19, 4.) :: \\(CD : CA :: A : a\\); therefore, \\(CPM : CPE :: A : a\\); and consequently \\(CPM + CPE\\), or \\(CME : 2CPM :: A + a : A\\), and \\(CME : 2CPM :: A + a : 2A\\); but \\(CME\\) and \\(2CPM\\), or \\(CMPA\\), are to one another as the polygons \\(B\\) and \\(b\\), of which they are like parts; therefore, \\(A + a : 2A :: B : b\\). Now the polygon \\(a\\) has been already found, therefore by this last proportion the polygon \\(b\\) is determined; that is, \\(b = \\frac{2A \\times B}{A + a}\\).\n\nProp. VI. Problem.\n\nTo find nearly the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.\n\nLet the radius of the circle \\(= 1\\), then, the sides of the inscribed square being the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle of which the radii are the sides, (see fig.\nthe area of the inscribed square will be \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) (fig. 115.) and the circumscribed square, being the square of the diameter, will be 4. Now, retaining the notation of last problem, if we make \\( A = 2 \\) and \\( B = 4 \\), the formula\n\n\\[ a = \\sqrt{A \\times B}, \\quad b = \\frac{2A \\times B}{A + a} \\]\n\ngives us \\( a = 2.8284271 \\), &c.\n\nthe area of the inscribed octagon, and \\( b = 3.1415926 \\), &c., the area of the circumscribed octagon. By substituting these numbers in the formula, instead of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we shall obtain the areas of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons of 16 sides; and thence we may find those of 32 sides, and so on as in the following table:\n\n| No. of sides | Ins. Polygons | Circ. Polygons |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 4            | 2.000000      | 4.000000      |\n| 8            | 2.8284271    | 3.137085      |\n| 16           | 3.0614674    | 3.1825979     |\n| 32           | 3.1214451    | 3.1517249     |\n| 64           | 3.1365485    | 3.1441184     |\n| 128          | 3.1423311    | 3.1432236     |\n| 256          | 3.1412772    | 3.1417504     |\n| 512          | 3.1415138    | 3.1410321     |\n| 1024         | 3.1415729    | 3.1416026     |\n| 4096         | 3.141594     | 3.1415933     |\n| 8192         | 3.141593     | 3.1415928     |\n| 16384        | 3.1415925    | 3.1415927     |\n| 32768        | 3.1415926    | 3.1415926     |\n\nHence it appears that areas of a regular polygon of 82768 sides inscribed in the circle, and of a similar polygon described about it, differ so little from each other that the numbers which express them are the same as far as the eighth decimal place. And as the circle is greater than the one polygon, and less than the other, its area will be nearly 3.1415926. But the area is the product of the radius and the half of the circumference; therefore, the radius being unity or half the circumference is 3.1415926 nearly; and the radius is to half the circumference, or the diameter is to the circumference, nearly as 1 to 3.1415926.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nIn this way the ratio of the diameter to the circumference may be found to any degree of accuracy; but neither by this, nor any other method yet known, can the ratio be exactly determined.\n\nArchimedes by means of inscribed and circumscribed polygons of 96 sides, found that the diameter is to the circumference as 7 to 22; nearly, which ratio is nearer to the truth than can be expressed by any smaller numbers; and Metius found it to be more nearly as 113 to 355. Both of these expressions are convenient on account of the smallness of the numbers, but later mathematicians have carried the approximation to a much greater degree of accuracy. Thus, it has been found that the diameter being 1, the circumference is greater than 3.1415926535897932, but less than the same number having its last figure increased by unity; and some have even had the patience to carry the approximation as far as the 150th place of decimals.\n\n---\n\n**Sect. VII.**\n\n**Definitions.**\n\nI. A straight line is *perpendicular*, or at right angles, to a plane, when it is perpendicular to every straight line meeting it in that plane. The plane is also perpendicular to the line.\n\nII. A line is *parallel* to a plane, when they cannot meet each other, although both be produced. The plane is also parallel to the line.\n\nIII. Parallel planes are such as cannot meet each other, though produced.\n\nIV. It will be demonstrated (Theor. 3.) that the common section of two planes is a straight line; this being premised, the inclination of two planes is the angle contained by two straight lines drawn perpendicular to the line, which is their common section, from any point in it, the one perpendicular being drawn in the one plane, and the other in the other plane.\n\nThis angle may be either acute or obtuse.\n\nV. If it be a right angle the two planes are perpendicular to each other.\n\nVI. A *solid angle* is that which is made by the meeting of more than two plane angles, which are not in the same plane, in one point. Thus the solid angle \\( S \\) is formed by the plane angles ASB, BSC, CSD, DSA.\n\n**Theorem I.**\n\nOne part of a straight line cannot be in a plane and another part above it.\n\n---\n\n**Theorem II.**\n\nTwo straight lines which cut each other in a plane determine its position; that is, the plane can coincide with these lines only in one position.\n\nLet the straight lines \\( AB, AC \\) cut each other in \\( A \\); conceive a plane to pass through \\( AB \\), and to be turned about that line, till it passes through the point \\( C \\); and this it can manifestly do only in one position; then, as the points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) are in the plane, the whole line \\( AC \\) must be in the plane; therefore there is only one position in which the plane can coincide with the same two lines \\( AB, AC \\).\n\nCor. Therefore, a triangle \\( ABC \\), or three points \\( A, B, C \\) not in a straight line, determine the position of a plane.\n\n**Theorem III.**\n\nIf two planes \\( AB, CD \\) intersect each other, their intersection is a straight line.\n\nLet \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) be two points in the line of common section, and let a straight line \\( EF \\) be drawn between them; then the line \\( EF \\) must be in the plane \\( AB \\).\n(7. def. 1.) and the same line must also be in the same plane CD, therefore it must be the common section of them both.\n\n**Theorem IV.**\n\nIf a straight line AP is perpendicular to two straight lines PB, PC at P the point of their intersection; it will also be perpendicular to the plane MN, in which these lines are.\n\nDraw any other line PQ in the plane MN, and from Q any point in that line draw QD parallel to PB; make DC = DP; join CQ, meeting PB in B; and join AB, AQ, AC. Because DQ is parallel to PB, and PD = DC; therefore BQ = QC, and BC is bisected in Q. Hence in the triangle BAC,\n\n\\[ AB^2 + AC^2 = 2AQ^2 + 2BQ^2, \\] (16. 4.)\n\nand in the like manner, in the triangle PBC,\n\n\\[ PB^2 + PC^2 = 2PQ^2 + 2CQ^2; \\]\n\ntherefore, taking equal quantities from equal quantities, that is, subtracting the two last quantities, which are put equal to each other, from the two first, and observing, that as APR, APO are by hypothesis right-angled triangles, \\( AB^2 - BP^2 = AP^2 \\), and \\( AC^2 - CP^2 = AP^2 \\), we have\n\n\\[ AP^2 + AP^2 = 2AQ^2 - 2PQ^2, \\]\n\nand therefore \\( AP^2 = AQ^2 - PQ^2 \\), or \\( AP^2 + PQ^2 = AQ^2 \\); therefore the triangle APQ is right-angled at P, (schol. 15. 4.) and consequently AP is perpendicular to the plane MN (Def. 1.).\n\nCor. 1. The perpendicular AP is shorter than any oblique line AQ, therefore it measures the distance of the point A from the plane.\n\nCor. 2. From the same point P in a plane no more than one perpendicular can be drawn. For if it be possible that there can be two perpendiculars, conceive a plane to pass through them, and to intersect the plane MN in the straight line PQ; then these perpendiculars will be in the same plane, and both perpendicular to the same line PQ, at the same point P in that line, which is impossible.\n\nIt is also impossible that from a point without a plane two perpendiculars can be drawn to the plane; for if the straight lines AP, AQ could be two such perpendiculars, then the triangle APQ would have two right angles, which is impossible.\n\n**Theorem V.**\n\nIf a straight line AP be perpendicular to a plane MN, every straight line DE parallel to AP is perpendicular to the same plane.\n\nLet a plane pass through the parallel lines AP, DE, and intersect the plane MN in the line PD; through D draw BC at right angles to PD; take DC = DB, and join PB, PC, AB, AC, AD. Because DB = DC, therefore PB = PC; (cor. 5. 1.) and because AP is perpendicular to the plane MN, so that APB, APC are right angles, \\( AB = AC \\), (cor. 5. 1.) therefore ABC is an isosceles triangle; and since its base BC is bisected at D, BC is perpendicular to AD; (schol. 11. 1.) but by construction BC is perpendicular to PD; therefore (4.)\n\n\\[ BC \\text{ or } BD \\text{ is perpendicular to the plane passing through the lines } AD \\text{ and } PD, \\text{ or } AP \\text{ and } DE; \\text{ hence } ED \\text{ is perpendicular to } DE, \\text{ but } PD \\text{ is also perpendicular to } DE, \\text{ (19. 1.) therefore } DE \\text{ is perpendicular to the two lines } DP, DB; \\text{ and therefore it is perpendicular to the plane } MN \\text{ passing through them.} \\]\n\nCor. 1. Conversely, if the straight lines AP, DE are perpendicular to the same plane MN, they are parallel; for if not, through D draw a parallel to AP; this parallel will be perpendicular to the plane MN, (by the theorem) therefore, from the same point D two perpendiculars may be drawn to a plane, which is impossible (4.).\n\nCor. 2. Two straight lines A and B which are parallel to a third line C, though not in the same plane, are parallel to each other. For suppose a plane to be perpendicular to the line C, the lines A and B parallel to this perpendicular are perpendicular to the same plane; therefore, by the preceding corollary they are parallel between themselves.\n\n**Theorem VI.**\n\nTwo planes MN, PQ, perpendicular to the same straight line AB, are parallel to each other.\n\nFor, if they can meet each other, let O be a point common to both, and join OA, OB; then the line AB, which is perpendicular to the plane MN, must be perpendicular to AO, a line drawn in the plane MN from the point in which AB meets that plane. For the same reason AB is perpendicular to BO; therefore, OA, OB are two perpendiculars drawn from the same point O, to the same straight line AB, which is impossible.\n\n**Theorem VII.**\n\nThe intersections EF, GH of two parallel planes MN, PQ with a third plane FG, are parallel:\n\nFor if the lines EF, GH, situated in the same plane, are not parallel, they must meet if produced; therefore, the planes MN, PQ, in which they are, must also meet, which is contrary to the hypothesis of their being parallel.\n\n**Theorem VIII.**\n\nAny straight line AB, perpendicular to MN one of two parallel planes MN, PQ, is also perpendicular to PQ the other plane.\n\nFrom B draw any straight line BC in the plane PQ, and let a plane pass through the lines AB, BC, and meet the plane MN in the line AD, then AD will be parallel to BC, (7.) and since AB is perpendicular to the plane MN, it must be perpendicular to BC; (19. 1.) hence (Def. 1.) the line AB is perpendicular to the plane PQ.\n\n**Theorem IX.**\n\nParallel straight lines EG, FH, comprehended between two parallel planes MN, PQ, are equal.\n\nLet a plane pass through the lines EG, FH, and\nmeet the parallel planes in EF and GH; then EF and GH are parallel (7.) as well as EG and FH; therefore, EGHF is a parallelogram, and EFG = H.\n\nCor. Hence two parallel planes are everywhere at the same distance from each other. For, if EF and GH are perpendicular to the two planes, they are parallel, (1. cor. 5.) therefore they are equal.\n\n**Theorem X.**\n\nIf two straight lines CA, EA, meeting one another, be parallel to two other lines DB, FB, that meet one another, though not in the same plane with the first two; the first two and the other two shall contain equal angles, and the plane passing through the first two shall be parallel to the plane passing through the other two.\n\nTake AC = BD, AE = BF, and join CE, DF, AB, CD, EF. Because AC is equal and parallel to BD, the figure ABDG is a parallelogram; therefore, CD is equal and parallel to AB. For a similar reason EF is equal and parallel to AB; therefore also CE is equal and parallel to DF (2 cor. 5. and 28. 1.); therefore the triangles CAE, DBF are equal, (10. 1.) hence the angle CAE = DBF.\n\nIn the second place, the plane ACE is parallel to the plane BDF: For suppose that the plane parallel to BDF, passing through the point A, meets the lines CD, EF in any other points than C and E (for example in G and H,) then (9.) the three lines AB, GD, FH are equal; but the three lines AB, CD, EF have been shown to be equal; therefore, CD = GD, and FH = EF, which is absurd, therefore the plane ACE is parallel to BDF.\n\n**Theorem XI.**\n\nIf a straight line AP be perpendicular to a plane MN, any plane APB, passing through AP, shall be perpendicular to the plane MN.\n\nLet BC be the intersection of the planes AB, MN; if in the plane MN the line DE be drawn perpendicular to BP, the line AP, being perpendicular to the plane MN, shall be perpendicular to each of the straight lines BC, DE; therefore the angle APD is a right angle; now PA and PD are drawn in the planes AB, MN perpendicular to their common section, therefore (5. Def.) the planes AB, MN are perpendicular to each other.\n\n**Scholium.**\n\nWhen three straight lines, such as AP, BP, DP, are perpendicular to each other, each is perpendicular to the plane of the two other lines.\n\n**Theorem XII.**\n\nIf the plane AB is perpendicular to the plane MN; and in the plane AB a straight line PA be drawn perpendicular to BP, the common intersection of the planes, then shall PA be perpendicular to the plane MN.\n\nFor, if in the plane MN, a line PD be drawn perpendicular to PB, the angle APD shall be a right angle, because the planes are perpendicular to each other, therefore, the line AP is perpendicular to the two lines PB, PD, therefore it is perpendicular to their plane MN.\n\nCor. If the plane AB be perpendicular to the plane MN, and from any point P, in their common intersection, a perpendicular be drawn to the plane MN; this perpendicular shall be in the plane AB; for if it is not, a perpendicular AP may be drawn in the plane AB to the common intersection BP, which will be at the same time perpendicular to the plane MN; therefore, at the same point P, there may be two perpendiculars to a plane NM, which is impossible (4.)\n\n**Theorem XIII.**\n\nIf two planes AB, AD are perpendicular to a third, Fig. 136., their common intersection AP is perpendicular to the third plane.\n\nFor, if through the point P, a perpendicular be drawn to the plane MN, this perpendicular shall be in the plane AB, and also in the plane AD, (cor. 12.) therefore it is at their common intersection AP.\n\n**Theorem XIV.**\n\nIf two straight lines be cut by parallel planes, they shall be cut in the same ratio.\n\nLet the line AB meet the planes MN, PQ, RS in A, F, B; and let CD meet them in C, F, D, then shall AE : EB :: CF : FD. For draw AD meeting the plane PQ in G, and join AC, EG, GF, BD; the lines EG, BD, being the common sections of the plane of the triangle ABD and the parallel planes PQ, RS, are parallel (7.) and in like manner it appears, that AC, GF are parallel; therefore AE : EB (: AG : GD) :: CF : FD.\n\n**Theorem XV.**\n\nIf a solid angle be contained by three plane angles, the sum of any two of these is greater than the third.\n\nIt is evidently only necessary to demonstrate the theorem, when the plain angle which is compared with the sum of the other two is greater than either of them; for, if it were equal to or less than one of them, the theorem would be manifest: therefore let S be a solid angle formed by three plane angles ASB, ASC, BSC, of which ASB is the greatest. In the plane ASB make the angle BSD = BSC; draw any straight line ADB, and having taken SC = SD, join AC, BC; the triangles BSC, BSD having two sides, and the included angle of the one equal to two sides, and the included angle of the other, each to each, are equal (5. 1.), therefore BD = BC; now AB < AC + BC, therefore, taking BD from the first of these unequal quantities, and BC from the second, we get AD < AC; and as the triangles ASD, ASC have SD = SC, and SA common to both, and AD < AC, therefore (9. 1.) the angle ASD < ASC; and, adding DSB to the one, and CSB to the other, ASB < ASC + BSC.\n\n**Theorem XVI.**\n\nIf each of two solid angles be contained by three Fig. 133. plane\nplane angles equal to one another, each to each, the planes in which the equal angles are, have the same inclination to one another.\n\nLet the angle ASB = DTE, the angle ASC = DTF, and the angle BSC = ETF; the two planes ASB, ASC, shall have to each other the same inclination as the two planes DTE, DTF.\n\nTake A any point in SA, and in the two planes ASB, ASC, draw AB and AC perpendiculars to AS, then (def. 4.) the angle BAC is the inclination of these planes; again, take TD = SA, and in the planes TDE, TDF draw DE and DF perpendiculars to TD, and the angle EDF shall be the inclination of these other planes; join BC, EF. The triangles ASB, DTE have the side AS = DT, the angle SAB = TDE and ASB = DTF, therefore the triangles are equal, and thus AB = DE, and SB = TE: In like manner it appears that the triangles ASC, DTF are equal, and therefore, that AC = DF, and SC = TF. Now the triangles BSC, ETF, having BS = TE, SC = TF, and the angle BSC = ETF, are also equal, and therefore Of Solids bounded by Planes.\n\nIf the three plane angles which contain the solid angles, are equal each to each, and if besides the angles are also disposed in the same order in the two solid angles, then these angles when applied to one another will coincide, and be equal. But if the plane angles are disposed in a contrary order, the solid angles will not coincide, although the theorem is equally true in both cases. In this last case the solid angles are called Symmetrical angles.\n\nSECT. VIII. OF SOLIDS BOUNDED BY PLANES.\n\nDefinitions.\n\nI. A Solid is that which has length, breadth, and thickness.\n\nII. A Prism is a solid contained by plane figures, of which two that are opposite are equal, similar, and parallel; and the others are parallelograms.\n\nTo construct this solid, let ABCDE be any polygon; if in a plane parallel to ABC there be drawn straight lines FG, GH, HI, &c. equal and parallel to the sides AB, BC, CD, &c. so as to form a polygon FGHIK equal to ABCDE, and straight lines AF, BG, CH, &c. be drawn, joining the vertices of the homologous angles in the two planes; the planes or faces ARG, BCHG, &c. thus formed will be parallelograms; and the solid ABCDEFGHIK contained by these parallelograms and the two polygons, is the prism itself.\n\nIII. The equal and parallel polygons ABCDE, FGHIK are called the Bases of the prism, and the distance between the bases is its Altitude.\n\nIV. When the base of a prism is a parallelogram, and consequently the figure has all its faces parallelograms, it is called a parallelopiped. A parallelopiped is rectangular when all its faces are rectangles.\n\nV. A Cube is a rectangular parallelopiped contained by six equal squares.\n\nVI. A Pyramid is a solid contained by several planes, which meet in the same point A, and terminate in a polygonal plane BCD.\n\nVII. The polygon ABCDE is called the Base of the pyramid; the point S is its Vertex; and a perpendicular let fall from the vertex upon the base is called its Altitude.\n\nVIII. Two solids are similar, when they are contained by the same number of similar planes, similarly situated, and having like inclinations to one another.\n\nTheorem I.\n\nTwo prisms are equal when the three planes which contain a solid angle of the one are equal to the three planes which contain a solid angle of the other, each to each, and are similarly situated.\n\nLet the base ABCDE be equal to the base abcde, the parallelogram ABGF equal to the parallelogram abgjf, and the parallelogram BCHG equal to the parallelogram bchjg; the prism ABCI shall be equal to the prism abcij.\n\nFor let the base ABCDE be applied to its equal the base abcde, so that they may coincide with each other; then, as the three plane angles which form the solid angle B are equal to the three plane angles which form the angle b, each to each, viz., ABC = abc, ABG = abg, and GBC = bc, and as these angles are similarly situated, the solid angles B and b are equal (15.7.) therefore the side BG shall fall upon the side bg; and because the parallelograms ABGF, abgjf are equal, the side FG shall fall upon its equal fg; in like manner it may be shewn, that GH falls upon gh, therefore the upper base FGHIK coincides entirely with its equal fghik, and the two solids coincide with each other, or occupy the same space, therefore the prisms are equal.\n\nScholium.\n\nA prism is entirely determined, when its base ABCDE is known, and its edge BG is given in magnitude and position; for if through the point G, GF be drawn equal and parallel to AB, and GH equal and parallel to BC, and the polygon FGHIK be described equal to ABCDE (22.5.), it is evident that the points\nOf Solids points FKI will have determinate positions; therefore bounded by any two prisms constructed with the same data cannot be unequal.\n\n**Theorem II.**\n\nFig. 135. In any parallelopiped the opposite planes are equal and parallel.\n\nFrom the nature of the solid (4. def.) the bases ABCD, EFGH are equal parallelograms, and their sides are parallel, therefore the planes AC, EG are parallel; and because AD is equal and parallel to BC, and AE is equal and parallel to BF, the angle DAE = CBF, (10. 7.) therefore also the parallelogram DAEB is equal to the parallelogram CBFG. It may in like manner be demonstrated, that the opposite parallelograms ABFE, DCGH are equal and parallel.\n\nCor. Hence, in a parallelopiped, any one of the six planes which contain it may be taken for its base.\n\n**Theorem III.**\n\nFig. 136. The plane BDHF, which passes through two parallel opposite edges BF, DH, of a parallelopiped AG, divides it into two triangular prisms ABDHEF, GHFBCD, equal to one another.\n\nFor the triangles ABD, EFH, having their sides equal and parallel, are equal, and the lateral faces ABPE, ADHE, BDHF are parallelograms; therefore the solid ABDHEF is a prism; for like reasons the solid GHFBCD is a prism. Again, because the plane angles which contain the solid angle at G are equal to those which contain the solid angle at A, viz. the angle FGH = DAB, FGC = DAE, and HGC = BAE, the planes in which these angles are have the same inclination to one another, (16.7.) as, however, these angles are not disposed in the same order, but in a contrary order, the solid angles cannot be made to coincide with one another, and consequently the prisms cannot be proved equal by superposition, as in Theorem I. Their equality may however be established by reasoning thus:\n\nThe inclination of each of any two adjacent faces of a prism to the base, and the length of an edge being given, the prism is evidently restricted to one determinate magnitude; and it will evidently have the same magnitude whichever of the two sides of the base it may stand upon; that is, whether it be constructed above or below the base. Now if the upper base FGH of the one prism be applied to the lower base DAB of the other, so that the sides FG, GH, FH may be upon the sides DA, AB, DB equal to them, then the prism GHFBCD will have the position ABDHEF; and the two faces ABFE', ADHE' of the prism below the base will have each the same inclination to it, as the equivalent faces ABFE, ADHE of the prism above the base; and the edge AE' is equal to the edge AE; therefore the conditions which determine the magnitude of both prisms are identical, and consequently the prisms are equal.\n\n**Theorem IV.**\n\nIf two parallelopipeds AG, AL have a common base ABCD, and have their upper bases in the same plane, and between the same parallel straight lines EK, HL, the two parallelopipeds are equivalent to each other.\n\nBecause AE is parallel to BF, and HE to GF, the angle AEI = BFK, HEI = GFK, and HEA = GFB; of these six angles the three first form the solid angle E, and the three others form the solid angle F; therefore, since the plane angles are equal each to each, and similarly situated, the solid angles E and F are equal. Now if the prism AEIDHM be applied to the prism BFKCGL, so that their bases AEI, BFK, which are equal, may coincide with each other, then, because the solid angle E is equal to the solid angle F, the side EH shall fall upon FG, and this is all that is necessary to prove that the two prisms coincide entirely, for the base AEI and the edge EH determine the prism AEM, and the base BFK and the edge FG determine the prism BFL; therefore the prisms are equal. But if from the solid AEL, the prism AEM be taken away, here will remain the parallelopiped AIL; and if from the same solid AEL, the prism BFL be taken away, there will remain the parallelopiped AEG; therefore the parallelopipeds AIL, AEG are equivalent to each other.\n\n**Theorem V.**\n\nParallelopipeds upon the same base, and having the same altitude, are equivalent to one another.\n\nLet ABCD be the common base of the two parallelopipeds AG, AL, which, because they have the same altitude, will have their upper bases in the same plane; then, because EF and AB are equal and parallel, as also IK and AB; EF is parallel to IK, (cor. 2. 5. 7.) for a similar reason GF is parallel to LK. Let the sides EF, HG, as also the sides LK, IM, be produced, so as to form by their intersections the parallelogram NOPQ; it is manifest that this parallelogram is equal to each of the bases EFGH, IKLM. Now, if we suppose a third parallelopiped, which, with the same lower base ABCD, has for its upper base NOPQ, this third parallelopiped will be equivalent to the parallelopiped AG, (4.) for the same reason the third parallelopiped will be equivalent to the parallelopiped AL; therefore the two parallelopipeds AG, AL, which have the same base and the same altitude, are equivalent to one another.\n\n**Theorem VI.**\n\nAny parallelopiped AG is equivalent to a rectangular parallelopiped, having the same altitude, and an equivalent base.\n\nAt the points A, B, C, D, let AI, BK, CL, DM, be drawn perpendicular to the plane ABCD, and terminating in the plane of the upper base; then, IK, KL,\nSect. VIII.\n\nOf Solids KL, LM, MI, being joined, a parallelopiped AL will be bounded by thus formed, which will manifestly have its lateral faces AK, BL, CM, DI rectangles; and if the base AC is also a rectangle, the solid AL will be a rectangular parallelopiped equivalent to the parallelopiped AG. But if ABCD is not a rectangle, (fig. 130.) draw AO and BN perpendicular to CD, and OQ and NP perpendicular to DC, meeting ML in Q and P; the solid ABNOIKPQ will manifestly be a rectangular parallelopiped, which will be equal to the parallelopiped AL, for they have the same base ABKI, and the same altitude, viz. AO; therefore the rectangular parallelopiped AP is equivalent to the parallelopiped AG, (fig. 130.) and they have the same altitude, and the base ABNO of the former is equivalent to the base ABCD of the latter.","sp":299,"ep":313}]
