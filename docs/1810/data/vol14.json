Melody is a series of sounds which succeed one to another in a manner agreeable to the ear.\n\n2. A Chord is a combination of several sounds heard together; and Harmony is properly a series of chords of which the succession pleases the ear. A single chord is\n\n(K) From my general recommendation of this code, I except the reflections on the principle of sound which are at the end, and which I should not advise any one to read.\n\n(L) Printed at Paris by Lambert in the year 1754.\n\n(M) In addition to the works mentioned in the text, we recommend to our readers, Holden's Essay, Glasgow 1770, Edin. 1805; Kollmann's Essay on Musical Harmony, 1796; his Essay on Musical Composition, fol. 1799; Shield's Introduction, 1800; and Dr Callicott's Musical Grammar, 1806.\nDefinitions, is likewise sometimes called harmony, to signify the coalescence of the sounds which form the chord, and the sensation produced in the ear by that coalescence. We shall occasionally use the word harmony in this last sense, but in such a manner as never to leave our meaning ambiguous.\n\n3. An Interval, in melody and harmony, is the distance, or difference in pitch, between one sound, and another higher or lower than it.\n\n4. That we may learn to distinguish the intervals, and the manner of perceiving them, let us take the ordinary scale C, D, E, F, G, A, B, c, which every person whose ear or voice is not extremely false naturally modulates. The following observations will occur to us in fingering this scale.\n\nThe found D is higher or sharper than the found C, the found E higher than the found D, the found F higher than the found E, &c., and so through the whole octave; so that the interval, or the distance from the found C to the found D, is less than the interval or distance between the found C and the found E, the interval from C to F is less than that between C and F, &c., and in short that the interval from the first to the second C is the greatest of all.\n\nTo distinguish the first from the second C, we have marked the last with a small letter (n).\n\n5. In general, the interval between two sounds is proportionally greater, as one of these sounds is higher or lower with relation to the other; but it is necessary to observe, that two sounds may be equally high, strong, or low, though unequal in their force. The string of acute and a violin touched with a bow produces always a sound grave, equally high, whether strongly or faintly struck; the sound will only have a greater or lesser degree of strength. It is the same with vocal modulation; let any one form a sound by gradually swelling the voice, the sound may be perceived to increase in force, whilst it continues always equally low or equally high.\n\n6. We must likewise observe concerning the scale, that the intervals between C and D, between D and E, between E and F, between G and A, between A and B, and between B and C, are equal, or at least nearly equal; and that the intervals between E and F, and between B and C, are likewise equal among themselves, but consist almost only of half the former. This fact is known and recognised by every one: the reason for it shall be given in the sequel; in the meantime everyone may ascertain its reality by the assistance of an experiment (o).\n\n---\n\n(n) We shall afterwards find that three different series of the seven letters are used, which we have distinguished by capitals, small Roman, and Italic characters. When the notes represented by small Roman characters occur in this treatise we shall, merely to distinguish them from the typography of the text, place them in inverted commas, thus 'c', 'd', &c.\n\n(o) This experiment may be easily tried. Let anyone sing the scale C, D, E, F, G, A, B, 'c', it will be immediately observed without difficulty, that the last four notes of the octave G, A, B, 'c', are quite similar to the first C, D, E, F; inasmuch, that if, after having sung this scale, one would choose to repeat it, beginning with C in the same tone which was occupied by G in the former scale, the note D of the last scale would have the same sound with the note A in the first, the E with the B, and the F with the 'c'.\n\nWhence it follows, that the interval between C and D, is the same as between G and A; between D and E, as between A and B, and E and F, as between B and 'c'.\n\nFrom D to E, from F to G, there is the same interval as from C to D. To be convinced of this, we need only sing the scale once more; then sing it again, beginning with C, in this last scale, in the same tone which was given to D in the first; and it will be perceived, that the D in the second scale will have the same sound, at least as far as the ear can discover, with the E in the former scale; whence it follows, that the difference between D and E is, at least as far as the ear can perceive, equal to that between C and D. It will also be found, that the interval between F and G is, so far as our senses can determine, the same with that between C and D.\n\nThis experiment may perhaps be tried with some difficulty by those who are not inured to form the notes and change the key; but such may very easily perform it by the assistance of a harpsichord, by means of which the performer will be saved the trouble of retaining the sounds in one intonation whilst he performs another. In touching upon this harpsichord the keys G, A, B, 'c', and in performing with the voice at the same time C, D, E, F, in such a manner that the same sound may be given to C in the voice with that of the key G in the harpsichord, it will be found that D in the vocal intonation shall be the same with A upon the harpsichord, &c.\n\nIt will be found likewise by the same harpsichord, that if one should sing the scale beginning with C in the same tone with E on the instrument, the D, which ought to have followed C, will be higher by an extremely perceptible degree than the F which follows E; thus it may be concluded, that the interval between E and F is less than between C and D; and if one would rise from F to another sound which is at the same distance from F, as F from E, he would find, in the same manner, that the interval from E to this new sound is almost the same as that between C and D. The interval then from E to F is nearly half of that between C and D.\n\nSince then, in the scale thus divided, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, 'c', the first division is perfectly like the last; and since the intervals between C and D, between D and E, and between F and G, are equal; it follows, that the intervals between G and A, and between A and B, are likewise equal to every one of the three intervals between C and D, between D and E, and between F and G; and that the intervals between E and F and between B and 'c' are also equal, but that they only constitute one half of the others.\nElements.\n\nDefinitions.\n\n7. It is for this reason that they have called the interval from E to F, and from B to C, a semitone; whereas those between C and D, D and E, F and G, G and A, A and B, are tones.\n\n* Plate CC.XXIII.\n\nThe tone is likewise called a second major*, and the semitone a second minor\u2020.\n\n8. To descend or rise diatonically, is to descend or rise from one found to another by the interval of a tone or of a semitone, or in general by seconds, whether major or minor; as from D to C, or from C to D, from F to E, or from E to F.\n\nII. The Terms by which the different Intervals of the Scale are denominated.\n\nThird minor, what.\n\nThird major, what.\n\nFourth, what.\n\nTriton, what.\n\nFifth, what.\n\nSixth minor, what.\n\nSixth major, what.\n\nSeventh minor, what.\n\nSeventh major, what.\n\nOctave, what.\n\nUnison, what.\n\never unequal in their force, are said to be in unison one with the other.\n\n11. If two founds form between them any interval, whatever it be, we say, that the highest when ascending is in that interval with relation to the lowest; and when descending, we pronounce the lowest in the same interval with relation to the highest. Thus in the third minor, E, G, where E is the lowest and G the highest found, G is a third minor from E ascending, and E is third minor from G in descending.\n\n12. In the same manner, if speaking of two sonorous bodies, we should say, that the one is a fifth above the other in ascending; this infers that the found given by the one is at the distance of a fifth ascending from the found given by the other.\n\nIII. Of Intervals greater than the Octave.\n\n13. If, after having sung the scale C, D, E, F, G, Fig. 21 A, B, c, one would carry this scale still farther in ascent, it would be discovered without difficulty that a new scale would be formed, c, d, e, f, &c. entirely similar to the former, and of which the founds will be an octave ascending, each to its correspondent note in the former scale; thus 'd', the second note of the second scale, will be an octave in ascent to the D of the first scale; in the same manner 'e' shall be the octave to E, &c. and so of the rest.\n\n14. As there are nine notes from the first C to the Ninth, second 'd', the interval between these two founds is called a ninth, and this ninth is composed of six full tones and two semitones. For the same reason the interval from C to 'f' is called an eleventh, and the interval between C and 'g' a twelfth, &c.\n\nIt is plain that the ninth is the octave of the second, eleventh of the fourth, and the twelfth of the seventh, fifteenth, &c.\n\nThe octave above the octave of any found is called a double octave*; the octave of the double octave is called a triple octave, and so of the rest.\n\nThe double octave is likewise called a fifteenth: and for the same reason the double octave of the third is called a seventeenth, the double octave of the fifth a nineteenth, &c. (r).\n\nIV.\n\n(p) Let us suppose two vocal strings formed of the same matter, of the same thickness, and equal in their tension, but unequal in their length; it will be found by experience,\n\n1stly, That if the shortest is equal to half the longest, the sound which it will produce must be an octave above the sound produced by the longest.\n\n2ndly, That if the shortest constitutes a third part of the longest, the sound which it produces must be a twelfth above the sound produced by the longest.\n\n3rdly, That if it constitutes the fifth part, its sound will be a seventeenth above.\n\nBesides, it is a truth demonstrated and generally admitted, that in proportion as one musical string is less than another, the vibrations of the least will be more frequent (that is to say, its departures and returns through the same space) in the same time; for instance, in an hour, a minute, a second, &c. in such a manner that one string which constitutes a third part of another, forms three vibrations, whilst the largest has only accomplished one. In the same manner, a string which is one half less than another, performs two vibrations, whilst the other only completes one; and a string which is only the fifth part of another, will perform five vibrations in the same time which is occupied by the other in one.\n\nFrom thence it follows, that the sound of a string is proportionally higher or lower, as the number of its vibrations is greater or smaller in a given time; for instance, in a second.\n\nIt is for that reason, that if we represent any sound whatever by 1, one may represent the octave above by 2, that is to say, by the number of vibrations formed by the string which produces the octave, whilst the longest string only vibrates once; in the same manner we may represent the twelfth above the sound 1 by 3, the seventeenth...\nIV. What is meant by Sharps and Flats.\n\n15. It is plain that one may imagine the five tones which enter into the scale, as divided each into two semitones; thus one may advance from C to D, forming in his progress an intermediate sound, which shall be higher by a semitone than C, and lower in the same degree than D. A sound in the scale is called sharp, when it is raised by a semitone; and it is marked with this character \u266f; thus C \u266f signifies C sharp, that is to say, C raised by a semitone above its pitch in the natural scale. A sound in the scale depressed by a semitone is called flat, and is marked thus, \u266d; thus A \u266d signifies A flat, or A depressed by a semitone.\n\nV. What is meant by Consonances and Dissonances.\n\n16. A chord composed of sounds whose union or coalescence pleases the ear is called a consonance; and the sounds which form this chord are said to be consonant one with relation to the other. The reason of this definition's denomination is, that a chord is found more perfect, as the sounds which form it coalesce more closely among themselves.\n\n17. The octave of a sound is the most perfect of consonances of which that sound is susceptible; then the fifth, afterwards the third, &c. This is a fact founded on experiment.\n\n18. A number of sounds simultaneously produced dissonance, whose union is displeasing to the ear is called a dissonance, and the sounds which form it are said to be dissonant one with relation to the other. The second, the tritone, and the seventh of a sound, are dissonants with relation to it. Thus the sounds C D, C B, or F B, &c. simultaneously heard, form a dissonance. The reason which renders dissonance disagreeable, is, that the sounds which compose it, seem by no means coalescent to the ear, and are heard each of them by itself as distinct sounds, though produced at the same time.\n\nPART I. THEORY OF HARMONY.\n\nCHAP. I. Preliminary and Fundamental Experiments.\n\nEXPERIMENT I.\n\n19. WHEN a sonorous body is struck till it gives a sound, the ear, besides the principal sound and its octave, perceives two other sounds very high, of which one is the twelfth above the principal sound, that is to say, the octave to the fifth of that sound; and the other is the seventeenth major about the same sound, that is to say, the double octave of its third major.\n\n20. This experiment is peculiarly sensible upon the thick strings of the violoncello, of which the sound being extremely low, gives to an ear, though not very much practised, an opportunity of distinguishing with sufficient ease and clearness the twelfth and seventeenth now in question (Q).\n\n---\n\nteeth major above 5, &c. But it is very necessary to remark, that by these numerical expressions, we do not pretend to compare sounds as such; for sounds in themselves are nothing but mere sensations, and it cannot be said of any sensation that it is double or triple to another: thus the expressions 1, 2, 3, &c. employed to denote a sound, its octave above, its twelfth above, &c. signify only, that if a string performs a certain number of vibrations, for instance, in a second, the string which is in the octave above shall double the number in the same time, the string which is in the twelfth above shall triple it, &c.\n\nThus to compare sounds among themselves is nothing else than to compare among themselves the numbers of vibrations which are formed in a given time by the strings that produce these sounds.\n\n(Q) Since the octave above the sound x is z, the octave below that same sound shall be \u00bd; that is to say, that the string which produces this octave shall have performed half its vibration, whilst the string which produces the sound 1 shall have completed one. To obtain therefore the octave above any sound, the operator must multiply the quantity which expresses the sound by 2; and to obtain the octave below, he must on the contrary divide the same quantity by 2.\n\nIt is for that reason that if any sound whatever, for instance C, is denominated\n\n| Quantity | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| 1        | Its octave above will be |\n| 2        | Its double octave above |\n| 4        | Its triple octave above |\n| 8        | In the same manner its octave below will be |\n| \u00bd        | Its double octave below |\n| \u00bc        | Its triple octave below |\n| \u215b        | And so of the rest. |\n| 3        | Its twelfth above |\n| \u2153        | Its twelfth below |\n| 5        | Its 17th major above |\n| \u2155        | Its 17th major below |\n\nThe fifth then above the sound 1 being the octave beneath the twelfth, shall be, as we have immediately observed,\n21. The principal sound is called the generator *; and the two other sounds which it produces, and with which it is accompanied, are, inclusive of its octave, called its harmonics \u00a7.\n\nExperiment II.\n\n22. There is no person insensible of the resemblance which subsists between any sound and its octave, whether above or below. These two sounds, when heard together, almost entirely coalesce in the organ of sensation. We may be further convinced (by two facts which are extremely simple) of the facility with which one of these sounds may be taken for the other.\n\nLet it be supposed that any person has an inclination to sing a tune, and having at first begun this air\n\nVOL. XIV. Part II.\n\nserved, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\); which signifies that this string performs \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) vibrations; that is to say, one vibration and a half during a single vibration of the string which gives the sound 1.\n\nTo obtain the fourth above the sound 1, we must take the twelfth below that sound, and the double octave above that twelfth. In effect, the twelfth below C, for instance, is F, of which the double octave f is the fourth above c. Since then the twelfth below 1 is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), it follows that the double octave above this twelfth, that is to say, the fourth from the sound 1 in ascending, will be \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) multiplied by 4, or \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nIn short, the third major being nothing else but the double octave beneath the seventeenth, it follows, that the third major above the sound 1 will be \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) divided by 4, or in other words \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n\nThe third major of a sound, for instance, the third major E, from the sound C, and its fifth G, form between them a third minor E, G; now E is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), and G \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), by what has been immediately demonstrated: from whence it follows, that the third minor, or the interval between E and G, shall be expressed by the relation of the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to the fraction \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n\nTo determine this relation, it is necessary to remark, that \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) are the same thing with \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), and that \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) are the same thing with \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\): so that \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) shall be to \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) in the same relation as \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) to \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\); that is to say, in the same relation as 10 to 12, or as 5 to 6. If, then, two sounds form between themselves a third minor, and that the first is represented by 5, the second shall be expressed by 6; or, what is the same thing, if the first is represented by 1, the second shall be expressed by \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\).\n\nThus the third minor, an harmonic sound which is even found in the protracted and coalescent tones of a sonorous body between the sound E and G, an harmonic of the principal sound, may be expressed by the fraction \\( \\frac{6}{5} \\).\n\nN.B. One may see by this example, that in order to compare two sounds one with another which are expressed by fractions, it is necessary first to multiply the numerator of the fraction which expresses the first by the denominator of the fraction which expresses the second, which will give a primary number; as here the numerator 5 of the fraction \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), multiplied by 2 of the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), has given 10. Afterwards may be multiplied the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first, which will give a secondary number, as here 12 is the product of 4 multiplied by 3; and the relation between these two numbers (which in the preceding example are 10 and 12), will express the relation between these sounds, or, what is the same thing, the interval which there is between the one and the other; in such a manner, that the farther the relation between these sounds departs from unity, the greater the interval will be.\n\nSuch is the manner in which we may compare two sounds one with another whose numerical value is known.\n\nWe shall now show the manner how the numerical expression of a sound may be obtained, when the relation which it ought to have with another sound is known whose numerical expression is given.\n\nLet us suppose, for example, that the third major of the fifth \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) is sought. That third major ought to be, by what has been shown above, the \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the fifth; for the third major of any sound whatever is the \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of that sound. We must then look for a fraction which expresses the \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\); which is done by multiplying the numerators and denominators of both fractions one by the other, from whence results the new fraction \\( \\frac{9}{16} \\). It will likewise be found that the fifth of the fifth is \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), because the fifth of the fifth is the \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n\nThus far we have only treated of fifths, fourths, thirds major and minor, in ascending; now it is extremely easy to find by the same rules the fifths, fourths, thirds major and minor in descending. For suppose C equal to 1, we have seen that its fifth, its fourth, its third, its major and minor in ascending, are \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\). To find its fifth, its fourth, its third, its major and minor in descending, nothing more is necessary than to reverse these fractions, which will give \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\), \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n\n\\( (\\text{Q}^*) \\) It is not then imagined that we change the value of a sound in multiplying or dividing it by 2, by 4, or by 8, &c., the number which expresses these sounds, since by these operations we do nothing but take the simple double, or triple octave, &c., of the sound in question, and that a sound coalesces with its octave.\n23. To render our ideas still more precise and permanent, we shall call the tone produced by the sonorous body C; it is evident, by the first experiment, that this sound is always attended by its 12th and 17th major; that is to say, with the octave of G, and the double octave of E.\n\n24. This octave of G then, and this double octave of E, produce the most perfect chord which can be joined with C, since that chord is the work and choice of nature (r).\n\n25. For the same reason, the modulation formed by C with the octave of G, and the double octave of E, sung one after the other, would likewise be the most simple and natural of all modulations which do not descend or ascend directly in the diatonic order, if our voices had sufficient compass to form intervals so great without difficulty: but the ease and freedom with which we can substitute its octave to any sound, when it is more convenient for the voice, afford us the means of representing this modulation.\n\n26. It is on this account that, after having sung the tone C, we naturally modulate the third E, and the fifth G, instead of the double octave of E, and the octave of G; from whence we form, by joining the octave of the sound G, this modulation, C, E, G, 'c', which in effect is the simplest and easiest of them all; and which likewise has its origin even in the protracted and compounded tones produced by a sonorous body.\n\n27. The modulation C, E, G, 'c', in which the chord C, E, is a third major, constitutes that kind of harmony or melody which we call the mode major; from whence it follows, that this mode results from the immediate operation of nature.\n\n28. In the modulation C, E, G, of which we have now been treating, the sounds E and G are so proportioned one to the other, that the principal sound C (art. 19.) causes both of them to refund; but the second tone E does not cause G to refund, which only forms the interval of a third minor.\n\n29. Let us then imagine, that, instead of this sound E, one should substitute between the sounds C and G, another note which (as well as the sound C) has the power of causing G to refund, and which is, however, different from the sound C; the sound which we explore ought to be such, by art. 19., that it may have for its 17th major G, or one of the octaves of G; of consequence the sound which we seek ought to be a 17th major below G, or, what is the same thing, a third minor below the same G. Now the sound E being a third minor beneath G, and the third major being (art. 9.) greater by a semitone than the third minor, it follows, that the sound of which we are in search shall be a semitone beneath the natural E, and of consequence E b.\n\n30. This new arrangement, C, E b, G, in which the sounds C and E b have both the power of causing G to refund, though C does not cause E b to refund, is not indeed equally perfect with the first arrangement C, E, G; because in this the two sounds E and G are both the one and the other generated by the principal sound C; whereas, in the other, the sound E b, is not generated by the sound C; but this arrangement C, E b, G, is likewise dictated by nature (art. 19.), though less immediately than the former; and accordingly experience evinces that the ear accommodates itself almost as well to the latter as to the former.\n\n31. In this modulation or chord C, E b, G, C, Origin of it is evident that the third from C to E b is minor; mode minor; and such is the origin of that mode which we call minor (s).\n\n32. The most perfect chords then are, 1. All chords related one to another, as C, E, G, 'c', consisting of perfect any sound, of its third major, of its fifth, and of its chords, octave. 2. All chords related one to another, as C what, E b, G, 'c', consisting of any sound, of its third minor,\n\n(r) The chord formed with the twelfth and seventeenth major united with the principal sound, being exactly conformed to that which is produced by nature, is likewise for that reason the most agreeable of all; especially when the composer can proportion the voices and instruments together in a proper manner to give this chord its full effect. M. Rameau has executed this with the greatest success in the opera of Pygmalion, page 34. where Pygmalion sings with the chorus L'amour triomphe, &c.: in this passage of the chorus, the two parts of the vocal and instrumental basses give the principal sound and its octave; the first part above, or treble, and that of the counter-tenor, produce the seventeenth major, and its octave, in descending; and the second part, or tenor above gives the twelfth.\n\n(s) The origin which we have here given of the mode minor, is the most simple and natural that can possibly be given. M. Rameau deduces it, more artificially, from the following experiment.\u2014If you put in vibration a musical string HI, and if there are at the same time contiguous to this two other strings KN, RW, of which the first shall be a twelfth, and the second a seventeenth major below the string HI, the strings KN, RW will vibrate without being struck as soon as the string HI shall give a sound, and divide themselves by a kind of undulation, the first into three, the last into five equal parts; in such a manner, that, in the vibration of the string KN, you may easily distinguish two points at rest LM, and in the tremulous motion of the string RW, four quiescent points S, T, U, V, all placed at equal distances from each other, and dividing the strings into three or five equal parts. In this experiment, says M. Rameau, if we represent by the note C the tone of the string HI, the two other strings will represent the sounds F and A b; and from thence M. Rameau deduces the modulation F, A b, C, and of consequence the mode minor. The origin which we have assigned to the minor mode, appears more direct and more simple, because it presupposes no other experiment than that of art. 19. and because also the fundamental sound C is still retained in both the modes, without being obliged, as M. Rameau found himself, to change it into F.\nPart I.","sp":113,"ep":119},{"h":"END OF THE FOURTEENTH VOLUME","t":"DIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES OF VOL.

Historians ascribe it to the Aeginetes, the Phoenicians, Tyrians, and the ancient inhabitants of Britain. Some suppose, that the first hint was taken from the flight of the kite; others, as Oppian (De Piscibus, lib. i.), from the fish called nautilus: others ascribe it to accident.\u2014Scripture refers the origin of so useful an invention to God himself, who gave the first specimen thereof in the ark built by Noah under his direction. For the rillery which the good man underwent on account of his enterprise flows evidently enough that the world was then ignorant of anything like navigation, and that they even thought it impossible.\n\nHowever, profane history represents the Phoenicians, especially those of their capital Tyre, as the first navigators; being urged to seek a foreign commerce by the narrowness and poverty of a slip of ground they possessed along the coasts; as well as by the conveniency of two or three good ports, and by their natural genius for traffic. Accordingly, Lebanon, and the other neighbouring mountains, furnishing them with excellent wood for ship-building, in a short time they were masters of a numerous fleet; and constantly hazarding new navigations, and settling new trades, they soon arrived at an incredible pitch of opulence and populousness: insomuch as to be in a condition to send out colonies, the principal of which was that of Carthage; which, keeping up their Phoenician spirit of commerce, in time not only equalled Tyre itself, but vastly surpassed it; sending its merchant fleets through Hercules's Pillars, now the straits of Gibraltar, along the western coasts of Africa and Europe; and even, if we believe some authors, to America itself.\n\nTyre, whose immense riches and power are represented in such lofty terms both by sacred and profane authors, being destroyed by Alexander the Great, its navigation and commerce were transferred by the conqueror to Alexandria, a new city, admirably situated for those purposes; proposed for the capital of the empire of Asia, which Alexander then meditated. And thus arose the navigation of the Egyptians; which was afterwards so much cultivated by the Ptolemies, that Tyre and Carthage were quite forgotten.\n\nEgypt being reduced into a Roman province after the battle of Actium, its trade and navigation fell into the hands of Augustus; in whose time Alexandria was only inferior to Rome; and the magazines of the capital of the world were wholly supplied with merchandises from the capital of Egypt.\n\nAt length, Alexandria itself underwent the fate of Tyre and Carthage; being surprised by the Saracens, who, in spite of the emperor Heraclius, overpread the northern coasts of Africa, &c. whence the merchants being driven, Alexandria has ever since been in a languishing state, though it still has a considerable part of the commerce of the Christian merchants trading to the Levant.\n\nThe fall of Rome and its empire drew along with it not only that of learning and the polite arts, but that of navigation; the barbarians, into whose hands it fell, contenting themselves with the spoils of the industry of their predecessors.\n\nBut no sooner were the more brave among those nations well settled in their new provinces, some in Gaul, as the Franks; others in Spain, as the Goths; and others in Italy, as the Lombards; but they began to learn the advantages of navigation and commerce, and the methods of managing them, from the people they subdued; and this with so much success, that in a little time some of them became able to give new lessons, and set on foot new institutions for its advantage. Thus it is to the Lombards we usually ascribe the invention and use of banks, book-keeping, exchanges, exchanges, &c.\n\nIt does not appear which of the European people, after the settlement of their new masters, first betook themselves to navigation and commerce. Some think it began with the French; though the Italians seem to have the justest title to it; and are accordingly regarded as the restorers thereof, as well as of the polite arts which had been banished together from the time the empire was torn asunder. It is the people of Italy then, and particularly those of Venice and Genoa, who have the glory of this restoration; and it is to their advantageous situation for navigation they in great measure owe their glory. In the bottom of the Adriatic were a great number of marshy islands, only separated by narrow channels, but those well screened, and almost inaccessible, the residence of some fishermen, who here supported themselves by a little trade in fish and salt, which they found in some of these islands. Thither the Veneti, a people inhabiting that part of Italy along the coasts of the gulf, retired, when Alaric king of the Goths, and afterwards Attila king of the Huns, ravaged Italy.\n\nThese new islanders, little imagining that this was to be their fixed residence, did not think of composing any body politic; but each of the 72 islands of this little archipelago continued a long time under its several masters, and each made a distinct commonwealth. When their commerce was become considerable enough to give jealousy to their neighbours, they began to think\nthink of uniting into a body. And it was this union, first begun in the fifth century, but not completed till the eighth, that laid the sure foundation of the future grandeur of the state of Venice. From the time of this union, their fleets of merchantmen were sent to all the ports of the Mediterranean; and at last to those of Egypt, particularly Cairo, a new city, built by the Saracen princes on the eastern banks of the Nile, where they traded for the spices and other products of the Indies. Thus they flourished, increased their commerce, their navigation; and their conquests on the terra firma, till the league of Cambrai in 1508, when a number of jealous princes conspired to their ruin; which was the more easily effected by the diminution of their East India commerce, of which the Portuguese had got one part and the French another. Genoa, which had applied itself to navigation at the same time with Venice, and that with equal success, was a long time its dangerous rival, disputed with it the empire of the sea, and shared with it the trade of Egypt and other parts both of the east and west.\n\nJealousy soon began to break out; and the two republics coming to blows, there was almost continual war for three centuries before the superiority was ascertained; when, towards the end of the 14th century, the battle of Chioza ended the strife; the Genoese, who till then had usually the advantage, having now lost all; and the Venetians, almost become desperate, at one happy blow, beyond all expectation, secured to themselves the empire of the sea, and superiority in commerce.\n\nAbout the same time that navigation was retrieved in the southern parts of Europe, a new society of merchants was formed in the north, which not only carried commerce to the greatest perfection it was capable of till the discovery of the East and West Indies, but also formed a new scheme of laws for the regulation therefore, which still obtain under the names of Utes and Customs of the Sea. This society is that famous league of the Hanse towns, commonly supposed to have begun about the year 1164. See Hanse Towns.\n\nFor the modern state of navigation in England, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal, &c. see Commerce, Company, &c.\n\nWe shall only add, that in examining the causes of commerce passing successively from the Venetians, Genoese, and Hanse towns, to the Portuguese and Spaniards, and from these again to the English and Dutch, it may be established as a maxim, that the relation between commerce and navigation, or, if we may be allowed to say it, their union, is so intimate, that the fall of the one inevitably draws after it that of the other; and that they will always either flourish or dwindle together. Hence so many laws, ordinances, statutes, &c. for its regulation; and hence particularly that celebrated act of navigation, which an eminent foreign author calls the palladium or tutelar deity of the commerce of England; which is the standing rule, not only of the British among themselves, but also of other nations with whom they traffic.\n\nThe art of navigation has been exceedingly improved in modern times, both with regard to the form of the vessels themselves, and with regard to the methods of working them. The use of rowers is now entirely superseded by the improvements made in the formation of the sails, rigging, &c., by which means ships can not only sail much faster than formerly, but can tack in any direction with the greatest facility. It is also very probable that the ancients were neither so well skilled in finding the latitudes, nor in steering their vessels in places of difficult navigation, as the moderns. But the greatest advantage which the moderns have over the ancients is from the mariner's compass, by which they are enabled to find their way with as great facility in the midst of an immeasurable ocean, as the ancients could have done by creeping along the coast, and never going out of sight of land. Some people indeed contend, that this is no new invention, but that the ancients were acquainted with it. They say, that it was impossible for Solomon to have sent ships to Ophir, Tarshish, and Parvaim, which last they will have been to Peru, without this useful instrument. They insist, that it was impossible for the ancients to be acquainted with the attractive virtue of the magnet, and to be ignorant of its polarity. Nay, they affirm, that this property of the magnet is plainly mentioned in the book of Job, where the lodestone is mentioned by the name of topaz, or the stone that turns itself. But it is certain, that the Romans, who conquered Judea, were ignorant of this instrument; and it is very improbable, that such an useful invention, if once it had been commonly known to any nation, would have been forgot, or perfectly concealed from such a prudent people as the Romans, who were so much interested in the discovery of it.\n\nAmong those who admit that the mariner's compass is a modern invention, it has been much disputed who was the inventor. Some give the honour of it to Flavio Gioia of Amalfi in Campania*, who lived about the beginning of the 14th century; while others say that it came from the east, and was earlier known in Europe. But, at whatever time it was invented, it is certain, that the mariner's compass was not commonly used in navigation before the year 1420. In that year the science was considerably improved under the auspices of Henry duke of Viseu, brother to the king of Portugal. In the year 1485, Roderick and Joseph, physicians to John II. king of Portugal, together with one Martin de Bohemia, a Portuguese, native of the island of Fayal, and scholar to Regiomontanus, calculated tables of the sun's declination for the use of sailors, and recommended the astrolabe for taking observations at sea. Of the instructions of Martin, the celebrated Christopher Columbus is said to have availed himself, and to have improved the Spaniards in the knowledge of the art; for the farther progress of which a lecture was afterwards founded at Seville by the emperor Charles V.\n\nThe discovery of the variation is claimed by Columbus, and by Sebastian Cabot. The former certainly did observe this variation without having heard of it from any other person, on the 14th of September 1492, and it is very probable that Cabot might do the same. At that time it was found that there was no variation at the Azores, where some geographers have thought proper to place the first meridian; though it hath since been observed that the variation alters in time.\u2014The use of the cross staff now began to be introduced among sailors. This ancient instrument is described by John Werner of Nuremberg, in his...\nhis annotations on the first book of Ptolemy's Geography, printed in 1514. He recommends it for observing the distance between the moon and some star, in order thence to determine the longitude.\n\nAt this time the art of navigation was very imperfect, on account of the inaccuracies of the plane chart, which was the only one then known, and which, by its gross errors, must have greatly misled the mariner, especially in voyages far distant from the equator. Its precepts were probably at first only set down on the sea charts, as is the custom at this day; but at length there were two Spanish treatises published in 1545; one by Pedro de Medina; the other by Martin Cortes, which contained a complete system of the art, as far as it was then known. These seem to have been the oldest writers who fully handled the art; for Medina, in his dedication to Philip prince of Spain, laments that multitudes of ships daily perished at sea, because there were neither teachers of the art, nor books by which it might be learned; and Cortes, in his dedication, boasts to the emperor, that he was the first who had reduced navigation into a compendium, valuing himself much on what he had performed. Medina defended the plane chart; but he was opposed by Cortes, who showed its errors, and endeavoured to account for the variation of the compass, by supposing the needle to be influenced by a magnetic pole (which he called the point attractive), different from that of the world; which notion hath been farther prosecuted by others. Medina's book was soon translated into Italian, French, and Flemish, and served for a long time as a guide to foreign navigators. However, Cortes was the favourite author of the English nation, and was translated in 1561; while Medina's work was entirely neglected, though translated also within a short time of the other. At that time the system of navigation consisted of the following particulars, and others similar: An account of the Ptolemaic hypothesis, and the circles of the sphere; of the roundness of the earth, the longitudes, latitudes, climates, &c. and eclipses of the luminaries; a calendar; the method of finding the prime, equinox, moon's age, and tides; a description of the compass, an account of its variation, for the discovering of which Cortes said an instrument might easily be contrived; tables of the sun's declination for four years, in order to find the latitude from his meridian altitude; directions to find the same by certain stars; of the course of the sun and moon; the length of the days; of time and its divisions; the method of finding the hour of the day and night; and lastly, a description of the sea chart, on which to discover where the ship is, they made use of a small table, that showed, upon an alteration of one degree of the latitude, how many leagues were run in each rhumb, together with the departure from the meridian. Besides, some instruments were described, especially by Cortes; such as one to find the place and declination of the sun, with the days, and place of the moon; certain dials, the astrolabe, and cross staff; with a complex machine to discover the hour and latitude at once.\n\nAbout the same time were made proposals for finding the longitude by observations of the moon.\u2014In 1530, Gemma Frisius advised the keeping of the time by means of small clocks or watches, then, as he says, newly invented. He also contrived a new sort of cross staff, and an instrument called the nautical quadrant; which last was much praised by William Cunningham, in his Astronomical Glass, printed in the year 1539.\n\nIn 1537 Pedro Nunez, or Nonius, published a book in the Portuguese language, to explain a difficulty in navigation proposed to him by the commander Don Martin Alphonso de Sufa. In this he exposes the errors of the plane chart, and likewise gives the solution of several curious astronomical problems; amongst which is that of determining the latitude from two observations of the sun's altitude and intermediate azimuth being given. He observed, that though the rhumbs are spiral lines, yet the direct course of a ship will always be in the arch of a great circle, whereby the angle with the meridians will continually change: all that the steersman can here do for the preserving of the original rhumb, is to correct these deviations as soon as they appear sensible. But thus the ship will in reality describe a course without the rhumb line intended; and therefore his calculations for affixing the latitude, where any rhumb line crosses the several meridians, will be in some measure erroneous. He invented a method of dividing a quadrant by means of concentric circles, which, after being much improved by Dr Halley, is used at present, and is called a nonius.\n\nIn 1577, Mr William Bourne published a treatise, in which, by considering the irregularities in the moon's motion, he shows the errors of the sailors in finding her age by the epact, and also in determining the hour from observing on what point of the compass the sun and moon appeared. He advises, in sailing towards the high latitudes, to keep the reckoning by the globe, as there the plane chart is most erroneous. He despairs of our ever being able to find the longitude, unless the variation of the compass should be occasioned by some such attractive point as Cortes had imagined; of which, however, he doubts: but as he had shown how to find the variation at all times, he advises to keep an account of the observations, as useful for finding the place of the ship; which advice was prosecuted at large by Simon Stevin, in a treatise published at Leyden in 1599; the substance of which was the same year printed at London in English by Mr Edward Wright, entitled the Haven-finding Art. In this ancient tract also is described the way by which our sailors estimate the rate of a ship in her course, by an instrument called the log. This was so named from the piece of wood or log that floats in the water while the time is reckoned during which the line that is fastened to it is veering out. The author of this contrivance is not known; neither was it taken notice of till 1607, in an East India voyage published by Purchas: but from this time it became famous, and was much taken notice of by almost all writers on navigation in every country; and it still continues to be used as at first, though many attempts have been made to improve it, and contrivances proposed to supply its place; many of which have succeeded in quiet water, but proved useless in a stormy sea.\n\nIn 1581 Michael Coignet, a native of Antwerp, published a treatise, in which he inadvertently mentioned Medina. In this he showed, that as the rhumbs are spirals,\nrals, making endless revolutions about the poles, numerous errors must arise from their being represented by straight lines on the sea charts; but though he hoped to find a remedy for these errors, he was of opinion that the proposals of Nonius were scarcely practicable, and therefore in a great measure useless. In treating of the sun's declination, he took notice of the gradual decrease in the obliquity of the ecliptic; he also described the cross staff with three transverse pieces, as it is at present made, and which he owned to have been then in common use among the sailors. He likewise gave some instruments of his own invention; but all of them are now laid aside, excepting perhaps his nocturnal. He constructed a sea table to be used by such as sailed beyond the 60th degree of latitude; and at the end of the book is delivered a method of sailing on a parallel of latitude by means of a ring dial and a 24 hour glass. The same year the discovery of the dipping needle was made by Mr Robert Norman*. In his publication on that art he maintains, in opposition to Cortes, that the variation of the compass was caused by some point on the surface of the earth, and not in the heavens; he also made considerable improvements in the construction of compasses themselves; showing especially the danger of not fixing, on account of the variation, the wire directly under the fleur de luce; as compasses made in different countries have it placed differently. To this performance of Norman's is always prefixed a discourse on the variation of the magnetic needle, by Mr William Burrough, in which he shows how to determine the variation in many different ways. He also points out many errors in the practice of navigation at that time, and speaks in very severe terms concerning those who had published upon it.\n\nAll this time the Spaniards continued to publish treatises on the art. In 1585 an excellent compendium was published by Roderico Zamorano; which contributed greatly towards the improvement of the art, particularly in the sea charts. Globes of an improved kind, and of a much larger size than those formerly used, were now constructed, and many improvements were made in other instruments; however, the plane chart continued still to be followed, though its errors were frequently complained of. Methods of removing these errors had indeed been sought after; and Gerard Mercator seems to have been the first who found the true method of doing this, so as to answer the purposes of seamen. His method was to represent the parallels both of latitude and longitude by parallel straight lines, but gradually to augment the former as they approached the pole. Thus the rhumbs, which otherwise ought to have been curves, were now also extended into straight lines; and thus a straight line drawn between any two places marked upon the chart would make an angle with the meridians, expressing the rhumb leading from the one to the other. But though, in 1569, Mercator published an universal map constructed in this manner, it doth not appear that he was acquainted with the principles on which this proceeded; and it is now generally believed, that the true principles on which the construction of what is called Mercator's chart depends, were first discovered by an Englishman, Mr Edward Wright.\n\nMr Wright supposes, but, according to the general opinion, without sufficient grounds, that this enlargement of the degrees of latitude was known and mentioned by Ptolemy, and that the same thing had also been spoken of by Cortes. The expressions of Ptolemy alluded to, relate indeed to the proportion between the distances of the parallels and meridians; but instead of proposing any gradual enlargement of the parallels of latitude in a general chart, he speaks only of particular maps, and advises not to confine a system of such maps to one and the same scale, but to plan them out by a different measure, as occasion might require: only with this precaution, that the degrees of longitude in each should bear some proportion to those of latitude; and this proportion is to be deduced from that which the magnitude of the respective parallels bears to a great circle of the sphere. He adds, that in particular maps, if this proportion be observed with regard to the middle parallel, the inconvenience will not be great though the meridians should be straight lines parallel to each other. Here he is said only to mean, that the maps should in some measure represent the figures of the countries for which they are drawn. In this sense Mercator, who drew maps for Ptolemy's tables, undertook him; thinking it, however, an improvement not to regulate the meridians by one parallel, but by two; one distant from the northern, the other from the southern extremity of the map by a fourth part of the whole depth; by which means, in his maps, though the meridians are straight lines, yet they are generally drawn inclining to each other towards the poles. With regard to Cortes, he speaks only of the number of degrees of latitude, and not of the extent of them; nay, he gives express directions that they should all be laid down by equal measurement on a scale of leagues adapted to the map.\n\nFor some time after the appearance of Mercator's map, it was not rightly understood, and it was even thought to be entirely useless, if not detrimental.\u2014However, about the year 1592, its utility began to be perceived; and seven years after, Mr Wright printed his famous treatise entitled, The Correction of certain Errors in Navigation, where he fully explained the reason of extending the length of the parallels of latitude, and the uses of it to navigators. In 1610, a second edition of Mr Wright's book was published with improvements. An excellent method was proposed of determining the magnitude of the earth; at the same time it was judiciously proposed to make our common measures in some proportion to a degree on its surface, that they might not depend on the uncertain length of a barley corn. Some of his other improvements were, \"The table of latitudes for dividing the meridian computed to minutes;\" whereas it had been only divided to every tenth minute. He also published a description of an instrument which he calls the sea rings; and by which the variation of the compass, altitude of the sun, and time of the day, may be determined readily at once in any place, provided the latitude is known. He showed also how to correct the errors arising from the eccentricity of the eye in observing by the cross-staff. He made a total amendment in the tables of the declinations and places of the sun and stars from his own observations made with a six foot quadrant in the years 1594, 95, 96, and 97. A sea quadrant to take altitudes by a forward or backward observation; and likewise with a contrivance for the ready finding the latitude.\nlatitude by the height of the pole star, when not upon the meridian. To this edition was subjoined a translation of Zamorano's Compendium above mentioned, in which he corrected some mistakes in the original; adding a large table of the variation of the compass observed in very different parts of the world, to show that it was not occasioned by any magnetical pole.\n\nThese improvements soon became known abroad.\u2014In 1623, a treatise entitled, Hypomnemata Mathematica, was published by Simon Stevin, for the use of Prince Maurice. In that part relating to navigation, the author having treated of sailing on a great circle, and shown how to draw the rhumbs on a globe mechanically, sets down Wright's two tables of latitudes and of rhumbs, in order to describe these lines more accurately, pretending even to have discovered an error in Wright's table. But all Stevin's objections were fully answered by the author himself, who showed that they arose from the gross way of calculating made use of by the former.\n\nIn 1624, the learned Wellebrodus Snellius, professor of mathematics at Leyden, published a treatise of navigation on Wright's plan, but somewhat obscurely: and as he did not particularly mention all the discoveries of Wright, the latter was thought by some to have taken the hint of all his discoveries from Snellius. But this supposition is long ago refuted: and Wright enjoys the honour of those discoveries which is justly his due.\n\nMr Wright having shown how to find the place of the ship on his chart, observed that the same might be performed more accurately by calculation: but considering, as he says, that the latitudes, and especially the courses at sea, could not be determined so precisely, he forbore setting down particular examples; as the mariner may be allowed to save himself this trouble, and only mark out upon his chart the ship's way, after the manner then usually practised. However, in 1614, Mr Raphe Handfon, among his nautical questions subjoined to a translation of Pitiscus's trigonometry, solved very distinctly every case of navigation, by applying arithmetical calculations to Wright's table of latitudes, or of meridional parts, as it hath since been called. Though the method discovered by Wright for finding the change of longitude by a ship sailing on a rhumb is the proper way of performing it. Handfon also proposes two ways of approximation to it without the assistance of Wright's division of the meridian line. The first was computed by the arithmetical mean between the coines of both latitudes; the other by the same mean between the secants as an alternative, when Wright's book was not at hand; though this latter is wider from the truth than the first. By the same calculations also he showed how much each of these compendiums deviates from the truth; and also how widely the computations on the erroneous principles of the plane chart differ from them all. The method, however, commonly used by our sailors is commonly called the middle latitude; which, though it errs more than that by the arithmetical mean between the two coines, is preferred on account of its being less operable: yet in high latitudes it is more eligible to use that of the arithmetical mean between the logarithmic coines, equivalent to the geometrical mean between the coines themselves; a method since proposed by Mr John Baffat. The computation by the middle latitude will always fall short of the true change of longitude; that by the geometrical mean will always exceed; but that by the arithmetical mean falls short in latitudes above 45 degrees, and exceeds in lesser latitudes. However, none of these methods will differ much from the truth when the change of latitude is sufficiently small.\n\nAbout this time logarithms were invented by John Napier, baron of Merchiston, in Scotland, and proved of the utmost service to the art of navigation. From which Mr Edmund Gunter constructed a table of logarithmic sines and tangents to every minute of the quadrant, which he published in 1620. In this work he applied to navigation, and other branches of mathematics, his admirable ruler known by the name of Gunter's scale; on which are described lines of logarithms, of logarithmic sines and tangents, of meridional parts, &c. He greatly improved the sector for the same purposes. He showed also how to take a back observation by the cross staff, whereby the error arising from the eccentricity of the eye is avoided. He described likewise another instrument, of his own invention, called the cross bow, for taking altitudes of the sun or stars, with some contrivances for the more ready collecting the latitude from the observation. The discoveries concerning logarithms were carried to France in 1624 by Mr Edmund Wingate, who published two small tracts in that year at Paris. In one of these he taught the use of Gunter's scale; and in the other, of the tables of artificial sines and tangents, as modelled according to Napier's last form, erroneously attributed by Wingate to Briggs.\n\nGunter's rule was projected into a circular arch by the Reverend Mr William Oughtred in 1633, and its uses fully shown in a pamphlet entitled, The Circles of Proportion, where, in an appendix, are well treated several important points in navigation. It has also been made in the form of a sliding ruler.\n\nThe logarithmic tables were first applied to the different cases of sailing by Mr Thomas Addison, in his treatise entitled, Arithmetical Navigation, printed in 1625. He also gives two traverse tables, with their uses; the one to quarter points of the compass, the other to degrees. Mr Henry Gellibrand published his discovery of the changes of the variation of the compass, in a small quarto pamphlet, entitled, A discourse mathematical on the variation of the magnetical needle, printed in 1635. This extraordinary phenomenon he found out by comparing the observations made at different times near the same place by Mr Burrough, Mr Gunter, and himself, all persons of great skill and experience in these matters. This discovery was likewise soon known abroad; for Father Athanasius Kircher, in his treatise entitled, Magnes, first printed at Rome in 1641, informs us, that he had been told it by Mr John Greaves; and then gives a letter of the famous Marinus Merennus, containing a very distinct account of the same.\n\nAs altitudes of the sun are taken on shipboard by observing his elevation above the visible horizon; to obtain from thence the sun's true altitude with correctness, Wright observes it to be necessary that the dip of the visible horizon below the horizontal plane passing through the observer's eye should be brought into the account,\naccount, which cannot be calculated without knowing the magnitude of the earth. Hence he was induced to propose different methods for finding this; but complains that the most effectual was out of his power to execute; and therefore contented himself with a rude attempt, in some measure sufficient for his purpose: and the dimensions of the earth deduced by him corresponded very well with the usual divisions of the log line; however, as he wrote not an express treatise on navigation, but only for the correcting such errors as prevailed in general practice, the log line did not fall under his notice. Mr Richard Norwood, however, put in execution the method recommended by Mr Wright as the most perfect for measuring the dimensions of the earth, with the true length of the degrees of a great circle upon it; and, in 1635, he actually measured the distance between London and York; from whence, and the summer solstitial altitudes of the sun observed on the meridian at both places, he found a degree on a great circle of the earth to contain 367,196 English feet, equal to 574,200 French fathoms or toises: which is very exact, as appears from many measures that have been made since that time. Of all this Mr Norwood gave a full account in this treatise called The Seaman's Practice, published in 1637. He there shows the reason why Snellius had failed in his attempt; he points out also various uses of his discovery, particularly for correcting the gross errors hitherto committed in the divisions of the log line. But necessary amendments have been little attended to by sailors, whose obstinacy in adhering to established errors has been complained of by the best writers on navigation. This improvement has at length, however, made its way into practice, and few navigators of reputation now make use of the old measure of 42 feet to a knot. In that treatise also Mr Norwood describes his own excellent method of setting down and perfecting a sea reckoning, by using a traverse table; which method he had followed and taught for many years. He shows also how to rectify the course by the variation of the compass being considered; as also how to discover currents, and to make proper allowance on their account. This treatise, and another on trigonometry, were continually reprinted, as the principal books for learning scientifically the art of navigation. What he had delivered, especially in the latter of them, concerning this subject, was contracted as a manual for sailors, in a very small piece called his Epitome; which useful performance has gone through a great number of editions. No alterations were ever made in the Seaman's Practice till the 12th edition in 1676, when the following paragraph was inserted in a smaller character: \"About the year 1672, Monsieur Picart has published an account in French, concerning the measure of the earth, a brevity whereof may be seen in the Philosophical Transactions, No 112, wherein he concludes one degree to contain 365,184 English feet, nearly agreeing with Mr Norwood's experiment;\" and this advertisement is continued through the subsequent editions as late as the year 1732.\n\nAbout the year 1645, Mr Bond published in Norwood's Epitome a very great improvement in Wright's method, by a property in his meridian line, whereby its divisions are more scientifically assigned than the author himself was able to effect; which was from this theorem, that these divisions are analogous to the excesses of the logarithmic tangents of half the respective latitudes augmented by 45 degrees above the logarithm of the radius. This he afterwards explained more fully in the third edition of Gunter's works, printed in 1653; where, after observing that the logarithmic tangents from 45\u00b0 upwards increase in the same manner that the secants added together do, if every half degree be accounted as a whole degree of Mercator's meridional line. His rule for computing the meridional parts belonging to any two latitudes, supposed on the same side of the equator, is to the following effect: \"Take the logarithmic tangent, rejecting the radius, of half each latitude, augmented by 45 degrees; divide the difference of those numbers by the logarithmic tangent of 45\u00b0 30', the radius being likewise rejected; and the quotient will be the meridional parts required, expressed in degrees.\" This rule is the immediate consequence from the general theorem, That the degrees of latitude bear to one degree (or 60 minutes, which in Wright's table stands for the meridional parts of one degree), the same proportion as the logarithmic tangent of half any latitude augmented by 45 degrees, and the radius neglected, to the like tangent of half a degree augmented by 45 degrees, with the radius likewise rejected. But here was farther wanting the demonstration of this general theorem, which was at length supplied by Mr James Gregory of Aberdeen in his Exercitationes Geometricae, printed at London in 1668; and afterwards more concisely demonstrated, together with a scientific determination of the divisor, by Dr Halley in the Philosophical Transactions for 1693, No 219, from the consideration of the spirals into which the rhumbs are transformed in the stereographic projection of the sphere upon the plane of the equinoctial; and which is rendered still more simple by Mr Roger Cotes, in his Logometria, first published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1714, No 388. It is moreover added in Gunter's book, that if \\( \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\) th of this division, which does not sensibly differ from the logarithmic tangent of 45\u00b0 1' 30\" (with the radius subtracted from it), be used, the quotient will exhibit the meridional parts expressed in leagues, and this is the divisor set down in Norwood's Epitome. After the same manner the meridional parts will be found in minutes, if the like logarithmic tangent of 45\u00b0 1' 30\", diminished by the radius, be taken; that is, the number used by others being 12633, when the logarithmic tables consist of eight places of figures besides the index.\n\nIn an edition of the Seaman's Kalender, Mr Bond declared, that he had discovered the longitude by having found out the true theory of the magnetic variation; and to gain credit to his assertion, he foretold, that at London in 1657 there would be no variation of the compass, and from that time it would gradually increase the other way; which happened accordingly. Again, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1668, No 40, he published a table of the variation for 49 years to come. Thus he acquired such reputation, that his treatise, entitled, The Longitude Found, was in 1676 published by the special command of Charles II. and approved by many celebrated mathematicians. It was not long, however, before it met with opposition; and in 1678 another treatise, entitled, The Longitude not Found, made its appearance; and as Mr Bond's hy-\npothesis did not in any manner answer its author's fan-\nguine expectations, the affair was undertaken by Dr\nHalley. The result of his speculation was, that the\nmagnetic needle is influenced by four poles; but this\nwonderful phenomenon seems hitherto to have eluded\nall our researches. In 1700, however, Dr Halley pub-\nlished a general map, with curve lines expressing the\npaths where the magnetic needle had the same varia-\ntion; which was received with universal applause. But\nas the positions of these curves vary from time to time,\nthey should frequently be corrected by skilful persons;\nas was done in 1644 and 1756, by Mr William Moun-\ntaine, and Mr James Dodson, F. R. S. In the Phi-\nlosophical Transactions for 1692, Dr Halley also gave\na dissertation on the monsoons; containing many very\nuseful observations for such as sail to places subject to\nthese winds.\n\nAfter the true principles of the art were settled by\nWright, Bond, and Norwood, the authors on naviga-\ntion became so numerous, that it would be impossible\nto enumerate them. New improvements were daily\nmade, and every thing relative to it was settled with\nan accuracy nor only unknown to former ages, but\nwhich would have been reckoned utterly impossible.\nThe earth being found to be a spheroid, and not a per-\nfect sphere, with the shortest diameter passing through\nthe poles, a tract was published in 1741 by the Rev.\nDoctor Patrick Murdoch, wherein he accommodated\nWright's sailing to such a figure; and Mr Colin Mac-\nlaurin, the same year, in the Philosophical Transac-\ntions, No. 461, gave a rule for determining the meri-\ndional parts of a spheroid; which speculation is farther\ntreated of in his book of Fluxions, printed at Edin-\nburgh in 1742.\n\nAmong the latter discoveries in navigation, that of\nfinding the longitude both by lunar observations and\nby time-keepers is the principal. It is owing chiefly\nto the rewards offered by the British parliament that this\nhas attained the present degree of perfection. We are\nindebted to Dr Makelyne for putting the first of these\nmethods in practice, and for other important improve-\nments in navigation. The time-keepers, constructed\nby Harrison for this express purpose, were found to\nanswer so well, that he obtained the parliamentary re-\nward.\n\nThe only works that have appeared of late on navi-\ngation are those on the longitude and navigation by Dr\nMackay, of which the following account is transcribed\nfrom the Anti-Jacobin Review for September 1804.\n\n\"This publication, (Dr Mackay's Treatise on Na-\nvigation) and that on the longitude by the same author,\nform the most correct and practical system of navigation\nand nautical science hitherto published in this country;\nthey may be considered not only of individual utility,\nbut of national importance.\"","sp":266,"ep":272},{"h":"MORASS","t":"a marsh, fen, or low moor ground, which receives the waters from above without having any descent to carry them off again.

It is seated on the lake Morat, on the road from Avenche to Bern, 10 miles west of Bern and 10 miles north-east of Friburg. The lake is about six miles long and two broad, and the country about it pleasant and well cultivated. The lakes of Morat and Neufchatel are parallel to each other, but the latter is more elevated, discharging itself by means of the river Broye into the lake of Neufchatel. According to M. de Luc, the former is 15 French feet above the level of Neufchatel lake; and both these lakes, as well as that of Bi\u00e9nnne, seem formerly to have extended considerably beyond their present limits, and from the position of the country appear to have been once united. Formerly the large fish named *filurus glanis*, or the saluth, frequented these lakes, but has not been caught in them for a long time past. The environs of this town and lake were carefully examined by Mr Cox, during his residence in Switzerland, who made several excursions across the lake to a ridge of hills situated betwixt it and Neufchatel. Here are many delightful prospects; particularly one from the top of Mount Vuilly, which, he says, is perhaps the only central spot from which the eye can at once comprehend the vast amphitheatre formed on one side by the Jura stretching from the environs of Geneva as far as Baffe, and, on the other, by that stupendous chain of snowy Alps which extend from the frontiers of Italy to the confines of Germany, and is lost at each extremity in the horizon. Morat is celebrated for the obstinate defence it made against Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, and for the battle which afterwards followed on the 22d of June 1476, where the duke was defeated, and his army almost entirely destroyed*. Not far from the town, and adjoining to the high road, there still remains a monument of this victory. It is a square building, filled with the bones of Burgundian soldiers who were slain at the siege and in the battle; the number of which appears to have been very considerable. There are several inscriptions in the Latin and German languages commemorating the victory.\n\n*MORATA, OLYMPIA FULVIA, an Italian lady, distinguished for her learning, was born at Ferrara, in 1436. Her father, after teaching the belles lettres in several cities of Italy, was made preceptor to the two young princes of Ferrara, the sons of Alphonso I. The uncommon abilities he discovered in his daughter determined him to give her all the advantages of education. Meanwhile the princes of Ferrara studying polite literature, it was judged expedient that she should have a companion in the same pursuit; and Morata being called, she was heard by the astonished courtiers to declaim in Latin, to speak Greek, and to explain the paradoxes of Cicero. Her father dying, she was obliged to return home to take upon her the management of family affairs, and the education of her brother and three sisters, both which she executed with the greatest diligence and success. In the mean time Andrew Grunthler, a young German physician, who had married her, and with him she went to Germany, taking her brother along with her, whom she instructed in the Latin and Greek tongues; and after staying a short time at Augsburg, went to Schweinfurt in Franconia, where her husband was born: but they had not been there long before that town was unhappily besieged and burnt; however, escaping the flames, they fled in the utmost distress to Hammelburg. This place they were also obliged to quit, and were reduced to the last extremities, when the elector Palatine invited Grunthler to be professor of physic at Heidelberg. He entered on his new office in 1554; but they no sooner began to taste the sweets of repose, than a disease, occasioned by the distresses and hardships they had suffered, seized upon Morata, who died in 1555, in the 29th year of her age; and her husband and brother did not long survive her. She composed several works, great part of which were burnt with the town of Schweinfurt; the remainder, which consist of orations, dialogues, letters, and translations, were collected and published under the title of *Olympiae Fulviae Moratae, formae doctissimae, et plan\u00e8 divinae, opera omnia que hactenus invenerit potuerint; quibus Caelli secundi curioris epiloce ac orationes acceperunt*.","sp":6,"ep":7},{"h":"MORAVIA","t":"a river of Turkey in Europe, which rises in Bulgaria, runs north through Servia by Nilla, and falls into the Danube at Semendria, to the eastward of Belgrade.\n\nMoravia, a marquisate of Germany, derives the name of *Mahern*, as it is called by the Germans, and of *Morava*, as it is called by the natives, from the river of that name, which rises in the mountains of the county of Glatz, and passes through the middle of it. It is bounded to the south by Austria, to the north by Glatz and Silelia, to the west by Bohemia, and to the east by Silelia and Hungary; being about 120 miles in length and 120 in breadth.\n\nA great part of this country is overrun with woods and mountains, where the air is very cold, but much wholesome than in the low grounds, which are full of bogs and lakes. The mountains, in general, are barren; but the more campaign parts tolerably fertile, yielding corn, with plenty of hemp and flax, good saffron, and pasture. Nor is it altogether destitute of wine, red and white, fruits, and garden stuff. Moravia also abounds in horses, black cattle, sheep, and goats. In the woods and about the lakes there is plenty of wild fowl, game, venison, bees, honey, hares, foxes, wolves, beavers, &c. This country affords marble, alum, iron, sulphur, saltpetre, and vitriol, with mineral waters, and warm springs; but salt is imported. Its rivers, of which the March, Morawa, or Morau, are the chief, abound with trout, crayfish, barbels, eels, perch, and many other sorts of fish.\n\nThe language of the inhabitants is a dialect of the Sclavonic, differing little from the Bohemian; but the nobility and citizens speak German and French.\n\nMoravia was anciently inhabited by the Quadi, who were driven out by the Sclavi. Its kings, who were once powerful and independent, afterwards became dependent on, and tributary to, the German emperors and kings. At last, in the year 908, the Moravian kingdom was parcelled out among the Germans, Poles, and Hungarians. In 1086, that part of it properly called Moravia was declared a marquisate by the German king Henry IV. and united with Bohemia, to whose dukes and kings it hath ever since been subject. Though it is not very populous, it contains about 42 greater or walled towns, 17 smaller or open towns, and 198 market towns, besides villages, &c. The states\nMORAVIA states of the country consist of the clergy, lords, knights, and burgesses; and the diets, when summoned by the regency, are held at Brunn. The marquisate is still governed by its own peculiar constitutions, under the direcTorum in publicis et cameralibus, and the supreme judicatory at Vienna. It is divided into six circles, each of which has its captain, and contributes to its sovereign about one third of what is exacted of Bohemia. Towards the expenses of the military establishment of the whole Austrian hereditary countries, its yearly quota is 1,856,492 florins. Seven regiments of foot, one of cuirassiers, and one of dragoons, are usually quartered in it.\n\nChristianity was introduced into this country in the 9th century; and the inhabitants continued attached to the church of Rome till the 15th, when they espoused the doctrine of John Huss, and threw off Popery: but after the defeat of the elector Palatine, whom they had chosen king, as well as the Bohemians, the emperor Ferdinand II. re-established Popery; though there are still some Protestants in Moravia. The bishop of Olmutz, who stands immediately under the pope, is at the head of the ecclesiastics in this country. The supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction, under the bishop, is vested in a confistory.\n\nThe commerce of this country is inconsiderable. Of what they have, Brunn enjoys the principal part. At Iglau and Trebix are manufactures of cloth, paper, gunpowder, &c. There are also some iron works and glasshouses in the country.\n\nThe inhabitants of Moravia in general are open-hearted, not easy to be provoked or pacified, obedient to their masters, and true to their promises; but credulous of old prophecies, and much addicted to drinking, though neither such fots or bigots as they are represented by some geographers. The boors, indeed, upon the river Hank, are said to be a thievish, unpolished, brutal race. The sciences now begin to lift up their heads a little among the Moravians, the university of Olmutz having been put on a better footing; and a rising academy, with a learned society, have been lately established there.\n\nMORAVIAN BRETHREN.

In 1675 he succeeded his father in his honours and estate. While young he served under the admirals Torrington and Narborough in the Mediterranean against the Algerines; and in 1680 embarked for Africa with the earl of Plymouth, and distinguished himself at Tangier when it was besieged by the Moors. In the reign of James II. he voted against the repeal of the test act; and disliking the measures of the court, obtained leave to go to Holland to accept the command of a Dutch squadron in the West Indies. He afterwards accompanied the prince of Orange into this kingdom; and upon his advancement to the throne, was sworn of the privy-council, made one of the lords of the bedchamber to his majesty, also first commissioner of the treasury, and advanced to the dignity of earl of Monmouth. But in November 1692 he was dismissed from his post in the treasury. On the death of his uncle Henry earl of Peterborough in 1697, he succeeded to that title; and, upon the accession of Queen Anne, was invested with the commission of captain-general and governor of Jamaica. In 1725 he was sworn of the privy-council; and the same year declared general and commander in chief of the forces sent to Spain, and joint admiral of the fleet with Sir Cloudley Shovel, of which the year following he had the sole command. His taking Barcelona with a handful of men, and afterwards relieving it when greatly distressed by the enemy; his driving out of Spain the duke of Anjou, and the French army, which consisted of 25,000 men, though his own troops never amounted to 10,000; his gaining possession of Catalonia, the kingdoms of Valencia, Arragon, and the isle of Majorca, with part of Murcia and Castile, and thereby giving the earl of Galway an opportunity of advancing to Madrid without a blow; are astonishing instances of his bravery and conduct. For these important services his lordship was declared general in Spain by Charles III. afterwards emperor of Germany; and on his return to England he received the thanks of the house of lords. His lordship was afterwards employed in several embassies to foreign courts, installed knight of the garter, and made governor of Minorca. In the reign of George I. he was general of all the marine forces in Great Britain, in which post he was continued by King George II. He died in his passage to Lisbon, where he was going for the recovery of his health, in 1735. His lordship was distinguished by various shining qualities: for, to the greatest personal courage and resolution, he added all the arts and address of a general; a lively and penetrating genius; and a great extent of knowledge upon almost every subject of importance within the compass of ancient and modern literature; hence his familiar letters, inserted among those of his friend Mr Pope, are an ornament to that excellent collection.","sp":8,"ep":8},{"h":"MORE","t":"SIR THOMAS, lord-high chancellor of England, the son of Sir John More, knight, one of the judges of the King's Bench, was born in the year 1480, in\nMore in Milk-street London. He was first sent to a school at St. Anthony's in Threadneedle Street; and afterward introduced into the family of Cardinal Moreton, who in 1497 sent him to Canterbury college in Oxford. During his residence at the university he constantly attended the lectures of Linaere and Grocinus, on the Greek and Latin languages. Having in the space of about two years made considerable proficiency in academical learning, he came to New Inn in London, in order to study the law; whence, after some time, he removed to Lincoln's Inn, of which his father was a member. Notwithstanding his application to the law, however, being now about 20 years old, he was so bigotted to monkish discipline, that he wore a hair shirt next his skin, frequently fasted, and often slept on a bare plank. In the year 1503, being then a burgess in parliament, he distinguished himself in the house, in opposition to the motion for granting a subsidy and three fifteenths for the marriage of Henry VII.'s eldest daughter, Margaret, to the king of Scotland. The motion was rejected; and the king was so highly offended at this opposition from a beardless boy, that he revenged himself on Mr. More's father, by sending him, on a frivolous pretence, to the Tower, and obliging him to pay 100l. for his liberty. Being now called to the bar, he was appointed law reader at Furnival's inn, which place he held about three years; but about this time he also read a public lecture in the church of St. Lawrence, Old Jewry, upon St. Austin's treatise De civitate Dei, with great applause. He had indeed formed a design of becoming a Franciscan friar, but was dissuaded from it; and, by the advice of Dr. Colet, married Jane, the eldest daughter of John Colt, Esq., of Newhall in Essex. In 1508 he was appointed judge of the sheriff's court in the city of London, was made a justice of the peace, and became very eminent at the bar. In 1516 he went to Flanders in the retinue of Bishop Tonital, and Dr. Knight, who were sent by King Henry VIII. to renew the alliance with the archduke of Austria, afterwards Charles V. On his return, Cardinal Wolsey would have engaged Mr. More in the service of the crown, and offered him a pension, which he refused. Nevertheless, it was not long before he accepted the place of master of the requests, was created a knight, admitted of the privy council, and in 1520 made treasurer of the exchequer. About this time he built a house on the bank of the Thames, at Chelsea, and married a second wife. This wife, whose name was Middleton, and a widow, was old, ill tempered, and covetous; nevertheless Erasmus says, he was as fond of her as if she were a young maid.\n\nIn the 14th year of Henry VIII. Sir Thomas More was made speaker of the house of commons; in which capacity he had the resolution to oppose the then powerful minister, Wolsey, in his demand of an oppressive subsidy; notwithstanding which, it was not long before he was made chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and was treated by the king with singular familiarity. The king having once dined with Sir Thomas at Chelsea, walked with him near an hour in the garden, with his arm round his neck. After he was gone, Mr. Roper, Sir Thomas's son-in-law, observed how happy he was to be so familiarly treated by the king: to which Sir Thomas replied, \"I thank our lord, son Roper, I find his grace my very good lord indeed, and believe he doth as singularly favour me as any subject within this realm: howbeit, I must tell thee, I have no cause to be proud thereof; for if my head would win him a castle in France, it would not fail to go off.\" From this anecdote it appears, that Sir Thomas knew his grace to be a villain.\n\nIn 1526 he was sent with Cardinal Wolsey and others, on a joint embassy to France, and in 1529 with Bishop Tonital to Cambrai. The king, it seems, was so well satisfied with his services on these occasions, that in the following year, Wolsey being disgraced, he made him chancellor; which seems the more extraordinary, when we are told that Sir Thomas had repeatedly declared his disapprobation of the king's divorce, on which the great defensor fidei was so positively bent. Having executed the office of chancellor about three years, with equal wisdom and integrity, he resigned the seals in 1533, probably to avoid the danger of his refusing to confirm the king's divorce. He now retired to his house at Chelsea; dismissed many of his servants; sent his children with their respective families to their own houses (for hitherto, he had, it seems, maintained all his children, with their families, in his own house, in the true style of an ancient patriarch; and spent his time in study and devotion: but the capricious tyrant would not suffer him to enjoy his tranquillity. Though now reduced to a private station, and even to indigence, his opinion of the legality of the king's marriage with Anne Boleyn was deemed of so much importance, that various means were tried to procure his approbation; but all persuasion proving ineffectual, he was, with some others, attainted in the house of lords of high treason, for encouraging Elizabeth Barton, the nun of Kent, in her treasonable practices. His innocence in this affair appeared so clearly, that they were obliged to strike his name out of the bill. He was then accused of other crimes, but with the same effect; till, refusing to take the oath enjoined by the act of supremacy, he was committed to the Tower, and, after 15 months imprisonment, was tried at the bar of the King's Bench for high treason, in denying the king's supremacy. The proof rested on the sole evidence of Rich the solicitor general, whom Sir Thomas, in his defence, sufficiently discredited; nevertheless the jury brought him in guilty, and he was condemned to suffer as a traitor. The merciful Harry, however, indulged him with simple decapitation; and he was accordingly beheaded on Tower hill, on the 6th of July 1535. His body, which was first interred in the Tower, was begged by his daughter Margaret, and deposited in the chancel of the church at Chelsea, where a monument, with an inscription written by himself, had been some time before erected. This monument with the inscription is still to be seen in that church. The same daughter, Margaret, also procured his head after it had remained 14 days upon London bridge, and placed it in a vault belonging to the Roper family, under a chapel adjoining to St. Dunstan's church in Canterbury. Sir Thomas More was a man of some learning, and an upright judge; a very pious in religion, yet cheerful, and even affectedly witty.\nwitty (A). He wanted not sagacity, where religion was out of the question; but in that his faculties were so enveloped, as to render him a weak and credulous enthusiast. He left one son and three daughters; of whom Margaret, the eldest, was very remarkable for her knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages. She married a Mr Roper of Wellhall in Kent, whose life of Sir Thomas More was published by Mr Hearne at Oxford in 1716. Mrs Roper died in 1544; and was buried in the vault of St Dunstan's in Canterbury, with her father's head in her arms.\n\nSir Thomas was the author of various works, though his Utopia is the only performance that has survived in the esteem of the world; owing to the reft being chiefly of a polemic nature: his answer to Luther has only gained him the credit of having the best knack of any man in Europe, at calling bad names in good Latin.

Before it was finished, he was informed that she was actually dead: I am sorry for it (replied he coldly), she was an excellent woman. This printer acquired great reputation from the works which he published, which were very numerous and beautifully executed. From the manuscripts in the king's library, he published several treatises of St Basil, Theodore, St Cyril; and he accompanied them with a translation. His edition of the works of C\u00e6cumenius and Aretas, in 2 vols., folio, is much esteemed.

See FATA.\n\nMorgagni, John Baptist, doctor of medicine, first professor of anatomy in the university of Padua, and member of several of the most eminent societies of learned men in Europe, was born in the year 1682, at Forli, a town in the district of La Romagna in Italy.\nMorgagni. His parents, who were in easy circumstances, allowed him to follow that course in life his genius dictated. He began his studies at the place of his nativity; but soon after removed to Bologna, where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine, when he had but just reached the 16th year of his age. Here his peculiar taste for anatomy found an able preceptor in Vallalva, who bestowed on him the utmost attention; and such was the progress he made under this excellent master, that at the age of 20 he himself taught anatomy with high reputation. Soon, however, the fame of his lectures, and the number of his pupils, excited the jealousy of the public professors, and gave rise to injurious persecutions. But his abilities and prudence gained him a complete triumph over his enemies; and all opposition to him was finally terminated from his being appointed by the senate of Bologna to fill a medical chair, which soon became vacant. But the duties of this office, although important, neither occupied the whole of his time, nor satisfied his anxious desire to afford instruction. He still continued to labour in secret on his favourite subject, and soon after communicated the fruits of these labours to the public in his *Adversaria Anatomica*, the first of which was published in the year 1706, the second and third in 1717, and the three others in 1719. The publication of this excellent work spread the fame of Morgagni far beyond the limits of the state of Bologna. Such was his reputation, that the wise republic of Venice had no hesitation in making him an offer of the second chair of the theory of medicine in the university of Padua, then vacant by the death of M. Molinetti; and, to ensure his acceptance, they doubled the emoluments of that appointment. While he was in this department, he published his treatise, entitled *Nova Institutionum medicarum idea*, which first appeared at Padua in the year 1712. From this work his former reputation suffered no diminution. And soon after he rose, by different steps, to be first professor of anatomy in that celebrated university. Although Morgagni was thus finally settled at Padua, yet he gave evident proofs of his gratitude and attachment to Bologna, which he considered as his native country with respect to the sciences. He exerted his utmost efforts in establishing the academy of Bologna, of which he was one of the first associates; and he enriched their publications with several valuable and curious papers. Soon after this, the Royal Societies of London and Paris received him among their number. Not long after the publication of his *Adversaria Anatomica*, he began, much upon the same plan, his *Epistle Anatomicae*, the first of which is dated at Padua in the beginning of April 1726. The works of Morgagni which have already been mentioned, are to be considered, in a great measure, as strictly anatomical: but he was not more eminent as an anatomist, than as a learned and successful physician. In the year 1765, when he was not far distant from the 80th year of his age, he published his large and valuable work *De causis et fedibus morborum per anatomen indagatis*. This last and most important of all his productions will afford convincing evidence of his industry and abilities to latest posterity. Besides these works, he published, at different periods of his life, several miscellaneous pieces, which were afterwards collected into one volume, and printed under his own eye at Padua, in the year 1765. It does not appear that he had in view any future publications; but he intended to have favoured the world with a complete edition of all his works, which would probably have been augmented with many new observations. In this he was engaged when, on the fifth of December 1771, after he had nearly arrived at the 90th year of his age, death put a period to his long and glorious career in the learned world.","sp":10,"ep":11},{"h":"MORGES","t":"a town of Switzerland in the canton of Berne, a place of some trade, and situated on the lake of Geneva, five miles from Lausanne.

The inhabitants are called Morlacki or Morlacchi; they inhabit the pleasant valleys of Koter, along the rivers Kerka, Cettina, Narenta, and among the inland mountains of Dalmatia. The inhabitants are by some said to be of Walachian extraction, as is indicated by their name; Morlachia being a contraction of Meuro Walachia, that is, Black Walachia; and the Walachians are said to be descendants of the ancient Roman colonies planted in these countries. This, however, is denied by the Abb\u00e9 Fortis, who published a volume of travels into that country. He informs us, that the origin of the Morlacchi is involved in the darkness of barbarous ages, together with that of many other nations, resembling them so much in customs and language, that they may be taken for one people, dispersed in the vast tracts from the Adriatic sea to the Frozen ocean.\n\nWith regard to the etymology of the name, the Abb\u00e9 observes, that the Morlacchi generally call themselves, in their own language, Vlafii; a national term, of which no vestige is found in the records of Dalmatia till the 13th century. It signifies powerful men, or men of authority; and the denomination of Moro Vlafii, corruptly Morlacchi, as they are now called, may perhaps point out the original of the nation. This word may possibly signify the conquerors that came from the sea; moor, in all the dialects of the Slavonian language, signifying the sea.\n\nWith regard to the character of these people, we are informed that they are much injured by their maritime neighbours. The inhabitants of the sea coast of Dalmatia tell many frightful stories of their avarice and cruelty: but these, in our author's opinion, are all either of an ancient date, or if any have happened in latter times, they ought rather to be ascribed to the corruption of a few individuals, than to the bad disposition of the nation in general; and though thievish tricks are frequent among them, he informs us, that a stranger may travel securely through their country, where he is faithfully escorted, and hospitably treated.\n\nAs to the Morlacchi themselves, they are represented as open and sincere to such a degree, that they would be taken for simpletons in any other country; and by means of this quality they have been so often duped by the Italians, that the faith of an Italian and the faith of a dog, are synonymous among the Morlacchi. They are very hospitable to strangers; and their hospitality is equally conspicuous among the rich and poor.\n\nThe rich prepares a roasted lamb or sheep, and the poor with equal cordiality offers whatever he has; nor is this generosity confined to strangers, but generally extends itself to all who are in want. When a Morlack is on a journey, and comes to lodge at a friend's house, the eldest daughter of the family, or the new married bride, if there happen to be one, receives and kisses him when he alights from his horse or at the door of the house; but a foreigner is rarely favoured with these female civilities; on the contrary, the women, if they are young, hide themselves, and keep out of his way.\n\nThe Morlacchi in general have little notion of domestic economy, and readily consume in a week as much as would be sufficient for several months, whenever any occasion of merriment presents itself. A marriage, the holiday of the saint protector of the family, the arrival of relations or friends, or any other joyful incident, consumes of course all that there is to eat and to drink in the house. Yet the Morlack is a great economilist in the use of his wearing apparel; for rather than spoil his new cap, he takes it off, let it rain ever so hard, and goes bareheaded in the storm. In the same manner he treats his shoes, if the road is dirty and they are not very old. Nothing but an absolute impossibility hinders a Morlack from being punctual; and if he cannot repay the money he borrowed at the appointed time, he carries a small present to his creditor, and requests a longer term.\n\nFriendship is lasting among the Morlacchi. They have even made it a kind of religious point, and tie the sacred bond at the foot of the altar. The Slavonian ritual contains a particular benediction for the solemn union of two male or two female friends in the presence of the congregation. The male friends thus united are called Pobratimi, and the female Poljefreme, which mean half-brothers and half-sisters. From these consecrated friendships among the Morlacchi and other nations of the same origin, it should seem that the favored brothers arose; a denomination frequent enough among the common people of Italy and in many parts of Europe. The difference between these and the Pobratimi of Morlachia consists not only in the want of the ritual ceremony, but in the design of the union itself. For, among the Morlacchi, the sole view is reciprocal service and advantage; but such a brotherhood among the Italians is generally commenced by bad men, to enable them the more to hurt and disturb society.\n\nBut as the friendships of the Morlacchi are strong and sacred, so their quarrels are commonly unextinguishable. They pass from father to son; and the mothers fail not to put their children in mind of their duty to revenge their father if he has had the misfortune to be killed, and to show them often the bloody shirt and arms of the dead. And so deeply is revenge rooted in the minds of this nation, that all the missionaries in the world would not be able to eradicate it. A Morlack is naturally inclined to do good to his fellow creatures, and is full of gratitude for the smallest benefit; but implacable if injured or insulted.\n\nA Morlack who has killed another of a powerful family, is commonly obliged to leave himself by flight, and\nMORLACCHI and to keep out of the way for several years. If during that time he has been fortunate enough to escape the search of his pursuers, and has got a small sum of money, he endeavours to obtain pardon and peace; and, that he may treat about the conditions in person, he asks and obtains a safe conduct, which is faithfully maintained, though only verbally granted. Then he finds mediators; and, on the appointed day, the relations of the two hostile families are assembled, and the criminal is introduced, dragging himself along on his hands and feet, the muklet, pittole, or cutlass, with which he committed the murder, hung about his neck; and while he continues in that humble posture, one or more of the relations recites a panegyric on the dead, which sometimes rekindles the flames of revenge, and puts the poor prostrate in no small danger.\n\nThe Morlacks, whether they happen to be of the Roman or of the Greek church, have very singular ideas about religion; and the ignorance of their teachers daily augments this monstrous evil. They are as firmly persuaded of the reality of witches, fairies, enchantments, nocturnal apparitions, and fortresses, as if they had seen a thousand examples of them. Nor do they make the least doubt about the existence of vampires; and attribute to them, as in Transylvania, the sucking the blood of infants. Therefore, when a man dies suspected of becoming a vampire, or vu-kodolak, as they call it, they cut his hams, and prick his whole body with pins; pretending, that after this operation he cannot walk about. There are even instances of Morlacchi, who, imagining that they may possibly thirst for children's blood after death, entreat their heirs, and sometimes oblige them to promise, to treat them as vampires when they die.\n\nA most perfect discord reigns in Morlachia, as it generally does in other parts, between the Latin and Greek communion, which their respective priests fail not to foment, and tell a thousand little scandalous stories of each other. The churches of the Latins are poor, but not very dirty; those of the Greeks are equally poor, and shamefully ill kept. Our author has seen the curate of a Morlack village sitting on the ground in the churchyard, to hear the confession of women on their knees by his side: a strange posture indeed! but a proof of the innocent manners of those good people, who have the most profound veneration for their spiritual pastors, and a total dependence upon them; who, on their part, frequently make use of a discipline rather military, and correct the bodies of their offending flock with the cudgel.\n\nInnocence, and the natural liberty of pastoral ages, are still preserved among the Morlacchi, or at least many traces of them remain in the places farthest distant from our settlements. Pure cordiality of sentiment is not there restrained by other regards, and displays itself without any distinction of circumstances. A young handsome Morlack girl, who meets a man of her district on the road, kisses him affectionately, without the least imputation of impropriety; and M. Fortis has seen all the women and girls, all the young men and old, kissing one another as they came into the churchyard on a holiday; so that they looked as if they all belonged to one family. He often observed the same thing on the road, and at the fairs in the maritime towns, where the Morlacchi came to sell their Morlacchi commodities.\n\nThe dress of the unmarried women is the most complex and whimsical, in respect to the ornaments of the head; for when married they are not allowed to wear anything else but a handkerchief, either white or coloured, tied about it. The girls use a scarlet cap, to which they commonly hang a veil falling down on the shoulders, as a mark of their virginity. The better sort adorn their caps with strings of silver coins, among which are frequently seen very ancient and valuable ones; they have moreover ear rings of very curious work, and small silver chains with the figures of half moons fastened to the ends of them. But the poor are forced to content themselves with plain caps; or if they have any ornaments, they consist only of small exotic shells, round glass beads, or bits of tin. The principal merit of these caps, which constitute the good taste as well as vanity of the Morlack young ladies, is to attract and fix the eyes of all who are near them by the multitude of ornaments, and the noise they make on the least motion of their heads.\n\nBoth old and young women wear about their necks large strings of round glass beads, of various size and colour; and many rings of brass, tin, or silver, on their fingers. Their bracelets are of leather covered with wrought tin or silver; and they embroider their stomachers, or adorn them with beads or shells. But the use of flays is unknown, nor do they put whalebone or iron in the stomacher. A broad woollen girdle surrounds their petticoat, which is commonly decked with shells, and of blue colour, and therefore called modrina. Their gown as well as petticoat, is of a kind of serge; and both reach near to the ankle: the gown is bordered with scarlet, and called sadak. They use no modrina in summer, and only wear the sadak without sleeves over a linen petticoat or shift. The girls always wear red stockings; and their shoes are like those of the men, called opante. The sole is of untressed ox hide, and the upper part of sheep's skin thongs knotted, which they call opante; and these they fasten above the ankles, something like the ancient cothurnus. The unmarried women, even of the richest families, are not permitted to wear any other sort of shoes; though after marriage, they may, if they will, lay aside the opante, and use the Turkish slippers. The girls keep their hair tressed under their caps, but when married they let it fall dishevelled on the breast; sometimes they tie it under the chin; and always have medals, beads, or bored coins, in the Tartar or American mode, twisted amongst it.\n\nNothing is more common among the Morlacchi than marriages concluded between the old people of the respective families, especially when the parties live at a great distance, and neither see nor know each other; and the ordinary motive of these alliances is the ambition of being related to a numerous and powerful family, famous for having produced valiant men. A denial in such cases is very rare; nor does the father of the maid inquire much into the circumstances of the family that asks her. Sometimes a daughter of the master is given in marriage to the servant or tenant, as was usual in patriarchal times; so little are the women regarded in this country. But on these occasions, the Morlacchi girls enjoy the privilege of refusal. For he\nMORLACCHI who acts by proxy, having obtained his suit, is obliged to go and bring the bridegroom; and, if on seeing each other, the young people are reciprocally content, the marriage is concluded, but not otherwise. In some parts it is the custom for the bride to go to see the house and family of the proposed husband, before she gives a definitive answer; and if the place or persons are disagreeable to her, she is at liberty to annul the contract.\n\nThe bride is conducted to a church, veiled, and surrounded by the friends of the bridegroom, or fratii, as they are called, on horseback; and the sacred ceremony is performed amidst the noise of muskets, pistols, barbaric shouts and acclamations, which continue till the return to her father's house or to that of her husband, if not far off. The first day's entertainment is sometimes made at the bride's house, but generally at the bridegroom's, whether the fratii hasten immediately after the nuptial benediction; and at the same time three or four men run on foot to tell the good news; the first who gets to the house has a kind of a towel embroidered at the ends, as a premium. The domachin, or head of the house, comes out to meet his daughter-in-law; and a child is handed to her, before she lights, to care for it; and if there happen to be none in the house, the child is borrowed from one of the neighbours. When she lights, she kneels down, and kisses the threshold.\u2014Then the mother in law, or in her place some other female relation, presents a corn sieve, full of different kinds of grain, nuts, almonds, and other small fruit, which the bride scatters upon the fratii, by handfuls, behind her back. The bride does not sit at the great table the first day, but has one apart for herself, the two diverti, and the itacheo. The bridegroom sits at table with the fratii; but in all that day, consecrated to the matrimonial union, he must neither unloosen nor cut any thing whatever. The knum carves his meat, and cuts his bread. It is the domachin's business to give the toast; and the flari-fratii is the first who pledges him. Generally the bukkara, a very large wooden cup, goes round, first to the saint protector of the family; next to the prosperity of the holy faith; and sometimes to a name the most sublime and venerable. The most extravagant abundance reigns at these feasts; and each of the fratii contributes, by feeding a share of provisions. The dinner begins with fruit and cheese; and the soup comes last, just contrary to our custom. All sorts of domestic fowls, kid, lamb, and sometimes venison, are heaped in prodigal quantities upon their tables.\n\nThese nuptial feasts, called sfarave by the ancient Huns, are by the Morlacchi called sfaravizze, from whence the Italian word sfaravizzo is undoubtedly derived. They continue three, six, eight, or more days, according to the ability or prodigal disposition of the family where they are held. The new married wife gets no inconsiderable profit in these days of joy; and it usually amounts to much more than all the portion she brings with her, which often consists of nothing but her own clothes and perhaps a cow; nay, it happens sometimes that the parents, instead of giving money with their daughter, get something from the bridegroom by way of price. The bride carries water every morning, to wash the hands of her guests as long as the feasting lasts; and each of them throws a small piece of money into the bason after performing that function, which is a very rare one among them, excepting on such occasions.\n\nThe Morlacchi pass their youth in the woods, attending their flocks and herds; and in that life of quiet and leisure they often become dextrous in carving with a simple knife: they make wooden cups, and whistles adorned with fanciful bas-reliefs, which are not void of merit, and at least show the genius of the people.","sp":12,"ep":14},{"h":"MORNAY","t":"PHILIPPE DE, seigneur du Plessis Marly, was born at Buhy or Bilhuy in Upper Normandy in France, in 1549, and was educated at Paris. What was then thought a prodigy in a gentleman, he made a rapid progress in the belles lettres, in the learned languages, and in theology. He was at first destined for the church; but the principles of Calvinism, which he had imbibed from his mother, effectually excluded him from the ecclesiastical preferments to which he was entitled by his intellect, abilities, and birth. After the horrible massacre of St Bartholomew, Philippe de Mornay made the tour of Italy, Germany, England, and the Low Countries; and he was equally improved and delighted by his travels. Mornay afterwards joined the King of Navarre, at that time leader of the Protestant party, and so well known since by the name of Henry IV. This prince sent Mornay, who employed his whole abilities, both as a soldier and a writer, in defence of the Protestant cause, to conduct a negotiation with Elizabeth queen of England; and left him wholly to his own discretion in the management of that business. He was successful in almost every negotiation, because he conducted it like an able politician, and not with a spirit of intrigue. He tenderly loved Henry IV. and spoke to him on all occasions as to a friend. When he was wounded at Amiens, he wrote to him in these words: \"Sire, You have long enough acted the part of Alexander, it is now time you should act that of Caesar. It is our duty to die for your majesty, &c. It is glorious for you, Sire, and I dare venture to tell you it is your duty, to live for us.\" This faithful subject did every thing in his power to raise Henry to the throne. But when he deserted the Protestant faith, he reproached him in the bitterest manner, and retired from court. Henry still loved him; and was extremely affronted with an insult which he received in 1597 from one Saint Phal, who beat him with a cudgel, and left him for dead. Mornay demanded justice from the king, who gave him the following answer, a proof as well of his spirit as of his goodness of heart. \"Monseigneur Duplessis, I am exceedingly offended at the insult you have received; and I sympathize with you both as your sovereign and your friend. In the former capacity, I shall do justice to you and to myself; and had I sustained only the character of your friend, there are few perhaps who would have drawn their sword or sacrificed their life more cheerfully in your cause. Be satisfied, then, that I will act the part of a king, a master, and a friend,\" &c. Mornay's knowledge, probity, and valour, made him the soul of the Protestant party, and procured him the contemptuous appellation of the Pope of the Huguenots. He defended their doctrines both by speech and writing. One of his books on the Inquiry of the Mass, having flattered up all the Catholic divines, he refused to\nMORAY to make any reply to their censures and criticisms except in a public conference. This was accordingly appointed to be held A.D. 1605, at Fontainebleau, where the court then was. The two champions were, Du Perron bishop of Evreux, and Moray. After a great many arguments and replies on both sides, the victory was adjudged to Du Perron. He had boasted that he would point out to the satisfaction of every one five hundred errors in his adversary's book, and he partly kept his word. The Calvinists did not fail to claim the victory on this occasion, and they still continue to do so. This conference, instead of putting an end to the differences, was productive of new quarrels among the controversialists, and of much profane wit among the libertines. A Huguenot minister, who was present at the conference, observed with great concern to a captain of the same party, \"The bishop of Evreux has already driven Moray from several strong holds.\"\n\n\"No matter (replied the folder), provided he does not drive him from Saumur.\" This was an important place on the river Loire, of which Duplessis was governor. Hither he retired, his attention being constantly occupied in defending the Huguenots, and in making himself formidable to the Catholics. When Louis XIII. was making preparations against the Protestants, Duplessis wrote him a letter, dissuading him from such a measure. After employing the most plausible arguments, he concludes in the following manner: \"To make war on the subject, is an indication of weakness in the government. Authority consists in the quiet submission of the people, and is established by the prudence and justice of the governor. Force of arms ought never to be employed except in repelling a foreign enemy. The late king would have sent the new ministers of state to learn the first elements of politics, who like unskillful surgeons would apply violent remedies to every disease, and advise a man to cut off an arm when his finger aches.\" These remonstrances produced no other effect than the loss of the government of Saumur, of which he was deprived by Louis XIII. in 1621. He died two years after, November 11, 1623, aged 74, in his barony de la For\u00eat-sur-Seure in Poitou.

It seems to pursue those insects out of enmity or diversion as well as for food, leaving great numbers dead on the ground, besides those which it devours for food.\n\nThe moroc resembles the cuckoo in size and shape, but differs in other respects. Its mouth is very wide, the opening reaching almost to its eyes; the inside of the mouth and throat yellow, the tongue sharp pointed, and capable of being drawn almost half its length out of the mouth beyond the point of its beak, and is very flexible. The head and neck are brown, without any mixture of other colours; there are likewise a number of very small and scarcely visible hairs at the root of the beak.\n\nThis seems to be the bird mentioned by Sparman under the name of cuculus indicator, which (he says) has the singular property of discovering the nests of wild bees, and leading travellers by a certain cry to the place where the treasure is deposited. According to Sparman's account, it makes known these discoveries by the same cry to foxes as well as to the human species; but Jerome Lobo, who mentions the Abyssinian bird, takes no notice of the foxes, though he mentions its singing melodiously when it arrives at the place where the honey is deposited. Both these accounts are severely criticised by Mr Bruce, who says, that honey is so abundant on every hillock and every tree, that a bird possessing this faculty could be of no use to man or to any other animal in that country, and that having never heard of such a bird in Abyssinia, he considers the account of it as a fiction.","sp":15,"ep":15},{"h":"MOROCCO","t":"an empire of Africa, comprehending Situation a considerable part of the ancient Mauritania, is bounded and bounded on the west by the Atlantic ocean; on the east by the river Muluya, which separates it from Algiers; on the north by the Mediterranean; and on the south by Mount Atlas, or rather by the river Sus, which divides it from the kingdom of Tafilet. Its greatest length is from the north-east to the south-west, amounting to above 590 miles; its breadth is not above 260 where broadest, and in the narrowest places it is not above half that breadth.\n\nThe ancient history of Morocco has been already Histv. given under the article MAURITANIA. It continued under the dominion of the Romans upwards of 400 years. On the decline of that empire it fell under the Goths, who held it till about the year 600, when the Goths were driven out by the Vandals, the Vandals by the Greeks, and they in their turn by the Saracens, who conquered not only this empire, but we may say the whole continent of Africa; at least their religion, one way or other, is to be found in all parts of it. The Saracen empire did not continue long united under one head, and many princes set up for themselves in Africa as well as elsewhere, through whose divisions the Almoravides were at length\nraided to the sovereignty, as related under the article Algiers, No. 2. Yulef, or Joseph, the second monarch of that line, built the city of Morocco, conquered the kingdom of Fez, and the Moorish dominions in Spain; all which were lost by his grandson Abou Hali, who was defeated and killed by the Spaniards. On this prince's death the crown passed to the Mohicans, or Almohades, with whom it had not continued above three generations, when Mohammed the son of Al Manfur lost the famous battle of Sierra Morena, in which 200,000 Moors were slain, and in consequence of which Alphonso X. retook a great many of the Moorish conquests immediately after.\n\nMohammed died soon after this disgrace, and left several sons, between whom a civil war ensued, during which the viceroys of Fez, Tunis, and Tremeten, found means to establish themselves as independent princes. At length one of the princes of the royal blood of Tremeten having defeated the Almohades, made himself master of the kingdoms of Morocco and Fez, and entailed them on his own family. In a short time, however, this family was expelled by the Merini, the Merini by the Oatazes, and these by the Sharifs of Hafsen, who have kept the government ever since.\n\nNothing can be conceived more unjust and despotic than the government of Morocco, and nothing more degenerate than the character of the people. The emperor is allowed to have not only an uncontrollable power over the lives and fortunes of his subjects, but in a great measure over their consciences, in as much as he is the only person who, as the successor of the prophet, has a right to interpret the Koran; and appoints all the judges under him, of whom those of Morocco and Fez are the chief, whose business it is to explain and dispense all matters relating to their religion; and who, being his creatures and dependents, dare not steer otherwise than as he directs. Whenever therefore the laws are enacted by him, and proclaimed by his governors in all the provinces, as is commonly done, that none may plead ignorance, they are everywhere received with an implicit and religious submission. On the other hand, the subjects are bred up with a notion, that those who die in the execution of his command are entitled to an immediate admittance into paradise, and those who have the honour to die by his hand to a still greater degree of happiness in it. After this we need not wonder at finding so much cruelty, oppression, and tyranny on the one side, and so much submission, patience, and misery on the other.\n\nThis latter, however, extends no farther than the Moors; for as to the mountaineers, the subjection and tribute they pay to those tyrants was always involuntary; and as for the negroes, their zeal and attachment is owing merely to the great sway and power which they have gained in the government, on various accounts. They were first introduced, or rather their importation increased, by the policy of Muley Ithmael, a late emperor, at a period when there was a great decrease of population in the empire, occasioned in some degree by the enormous cruelties exercised by its former sovereigns, who have been known not unfrequently, through a flight difficult, to abandon a whole town or province to the sword. In the character of Muley Ithmael were found the most singular inconsistencies; for it is certain, that although a tyrant, yet in other respects, as if to repair the mischief which he committed, Morocco, he left nothing undone for the encouragement of population.\u2014He introduced large colonies of negroes from Guinea; built towns for them, many of which are still remaining; assigned them portions of land, and encouraged their increase by every possible means. He soon initiated them in the Mahometan faith; and had his plan been followed, the country by this time would have been populous, and probably flourishing. As the negroes are of a more lively, active and enterprising disposition than the Moors, they might soon have been taught the arts of agriculture; and their singular ingenuity might have been directed to other useful purposes. It is true, Muley Ithmael, when he adopted this plan, had more objects in view than that of merely peopling his dominions. He saw plainly that his own subjects were of too capricious a disposition to form soldiers calculated for his tyrannical purposes. They had uniformly manifested an inclination to change their sovereigns, though more from the love of variety than to reform the government, or restrain the abuses of tyranny. Muley Ithmael had discernment enough to see, that by forming an army of slaves, whose sole dependence should rest upon their master, he could easily train them in such a manner as to act in the strictest conformity to his wishes. He soon learnt that the great object with the negroes was plenty of money and liberty of plunder; in these he liberally indulged them, and the plan fully answered his expectations. Though, however, Muley Ithmael had no great merit in introducing subjects for the purposes of tyranny, yet the good effects of this new colonization were very generally experienced. By intermarrying among themselves, and intermixing among the Moors (for the Moors will keep negro women as concubines, though they seldom marry them), a new race of people started up, who became as useful subjects as the native inhabitants, and brought the empire into a much more flourishing state than it had ever been in since their great revolution.\n\nSidi Mahomet, his grandson and successor, had different views, and was actuated by different motives. From his inordinate avarice, he ceased to act towards his black troops in the generous manner which had distinguished his predecessor Muley Ithmael; and they soon showed themselves discontented with his conduct. They offered to place his eldest son Muley Ali, on the throne; but this prince, not unmindful of the duty which he owed his father and sovereign, declined their offer. They next applied to Muley Yazid, who at first accepted of the affiance they tendered, but in a short time relinquished the plan. Sidi Mahomet, disgusted with this conduct of the negroes, determined to curb their growing power, by disbarring a considerable part of these troops, and banishing them to distant parts of the empire.\n\nA most flagrant species of despotism, which renders despotism the emperors more formidable to their subjects, is their of the making themselves their sole heirs, and, in virtue of that prerogative, seizing upon all their effects, and making only such provision for their families as they think proper; and often, on some frivolous pretence, leaving them destitute of any, according to the liking or dislike they bear to the deceased; so that, upon the whole, they are the only makers, judges, and interpreters, and in many instances likewise the executioners, of their own laws, which have\nno other limits than their own arbitrary will. The titles which the emperors of Morocco assume, are those of Most glorious, mighty, and noble emperor of Africa; king of Fez and Morocco, Tafilet, Suz, Dorha, and all the Algarbe, and its territories in Africa; grand Sharif (or, as others write it, Xarif), that is, successor, or vicegerent, of the great Prophet Mohammed, &c.\n\nThe judges or magistrates who act immediately under the emperor are either spiritual or temporal, or rather ecclesiastical and military. The mufti and the cadis are judges of all religious and civil affairs; and the baihaws, governors, alcaldes, and other military officers, of those that concern the flate or the army: all of them the most obsequious creatures and slaves of their prince, and no less the rapacious tyrants of his subjects, and from whom neither justice nor favour can be obtained but by mere dint of money and extortionate bribery, from the highest to the lowest. Neither can it indeed be otherwise in such an arbitrary government, where the highest posts must not only be bought of the prince at a most extravagant price, and kept only by an exorbitant tribute, which is yearly paid to him, but where no one is sure to continue longer than he can bribe some of the courtiers to insinuate to the monarch that he pays to the utmost of his power and much beyond what was expected from him. There are instances of the sultan elevating at once a common soldier to the rank of a baihaw, or making him a confidential friend; the following day he would perhaps imprison him, or reduce him again to the station of a private soldier. Yet such is the disposition of these people, that they have an unbounded thirst for rank and power with all their uncertainties; and what is more extraordinary, when they have obtained a high station, they seldom fail to afford their sovereign a plea for ill treating them, by abusing in some way or other their trust.\n\nFrom what has been said, it may be reasonably concluded that the revenue arising to the emperor from the last mentioned source, that of bribery, extortion, and confiscation, must be very considerable, though there is no possibility to make any other conjecture of its real amount than that it must be an immense one. Another considerable branch is the piratical trade, which brings the greater income into his treasury, as he is not at any expense either for fitting out of corsair vessels, or maintaining their men; and yet has the tenth of all the cargo and of all the captives; besides which, he appropriates to himself all the rest of them, by paying the captors 50 crowns per head, by which means he engrosses all the slaves to his own service and advantage. This article is indeed a very considerable addition to his revenue, not only as he sells their ransom at a very high rate, but likewise as he has the profit of all their labour, without allowing them any other maintenance than a little bread and oil, or any other assistance when sick, than what medicines a Spanish convent, which he tolerates there, gives them gratis; and which, nevertheless, is forced to pay him an annual present for that toleration, besides furnishing the court with medicines, and the slaves with lodging and diet when they are not able to work. Another branch of his revenue consists in the tenth part of all cattle, corn, fruits, honey, wax, hides, rice, and other products of the earth, which is exacted of the Arabs and Berbes, as well as of the natives; and these are levied, or rather farmed, by the baihaws, go-\n\nvemors, alcaldes, &c., with all possible severity. The Jews and Christians likewise pay an income or capita- tion, the former of six crowns per head on all males from 15 years and upwards, besides other arbitrary imposts, fines, &c. That on the Christians, for the liberty of trading in his dominions, rises and falls according to their number, and the commerce they drive; but which, whatever it may bring yearly into his coffers, is yet detrimental to trade in general, seeing it discourages great numbers from settling there, notwithstanding the artful invitations which the emperors and their ministers make use of to invite them to it; for, besides those arbitrary exactions, there is still another great hardship attending them, viz. that they cannot leave the country without forfeiting all their debts and effects to the crown. The duties on all imports and exports is another branch of his income, the amount of which, it is said, does not exceed 165,000l. per annum.\n\nThe climate of the empire of Morocco is in general sufficiently temperate, healthy, and not too hot as its situation might lead us to suppose. The chain of mountains which form Atlas, on the eastern side, defends it from the east winds, that would scorch up the earth were they frequent. The summit of these mountains is always covered with snow; and their abundant descending streams spread verdure through the neighbourhood, make the winter more cold, and temper the heats of summer. The sea on the west side, which extends along the coast from north to south, also refreshes the land with regular breezes, that seldom vary according to their seasons. At a distance from the sea, within land, the heat is so great, that the rivulets become dry in summer; but as in hot countries dews are plentiful, the nights are there always cool. The rains are tolerably regular in winter; and are even abundant, though the atmosphere is not loaded with clouds as in northern latitudes. Those rains which fall by intervals are favourable to the earth, and increase its fecundity. In January the country is covered with verdure, and enamelled with flowers. Barley is cut in March, but the wheat harvest is in June. All fruits are early in this climate; and in forward years the vintage is over in the beginning of September. Though in general there is more uniformity and less variation in hot than in northern climates, the first are nevertheless exposed to the intemperance of weather: too heavy rains often impede the harvest; and drought has still greater inconveniences, for it endures the propagation of locusts.\n\nThe soil of Morocco is exceedingly fertile. It is soil, and most so in the inland provinces. On the western coast it is in general light and stony, and is better adapted to the vine and olive than the culture of wheat. They annually burn, before the September rains, the stubble, which is left rather long; and this and the dung of cattle, every day turned to pasture, form the sole manure the land receives. The soil requires but little labour, and the ploughing is so light that the furrows are scarcely six inches deep; for which reason, in some provinces, wooden ploughshares are used for cheapness.\n\nThe empire of Morocco might supply itself with all produce necessaries, as well from the abundance and nature of its products, as from the few natural or artificial wants of the Moors occasioned by climate or education. Its wealth consists in the fruitfulness of its soil: its corn,\nfruits, flocks, flax, salt, gums, and wax, would not only supply its necessities, but yield a superfluous, which might become an object of immense trade and barter with other nations. Such numerous exports might return an inexhaustible treasure, were its government fixed and secure, and did subjects enjoy the fruits of their labour and their property in safety. The increase of corn in Morocco is often as sixty to one, and thirty is held to be but an indifferent harvest.\n\nThe Moors, naturally indolent, take little care of the culture of their fruits. Oranges, lemons, and thick skinned fruits, the trees of which require little nurture, grow in the open fields; and there are very large plantations of them found, which they take the trouble to water in order to increase their product. Their vines, which yield excellent grapes, are planted as far as the 33rd degree, as in the southern provinces of France, and are equally vigorous. But at Morocco, where they yield a large and delicious grape, they are supported by vine poles five and six feet above ground; and as they are obliged to be watered, the little wine made there is seldom preferred. Figs are very good in some parts of the empire, but toward the south they are scarcely ripe before they are full of worms; the heats and night dews may, perhaps, contribute to this speedy decay. Melons, for the same reason, are rarely eatable; they have but a moment of maturity; which passes so rapidly that it is with difficulty seized. Water melons are everywhere reared, and in some provinces are excellent. Apricots, apples, and pears, are in tolerable plenty in the neighbourhood of Fez and Mequinez, where water is less scarce and the climate more temperate. But in the plain, which extends along the western coast, these delicate fruits are very indifferent, have less juice or taste, and the peaches there do not ripen. The tree called the prickly pear, or the Barbary fig, is plentifully found in the empire of Morocco; and is planted round vineyards and gardens, because its thick and thorny leaves, which are wonderfully prolific, form impenetrable hedges. From these leaves a fruit is produced, covered with a thorny skin, that must be taken off with care. This fruit is mild, and full of very hard, small kernels. The olive is everywhere found along the coast, but particularly to the south.\n\nIn the province of Suz, between the 25th and 30th degrees, the inhabitants have an almond harvest, which varies little because of the mildness of the climate; but the fruit is small, for which reason they take little care of the trees, and they degenerate with time. The palm tree is common in the southern provinces of Morocco; but dates ripen there with difficulty, and few are good except in the province of Suz and toward Tafilet. On the coast of Sallee and Mamora there are forests of oak, which produce acorns near two inches long. They taste like chestnuts, and are eaten raw and roasted. Salt abounds in the empire, and in some places on the coast requires only the trouble of gathering. Independent of the salt pits formed by the evaporation of the soft water, there are pits and lakes in the country whence great quantities are obtained. It is carried even as far as Tombut, whence it passes to the interior parts of Africa.\n\nThe Moors cultivate their lands only in proportion to their wants; hence two-thirds of the empire at least lie waste. Here the doum, that is, the fan or wild palm tree, grows in abundance; and from which those people, when necessity renders them industrious, find great advantage. The shepherds, mule drivers, camel drivers, and travellers, gather the leaves, of which they make mats, fringes, baskets, hats, sours or large wallets to carry corn, twine, ropes, girths, and covers for their pack saddles. This plant, with which also they heat their ovens, produces a mild and resinous fruit that ripens in September and October. It is in form like the raisin, contains a kernel, and is astringent and very proper to temper and counteract the effects of the watery and laxative fruits, of which these people in summer make an immoderate use.\n\nUnacquainted with the sources of wealth of which their ancestors were possessed, the Moors pretend there are gold and silver mines in the empire, which the emperors will not permit to be worked, lest their subjects should thus find means to shake off their yoke. It is not improbable but that the mountains of Atlas may contain unexplored riches; but there is no good proof that they have ever yielded gold and silver. There are known iron mines in the south; but the working of them has been found so expensive, that the natives would rather use imported iron, notwithstanding the heavy duty it pays, by which its price is doubled. There are copper mines in the neighbourhood of Santa Cruz, which are not only sufficient for the small consumption of the empire, where copper is little used, but are also an object of exportation, and would become much more so were the duties less moderate.\n\nNeither the elephant nor the rhinoceros is to be found either in this or the other states of Barbary; but the deserts abound with lions, tigers, leopards, hyenas, and monstrous serpents. The Barbary horses were formerly very valuable, and thought equal to the Arabian. Though the breed is now said to be decayed, yet some very fine ones are occasionally imported into England. Camels and dromedaries, asses, mules, and kumrabs (a most serviceable creature, begot by an ass upon a cow), are their beasts of burden. Their cows are but small, and barren of milk. Their sheep yield but indifferent fleeces, but are very large, as are their goats. Bears, porcupines, foxes, apes, hares, rabbits, ferrets, weasels, moles, chameleons, and all kinds of reptiles, are found here. Partridges and quails, eagles, hawks, and all kinds of wild fowl, are frequent on the coast.\n\nThe principal mountains form the chain which goes under the name of Mount Atlas, and runs the whole length of Barbary from east to west, passing through Morocco, and abutting upon that ocean which separates the eastern from the western continent, and is from this mountain called the Atlantic Ocean. See Atlas. The principal rivers, besides the Malva or Muluya above mentioned, which rises in the deserts, and running from south to north divides Morocco from the kingdom of Algiers, are the Suz, Ommirabih, Rabbata, Larache, Darodt, Sebon, Gueron, and Tensift, which rise in Mount Atlas, and fall into the Atlantic ocean.\n\nThe traffic of the empire by land is either with Arabia or Nigroland: to Mecca they send caravans, consisting of several thousand camels, horses, and mules, twice every year, partly for traffic, and partly on a religious account; for numbers of pilgrims take that opportunity of paying their devotions to their great prophet. The goods they carry to the east are woollen manufactures,\nMorocco manufactures, leather, indigo, cochineal, and ostrich feathers; and they bring back from thence, silk, muslins, and drugs. By their caravans to Negroland, they send salt, silk, and woollen manufactures, and bring back gold and ivory in return, but chiefly negroes.\n\nThe caravans always go strong enough to defend themselves against the wild Arabs in the deserts of Africa and Asia; though, notwithstanding all their vigilance, some of the druggists and baggage often fall into their hands: they are also forced to load one half of their camels with water, to prevent their perishing with drought and thirst in those inhospitable deserts. And there is still a more dangerous enemy, which is the sand itself: when the winds rise, the caravan is perfectly blinded with dust; and there have been instances both in Africa and Asia, where whole caravans, and even armies, have been buried alive in the sands.\n\nThe natives have hardly any trading vessels, but are seldom without some corsairs. These, and European merchant ships, bring them whatever they want from abroad; as linen and woollen cloth, flax, iron wrought and unwrought, arms, gunpowder, lead, and the like: for which they take in return, copper, wax, hides, Morocco leather, wool (which is very fine), gums, soap, dates, almonds, and other fruits. The duties paid by the English in the ports of Morocco are but half those paid by other Europeans. It is a general observation, that no nation is fond of trading with these states, not only on account of their capricious deportment, but the villany of their individuals, both natives and Jews, many of whom take all opportunities of cheating, and when detected are seldom punished.\n\nThe land forces of the emperor of Morocco consist principally of black troops, and some few white; amounting altogether to an army of about 35,000 men upon the establishment, two thirds of which are cavalry. This establishment, however, upon occasion, admits of a considerable increase, as every man is supposed to be a folder, and when called upon is obliged to act in that capacity. About 6000 of the standing forces form the emperor's body guard, and are always kept near his person; the remainder are quartered in the different towns of the empire, and are under the charge of the bashaws of the provinces. They are all clothed by the emperor, and receive a trifling pay; but their chief dependence is on plunder, which they have frequent opportunities of acquiring.\n\nThe black troops are naturally of a very fiery disposition, capable of enduring great fatigue, hunger, thirst, and every difficulty to which a military life is exposed. They appear well calculated for skirmishing parties, or for the purpose of harassing an enemy; but were they obliged to undergo a regular attack, from their total want of discipline they would soon be routed. In all their manoeuvres they have no notion whatever of order and regularity, but have altogether more the appearance of a rabble than of an army.\n\nThe emperor's navy consists of about 15 small frigates, a few xebecs, and between 20 and 30 row-galleys. The whole is commanded by one admiral; but as these vessels are principally used for the purposes of piracy, they seldom unite in a fleet. The number of the seamen in service is computed at 6000.\n\nThe coins of this empire are a fluze, a bianquil, and Morocco ducat. The fluze is a small copper coin, 20 whereof make a bianquil, of the value of twopence sterling. The bianquil is of silver, and the ducat of gold, not unlike that of Hungary, and worth about nine shillings. Both these pieces are liable to be clipped and filed by the Jews, that the Moors always carry scales in their pockets to weigh them; and when they are found to be much diminished in their weight, they are recoined by the Jews, who are masters of the mint, by which they gain a considerable profit; as they do also by exchanging the light pieces for those that are full weight. Merchants' accounts are kept in ounces, 10 of which make a ducat; but in payments to the government, it is said they reckon 17 one-half for a ducat.\n\nWith respect to religion, the inhabitants of Morocco are Mohammedans, of the sect of Ali; and have a and mufti or high-priest, who is also the supreme civil magistrate, and the last resort in all causes ecclesiastical and civil. They have a great veneration for their hermits, and for idiots and madmen; as well as for those who by their tricks have got the reputation of wizzards: all whom they look upon as inspired persons, and not only honour as saints while they live, but build tombs and chapels over them when dead; which places are not only religiously visited by their devotees far and near, but are esteemed inviolable sanctuaries for all sorts of criminals except in cases of treason.\n\nNotwithstanding the natives are zealous Mohammedans, they allow foreigners the free and open profession of their religion, and their very slaves have their priests and chapels in the capital city; though it must be owned that the Christian slaves are here treated with the utmost cruelty. Here, as in all other Mohammedan countries, the Alcoran and their comments upon it are their only written laws; and though in some instances their cadis and other civil magistrates are controlled by the arbitrary determinations of their princes, bashaws, generals, and military officers, yet the latter have generally a very great deference and regard for their laws. Murder, theft, and adultery, are commonly punished with death: and their punishments for other crimes, particularly those against the state, are very cruel; as impaling, dragging the prisoner through the streets at a mule's heels till all his flesh is torn off, throwing him from a high tower upon iron hooks.\n\nThe inhabitants of the empire of Morocco, known by the name of Moors, are a mixture of Arabian and of the semi-African nations formed into tribes; with the origin of whom we are but imperfectly acquainted. These tribes, each strangers to the other, and ever divided by traditional hatred or prejudice, seldom mingle. It seems probable that most of the casts who occupy the provinces of Morocco have been repulsed from the eastern to the western Africa, during those different revolutions by which this part of the world has been agitated; that they have followed the standard of their chiefs, whose names they have preserved; and that by these they, as well as the countries they inhabit, are distinguished. At present these tribes are called cafles or cabiles, from the Arabic word kabilea; and they are so numerous, that it is impossible to have a knowledge of them all.\nThe native subjects of the empire of Morocco may be divided into two principal classes; the Brebes and the Moors.\n\nThe etymology of the name, and the origin of the people, of the first class, are equally unknown. Like the Moors, at the time of the invasion by the Arabs, they may have adopted the Mahometan religion, which is consonant to their manners and principal usages; but they are an ignorant people, and observe none of the precepts of that religion, but the aversion it enjoins against other modes of worship.\n\nConfined to the mountains, the Brebes preserve great animosity against the Moors, whom they confound with the Arabs, and consider as usurpers.\u2014They thus contract in their retreats a ferocity of mind, and a strength of body, which makes them more fit for war and every kind of labour than the Moors of the plains in general are. The independence they boast of gives even a greater degree of expression to their countenance. The prejudices of their religion make them submit to the authority of the emperors of Morocco; but they throw off the yoke at their pleasure, and retire into the mountains, where it is difficult to attack or overcome them. The Brebes have a language of their own, and never marry but among each other. They have tribes or castes among them who are exceedingly powerful both by their number and courage.\n\nThe Moors of the plains may be distinguished into those who lead a pastoral life, and those who inhabit the cities.\n\nThe former live in tents; and that they may allow their ground a year's rest, they annually change the place of their encampments, and go in search of fresh pasturage; but they cannot take this step without acquainting their governor. Like the ancient Arabs, they are entirely devoted to a pastoral life; their encampments, which they call douchars, are composed of several tents, and form a crescent; or they are ranged in two parallel lines, and their flocks, when they return from pasture, occupy the centre.\n\nThe tents of the Moors, viewed in front, are of a conical figure; they are from 8 to 10 feet high, and from 20 to 25 feet long; like those of high antiquity, they resemble a boat reversed. They are made of cloth composed of goats and camels hair, and the leaves of the wild palm, by which they are rendered impervious to water; but at a distance their black colour gives them a very disagreeable look.\n\nThe Moors, when encamped, live in the greatest simplicity, and exhibit a faithful picture of the inhabitants of the earth in the first ages of the world. The nature of their education, the temperature of the climate, and the rigour of the government, diminish the wants of the people, who find in their plains, in the milk and wool of their flocks, every thing necessary for food and clothing. Polygamy is allowed among them; a luxury so far from being injurious to a people who have few wants, that it is a great convenience in the economy of those societies, because the women are intrusted with the whole care of the domestic management. In their half-closed tents, they are employed in milking the cows for daily use; and when the milk abounds, in making butter, in picking their corn, their barley, and pulse, and grinding their meal, which they do daily in a mill composed of two stones about 18 inches in diameter, the uppermost having a handle, and turning on an axis fixed in the under one: they make bread likewise every day, which they bake between two earthen plates, and often upon the ground after it has been heated by fire. Their ordinary food is the coofcoofoo; which is a paste made with their meal in the form of small grains like Italian paste. This coofcoofoo is dressed in the vapour of boiling soup, in a hollow dish perforated with many small holes in the bottom, and the dish is enclosed in a kettle where meat is boiled; the coofcoofoo, which is in the hollow dish, grows gradually soft by the vapour of the broth, with which it is from time to time moistened. This simple food is very nourishing, and even agreeable when one has got the better of the prejudices which every nation entertains for its own customs. The common people eat it with milk or butter indifferently; but those of higher rank, such as the governors of provinces and lieutenants, who live in the centre of the encampments, add to it some succulent broth, made with a mixture of mutton, poultry, pigeons, or hedgehogs, and then pour on it a sufficient quantity of fresh butter.\n\nThe women in their tents spin wool, and weave it into cloth on looms suspended the whole length of the tent. Each piece is about five ells long, and one and a half broad; it is neither dressed nor dyed, and it has no seam; they wash it when it is dirty; and as it is the only habit of the Moors, they wear it night and day. It is called haick, and is the true model of the ancient draperies.\n\nThe Moors of the plain wear nothing but their dress, &c., woollen stuff; they have neither shirts nor drawers. Linen among these people is a luxury known only to those of the court or the city. The whole wardrobe of a country Moor in easy circumstances consists in a haick for winter, another for summer, a red cap, a hood, and a pair of slippers. The common people both in the country and in towns wear a kind of tunic of woollen cloth, white, gray, or striped, which reaches to the middle of the leg, with great sleeves and a hood; it resembles the habit of the Carthusians.\n\nThe women's dress in the country is likewise confined to a haick, which covers the neck and the shoulders, and is fastened with a silver clasp. The ornaments they are fond of are ear rings, which are either in the form of rings or crescents, made of silver, bracelets, and rings for the small of the leg; they wear these trinkets at their most ordinary occupations; lest out of vanity than because they are unacquainted with the use of caskets or cabinets for keeping them. They also wear necklaces made of coloured glass beads or cloves strung on a cord of silk.\n\nThe Moors consider their wives less in the light of companions than in that of slaves destined to labour. Except in the benefits of tillage, they are employed in every fertile operation; nay, in some of the poorer quarters a woman is often seen yoked in a plough along with a mule, an ass, or some other animal. When the Moors remove their douchars, all the men seat themselves in a circle on the ground; and with their elbows resting on their knees, pass the time in conversation, while the women strike the tents, fold them up into bundles, and place them on the backs of their camels or oxen. The old women are then each loaded with a parcel, and the young carry the children on their shoulders.\nshoulders suspended in a cloth girt round their bodies.\n\nIn the more southern parts the women are likewise employed in the care of the horses; the husband, who in these climates is always a despot, issues his orders, and seems only made to be obeyed.\n\nThe marriage ceremonies of the Moors that live in tents pretty much resemble those of the same people that live in the cities. In the douchars they are generally most brilliant and gay; the strangers that pass along are invited, and made to contribute to the feast; but this is done more from politeness than from any mercenary motive.\n\nThe tribes of the plain generally avoid mixing by marriage with one another; the prejudices that divide these people are commonly perpetuated; or, if they are partially healed, they never fail to revive upon trifling occasions, such as a strayed camel, or the preference of a pasture or well. Marriages have sometimes taken place among them, that, to far from cementing their differences, have occasioned the most tragical scenes. Husbands have been known to murder their wives, and women their husbands, to revenge national quarrels.\n\nParents are not encumbered with their children, however numerous they may be, for they are very early employed in domestic affairs; they tend the flocks, they gather wood, and they assist in ploughing and reaping. In the evening, when they return from the field, all the children of the douchar assemble in a common tent, where the iman, who himself can hardly spell, makes them read a few sentences from the Koran written on boards, and instructs them in their religion by the light of a fire made of straw, of bushes, and cow dung dried in the sun. As the heat is very great in the inland parts of the country, children of both sexes go quite naked till the age of nine or ten.\n\nThe douchars dispersed over the plains are always in the neighbourhood of some rivulet or spring, and they are a kind of inns for the reception of travellers. There is generally a tent erected for their use, if they have not brought one along with them, where they are accommodated with poultry, milk, and eggs, and with whatever is necessary for their horses. Instead of wood for fuel, they have the cow dung, which, when mixed with charcoal, makes a very brisk fire. A guard is always set on the tents of travellers, especially if they are Europeans, because the opinion of their wealth might tempt the avidity of the Moors, who are naturally inclined to thieving.\n\nWith respect to the roads, a very judicious policy is established, which is adapted to the character of the Moors, and to their manner of life. The douchars are responsible for robberies committed in their neighbourhood and in sight of their tents; they are not only obliged to make restitution, but it gives the sovereign a pretence for exacting a contribution proportioned to the abilities of the douchar. In order to temper the rigour of this law, they are made responsible only for such robberies as are committed during the day; those that happen after sunset are not imputed to them, as they could neither see nor prevent them; on this account, people here travel only from sunrise to sunsetting.\n\nTo facilitate the exchange of necessaries, there is in the fields every day, except Friday, which is a day of prayer, a public market in the different quarters of Morocco, each province. The Moors of the neighbourhood assemble to sell and buy cattle, corn, pulse, dried fruits, carpets, haicks, and in short all the productions of the country. This market, which is called Soc, resembles our fairs. The bustle of the people who go and come, gives a better idea of the manner of life of the Moors than can be had in the cities. The alcaldes, who command in the neighbourhood, always attend these markets with soldiers to keep the peace; as it frequently happens that the grudges which these tribes harbour against one another break out upon such occasions into open violence.\n\nThe Moors who inhabit the cities differ from the others only in having a little more urbanity and a more easy deportment. Though they have the same origin with those of the plains, they affect to decline all intercourse with them. Some writers, without any foundation, have given the name of Arabs to the inhabitants of the towns, and that of Moors to those of the plains. But the greater part of the cities of this empire are more ancient than the invasion of the Arabs, who themselves lived in tents.\n\nThe houses in most of the towns in this empire appear at a little distance like vaulted tombs in a church-yard; and the entrance into the best of them has but furniture, a mean appearance. The rooms are generally on the ground floor, and whitened on the outside. As the roofs are quite flat, they serve as verandas, where the Moorish women commonly sit for the benefit of the air; and in some places it is possible to pass nearly over the whole town without having occasion to descend into the street.\n\nAs the best apartments are all backwards, a stable, or perhaps something worse, is the place to which visitors are first introduced. Upon entering the house, the stranger is either detained in this place, or in the street, till all the women are despatched out of the way; he is then allowed to enter a square court, into which four narrow and long rooms open by means of large folding doors, which, as they have no windows, serve likewise to introduce light into the apartments. The court has generally in its centre a fountain; and if it is the house of a Moor of property, it is floored with blue and white chequered tiling. None of the chambers have fire places; and their victuals are always dressed in the court-yard in an earthen stove heated with charcoal. When the visitor enters the room, where he is received by the master of the house, he finds him sitting cross-legged and barefooted on a mattress, covered with fine white linen, and placed on the floor or else on a common mat. This, with a narrow piece of carpeting, is in general the only furniture he will meet with in Moorish houses, though they are not destitute of other ornaments.\n\nThe wardrobe of the inhabitants of cities is but little different from that of those who live in tents.\u2014Like the men, the latter, they have a haick, and a hood more or less fine, and have also a hood of coarse European cloth of dark blue for the winter. What farther distinguishes them from the country Moors is, that they wear a flint and linen drawers, and an upper garment of cotton in summer, and of cloth in winter, which they call a caftan. The white or blue hood, the purpose of which seems to be to guard against bad weather, and which is called bernus,\nThe Moorish women who live in cities are, as in other nations, more addicted to show and finery in dress than those of the country; but as they generally leave the house only one day in the week, they seldom dress themselves. Not allowed to receive male visitors, they remain in their houses employed in their families, and so totally in delirium that they often wear only a shift, and another coarser shift over the first, tied round their waist, with their hair plaited, and sometimes with, though often without, a cap. When dressed, they wear an ample and fine linen shift, the bosom embroidered in gold; a rich caftan of cloth, stuff, or velvet, worked in gold; and one or two folds of gauze, streaked with gold and silk, round the head, and tied behind so as that the fringes, intermingled with their tresses, descend as low as the waist; to which some add a ribbon of about two inches broad, worked in gold or pearls, that encircles the forehead in form of a diadem. Their caftan is bound round their waist by a crimson velvet girdle, embroidered in gold, with a buckle of gold or silver, or else a girdle of tamboured stuff, manufactured at Fez.\n\nThe women have yellow slippers, and a custom of wearing a kind of stocking of fine cloth somewhat large, which is tied below the knee and at the ankle, over which it falls in folds. This stocking is less calculated to show what we call a handsome leg, than to make it appear thick; for to be fat is one of the rules of beauty among the Moorish women. To obtain this quality, they take infinite pains, feed when they become thin on a diet somewhat like forced meat balls, a certain quantity of which is given them daily; and in fine, the same care is taken among the Moors to fatten young women as is in Europe to fatten fowls.\n\nThe Negroes, who constitute a large proportion of the emperor's subjects, are better formed than the Moors; and as they are more lively, daring, and active, they are intrusted with an important share in the executive part of government. They constitute in fact the most considerable part of the emperor's army, and are generally appointed to the command of provinces and towns. This circumstance naturally creates a jealousy between them and the Moors, the latter considering the negroes as usurpers of a power which they have no right to assume. Besides those negroes which form the emperor's army, there are a great many others in the country, who either are or have been slaves to private Moors: every Moor of consequence, indeed, has his proportion of them in his service. To the disgrace of Europe, the Moors treat their slaves with humanity, employing them in looking after their gardens, and in the domestic duties of their houses. They allow them to marry among themselves; and after a certain number of years, spontaneously present them with the invaluable boon of liberty. They soon are initiated in the Mahometan persuasion, though they sometimes intermix with it a few of their original superstitious customs. In every other respect they copy the dress and manners of the Moors.\n\nAmong the inhabitants of Morocco there is another class, of whom we must not omit to make mention. These are the Renegadoes, or foreigners, who have renounced their religion for the faith of Mahomet. Of these there are a great number who have been originally Jews: they are held in little estimation by the Moors; and would be held in abhorrence by the Jews, if they durst freely express their aversion. The families of these apostates are called Toonadis: not having at any time married with the Moors, they still preserve their ancient characteristics, and are known almost at sight to be the progeny of those who formerly embraced the Mahometan religion. The Christian renegadoes are but few; and generally are fugitive peculators of Spain, or men fallen from power, who because of their misfortunes, or in despair, quit one unfortunate situation for another much more deplorable.\n\nThe Jews were formerly very numerous in this empire. After being proscribed in Spain and Portugal, multitudes of them passed over to Morocco, and spread themselves through the towns and over the country. By the relations they themselves give, and by the extent of the places assigned them to dwell in, it would appear there were more than 30,000 families, of whom at present there is scarcely a residue of one-twelfth; the remainder either having changed their religion, sunk under their sufferings, or fled from the vexations they endured, and the arbitrary taxes and tolls imposed upon them. The Jews possess neither lands nor gardens, nor can they enjoy their fruits in tranquility: they must wear only black; and are obliged, when they pass near mosques, or through streets in which there are sanctuaries, to walk barefoot. The lowest among the Moors imagines he has a right to ill-treat a Jew; nor dares the latter defend himself, because the Koran and the judge are always in favour of the Mahometan.\u2014Notwithstanding this state of oppression, the Jews have many advantages over the Moors: they better understand the spirit of trade; they act as agents and brokers, and profit by their own cunning and the ignorance of the Moors.\n\nThe Moors, who derive their language and religion from the Arabs, seem not in any manner to have participated of their knowledge. United and confounded, as they are of Morocco have been with the Moors of Spain, the latter of whom cultivated the arts and gave birth to Averroes, and many other great men, the Moors of this empire have preserved no traces of the genius of their ancestors. They have no conception of the speculative sciences. Education consists merely in learning to read and write; and as the revenues of the learned are derived from these talents, the priests and talbes among them are the sole depositaries of thus much knowledge: the children of the Moors are taught in their schools to read and repeat some sixty lefsons, selected from the Koran, which for the sake of economy are written upon small boards.\n\nThe Moors who formerly inhabited Spain gave great application to physic and astronomy; and they have left manuscripts behind them which still remain monuments of their genius. The modern Moors are infinitely degenerate; they have not the least inclination to the study of science; they know the properties of some simples; but as they do not proceed upon principle, and are ignorant of the causes and effects of diseases, they generally make a wrong application of their remedies. Their most useful physicians are their talbes, their fa-\nkirs, and their saints, in whom they place a superstitious confidence.\n\nNotwithstanding the Moors have occupied themselves little in the study of astronomy, they have been eager after astrology. This imaginary science, which made so rapid a progress at Rome in spite of the edicts of the emperors, may be conceived to make still greater advances among a people wholly fluid and ignorant, and ever agitated by the dread of present evils, or the hope of a more happy futurity. Magic, the companion of astrology, has here also found its followers, and is particularly studied by the talbes in the southern parts, who successfully use it in imposing upon Moorish credulity with strange dreams and ambiguous forebodings and prophecies.\n\nThe Moorish manufactures are\u2014The haick, which, as was before observed, is a long garment composed of white wool and cotton, or cotton and silk woven together, and is used by the Moors for the purpose of covering their under dress when they go abroad, which they do by totally wrapping themselves in it in a careless but easy manner; silk handkerchiefs of a particular kind, prepared only at Fez; silks checkered with cotton; carpeting, little inferior to that of Turkey; beautiful matting, made of the palmetto or wild palm tree; paper of a coarse kind; cordovan, commonly called Morocco leather; gunpowder of an inferior nature; and long-barrelled muskets, made of Billcay iron. The Moors are unacquainted with the mode of casting cannon; and therefore those few which are now in the country are obtained from Europeans. The manufacture of glass is likewise unknown to them; as indeed they make great use of earthen ware, and have few or no windows to their houses, this commodity may be of less importance to them than many others. They make butter, by putting the milk into a goat skin, with its outward coat turned inwards, and shaking it till the butter collects on the sides, when it is taken out for use. From this operation it proves always full of hairs, and has an insipid flavour. Their cheese consists merely of curds hardened and dried, and has uniformly a disagreeable taste. The bread in some of the principal towns, particularly at Tangier and Sallee, is remarkably good, but in many other places it is coarse, black, and heavy.\n\nTheir looms, forges, ploughs, carpenters tools, &c., are much upon the same construction with the improved instruments of the same kind which are used at this time in some parts of Europe, only still more clumsily finished. In their work, they attend more to strength than neatness or convenience; and, like all other ignorant people, they have no idea that what they do is capable of improvement. It is probable, indeed, that the Moors have undergone no very material change since the revolution in their arts and sciences, which took place soon after their expulsion from Spain. Previous to that period, it is well known they were an enlightened people, at a time when the greater part of Europe was involved in ignorance and barbarism; but owing to the weakness and tyranny of their princes, they gradually sunk into the very opposite extreme, and may now be considered as but a few degrees removed from a savage state.\n\nTheir mosques or places of public worship are usually large square buildings, composed of the same materials as the houses. The building consists of broad and lofty piazzas, opening into a square court, in a manner in some degree similar to the Royal Exchange of London. In the centre of the court is a large fountain, and a small stream surrounds the piazzas, where the Moors perform the ceremony of ablution. The court and piazzas are floored with blue and white chequered tiling; and the latter are covered with matting, upon which the Moors kneel while repeating their prayers. In the most conspicuous part of the mosque fronting the east, stands a kind of pulpit, where the talbe or priest occasionally preaches. The Moors always enter this place of worship barefooted, leaving their slippers at the door. On the top of the mosque, is a square steeple with a flag staff, whither at stated hours the talbe ascends, hoists a white flag, and calls the people to prayers, for they have no bells. From this high situation the voice is heard at a considerable distance; and the talbes have a monotonous mode of enunciation, the voice sinking at the end of every short sentence, which in some measure resembles the sound of a bell. The moment the flag is displayed, every person forsook his employment, and goes to prayers. If they are near a mosque, they perform their devotions within it, otherwise immediately on the spot where they happen to be, and always with their faces towards the east, in honour of their prophet Mahomet, who it is well known was buried at Medina.\n\nTheir Sabbath is on our Friday, and commences from six o'clock the preceding evening. On this day they use a blue flag instead of the white one. As it has been prophesied that they are to be conquered by the Christians on the Sabbath day, the gates of all the towns and of the emperor's palaces are shut when at divine service on that day, in order to avoid being surprised during that period. Their talbes are not distinguished by any particular dress.\n\nThe Moors have three solemn devotional periods in the course of the year. The first, which is named Aid de Gabier, is held in commemoration of the birth of Mahomet. It continues seven days; during which period, every person who can afford the expense kills a sheep as a sacrifice, and divides it among his friends. The second is the Ramadam. This is held at the season when Mahomet disappeared in his flight from Mecca to Medina. Every man is obliged at that period to fast (that is, to abstain from animal food from sunrise to sunset each day) for thirty days; at the expiration of which time a feast takes place, and continues a week. The third is named Llajbore, and is a day set apart by Mahomet for every person to compute the value of his property, in order for the payment of zakat, that is, one-tenth of their income to the poor, and other pious uses. Although this feast only lasts a single day, yet it is celebrated with far greater magnificence than either of the others.\n\nThe Moors compute time by lunar months, and count the days of the week by the first, second, third, &c., beginning from our Sunday. They use a common reed for writing, and begin their manuscripts from right to left.\n\nThe Moors of the empire of Morocco, as well as those to the northern limits of Africa, speak Arabic; but this language is corrupted in proportion as we recede farther from Asia, where it first took birth; the intermixture\nintermixture which has happened among the African nations, and the frequent transmigrations of the Moors, during a succession of ages, have occasioned them to lose the purity of the Arabic language; its pronunciation has been vitiated, the use of many words lost, and other foreign words have been introduced without thereby rendering it more copious; the pronunciation of the Africans, however, is softer to the ear and less guttural than that of the Egyptians. The language, when written, is in effect much the same at Morocco as at Cairo, except that there are letters and expressions among the Moors which differ from those of the Oriental Arabs, who, however, understand the Moors in conversation, notwithstanding their vitiated manner of pronouncing. They mutually read each others writings with some difficulty.\n\nThe Moors are naturally of a grave and pensive disposition, fervid in professions of friendship, but very insincere in their attachments. They have no curiosity, no ambition of knowledge; an indolent habit, united to the want of mental cultivation, renders them perhaps even more callous than other unenlightened people to every delicate sensation; and they require more than ordinary excitement to render them sensible of pleasure or of pain. This languor of sentiment is, however, unaccompanied with the smallest spark of courage or fortitude. When in adversity, they manifest the most abject submission to their superiors; and in prosperity their tyranny and pride are inadmissible.\n\nPersonal cleanliness has been considered as one of those circumstances which serve to mark and determine the civilization of a people. It was in vain that Mahomet enjoined the frequency of ablution as a religious duty to the Moors. Their dress, which should be white, is but seldom washed; and their whole appearance evinces that they perform this branch of their religious ceremonies in but a slovenly manner. With this degree of negligence as to their persons, we may be justly surprized to find united a most scrupulous nicety in their habitations and apartments. They enter their chambers barefooted, and cannot bear the slightest degree of contamination near the place where they are seated. This delicacy again is much confined to the inside of their houses. The streets receive the whole of their rubbish and filth; and by these means the ground is so raised in most parts of the city of Morocco, that the new buildings always stand considerably higher than the old.\n\nWith respect to the hours for eating, the people of this country are remarkably regular. Very soon after daybreak they take their breakfast, which is generally a composition of flour and water boiled thin, together with an herb which gives it a yellow tinge. The male part of the family eat in one apartment and the female in another. The children are not permitted to eat with their parents, but take their meals afterwards with the servants; indeed in most other respects they are treated exactly as servants or slaves by their parents. The meal is put into an earthen bowl, and brought in upon a round wooden tray. It is placed in the centre of the guests, who sit cross-legged either on a mat or on the floor, and who form a circle for the purpose. Having previously washed themselves, a ceremony always performed before and after meals, each person with his spoon attacks voraciously the bowl, while they diversify the entertainment by eating with it fruit or bread. At twelve o'clock they dine, performing the same ceremonies as at breakfast. For dinner, from the emperor down to the peasant, their dish is universally cooked, the mode of preparing which has been already described. The dish is brought in upon a round tray and placed on the floor, round which the family sit as at breakfast, and with their fingers commit a violent assault on its contents: they are at the same time, however, attended by a slave or domestic, who presents them with water and a towel occasionally to wash their hands. From the want of the simple and convenient invention of knives and forks, it is not uncommon in this country to see three or four people pulling to pieces the same piece of meat, and afterwards with their fingers stirring up the paste or sauce, of which they often take a whole handful at once into their mouth. At sunset they sup upon the same dish; and indeed supper is their principal meal.\n\nBut the common people must content themselves with a little bread and fruit instead of animal food, and sleep in the open streets. This kind of existence seems ill calculated to endure even in an inactive state; far more severe must it therefore be to those who exercise the laborious employment of couriers in this country, who travel on foot a journey of three hundred or four hundred miles at the rate of between thirty or forty miles a-day, without taking any other nourishment than a little bread, a few figs, and some water, and who have no better shelter at night than a tree. It is wonderful with what alacrity and perseverance these people perform the most fatiguing journeys at all seasons of the year. There is a regular company of them in every town, who are ready to be dispatched at a moment's warning to any part of the country their employers may have occasion to send them.\n\nAs the Moors are not fond of admitting men into their houses except upon particular occasions, if the weather be fine they place a mat, and sometimes a carpet, on the ground before their door, seat themselves upon it cross-legged, and receive their friends, who form a circle, sitting in the same manner, with their attendants on the outside of the groups. Upon these occasions they either drink tea or smoke and converse. The streets are sometimes crowded with parties of this kind; some engaged in playing at an inferior kind of chess or draughts, at which they are very expert; but the majority in conversation. The people of this country, indeed, are so decidedly averse to standing up, or walking about, that if only two or three people meet, they squat themselves down in the first clean place they can find, if the conversation is to hold but for a few minutes.\n\nThe Moors have in general but few amusements; their sedentary life they lead in cities is little variegated amusement, except by the care they take of their gardens, which are rather kept for profit than pleasure. Most of these gardens are planted with the orange, the lemon tree, and the cedar, in rows, and in such great quantities, that the appearance is rather that of a forest than that of a garden. The Moors sometimes, though rarely, have music in these retreats; a state of slavery but ill agrees with the love of pleasure: the people of Fez alone, either from a difference in education, or because their organs and sensibility are more delicate, make\nMorocco make music a part of their amusements. There are not in Morocco, as in Turkey, public coffee-houses, where people meet to inquire the news of the day; but instead of these, the Moors go to the barbers' shops, which in all countries seem to be the rendezvous of newsmongers. These shops are surrounded by benches; on which the customer, the inquisitive, and the idle, seat themselves, and when there are no more places vacant, they crouch on the ground like monkeys.\n\nA common diversion in the towns where there are soldiers, as well as in the country, is what the Moors call the game of gunpowder; a kind of military exercise, that is the more pleasing to these people, inasmuch as, by the nature of their government, they all are, or are liable to become, soldiers, therefore all have arms and horses. By explosions of powder, too, they manifest their fertility on their holidays. Their game of gunpowder consists in two bodies of horse, each at a distance from the other, galloping in successive parties of four and four, and firing their pieces charged with powder. Their chief art is in galloping up to the opposite detachment, suddenly stopping, firing their muskets, facing about, charging, and returning to the attack; all which manoeuvres are imitated by their opponents. The Moors take great pleasure in this amusement, which is only an imitation of their military evolutions.\n\nThe common topics for conversation among the Moors, are the occurrences of the place, religion, their women, but above all their horses. This last topic, indeed appears to occupy by far the greatest portion of their attention. These animals are seldom kept in stables in Morocco. They are watered and fed only once a day, the former at one o'clock at noon, and the latter at sunset; and the only one mode which they use to clean them is by washing them all over in a river two or three times a week, and suffering them to dry themselves.\n\nLike all barbarous nations, the Moors are passionately fond of music, and some few have a taste for poetry. Their flow airs, for want of that variety which is introduced when the science has attained a degree of perfection, have a very melancholy sameness; but some of their quick tunes are beautiful and simple, and partake in some degree of the characteristic melody of the Scotch airs. The poetry of their songs, the constant subject of which is love, though there are few nations perhaps who are less sensible of that passion, has certainly less merit than the music.\n\nTheir instruments are a kind of hautboy, which differs from ours only in having no keys; the mandoline, which they have learnt to play upon from their neighbours the Spaniards; another instrument, bearing some resemblance to a violin, and played upon in a similar manner, but with only two strings; the large drum, the common pipe, and the tabor. These united, and accompanied with a certain number of voices, upon many occasions form a band, though solo music is more common in this uncivilized country.\n\nThe Moors marry very young, many of their females not being more than 12 years of age at their nuptials. As Mahometans, it is well known that their religion admits of polygamy to the extent of four wives, and as many concubines as they please; but if we except the very opulent, the people seldom avail themselves of this indulgence, since it entails on them a vast additional expense in housekeeping, and in providing for a large family. In contracting marriage, the parents of both parties are the only agents; and the intended bride and bridegroom never see each other till the ceremony is performed. The marriage settlement is made before the cadi; and then the friends of the bride produce her portion, or if not, the husband agrees to settle a certain sum upon her in case he should die, or divorce her on account of barrenness, or any other cause. The children of the wives have all an equal claim to the effects of the father and mother, but those of the concubines can each only claim half a share.\n\nWhen the marriage is finally agreed upon, the bride is kept at home eight days, to receive her female friends, who pay congratulatory visits every day. At the same time a talbe attends upon her, to converse with her relative to the solemn engagement on which she is about to enter: on these occasions he commonly accompanies his admonitions with singing a pious hymn, which is adapted to the solemnity. The bridegroom, on the other hand, receives visits from his male friends in the morning, and in the evening rides through the town accompanied by them, some playing on hautboys and drums, while others are employed in firing volleys of musketry. In all their festivals, the discharge of musketry indeed forms a principal part of the entertainment. Contrary to the European mode, which particularly aims at firing with exactness, the Moors discharge their pieces as irregularly as possible, so as to have a continual succession of reports for a few minutes.\n\nOn the day of the marriage, the bride in the evening is put into a square or octagonal cage about 12 feet in circumference, which is covered with fine white linen, and sometimes with gauzes and silks of various colours. In this vehicle, which is placed on a mule, she is paraded round the streets, accompanied by her relations and friends, some carrying lighted torches, others playing on the hautboys, and a third party again firing volleys of musketry. In this manner she is carried to the house of her intended husband, who returns about the same time from performing similar ceremonies. On her arrival, she is placed in an apartment by herself, and her husband is introduced to her alone for the first time, who finds her sitting on a silk or velvet cushion (supposing her to be a person of consequence), with a small table before her, upon which are two wax candles lighted. Her shift, or more properly skirt, hangs down like a train behind her, and over it is a silk or velvet robe with close sleeves, which at the breast and wrists is embroidered with gold; this dress reaches something lower than the calf of the leg. Round her head is tied a black silk scarf, which hangs behind as low as the ground. Thus attired, the bride sits with her hands over her eyes, when her husband appears, and receives her as his wife without any further ceremony; for the agreement made by the friends before the cadi is the only specific contract which is thought necessary.\n\nIf the husband should have any reason to suspect that his wife has not been strictly virtuous, he is at liberty to divorce her and take another. For some time after marriage, the family and the friends are engaged in much\nmuch feasting, and a variety of amusements, which last a longer or shorter time according to the circumstances of the parties. It is usually customary for the man to remain at home eight days and the woman eight months after they are first married; and the woman is at liberty to divorce herself from her husband, if she can prove that he does not provide her with a proper subsistence.\n\nWomen suffer but little inconvenience in this country from child-bearing; they are frequently up the next day, and go through all the duties of the house with the infant upon their backs. In celebrating the rite of circumcision, the child is dressed very sumptuously, and carried on a mule, or, if the parents are in poor circumstances, on an ass, accompanied with flags flying and musicians playing on hautboys and beating drums. In this manner they proceed to the mosque, where the ceremony is performed. Children, as soon as they can be made in the least degree useful, are put to the various kinds of labour adapted to their age and strength. Others, whose parents are in better circumstances, are sometimes sent to school; and those who are intended for the church, usually continue their studies till they have nearly learnt the Koran by rote. In that case they are enrolled among the talibes, or learned men of the law; and upon leaving school are paraded round the streets on a horse, accompanied by music and a large concourse of people.\n\nWhen any person dies, a certain number of women are hired for the purpose of lamentation; in the performance of which, nothing can be more grating to the ear, or more unpleasant, than their frightful moans, or rather howlings: at the same time, these mercenary mourners beat their heads and breasts, and tear their cheeks with their nails. The bodies are usually buried a few hours after death. Previous to interment, the corpse is washed very clean, and sewed up in a shroud, with the right hand under the head, which is pointed towards Mecca: it is carried on a bier supported upon men's shoulders, to the burying place, which is always, with great propriety, on the outside of the town, for they never bury their dead in the mosques, or within the bounds of an inhabited place.\n\nMorocco, a city of the kingdom of Morocco in Barbary, lying about 120 miles to the north of Tarudant, 90 to the east of Mogador, and 350 to the south of Tangier. It is situated in a beautiful valley, formed by a chain of mountains on the northern side, and those of Atlas, from which it is distant about 20 miles, on the south and east. The country which immediately surrounds it is a fertile plain, beautifully diversified with clumps of palm trees and shrubs, and watered by small and numerous streams which descend from Mount Atlas. The emperor's out gardens, which are situated at the distance of about five miles to the south of the city, and are large plantations of olives walled in, add considerably to the beauty of the scene.\n\nMorocco, though one of the capitals of the empire (for there are three, Morocco, Mequinez, and Fez), has nothing to recommend it but its great extent and the royal palace. It is enclosed by remarkably strong walls built of tabby, the circumference of which is about eight miles. On these walls there are no guns mounted; but they are flanked with square towers, and surrounded by a wide and deep ditch. The city has a number of entrances, consisting of large double Morocco porches of tabby in the Gothic style, the gates of which are regularly shut every night at certain hours. As polygamy is allowed by the Mahometan religion, and is supposed in some degree to affect population, it would be difficult to form any computation near the truth with respect to the number of inhabitants which this city may contain. The mosques, which are the only public buildings except the palace worth noticing at Morocco, are more numerous than magnificent; one of them is ornamented with a very high and square tower, built of cut stone, which is visible at a considerable distance from the city. The streets are very narrow, dirty, and irregular, and many of the houses are uninhabited and falling to ruin. Those which are decent and respectable in their appearance are built of tabby, and enclosed in gardens. That of the effendi or prime minister (according to Mr Lempriere, from whose Tour* this account is transcribed), was among the best in Morocco. This house, which consisted of two stories, had elegant apartments both above and below, furnished in a style far superior to anything our author ever saw in that country. The court, into which the lower apartments opened, was very neatly paved with glazed blue and white tiling, and had in its centre a beautiful fountain. The upper apartments were connected together by a broad gallery, the balustrades of which were painted of different colours. The hot and cold baths were very large, and had every convenience which art could afford. Into the garden, which was laid out in a tolerably neat style, opened a room adjoining to the house, which had a broad arched entrance but no door, beautifully ornamented with chequered tiling; and at both ends of the apartment the walls were entirely covered with looking glass. The flooring of all the rooms was covered with beautiful carpeting, the walls ornamented with a large and valuable looking glass, intermixed with watches and clocks in glass cases. The ceiling was carved woodwork, painted of different colours; and the whole was in a superior style of Moorish grandeur. This and a few others are the only decent habitations in Morocco. The generality of them serve only to impress the traveller with the idea of a miserable and deserted city.\n\nThe Elcafeifa is a particular part of the town where stuffs and other valuable articles are exposed to sale. It consists of a number of small shops, formed in the walls of the houses, about a yard from the ground, of such a height within as just to admit a man to sit in one of them cross-legged. The goods and drawers are so arranged round him, that when he serves his customers, who are standing all the time out in the street, he can reach down any article he wants without being under the necessity of moving. These shops, which are found in all the other towns of the empire, are sufficient to afford a striking example of the indolence of the Moors. There are three daily markets in different parts of the town of Morocco where provisions are sold, and two weekly fairs or markets for the disposal of cattle. The city is supplied with water by means of wooden pipes connected with the neighbouring streams, which empty themselves into reservoirs placed for the purpose in the suburbs, and some few in the centre of the town.\n\nThe castle is a large and ruinous building, the outer walls\nMorocco\u2014walls of which enclose a space of ground about three miles in circumference. It has a mosque, on the top of which are three large balls, formed, as the Moors allege, of solid gold. The castle is almost a town of itself; it contains a number of inhabitants, who in some department or other are in the service of the emperor, and all under the direction of a particular alcaide, who is quite independent of the governor of the town. On the outside of the castle, between the Moorish town and the Jewry, are several small distinct pavilions, enclosed in gardens of orange trees, which are intended as occasional places of residence for such of the emperor's sons or brothers as happen to be at Morocco. As they are covered with coloured tiling, they have at a small distance rather a neat appearance; but upon approaching or entering them, that effect in a great measure ceases.\n\nThe Jews, who are at this place pretty numerous, have a separate town to themselves, walled in, and under the charge of an alcaide, appointed by the emperor. It has two large gates, which are regularly shut every evening about nine o'clock; after which time no person whatever is permitted to enter or go out of the Jewry till they are opened again the following morning. The Jews have a market of their own; and when they enter the Moorish town, cattle, or palace, they are always compelled to be barefooted.\n\nThe palace is an ancient building, surrounded by a square wall, the height of which nearly excludes from the view of the spectator the other buildings. Its principal gates are constructed with Gothic arches, composed of cut stone, which conduct to several open and spacious courts; through these it is necessary to pass before we reach any of the buildings. These open courts were used by the late emperor for the purposes of transacting public business and exercising his troops. The habitable part consists of several irregular square pavilions, built of tabby, and whitened over; some of which communicate with each other, others are distinct, and most of them receive their names from the different towns of the empire. The principal pavilion is named by the Moors the Douahar, and is more properly the palace or seraglio than any of the others. It consists of the emperor's place of residence and the harem, forming altogether a building of considerable extent. The other pavilions are merely for the purposes of pleasure or business, and are quite distinct from the douahar. The Mogador pavilion, so named from the late emperor's partiality to that town, has by far the fairest claim to grandeur and magnificence. This apartment was the work of Sidi Mahomet, and is lofty and square. It is built of cut stone, handsomely ornamented with windows, and covered with varnished tiles of various colours; and its elegance and neatness, contrasted altogether with the simplicity and irregularity of the other buildings, produce a most striking effect. In the inside, besides several other apartments, we find in the pavilion a spacious room floored with blue and white chequered tiling, its ceiling covered with curiously carved and painted wood, and its stuccoed walls variously ornamented with looking glasses and watches, regularly disposed in glass cases. To this pavilion the late emperor manifested an exclusive preference, frequently retiring to it both for the purpose of business and of recreation. The apartments of the emperor have in general a much smaller complement of furniture than those of the Moors in the inferior walks of life. Handsome carpeting, a mattress on the ground covered with fine linen, a couch, and a couple of European bedsteads, are the principal articles they contain. The gardens within the walls of the palace, of which he has several, are very neat; they contain orange and olive trees, variously disposed and arranged, and intersected with streams of water, fountains, and reservoirs. Those on the outside are nothing more than large tracts of ground, irregularly planted with olives; having four square walks, and surrounded by walls.\n\nMorocco, or Marruecos, the skin of a goat, or some other animal resembling it, dressed in sumach or galls, and coloured at pleasure; much used in bookbinding, &c.

It had once an abbey and a castle, now in ruins, situated about a quarter of a mile south of the town and river Wansbeck, on an eminence which overlooks both. The market-place is conveniently situated near the centre of the town; and an elegant townhouse was built by the Carlisle family in 1714, in which the quarter-sessions is held for the county. It is built of hewn stone, with a piazza. The church being a quarter of a mile distant from the town, a tower containing a good ring of bells stands near the market place. Near the bridge is the county gaol, a modern structure. Here are a free grammar school, a chapel near the river, on the site of a chantry that was granted for the support of the foundation of the school, which was part of the old structure, and an hospital for infirm people. In 1215, the townsmen themselves burnt their town, out of pure hatred to King John, that he might find no shelter there. Here is a good market on Saturday for corn, cattle, and all necessary provisions; and there is another on Wednesday, the greatest in England except Smithfield, for live cattle. This is a post town and a thoroughfare, with many good inns, and plenty of fish; and here are several mills.\u2014The earl of Carlisle's steward holds a court here twice a year, one of them the Monday after Michaelmas, when four persons are chosen by the free burgesses, who are about 107, and presented to the steward, who names two of them to the bailiffs, who, with seven aldermen, are its governors for the year ensuing.

It is therefore much to\nbe wished, that such accounts had been always cor-\nrectly kept in every kingdom, and regularly published\nat the end of every year. We should then have had\nunder our inspection the comparative strength of every\nkingdom, as far as it depends on the number of inhab-\nitants, and its increase or decrease at different periods.\nBut such accounts are rendered more useful, when they\ninclude the ages of the dead, and the distempers of\nwhich they have died. In this case they convey some\nof the most important instructions, by furnishing us\nwith the means of ascertaining the law which governs\nthe waste of human life, the values of annuities depend-\nent on the continuance of any lives, or any survivor-\nships between them, and the favourable benefits and unfa-\nvourable losses of different situations to the duration of\nhuman life. There are but few registers of this kind;\n\nnor has this subject, though so interesting to mankind,\never engaged much attention till lately. The first bills\ncontaining the ages of the dead were those for the\ntown of Brest in Silicia. It is well known what use\nhas been made of these by Dr Halley, and after him\nby De Moivre. A table of the probabilities of the\nduration of human life at every age, deduced from\nthem by Dr Halley, has been published in the Philo-\nsophical Transactions, (see the Abridgement, vol. iii.\np. 699.) and is the first table of that sort that has been\never published. Since the publication of this table,\nsimilar bills have been established in a few towns of\nthis kingdom; and particularly in London, in the year\n1728, and at Northampton in 1735.\n\nTwo improvements of these registers have been pro-\nposed: the first is, That the sexes of all that die in\nevery period of life should be specified in them, under\nthe denomination of boys, married men, widowers, and\nbachelors; and of girls, married women, widows, and\nvirgins. The second is, That they should specify the\nnumber of both sexes dying of every distemper in\nevery month, and at every age. See the end of the 4th\nessay in Dr Price's Treatise on Reversionary Payments.\nRegisters of mortality thus improved, when compared\nwith records of the seasons, and with the circumstances\nthat discriminate different situations, might contribute\ngreatly to the increase of medical knowledge; and\nthey would afford the necessary data for determining\nthe difference between the duration of human life\namong males and females; for such a difference there\ncertainly is much in favour of females, as will appear\nfrom the following facts.\n\nAt Northampton, though more males are born than\nfemales, and nearly the same number die; yet the\nnumber of living females appeared, by an account tak-\nen in 1746, to be greater than the number of males,\nin the proportion of 2301 to 1770, or 39 to 30.\n\nAt Berlin it appeared, from an accurate account\nwhich was taken of the inhabitants in 1747, that the\nnumber of female citizens exceeded the number of male\ncitizens in the proportion of 459 to 391. And yet\nout of this smaller number of males, more had died for\n20 years preceding 1751, in the proportion of 19\nto 17.\n\nAt Edinburgh, in 1743, the number of females\nwas to the number of males as 4 to 3. (See Mait-\nland's History of Edinburgh, p. 220.) But the fe-\nmales that died annually from 1749 to 1758, were to\nthe males in no higher proportion than 3\u00bd to 3.\n\nHe that will take the pains to examine the accounts\nin Phil. Trans. Abr. vol. vii. part iv. p. 46, &c., will\nfind, that though in the towns there enumerated, the\nproportion of males and females born is no higher than\n19 to 18, yet the proportion of boys and girls that\ndie is 8 to 7; and that, in particular, the still-born\nand chryson males are to the still-born and chryson\nfemales as 3 to 2.\n\nIn 39 parishes of the district of Vaud in Switzer-\nland, the number of males that died during ten years\nbefore 1766 was 8170; of females 8167; of whom\nthe numbers that died under one year of age were 1817\nmales and 1305 females; and under ten years of age,\n3299 males and 2598 females. In the beginning of\nlife, therefore, and before any emigrations can take\nplace, the rate of mortality among males appears to\nMortality be greater than among females. And this is rendered yet more certain by the following accounts. At Vevey, in the district of Vaud just mentioned, there died in the course of 20 years, ending at 1764, in the first month after birth, of males 135 to 89 females; and in the first year 225 to 162. To the same effect it appears from a table given by S\u00fcssmilch, in his Gottliche Ordnung, vol. ii. p. 317, that in Berlin 223 males die in the first month, and but 168 females; and in the first year, 489 to 395; and also, from a table of Struyck's, that in Holland 396 males die in the first year to 326 females.\n\nThe authorities for the facts here mentioned, and much more on this subject, may be found in the 4th essay in Dr Price's Treatise on Reversionary Payments, and in the supplement at the end of that treatise.\n\nWe shall here only add the following table, taken from a memoir of Mr Wargentin's, published in the collection of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, printed at Paris in 1772.\n\nIn all Sweden for nine years, ending in 1763, the proportion of females to males that died out of a given number living, was\n\n| Under the age of one year | 1000 to 1099 |\n|---------------------------|--------------|\n| From 1 to 3 years of age   | 1000 to 1022 |\n| 3\u20145                      | 1042         |\n| 5\u201410                     | 1074         |\n| 10\u201415                    | 1080         |\n| 15\u201420                    | 1097         |\n| 20\u201425                    | 1283         |\n| 25\u201430                    | 1161         |\n| 30\u201435                    | 993          |\n| 35\u201440                    | 1139         |\n| 40\u201445                    | 1115         |\n| 45\u201450                    | 1340         |\n| 50\u201455                    | 1339         |\n| 55\u201460                    | 1292         |\n| 60\u201465                    | 1115         |\n| 65\u201470                    | 1080         |\n| 70\u201480                    | 1022         |\n| 80\u201490                    | 1046         |\n| Above 90                  | 1044         |\n\nRegisters of mortality on the improved plan before mentioned, were established in 1772 at Chester, and also in 1773 at Warrington in Lancashire; and they are so comprehensive and correct, that there is reason to expect they will afford much instruction on the subject of human mortality, and the values of lives.\n\nBut the country most distinguished in this respect is Sweden: for in that kingdom exact accounts are taken of the births, marriages, and burials, and of the numbers of both sexes that die at all ages in every town and district, and also at the end of every period of five years, of the numbers living at every age; and at Stockholm a society is established, whose business it is to superintend and regulate the enumerations, and to collect from the different parts of the kingdom the registers, in order to digest them into tables of observation. These regulations were begun in Sweden in 1755; and tables, containing the result of them from 1755 to 1763, have been published in Mr Wargentin's memoir just referred to; and the most material parts of them may be found in an essay by Dr Price on the Difference between the Duration of Human Life in Towns and in Country Parishes, printed in the 65th volume of the Philosoph. Trans. Part II.\n\nIn the fourth essay in Dr Price's Treatise on Reversionary Payments and Life Annuities, the following account is given of the principles on which tables of observation are formed from registers of mortality; and of the proper method of forming them, so as to render them just representations of the number of inhabitants, and the probabilities of the duration of human life in a town or country.\n\nIn every place which just supports itself in the number of its inhabitants, without any recruits from other places; or where, for a course of years, there has been no increase or decrease; the number of persons dying every year at any particular age, and above it, must be equal to the number of the living at that age. The number, for example, dying every year at all ages from the beginning to the utmost extremity of life, must, in such a situation, be just equal to the whole number born every year. And for the same reason, the number dying every year at one year of age and upwards, at two years of age and upwards, at three and upwards, and so on, must be equal to the numbers that attain to those ages every year; or, which is the same, to the numbers of the living at those ages. It is obvious, that unless this happens, the number of inhabitants cannot remain the same. If the former number is greater than the latter, the inhabitants must decrease; if less, they must increase.\n\nFrom this observation it follows, that in a town or country where there is no increase or decrease, bills of mortality which give the ages at which all die, will show the exact number of inhabitants, and also the exact law according to which human life wastes in that town or country.\n\nIn order to find the number of inhabitants, the mean numbers dying annually at every particular age and upwards must be taken as given by the bills, and placed under one another in the order of the second column of the following tables. These numbers will, it has appeared, be the numbers of the living at 1, 2, 3, &c., years of age; and consequently the sum diminished by half the number born annually will be the whole number of inhabitants.\n\nThis subtraction is necessary, for the following reason. In a table formed in the manner here directed, it is supposed that the numbers in the second column are all living together at the beginning of every year. Thus the number in the second column opposite to 0 in the first column, the table supposes to be all just born together on the first day of the year. The number, likewise, opposite to 1, it supposes to attain to one year of age just at the same time that the former number is born. And the like is true of every number in the second column. During the course of the year, as many will die at all ages as were born at the beginning of the year, and consequently, there will be an excess of the number alive at the beginning of the year above the number alive at the end of the year, equal to the whole number of the annual births; and the true number constantly alive together, is the arithmetical mean between these two numbers; or a-\nMortality, greatly to the rule here given, the sum of the numbers in the second column of the table lessened by half the number of annual births.\n\nIn such a series of numbers, the excess of each number above that which immediately follows it will be the number dying every year out of the particular number alive at the beginning of the year; and these excesses set down regularly as in the third column of the table to which we have referred, will show the different rates at which human life wastes through all its different periods, and the different probabilities of life at all particular ages.\n\nIt must be remembered, that what has been now said goes on the supposition, that the place whose bills of mortality are given, supports itself, by procreation only, in the number of its inhabitants. In towns this very seldom happens, on account of the luxury and debauchery which generally prevail in them. They are, therefore, commonly kept up by a constant accretion of strangers, who remove to them from country parishes and villages. In these circumstances, in order to find the true number of inhabitants, and probabilities of life, from bills of mortality containing an account of the ages at which all die, it is necessary that the proportion of the annual births to the annual deaths should be known, and also the period of life at which the latter remove. Both these particulars may be discovered in the following method.\n\nIf for a course of years there have been no sensible increase or decrease in a place, the number of annual deaths will be equal to the excess of the annual burials above the annual births. If there be an increase, it will be greater than this excess. If there be a decrease, it will be less.\n\nThe period of life at which these settlers remove, will appear in the bills by an increase in the number of deaths at that period and beyond it. Thus in the London bills the number of deaths between 20 and 30 is generally above double; and between 30 and 40 near triple the number of deaths between 10 and 20; and the true account of this is, that from the age of 18 or 20 to 35 or 50, there is an influx of people every year to London from the country, which occasions a great increase in the number of inhabitants at these ages; and consequently raises the deaths for all ages above 20 considerably above their due proportion when compared with the number of deaths before 20. This is observable in all the bills of mortality for towns with which we are acquainted, not even excepting the Brellaw bills. Dr Halley takes notice, that these bills gave the number of deaths between 10 and 20 too small. This he considered as an irregularity in them owing to chance; and, therefore, in forming his table of observations, he took the liberty so far to correct it, as to render the proportion of those who die to the living in this division of life nearly the same with the proportion which, he says, he had been informed die annually of the young lads in Christ Church hospital. But the truth is, that this irregularity in the bills was derived from the cause we have just assigned. During the five years for which the Brellaw bills are given by Dr Halley, the births did indeed a little exceed the burials; but it appears that this was the effect of some peculiar causes that happened to operate just at that time; for during a complete century, from 1633 to 1734, the annual medium of births was 1089, and of Mortality, burials 1256. This town, therefore, must have been all along kept up by a number of yearly recruits from other places, equal to about a seventh part of the yearly births.\n\nIt appears from the account in the Philosophical Transactions (Abridgement, vol. vii. No. 382, p. 46, &c.), that from 1717 to 1725, the annual medium of births at Brellaw was 1252, of burials 1507; and also that much the greatest part of the births died under 10 years of age. From a table in Salmich's works, vol. i. p. 38, it appears that in reality the greater part of all that die in this town are children under five years of age.\n\nWhat has been now observed concerning the period of life at which people remove from the country to settle in towns, would appear sufficiently probable were there no such evidence for it as has been mentioned; for it might well be reckoned that these people in general must be single persons in the beginning of mature life, who not having yet obtained settlements in the places where they were born, migrate to towns in quest of employments.\n\nHaving premised these observations, it will be proper next to endeavour to explain distinctly the effect which these accretions to towns must have on tables of observation formed from their bills of mortality. This is a subject proper to be insisted on, because mistakes have been committed about it; and because also the difficulty of it is necessary to show how near to truth the value of lives comes as deduced from such tables.\n\nThe following general rule may be given on this subject. If a place has for a course of years been maintained in a state nearly stationary, as to number of inhabitants, by recruits coming in every year, to prevent the decrease that would arise from the excess of burials above the births, a table formed on the principle, \"that the number dying annually after every particular age, is equal to the number living at that age,\" will give the number of inhabitants, and the probabilities of life, too great, for all ages preceding that at which the recruits cease; and after this it will give them right. If the accretions are so great as to cause an increase in the place, such a table will give the number of inhabitants and the probabilities of life too little after the age at which the accretions cease; and too great if there is a decrease. Before that age it will in both cases give them too great; but most considerably so in the former case, or when there is an increase.\n\nAccordingly to these observations, if a place increases not in consequence of accretions from other places, but of a constant excess of the births above the deaths, a table constructed on the principle that has been mentioned will give the probabilities of life too low through the whole extent of life; because in such circumstances the number of deaths in the first stages of life must be too great in comparison of the number of deaths in the latter stages; and more or less so as the increase is more or less rapid. The contrary in all respects takes place where there is a decrease arising from the excess of the deaths above the births.\n\nFor example: Let us suppose that 244 of those born in a town attain annually to 20 years of age, and\nMortality, and that 250 more, all likewise 20 years of age, come into it annually from other places, in consequence of which it has for a course of years been just maintained in the number of its inhabitants, without any sensible increase or decrease: in these circumstances, the number of the living in the town of the age of 20 will be always 244 natives, and 250 settlers, or 494 in all; and since these are supposed all to die in the town, and no more recruits are supposed to come in, 494 will be likewise the number dying annually at 20 and upwards. In the same manner it will appear, on these suppositions, that the number of the living at every age subsequent to 20 will be equal to the number dying annually at that age and above it; and consequently that the number of inhabitants and the decrements of life, for every such age, will be given exactly by the table. But for all ages before 20, they will be given much too great. For let 280 of all born in the town reach 10; in this case, 280 will be the true number of the living in the town at the age of 10; and the recruits not coming in till 20, the number given by the bills as dying between 10 and 20 will be the true number dying annually of the living in this division of life. Let this number be 36; and it will follow that the table ought to make the numbers of the living at the ages between 10 and 20, a series of decreasing means between 280 and (280 diminished by 36, or) 244. But in forming the table on the principle just mentioned, 250 (the number above 20 dying annually in the town who were not born in it) will be added to each number in this series; and therefore the table will give the numbers of the living, and the probabilities of life in this division of life, almost twice as great as they really are. This observation, it is manifest, may be applied to all the ages under 20.\n\nIt is necessary to add, that such a table will give the number of inhabitants and the probabilities of life equally wrong before 20, whether the recruits all come in at 20, agreeably to the supposition just made, or only begin then to come in. In this last case, the table will give the number of inhabitants and probabilities of life too great throughout the whole extent of life, if the recruits come in at all ages above 20. But if they cease at any particular age, it will give them right only from that age; and before, it will err all along on the side of excess; but less considerably between 20 and that age than before 20. For example: if, of the 250 supposed to come in at 20, only 150 then come in, and the rest at 30; the number of the living will be given 100 too high at every age between 20 and 30; but, as just shown, they will be given 250 too high at every age before 20. In general, therefore, the number of the living at any particular age must be given by the supposed table as many too great as there are annual settlers after that age; and if these settlers come in at all ages indiscriminately, during any certain interval of life, the number of inhabitants and the probabilities of life will be continually growing less and less wrong, the nearer any age is to the end of that interval. These observations prove, that tables of observation formed in the common way, from bills of mortality for places where there is an excess of the burials above the births, must be erroneous for a great part of the duration of life, in proportion to the degree of that excess. They show likewise at what parts of life the errors in such tables are most considerable, and how they may be in a great measure corrected.\n\nAll this shall be exemplified in the particular case of London.\n\nThe number of deaths between the ages of 10 and 20 is always so small in the London bills, that it seems certain few recruits come to London under 20, or at least not so many as before this age are sent out for education to schools and universities. After 20 great numbers come in till 30, and some perhaps till 40 or 50: but at every age after 50, it is probable that more retire from London than come to it. The London tables of observation, therefore, being formed on the principle already mentioned, cannot give the probabilities of life right till 40. Between 30 and 40 they must be a little too high; but more so between 20 and 30, and most of all so before 20. It follows also that these tables must give the number of inhabitants in London much too great.\n\nThe first of the following tables is formed in the manner here explained, from the London bills for 10 years, from 1759 to 1768, and adapted to 1000 born as a radix. The sum of the numbers in the second column, diminished by half the number born, is 25,757. According to this table, then, for every 1000 deaths in London there are 25\u00bd as many inhabitants; or, in other words, the expectation of a child just born is 25\u00bd; and the inhabitants are to the annual burials as 25\u00bd to 1. But it has appeared, that the numbers in the second column, being given on the supposition that all those who die in London were born there, must be too great; and we have from hence a demonstration, that the probabilities of life are given in the common tables of London observations too high for at least the first 30 years of life; and also, that the number of inhabitants in London must be less than 25\u00bd multiplied by the annual burials. The common tables, therefore, of London observations undoubtedly need correction, as Mr. Simpson suggested, and in some measure performed; though too imperfectly, and without going upon any fixed principles, or showing particularly how tables of observation ought to be formed, and how far in different circumstances, and in different ages, they are to be depended on. The way of doing this, and in general the right method of forming genuine tables of observation for towns, may be learned from the following rule:\n\n\"From the sum of all that die annually, after any given age, subtract the number of annual settlers after that age; and the remainder will be the number of the living at the given time.\"\n\nThis rule can want no explication or proof after what has been already said.\n\nIf, therefore, the number of annual settlers in a town at every age could be ascertained, a perfect table of observations might be formed for that town from bills of mortality, containing an account of the ages at which all die in it. But no more can be learned in this instance from any bills, than the whole number of annual settlers, and the general division of life in which they enter. This, however, may be sufficient to enable us to form tables that shall be tolerably exact. For instance: Suppose the annual deaths in a town which has not increased or decreased, to have been...\nMortality been for many years in the proportion of 4 to 3 to the annual births. It will hence follow, that \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the persons who die in such a town are settlers, or emigrants from other places, and not natives; and the sudden increase in the deaths after 20 will also show, agreeably to what was before observed, that they enter after this age. In forming, therefore, a table for such a town, a quarter of all that die at all ages throughout the whole extent of life must be deducted from the sum of all that die after every given age before 20; and the remainder will be the true number living at that given age. And if at 20, and every age above it, the deduction is omitted, or the number of the living at every such age is taken the same with the sum of all that die after it, the result will be (supposing most of the settlers to come in before 30, and all before 40) a table exact till 20; too high between 20 and 30; but nearly right for some years before 40; and after 40 exact again. Such a table, it is evident, will be the same with the table last described at all ages above 20, and different from it only under 20. It is evident also, that on account of its giving the probabilities of life too great for some years after 20, the number of inhabitants deduced from it may be depended on as somewhat greater than the truth; and more or less so, as the annual recruits enter in general later or sooner after 20.\n\nLet us now consider what the result of these remarks will be, when applied particularly to the London bills.\n\nIt must be here first observed, that at least one quarter of all that die in London are supplies or settlers from the country, and not natives. The medium of annual burials for 10 years, from 1759 to 1768, was 22,956; of births 15,710. The excess is 7,246, or near a third of the burials. The same excess during 10 years before 1750 was 10,500, or near half the burials. London was then decreasing. For the last 12 or 15 years it has been increasing. This excess, therefore, agreeably to the foregoing observations, was then greater than the number of annual settlers, and it is now less. It is however here supposed, that the number of annual settlers is now no more than a quarter of the annual burials, in order to allow for more omissions in the births than the burials; and also, in order to be more sure of obtaining results that shall not exceed the truth.\n\nOf every 1000 then who die in London only 750 are natives, and 250 are recruits who come to it after 18 or 20 years of age; and, consequently, in order to obtain from the bills a more correct table than the first of the following tables, 250 must be subtracted from every one of the numbers in the second column till 20; and the numbers in the third column must be kept the same, the bills always giving these right. After 20, the table is to be continued unaltered; and the result will be, a table which will give the numbers of the living at all ages in London much nearer the truth but still somewhat too high. Such is the second of the following tables. The sum of all the numbers in the second column of this table, diminished by 500, is 20,750. For every 1000 deaths, therefore, in London, there are, according to this table, 20,750 living persons in it; or for every single death 20\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inhabitants. It was before shown, that the number of inhabitants in London could not be so great as 25\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times the deaths.\n\nIt now appears (since the numbers in the second column of this table are too high) that the number of inhabitants of London cannot be so great as even 20\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times the deaths. And this is a conclusion which everyone, who will before due attention on what has been said, will find himself forced to receive. It will not be amiss, however, to confirm it by the following fact, the knowledge of which is derived from the particular inquiry and information of Mr Harris, the late ingenious master of the royal mathematical school in Christ-Church hospital. The average of lads in this school has, for 30 years past, been 837. They are admitted at all ages between 7 and 11; and few stay beyond 16: they are therefore in general, lads between the age of 8 and 16. They have better accommodations than it can be supposed children commonly have; and about 300 of them have the particular advantage of being educated in the country. In such circumstances, it may be well reckoned, that the proportion of children dying annually must be less than the general proportion of children dying annually at the same ages in London. The fact is, that for the last 30 years 113 have died annually, or one in 70\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAccording to Table II, one in 73 dies between 10 and 20, and one in 70 between 8 and 16. That table, therefore, probably gives the decrements of life in London, at these ages, too little, and the numbers of the living too great: and if this is true of these ages, it must be true of all other ages under 20; and it follows demonstrably, in conformity to what was before shown, that more people settle in London after 20 than the fourth above supposed; and that from 20 to at least 30 or 35, the numbers of the living are given too great, in proportion to the decrements of life.\n\nIn this table the numbers in the second column are doubled at 20, agreeably to what really happens in London; and the sum of the numbers in this column diminished by half the whole number of deaths, gives the expectation of life, not of a child just born, as in other tables, but of all the inhabitants of London at the time they enter it, whether that be at birth or at 20 years of age. The expectations, therefore, and the values of London lives under 20, cannot be calculated from this table. But it may be very easily fitted for this purpose, by finding the number of births which, according to the given decrements of life, will leave 494 alive at 20; and then adapting the intermediate numbers in such a manner to this radix, as to preserve all along the number of the living in the same proportion to the numbers of the dead. This is done in the third of the following tables; and this table may be recommended as better adapted to the present state of London than any other table. The values of lives, however, deduced from it, are in general nearly the same with those deduced by Mr Simpson from the London bills as they stood forty years ago; the main difference is, that after 32, and in old age, this table gives them somewhat lower than Mr Simpson's table. The fourth and fifth of the following tables, compared with the two last, will give a distinct and full view of the difference between the rate of human mortality in great towns and in country parishes and villages.\n### TABLE I.\n\nShowing the Probabilities of Life in London, on the supposition that all who die in London were born there.

the possession of his ancestor's estate by the superior, or other person pretending right.","sp":28,"ep":35},{"h":"MORTAR","t":"a preparation of lime and sand mixed with water, which serves as a cement, and is used by masons and bricklayers in building walls of stone and brick. See Lime, Chemistry Index.\n\n**Mortar**, a chemical utensil, very useful for the division of bodies, partly by percussion and partly by grinding. Mortars have the form of an inverted bell. The matter intended to be pounded is to be put into them, and there it is to be struck and bruised by a long instrument called a pestle. The motion given to the pestle ought to vary according to the nature of the substances to be pounded. Those which are easily broken, or which are apt to fly out of the mortar, or which are hardened by the stroke of the pestle, require that this instrument should be moved circularly, rather than grinding or bruising than by striking. Those substances which are softened by the heat occasioned by rubbing...\nrubbing and percussion, require to be pounded very slowly. Lastly, those which are very hard, and which are not capable of being softened, are easily pounded by repeated strokes of the pellie. They require no bruising but when they are brought to a certain degree of fineness. But these things are better learned by habit and practice than by any directions.\n\nAs mortars are instruments which are constantly used in chemistry, they ought to be kept of all sizes and materials; as of marble, copper, glass, iron, gritstone, and agate. The nature of the substance to be pounded determines the choice of the kind of mortar. The hardness and dissolving power of that substance are particularly to be attended to. As copper is a metal, which is soluble by almost all menstrua, and hurtful to health, this metal is rarely or never employed for the purpose of making mortars.\n\nOne of the principal inconveniences of pulverization in a mortar proceeds from the fine powder which rises abundantly from some substances during the operation. If these substances be precious, the loss will be considerable; and if they be injurious to health, they may hurt the operator. These inconveniences may be remedied, either by covering the mortar with a skin, in the middle of which is a hole, through which the pellie passes; or by moistening the matter with a little water when this addition does not injure it; or, lastly, by covering the mouth and nose of the operator with a fine cloth, to exclude this powder. Some substances, as corrosive sublimate, arsenic, calces of lead, cantharides, euphorbium, &c. are so noxious, that all these precautions ought to be used, particularly when a large quantity is pounded.\n\nLarge mortars ought to be fixed upon a block of wood, so high, that the mortar shall be level with the middle of the operator. When the pellie is large and heavy, it ought to be suspended by a cord or chain fixed to a movable pole placed horizontally above the mortar: this pole considerably relieves the operator, because its elasticity assists the raising of the pellie.","sp":35,"ep":36},{"h":"MORTAR-PIECE","t":"in the military art, a short piece of ordnance, thick and wide, proper for throwing bombs, carcases, shells, stones, bags filled with grape-shot, &c. See GUNNERY, No. 50.\n\nLand Mortars, are those used in sieges, and of late in battles, mounted on beds made of solid timber, consisting generally of four pieces, those of the royal and cohorn excepted, which are but one single block; and both mortar and bed are transported on block-carriages. There is likewise a kind of land mortars, mounted on travelling carriages, invented by Count Buckeburg, which may be elevated to any degree; whereas ours are fixed to an angle of 45 degrees, and firmly lashed with ropes. The following table shows the weight of land mortars and shells; together with the quantity of powder the chambers hold when full; the weight of the shells, and powder for loading them.\n\n| Diameter of mortars | 13-inch | 10-inch | 8-inch | 5.8-inch royal | 4.6-inch cohorn |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|\n| Mortar's weight     | C. qr. lb. | C. qr. lb. | C. qr. lb. | C. qr. lb. | C. qr. lb. |\n| Shell's weight      | 25 0 10 | 2 18 4 | 0 20 1 | 1 0 3 |\n| Shell's cont. of powder | 1 2 15 0 | 2 25 0 | 1 15 0 | 0 12 0 | 7 |\n| Chamber's cont. of powder | 9 4 8 | 4 14 12 | 2 3 8 | 1 1 8 | 8 |\n\nSea Mortars, are those which are fixed in bomb vessels for bombarding places by sea: and as they are generally fired at a much greater distance than that which is required by land, they are made somewhat longer and much heavier than the land mortars. The following table exhibits the weight of the sea mortars and shells, and also of their full charges.\n\n| Nature of the mortar | Powder contained in the chamber when full | Weight of the mortar | Weight of the shell when fixed | Weight of powder contained in the shell |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 10-inch howitzer     | lb. oz. | C. qr. lb. | lb. | lb. oz. |\n| 13-inch mortar       | 12 0 | 31 2 26 | 198 | 7 0 |\n| 10-inch mortar       | 30 0 | 81 2 1 | 93 |\n\nTo Charge or Load a Mortar, the proper quantity of gunpowder is put into the chamber, and if there be any vacant space they fill it up with hay; some choose a wooden plug: over this they lay a turf, some a wooden tampion fitted to the bore of the piece; and lastly the bomb; taking care that the fuse be in the axis thereof, and the orifice be turned from the muzzle of the piece: what space remains is to be filled up with hay, straw, turf, &c. so as the load may not be exploded without the utmost violence.\nThe quantity of gunpowder to be used is found by dividing the weight of the bomb by 30; though this rule is not always to be strictly observed.\n\nWhen the proper quantity of powder necessary to charge a sea mortar is put into the chamber, it is covered with a wad well beat down with the rammer. After this the fixed shell is placed upon the wad, as near the middle of the mortar as possible, with the fuse hole uppermost, and another wad pressed down close upon it, so as to keep the shell firm in its position. The officer then points the mortar according to the proposed inclination.\u2014When the mortar is thus fixed, the fuse is opened; the priming iron is also thrust into the touch-hole of the mortar to clear it, after which it is primed with the finest powder. This done, two of the matroos or sailors, taking each one of the matches, the first lights the fuse, and the other fires the mortar. The bomb, thrown out by the explosion of the powder, is carried to the place intended: and the fuse, which ought to be exhausted at the instant of the shell's falling, inflames the powder contained in it, and bursts the shell in splinters; which, flying off circularly, occasion incredible mischief wherever they reach.\n\nIf the service of mortars should render it necessary to use pound shots, 200 of them with a wooden bottom are to be put into the 13 inch mortar, and a quantity of powder not exceeding 5 pounds; and 100 of the above shot with 2\u00bd pounds of powder, for the 10 inch mortar, or three pounds at most.\n\nTo Elevate the Mortar so as its axis may make any given angle with the horizon, they apply the artillery level or gunner's quadrant. An elevation of 70 or 80 degrees is what is commonly chosen for rendering mortars most serviceable in calling shells into towns, forts, &c., though the greatest range be at 45 degrees.\n\nAll the English mortars are fixed to an angle of 45 degrees, and lashed strongly with ropes at that elevation. Although in a siege there is only one case in which shells should be thrown with an angle of 45 degrees; that is, when the battery is so far off that they cannot otherwise reach the works; for when shells are thrown out of the trenches into the works of a fortification, or from the town into the trenches, they should have as little elevation as possible, in order to roll along, and not bury themselves; whereby the damage they do, and the terror they occasion, are much greater than if they sink into the ground. On the contrary, when shells are thrown upon magazines or any other buildings, with an intention to destroy them, the mortars should be elevated as high as possible, that the shells may acquire a greater force in their fall, and consequently do greater execution.\n\nIf all mortar pieces were, as they ought to be, exactly similar, and their requisites of powder as the cubes of the diameters of their several bores, and if their shells, bombs, carcasses, &c., were also similar; then, comparing like with like, their ranges on the plane of the horizon, under the same degree of elevation, would be equal; and consequently one piece being well proved, i.e., the range of the grenade, bomb, carcass, &c., being found to any degree of elevation, the whole work of the mortar piece would become very easy and exact.\n\nBut since mortars are not thus similar, it is required, that the range of the piece, at some known degree of elevation, be accurately found by measuring; and from hence all the other ranges may be determined.\n\nThus, to find the range of the piece at any other elevation required; say, As the fine of double the angle under which the experiment was made, is to the fine of double the angle proposed, so is the range known to the range required.\n\nSuppose, for instance, it be found, that the range of a piece, elevated to 30\u00b0, is 2000 yards; to find the range of the same piece with the same charge when elevated to 45\u00b0; take the fine of 60\u00b0, the double of 30\u00b0, and make it the first term of the rule of three; the second term must be the fine of 90\u00b0, the double of 45\u00b0, and the third the given range 2000; the fourth term will be 2310, the range of the piece at 45\u00b0. If the elevation be greater than 45\u00b0, instead of doubling it, take the fine of double its complement to 90\u00b0. As suppose the elevation of a piece be 50\u00b0, take the fine of 80\u00b0, the double of 40\u00b0. Again, if a determinate distance to which a shot is to be cast, be given, and the angle of elevation to produce that effect be required; the range known must be the first term in the rule of three, which suppose 2000 yards; the range proposed, which we suppose 1600 yards, the second term; and the fine of 60\u00b0 double of the elevation for the range of 2000 yards, the third term. The fourth term will be found the fine of 43\u00b0 52', whose half 21\u00b0 56' is the angle of elevation the piece must have to produce the desired effect. And if 21\u00b0 56' be taken from 90\u00b0, you will have 68\u00b0 4' for the other elevation of the piece, with which the same effect will likewise be produced.\n\nNote. To avoid the trouble of finding fines of double the angles of the proposed elevations, Galileo and Torricelli give us the following table, wherein the fines of the angles fought are had by inspection.\n\n| Degrees | Degrees | Ranges | Degrees | Degrees | Ranges |\n|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|--------|\n| 90      | 0       | 0      | 0       | 0       | 0      |\n| 89      | 1       | 349    | 66      | 24      | 7431   |\n| 88      | 2       | 698    | 65      | 25      | 7660   |\n| 87      | 3       | 1045   | 64      | 26      | 7880   |\n| 86      | 4       | 1392   | 63      | 27      | 8090   |\n| 85      | 5       | 1736   | 62      | 28      | 8290   |\n| 84      | 6       | 2709   | 61      | 29      | 8480   |\n| 83      | 7       | 2419   | 60      | 30      | 8660   |\n| 82      | 8       | 2536   | 59      | 31      | 8829   |\n| 81      | 9       | 3092   | 58      | 32      | 8988   |\n| 80      | 10      | 3420   | 57      | 33      | 9135   |\n| 79      | 11      | 3746   | 56      | 34      | 9272   |\n| 78      | 12      | 4067   | 55      | 35      | 9397   |\n| 77      | 13      | 4384   | 54      | 36      | 9511   |\n| 76      | 14      | 4695   | 53      | 37      | 9613   |\n| 75      | 15      | 5000   | 52      | 38      | 9723   |\n| 74      | 16      | 5299   | 51      | 39      | 9731   |\n| 73      | 17      | 5592   | 50      | 40      | 9841   |\n| 72      | 18      | 5870   | 49      | 41      | 9993   |\n| 71      | 19      | 6157   | 48      | 42      | 9945   |\n| 70      | 20      | 6428   | 47      | 43      | 9976   |\n| 69      | 21      | 6691   | 46      | 44      | 9994   |\n| 68      | 22      | 6947   | 45      | 45      | 10000  |\n| 67      | 23      | 7193   |        |         |        |\nMOR\n\nThe use of the table is obvious. Suppose, for instance, it be known by experiment, that a mortar elevated 15\u00b0 charged with three pounds of powder, will throw a bomb to the distance of 350 fathoms; and it be required, with the same charge, to throw a bomb 100 fathoms farther; seek in the table the number answering to 15 degrees, and you will find it 5000. Then as 350 is to 450, so is 5000 to a fourth number, which is 6428. Find this number, or the nearest to it, in the table, and against it you will find 20\u00b0 or 70\u00b0; the proper angles of elevation.","sp":36,"ep":38},{"h":"MORTGAGE","t":"in Law, (mortuum vadium, or dead pledge), is where a man borrows of another a specific sum (e.g. 200l.), and grants him an estate in fee, on condition that if he, the mortgager, shall pay the mortgagee the said sum of 200l. on a certain day mentioned in the deed, that then the mortgagee may re-enter on the estate so granted in pledge; or, as is now the more usual way, that the mortgagee shall re-convey the estate to the mortgager: in this case the land which is so put in pledge, is by law, in case of nonpayment, at the time limited, for ever dead and gone from the mortgager; and the mortgagee's estate in the lands, is then no longer conditional, but absolute. But so long as it continues conditional, that is, between the time of lending the money and the time allotted for payment, the mortgagee is called tenant in mortgage. But as it was formerly a doubt, whether, by taking such estate in fee, it did not become liable to the wife's dower, and other encumbrances of the mortgage (though that doubt has been long ago overruled by our courts of equity), it therefore became usual to grant only a long term of years, by way of mortgage; with condition to be void on repayment of the mortgage money: which course has been since continued, principally because on the death of the mortgagee such term becomes vested in his personal representatives, who only are entitled in equity to receive the money lent, of whatever nature the mortgage may happen to be.\n\nAs soon as the estate is created, the mortgagee may immediately enter on the lands; but is liable to be dispossessed, upon performance of the condition by payment of the mortgage money at the day limited. And therefore the usual way is to agree that the mortgager shall hold the land till the day assigned for payment: when, in case of failure, whereby the estate becomes absolute, the mortgager may enter upon it, and take possession, without any possibility of being afterwards evicted by the mortgager, to whom the land is now for ever dead. But here again the courts of equity interpose; and though a mortgage be thus forfeited, and the estate absolutely vested in the mortgagee at the common law, yet they will consider the real value of the tenements compared with the sum borrowed. And if the estate be of greater value than the sum lent thereon, they will allow the mortgager at any reasonable time to recall or redeem his estate; paying to the mortgagee his principal, interest, and expenses: for otherwise, in strictness of law, an estate worth 100l. might be forfeited for non-payment of 100l. or a less sum. This reasonable advantage, allowed to mortgagees, is called the equity of redemption; and this enables a mortgager to call on the mortgagee, who has possession of his estate, to deliver it back, and account for the rents and profits received on payment of his whole debt and interest, thereby turning the mortuum into a kind of vivum vadium; (see VADUM). But, on the other hand, the mortgagee may either compel the sale of the estate, in order to get the whole of his money immediately; or else call upon the mortgager to redeem his estate presently, or, in default thereof, to be for ever foreclosed from redeeming the same; that is, to lose his equity of redemption without possibility of recall. And also, in some cases of fraudulent mortgages, the fraudulent mortgager forfeits all equity of redemption whatsoever. It is not, however, usual for mortgagees to take possession of the mortgaged estate, unless where the security is precarious, or small; or where the mortgager neglects even the payment of interest: when the mortgagee is frequently obliged to bring an ejectment, and take the land into his own hands, in the nature of a pledge, or the pignus of the Roman law: whereas, while it remains in the hands of the mortgager, it more resembles their hypotheca, which was where the possession of the thing pledged remained with the debtor. But by statute Geo. II. c. 20, after payment or tender by the mortgager of principal, interest, and costs, the mortgagee can maintain no ejectment; but may be compelled to re-assign his securities. In Glanvil's time, when the universal method of conveyance was by livery of seizin or corporal tradition of the lands, no gage or pledge of lands was good unless possession was also delivered to the creditor; si non sequatur ijtius vadii traditio, curia domini regis hujusmodi privatae convenienses tueri non solet: for which the reason given is, to prevent subsequent and fraudulent pledges of the same land; cum in tali cafo posset eadem res plurius aliis creditoribus tum pruis tum posterius invadari. And the frauds which have arisen, since the exchange of these public and notorious conveyances for more private and secret bargains, have well evinced the wisdom of our ancient law.","sp":38,"ep":38},{"h":"MORTIER","t":"an ensign of dignity, which was borne by the chancellor and grand presidents of the parliament of France.

Yet in consequence of these it was always, and is still necessary, for corporations to have a license of mortmain from the crown, to enable them to purchase lands: for as the king is the ultimate lord of every fee, he ought not, unless by his own consent, to lose his privilege of escheats and other feudal profits, by the vesting of lands in tenants that can never be attainted or die. And such licenses of mortmain seem to have been necessary among the Saxons above 60 years before the Norman conquest. But, besides this general license from the king as lord paramount of the kingdom, it was also requisite, whenever there was a mesne or intermediate lord between the king and the alienor, to obtain his license also (upon the same feudal principles) for the alienation of the specific land. And if no such license was obtained, the king or other lord might respectively enter on the lands so alienated in mortmain, as a forfeiture. The necessity of this license from the crown was acknowledged by the Constitutions of Clarendon, in respect of advowsons, which the monks always greatly coveted, as being the groundwork of subsequent appropriations. Yet such were the influence and ingenuity of the clergy, that notwithstanding this fundamental principle, we find that the largest and most considerable donations of religious houses happened within less than two centuries after the Conquest. And (when a license could not be obtained) their contrivance seems to have been this: That as the forfeiture for such alienations accrued in the first place to the immediate lord of the fee, the tenant who meant to alienate first conveyed his lands to the religious house, and instantly took them back again to hold as tenant to the monastery; which kind of instantaneous seizin was probably held not to occasion any forfeiture: and then, by pretext of some other forfeiture, surrender, or escheat, the society entered into those lands in right of such their newly acquired dignities, as immediate lords of the fee. But when these donations began to grow numerous, it was observed that the feudal services, ordained for the defense of the kingdom, were every day visibly withdrawn; that the circulation of landed property from man to man began to stagnate; and that the lords were curtailed of the fruits of their dignities, their escheats, wardships, reliefs, and the like: and therefore, in order to prevent this, it was ordained by the second of King Henry's III.'s great charters, and afterwards by that printed in our common statute books, that all such attempts should be void, and the land forfeited to the lord of the fee.\n\nBut as this prohibition extended only to religious houses, bishops and other sole corporations were not included therein; and the aggregate ecclesiastical bodies (who, Sir Edward Coke observes, in this were to be commended, that they ever had of their counsel the best learned men that they could get) found many means to creep out of this statute, by buying in lands that were bona fide holden of themselves as lords of the fee, and thereby evading the forfeiture; or by taking long leases for years, which first introduced those extensive Mortmain terms, for a thousand or more years, which are now so frequent in conveyances. This produced the statute de religiosis, 7 Edw. I.; which provided, that no person, religious or other whatsoever, should buy, or sell, or receive under pretence of a gift, or term of years, or any other title whatsoever, nor should by any art or ingenuity appropriate to himself, any lands or tenements in mortmain; upon pain that the immediate lord of the fee, or, on his default for one year, the lords paramount, and in default of all of them, the king, might enter thereon as a forfeiture.\n\nThis seemed to be a sufficient security against all alienations in mortmain: but as these statutes extended only to gifts and conveyances between the parties, the religious houses now began to set up a fictitious title to the land, which it was intended they should have, and to bring an action to recover it against the tenant; who, by fraud and collusion, made no defence, and thereby judgement was given for the religious house, which then recovered the land by a sentence of law upon a supposed prior title. And thus they had the honour of inventing those fictitious adjudications of right, which are since become the great assurance of the kingdom, under the name of common recoveries. But upon this the statute of Westminster the second, 13 Edw. I. c. 32. enacted, that in such cases a jury shall try the true right of the demandants or plaintiffs to the land; and if the religious house or corporation be found to have it, they shall still recover seizin; otherwise it shall be forfeited to the immediate lord of the fee, or else to the next lord, and finally to the king, upon the immediate or other lord's default. And the like provision was made by the succeeding chapter, in case the tenants set up crofts upon their lands (the badges of knights templars and hospitallers) in order to protect them from the feudal demands of their lords, by virtue of the privileges of those religious and military orders. And so careful was this provident prince to prevent any future evasions, that when the statute of quia emptores, 18 Edw. I. abolished all sub-infeudations, and gave liberty for all men to alienate their lands to be holden of their next immediate lord, a proviso was inserted that this should not extend to authorize any kind of alienation in mortmain. And when afterwards the method of obtaining the king's license by writ of ad quod damnum was marked out by the statute 27 Edward I. st. 2. it was farther provided by statute 34 Edward I. st. 3. that no such license should be effectual without the consent of the mesne or intermediate lords.\n\nYet still it was found difficult to set bounds to ecclesiastical ingenuity: for when they were driven out of all their former holds, they devised a new method of conveyance, by which the lands were granted, not to themselves directly, but to nominal feoffees to the use of the religious houses; thus distinguishing between the possession and the use, and receiving the actual profits, while the seizin of the land remained in the nominal feoffee; who was held by the courts of equity (then under the direction of the clergy) to be bound in conscience to account to his feoffee for the rents and emoluments of the estate. And it is to these inventions that our practisers are indebted for the introduction of uses and truils, the founda-\nMortmain. tion of modern conveyancing. But, unfortunately for the inventors themselves, they did not long enjoy the advantage of their new device; for the statute 15 Richard II. c. 5, enacts, that the lands which had been purchased to ules should be admortised by license from the crown, or else be sold to private persons; and that, for the future, ules shall be subject to the statutes of mortmain, and forfeitable like the lands themselves. And whereas the statutes had been eluded by purchasing large tracts of land adjoining to churches, and consecrating them by the name of churchyards, such subtile imagination is also declared to be within the compass of the statutes of mortmain. And civil or lay corporations, as well as ecclesiastical, are also declared to be within the mischief, and of course within the remedy provided by those salutary laws. And lastly, As during the times of popery lands were frequently given to superstitious ules, though not to any corporate bodies; or were made liable in the hands of heirs and devisees to the charge of obits, chantries, and the like, which were equally pernicious in a well-governed state as actual alienations in mortmain; therefore at the dawn of the Reformation, the statute 23 Hen. VIII. c. 10, declares, that all future grants of lands for any of the purposes aforesaid, if granted for any longer term than 20 years, shall be void.\n\nBut, during all this time, it was in the power of the crown, by granting a license of mortmain, to remit the forfeiture, so far as related to its own rights; and to enable any spiritual or other corporation to purchase and hold any lands or tenements in perpetuity: which prerogative is declared and confirmed by the statute 18 Edw. III. st. 3, c. 3. But as doubts were conceived at the time of the Revolution how far such license was valid, since the king had no power to dispense with the statutes of mortmain by a clause of non obstante, which was the usual course, though it seems to have been unnecessary; and as, by the gradual declension of myne signories through the long operation of the statute of quia emptores, the rights of intermediate lords were reduced to a very small compass; it was therefore provided by the statute 7 & 8 W. III. c. 37, that the crown for the future at its own discretion may grant licenses to alienate or take in mortmain, of whomsoever the tenements may be holden.\n\nAfter the dissolution of monasteries under Hen. VIII., though the policy of the next popish successor affected to grant a security to the possessors of abbey lands, yet, in order to regain so much of them as either the zeal or timidity of their owners might induce them to part with, the statutes of mortmain were suspended for 20 years by the statute 1 & 2 P. & M. c. 8. and during that time any lands or tenements were allowed to be granted to any spiritual corporation without any license whatsoever. And long afterwards, for a much better purpose, the augmentation of poor livings, it was enacted by the statute 17 Car. II. c. 3, that appropriators may annex the great tithes to the vicarages, and that all benefices under 100l. per annum may be augmented by the purchase of lands, without license of mortmain in either case; and the like provision hath been since made in favour of the governors of Queen Anne's bounty. It hath also been held, that the statute 13 Hen. VIII. before-mentioned, did not extend to anything but superstitious ules; and that therefore a man may give lands for the maintenance of a school, hospital, or any other charitable uses. But as it was apprehended from recent experience, that persons on their deathbeds might make large and improvident dispositions even for these good purposes, and defeat the political ends of the statutes of mortmain; it is therefore enacted by the statute 9 Geo. II. c. 36, that no lands or tenements, or money to be laid out thereon, shall be given for or charged with any charitable uses whatsoever, unless by deed indented, executed in the presence of two witnesses 12 kalender months before the death of the donor, and enrolled in the court of chancery within six months after its execution (except flocks in the public funds, which may be transferred within six months previous to the donor's death), and unless such gift be made to take effect immediately, and be without power of revocation; and that all other gifts shall be void. The two universities, their colleges, and their scholars upon the foundation of the colleges of Eton, Winchester, and Westminster, are excepted out of this act: but such exemption was granted with this proviso, that no college shall be at liberty to purchase more advowsons than are equal in number to one moiety of the fellows or students upon the respective foundations.","sp":38,"ep":40},{"h":"MORTUARY","t":"in Law, is a sort of ecclesiastical heriot*, being a customary gift claimed by and due to* See the minister in very many parishes on the death of his Heriot. parishioners. They seem originally to have been only a voluntary bequest to the church; being intended, as Lyndewode informs us from a constitution of Archbishop Langham, as a kind of expiation and amends to the clergy for the personal tithes, and other ecclesiastical duties, which the laity in their life time might have neglected or forgotten to pay. For this purpose, after the lord's heriot or bell good was taken out, the second bell chattel was delivered to the church as a mortuary. And therefore in the laws of King Canute, this mortuary is called soul-foot, or symbolum animae. And, in pursuance of the same principle, by the laws of Venice, where no personal tithes have been paid during the life of the party, they are paid at his death out of his merchandise, jewels, and other moveables. So also, by a similar policy in France, every man that died without bequeathing a part of his estate to the church, which was called dying without confession, was formerly deprived of Christian burial; or, if he died intestate, the relations of the deceased, jointly with the bishop, named proper arbitrators to determine what he ought to have given to the church, in case he had made a will. But the parliament, in 1409, redressed this grievance.\n\nIt was anciently usual in England to bring the mortuary to church along with the corpse when it came to be buried; and thence it is sometimes called a corpse present: a term which bespeaks it to have been once a voluntary donation. However, in Bradon's time, so early as Henry III. we find it riveted into an established custom; inasmuch that the bequests of heriots and mortuaries were held to be necessary ingredients in every testament of chattels. Imprimis autem debet qui liber, qui testamentum fecerit, dominum suum de meliori re quam habuerit recognoscere; et poena eclefsiam de alia meliore: the lord must have the best good left him as a heriot; and the church the second best as a mortuary.\nMOR\n\nBut yet this custom was different in different places: in quibusdam locis habet ecclesia melius animal de confuetudine; in quibusdam fecundum, vel tertium melius; et in quibusdam nihil: et idem conferenda est confuetudo loci. This custom still varies in different places, not only as to the mortuary to be paid, but the person to whom it is payable. In Wales a mortuary or corpse-present was due upon the death of every clergyman to the bishop of the diocese; till abolished, upon a recompence given to the bishop, by the statute, 12 Ann. st. 2. c. 6. And in the archdeaconry of Chester a custom also prevailed, that the bishop, who is also archdeacon, should have, at the death of every clergyman dying therein, his belt horse or mare, bridle, saddle, and fours; his belt gown or cloak, hat, upper garment under his gown, and tippet, and also his belt signet or ring. But by statute 28 Geo. II. c. 6. this mortuary is directed to cease, and the act has settled upon the bishop an equivalent in its room. The king's claim to many goods, on the death of all prelates in England, seems to be of the same nature; though Sir Edward Coke apprehends, that this is a duty upon death, and not a mortuary: a distinction which seems to be without a difference. For not only the king's ecclesiastical character, as supreme ordinary, but also the species of the good claimed, which bear so near a resemblance to those in the archdeaconry of Chester, which was an acknowledged mortuary, puts the matter out of dispute. The king, according to the record vouched by Sir Edward Coke, is entitled to fix things; the bishop's belt horse or palfrey, with his furniture; his cloak or gown, and tippet; his cup and cover; his basin and ewer; his gold ring; and lastly, his muta comm, his mew or kennel of hounds.\n\nThis variety of customs with regard to mortuaries, giving frequently a handle to exactions on the one side, and frauds or expensive litigations on the other, it was thought proper by statute 21 Henry VIII. c. 6. to reduce them to some kind of certainty. For this purpose it is enacted, that all mortuaries, or corpse-presents to parsons of any parish, shall be taken in the following manner, unless where by custom less or none at all is due; viz. for every person who does not leave goods to the value of ten marks, nothing; for every person who leaves goods to the value of ten marks and under thirty pounds, 3s. 4d.; if above thirty pounds, and under forty pounds, 6s. 8d.; if above forty pounds, of what value ever they may be, 10s. and no more. And no mortuary shall throughout the kingdom be paid for the death of any feme-covert; nor for any child; nor for any one of full age, that is not a housekeeper; nor for any wayfaring man; but such wayfaring man's mortuary shall be paid in the parish to which he belongs. And upon this statute stands the law of mortuaries to this day.","sp":40,"ep":41},{"h":"MORUS","t":"the MULBERRY TREE, a genus of plants belonging to the monoecia clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 53rd order, Scabridae.

The critics are divided as to the origin and reason of the name. Some derive it\nMosaic, it from mosaicum, a corruption of musaicum, as that is of musium, as it was called among the Romans. Scaliger derives it from the Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, and imagines the name was given to this sort of work as being very fine and ingenious. Nebriciensis is of opinion it was so called, because ex illis picturis ornabantur mufca.\n\n1. Method of performing mosaic work of glass is this: They provide little pieces of glass, of as many different colours and sizes as possible.\n\nNow, in order to apply these several pieces, and out of them to form a picture, they in the first place procure a cartoon or design to be drawn; this is transferred to the ground or plaster by chalking as in painting in fresco. See Fresco.\n\nAs this plaster is to be laid thick on the wall, and therefore will continue fresh and soft a considerable time, so there may be enough prepared at once to serve for as much work as will take up three or four days.\n\nThis plaster is composed of lime made of hard stone, with brick dust very fine, gum tragacanth, and whites of eggs; when this plaster has been thus prepared and laid on the wall, and made the design of what is to be represented, they take out the little pieces of glass with a pair of pliers, and range them one after another, still keeping strictly to the light, shadow, different tints, and colours represented in the design before; pressing or flattening them down with a ruler, which serves both to link them within the ground and to render the surface even.\n\nThus, in a long time, and with a great deal of labour, they finish the work, which is still the more beautiful, as the pieces of glass are more uniform, and ranged at an even height.\n\nSome of these pieces of mosaic work are performed with that exactness, that they appear as smooth as a table of marble, and as finished and masterly as a painting in fresco; with this advantage, that they have a fine lustre, and will last ages.\n\nThe finest works of this kind that have remained till our time, and those by whom the moderns have retrieved the art, which was in a manner lost, are those in the church of St Agnes, formerly the temple of Bacchus, at Rome; and some at Pisa, Florence, and other cities of Italy. The most esteemed among the works of the moderns are those of Joseph Pine and the Chevalier Lanfranc, in the church of St Peter at Rome; there are also very good ones at Venice.\n\n2. The method of performing mosaic work of marble is this: The ground of mosaic works, wholly marble, is usually a mastic marble, either white or black. On this ground the design is cut with a chisel, after it has been first chalked. After it has been cut of a considerable depth, i.e., an inch or more, the cavities are filled up with marble of a proper colour, first fashioned according to the design, and reduced to the thickness of the indentures with various instruments. To make the piece thus inserted into the indentures cleave fast, whose several colours are to imitate those of the design, they use a flucco, composed of lime and marble dust; or a kind of mastic, which is prepared by each workman, after a different manner peculiar to himself. The figures being marked out, the painter or sculptor himself draws with a pencil the colours of the figures not determined by the ground, and in the same manner makes strokes or hatchings in the place where shadows are to be; and after he has engraven with the chisel all the strokes thus drawn, he fills them up with a black mastic, composed partly of Burgundy pitch poured on hot; taking off afterwards what is superfluous with a piece of felt stone or brick, which, together with water and beaten cement, takes away the mastic, polishes the marble, and renders the whole so even that one would imagine it only consisted of one piece. This is the kind of mosaic work that is seen in the pompous church of the invalids at Paris, and the fine chapel at Versailles, with which some entire apartments of that palace are incrustated.\n\n3. As for mosaic work of precious stones, other and finer instruments are required than those used in marble; as drills, wheels, &c., used by lapidaries and engravers on stone. As none but the richest marbles and stones enter this work, to make them go farther, they are sawn into the thinnest leaves imaginable, scarcely exceeding half a line in thickness; the block to be sawn is fastened firmly with cords on the bench, and only raised a little on a piece of wood, one or two inches high. Two iron pins, which are on one side the block, and which serve to fasten it, are put into a vice contrived for the purpose; and with a kind of saw or bow, made of fine brass wire, bent on a piece of spongy wood, together with emery steeped in water, the leaf is gradually fashioned by following the stroke of the design made on paper, and glued on the piece. When there are pieces enough fastened to form an entire flower, or some other part of the design, they are applied to the ground.\n\nThe ground which supports this mosaic work is usually of freestone. The matter with which the stones are joined together is a mastic, or kind of flucco, laid very thin on the leaves as they are fashioned; and this being done, the leaves are applied with pliers.\n\nIf any contour, or side of a leaf, be not either squared or rounded sufficiently, so as to fit the place exactly into which it is to be inserted, when it is too large, it is to be brought down with a brass file or rasp; and if it be too little, it is managed with a drill and other instruments used by lapidaries.\n\nMosaic work of marble is used in large works, as in pavements of churches, basilicas, and palaces; and in the incrustation and veneering of the walls of the same edifices.\n\nAs for that of precious stones, it is only used in small works, as ornaments for altar pieces, tables for rich cabinets, precious stones being so very dear.\n\n4. Manner of performing mosaic work of gypsum. Of this stone calcined in a kiln, beaten in a mortar, and sifted, the French workmen make a sort of artificial marbles, imitating precious stones; and of these they compose a kind of mosaic work, which does not come far short either of the durableness or the vivacity of the natural stones; and which besides has this advantage, that it admits of continued pieces or paintings of entire compartments without any visible joining.\n\nSome make the ground of plaster of Paris, others of freestone. If it be of plaster of Paris, they spread it in a wooden frame, of the length and breadth of the work intended, and in thickness about an inch and a half. This frame is so contrived, that the tenons being\nonly joined to the mortifies by single pins, they may be taken afunder, and the frame be difmounted when the plaster is dry. The frame is covered on one side with a strong linen cloth, nailed all round; which being placed horizontally with the linen at the bottom, is filled with plaster passed through a wide sieve. When the plaster is half dry, the frame is set up perpendicularly, and left till it is quite dry; then it is taken out, by taking the frame to pieces.\n\nIn this mosaic, the ground is the most important part. Now in order to the preparation of this fitted gypsum, which is to be applied on this ground, it is dissolved and boiled in the best English glue, and mixed with the colour that it is to be of; then the whole is worked up together into the usual consistence of plaster, and then is taken and spread on the ground five or six inches thick. If the work be such, as that mouldings are required, they are formed with gouges and other instruments.\n\nIt is on this plaster, thus coloured like marble or precious stone, and which is to serve as a ground to a work, either of lapis, agate, alabaster, or the like, that the design to be represented is drawn: having been first pounced or chalked. To hollow or impress the design, they use the same instruments that sculptors do; the ground whereon they are to work not being much less hard than the marble itself. The cavities being thus made in the ground, are filled with the same gypsum boiled in glue, only differently coloured, and thus are the different colours of the original represented. In order that the necessary colours and teints may be ready at hand, the quantities of the gypsum are tempered with the several colours in pots. After the design has been thus filled and rendered visible, by half polishing it with brick and soft stone, they go over it again, cutting such plates as are either to be weaker or more shadowed, and filling them with gypsum, which work they repeat till all the colours being added one after the other, represent the original to the life. When the work is finished, they scour it with soft stone, sand, and water; after that with a pumice stone; and in the last place polish it with a wooden mullet and emery. Lastly, They give it a lustre, by smearing it over with oil, and rubbing it a long time with the palm of the hand, which gives it a lustre nowise inferior to that of natural marble.\n\n5. In Clavigero's history of Mexico is described a curious kind of mosaic work, made by the ancient Mexicans of the most delicate and beautiful feathers of birds. They raised for this purpose various species of birds of fine plumage with which that country abounds, not only in the palaces of the king, where there were all sorts of animals, but likewise in private houses; and at certain seasons they carried off their feathers to make use of them on this kind of work, or to sell them at market. They set a high value on the feathers of those wonderful little birds which they call Huiztizilin, and the Spaniards Picaflores; on account of the smallness, the fineness, and the various colours of them. In these and other beautiful birds, nature supplied them with all the colours which art can produce, and also some which art cannot imitate. At the undertaking of every mosaic work several artists assembled; After having agreed upon a design, and taken their measures and proportions, each artist charged himself with the execution of a certain part of the image, and exerted himself so diligently in it, with such patience and application, that he frequently spent a whole day in adjusting a feather; first trying one, then another, viewing it sometimes one way, then another, until he found one which gave his part that ideal perfection proposed to be attained. When the part which each artist undertook was done, they assembled again to form the entire image from them.\u2014If any part was accidentally the least deranged, it was wrought again until it was perfectly finished. They laid hold of the feathers with small pinchers, that they might not do them the least injury, and pasted them on the cloth with isabella, or some other glutinous matter; then they united all the parts upon a little table, or a plate of copper, and flattened them softly until they left the surface of the image so equal and smooth that it appeared to be the work of a pencil.\n\nThese were the images so much celebrated by the Spaniards and other European nations. Whoever beheld them was at a loss whether he ought to have praised most the life and beauty of the natural colours, or the dexterity of the artist and the ingenious disposition of art. \"These images (says Acosta) are deservedly admired; for it is wonderful how it was possible, with the feathers of birds, to execute works so fine and so equal, that they appear the performance of the pencil; and, what neither the pencil nor the colours in painting can effect, they have, when viewed from a side, an appearance so beautiful, so lively, and animated, that they give delight to the sight. Some Indians, who are able artists, copy whatever is painted with a pencil so perfectly with plumage, that they rival the best painters of Spain.\" These works of feathers were even so highly esteemed by the Mexicans as to be valued more than gold. Cortes, Bernal Diaz, Gomara, Torquemada, and all the other historians who saw them, were at a loss for expressions sufficient to praise their perfection. Several works of this kind, our author says, are still preserved in the museums of Europe, and many in Mexico; but few, he apprehends, belong to the sixteenth century, and still fewer, if any, are of those made before the conquest. The mosaic works also which the Mexicans made of broken shells were extremely curious: this art is still practised in Guatemala.","sp":44,"ep":46},{"h":"MOSAIC LAW","t":"or the Law of Moses, is the most Wilson's ancient that we know of in the world, and is of three kinds; the moral law, the ceremonial law, and the Dict. judicial law.

As to the judicial law, it was neither so publicly nor so audibly given as the moral law, nor yet so privately as the ceremonial; this kind of law being of an indifferent nature, to be observed or not observed, as its rites suit with the place and government under which we live. The five books of Moses called the Pentateuch, are frequently styled, by way of emphasis the Law. This was held by the Jews in such veneration, that they would not allow it to be laid upon the bed of any sick person, lest it should be polluted by touching the dead.\n\nA TABLE of HARMONY of the MOSAIC LAW, digested into proper HEADS, with REFERENCES to the several Parts of the PENTATEUCH where the respective Laws occur.\n\n| Class I.

It was from this duchy that the czars of old took the title of dukes of Muscovy. The province is bounded on the north by the duchies of Tver, Rostow, Sudal, and Wodoliner; on the south by Rezan, from which it is separated by the river Occa; on the east by the principality of Cachine, and the same river Occa parting it from Nizh-Novgorod; and on the west by the duchies of Rezva, Bielar and Smolensko. It extends about 200 miles in length, and about 150 in breadth; and is watered by the Moskva, Occa, and Clema, which fall into the Wolga: nevertheless, the soil is not very fertile. The air, however, though sharp, is salubrious; and this consideration, with the advantage of its being situated in the midst of the best provinces in the empire, induced the czars to make it their chief residence. In the western part of Moscow is a large forest, from whence flows the celebrated river Dnieper, or Borysthenes, which, traversing the duchy of Smoleniko, winds in a serpentine course to Ukraine, Lithuania, and Poland.\n\nMoscow, the capital of the above province, and till the beginning of the present century the metropolis of all Russia, is situated in a spacious plain on the banks of the river Moskva. E. Long. 37\u00b0 31'. N. Lat. 55\u00b0 45'. The Russian antiquaries differ considerably in their opinions concerning the first foundation of Moscow; the following relation, Mr Coxe says, is generally esteemed by the best authors the most probable account.\n\nKiof was the metropolis, when George son of Vladimir Monomaka ascended in 1154 the Russian throne. That monarch, being insulted in a progress through his dominions by a rich and powerful nobleman named Stephen Kutchko, put him to death, and confiscated his domains, which consisted of the lands now occupied by the city of Moscow and the adjacent territory. Pleased with the situation of the ground lying at the confluence of the Moskva and Neglina, he laid the foundation of a new town, which he called Moskva from the river of that name. Upon the demise of George, the new town was not neglected by his son Andrew, who transferred the seat of empire from Kiof to Vladimir; but it fell into such decay under his immediate successors, that when Daniel, son of Alexander Nevski, received, in the division of the empire, the duchy of Muscovy as his portion, and fixed his residence upon the confluence of the Moskva and Neglina, he may be said to have newly founded the town. The spot now occupied by the Kremlin was at that time overgrown with a thick wood and a morass, in the midst whereof was a small island containing a single wooden hut. Upon this part Daniel constructed churches and monasteries, and various buildings, and enclosed it with wooden fortifications; he first assumed the title of duke of Moscow; and was so attached to this situation, that when in 1304 he succeeded his brother Andrew Alexandrovich in the great duchy of Vladimir, he did not remove his court to Vladimir, but continued his residence at Moscow, which then became the capital of the Russian dominions. His successors followed his example; among whom his son Ivan considerably enlarged the new metropolis, and in 1367 his grandson Demetrius Ivanovitch Doniski surrounded the Kremlin with a brick wall. These new fortifications, however, were not strong enough to prevent Tamerlane in 1382, from taking the town after a short siege. Being soon evacuated by that desultory conqueror, it again came into the possession of the Russians; but was frequently invaded and occupied by the Tartars, who in the 14th and 15th centuries overran the greatest part of Russia, and who even maintained a garrison in Moscow until they were finally expelled by Ivan Vasilievitch I. To him Moscow is indebted for its principal splendour, and under him it became the principal and most considerable city of the Russian empire.\n\nMoscow continued the metropolis of Russia until the beginning of the 18th century, when, to the great dissatisfaction of the nobility, but with great advantage probably to the state, the seat of empire was transferred to Peterburgh.\n\nNotwithstanding the predilection which Peter conceived for Peterburgh, in which all the succeeding sovereigns excepting Peter the II. have fixed their residence, Moscow, according to Mr Coxe, is still the most populous city of the Russian empire. Here the chief nobles who do not belong to the court reside; they here support a larger number of retainers; they love to gratify their taste for a ruder and more expensive magnificence in the ancient style of feudal grandeur; and are not, as at Peterburgh, eclipsed by the superior splendour of the court.\nMoscow is represented as the largest town in Europe; its circumference within the rampart, which encloses the suburbs, being exactly 39 versts or 26 miles; but it is built in so straggling and disjointed a manner, that its population in no degree corresponds to its extent. Some Russian authors state its inhabitants at 500,000 souls, a number evidently exaggerated. According to a computation, which Mr Coxe says may be depended upon, Moscow contains within the ramparts 250,000 souls, and in the adjacent villages 50,000. The streets of Moscow are in general exceedingly long and broad; some of them are paved; others, particularly those in the suburbs, are formed with trunks of trees, or are boarded with planks like the floor of a room; wretched hovels are blended with large palaces; cottages of one story stand next to the most superb and statelily mansions. Many brick structures are covered with wooden tops; some of the wooden houses are painted; others have iron doors and roofs. Numerous churches present themselves in every quarter, built in a peculiar style of architecture; some with domes of copper, others of tin, gilt or painted green, and many roofed with wood. In a word, some parts of this vast city have the look of a sequestered desert, other quarters of a populous town; some of a contemptible village, others of a great capital.\n\nMoscow may be considered as a town built upon the Asiatic model, but gradually becoming more and more European, and exhibiting in its present state a motley mixture of discordant architecture. It is distributed into the following divisions. 1. The Kremlin. This stands in the central and highest part of the city; is of a triangular form, and about two miles in circumference; and is surrounded by high walls of stone and brick; which were constructed in the year 1491, under the reign of Ivan Vasilievitch I. It contains the ancient palace of the czars, several churches, two convents, the patriarchal palace, the arsenal now in ruins, and one private house, which belonged to Boris Godunof before he was raised to the throne. 2. Kitaigorod, or the Chinese town, is enclosed on one side by that wall of the Kremlin which runs from the Moskva to the Neglina; and on the other side by a brick wall of inferior height. It is much larger than the Kremlin, and contains the university, the printing-house and many other public buildings, and all the tradesmen's shops. The edifices are mostly fluecoed or white washed, and it has only street in Moscow in which the houses stand close to one another without any intervals between them. 3. The Bielgorod, or White Town, which runs quite round the two preceding divisions, is supposed to derive its name from a white wall with which it was formerly enclosed, and of which some remains are still to be seen. 4. Semlinogorod, which environs all the three other quarters, takes its denomination from a circular rampart of earth with which it is encompassed. These two last mentioned divisions exhibit a grotesque group of churches, convents, palaces, brick and wooden houses, and mean hovels, in no degree superior to peasants cottages. 5. The Sloboda, or suburbs, form a vast exterior circle round all the parts already described, and are invested with a low rampart and ditch. These suburbs contain, beside buildings of all kinds and denominations, corn fields, much open pasture, and some small lakes, which give rise to the Moscow. The river Moikva, from which the city takes its name, flows through it in a winding channel; but excepting in spring is only navigable for rafts. It receives the Yauka in the Semlino gorod, and the Neglina at the western extremity of the Kremlin; the beds of both these last mentioned rivulets are in summer little better than dry channels.\n\nThe places of divine worship at Moscow are exceedingly numerous; including chapels, they amount to above 1000; there are 484 public churches, of which 199 are of brick; and the others of wood; the former are commonly fluecoed or white washed, the latter painted of a red colour. The most ancient churches of Moscow are generally square buildings, with a cupola and four small domes, some whereof are of copper or iron gilt; others of tin, either plain or painted green. These cupolas and domes are for the most part ornamented with crosses entwined with thin chains or wires. The church of the Holy Trinity, sometimes called the church of Jerusalem, which stands in the Kitaigorod, close to the gate leading into the Kremlin, has a kind of high steeple and nine or ten domes; it was built in the reign of Ivan Vasilievitch II. The inside of the churches is mostly composed of three parts; that called by the Greeks oikonomos, by the Russians trapeza; the body; and the sanctuary or shrine. Over the door of each church is the portrait of the saint to whom it is dedicated, to which the common people pay their homage as they pass along, by taking off their hats, crossing themselves, and occasionally touching the ground with their heads. The bells, which form an inconsiderable part of public worship in this country, as the length or shortness of their peals affects the greater or lesser sanctity of the day, are hung in bellfrys detached from the church; they do not swing like our bells; but are fixed immovably to the beams, and are rung by a rope tied to the clapper and pulled sidewise. Some of these bells are of a stupendous size; one in the tower of St Ivan's church weighs 3551 Russian poods, or 127,836 English pounds. It has always been esteemed a meritorious act of religion to present a church with bells; and the piety of the donor has been measured by their magnitude. According to this mode of estimation, Boris Godunof, who gave a bell of 288,000 pounds to the cathedral of Moscow, was the most pious sovereign of Russia, until he was surpassed by the empress Anne, at whose expense a bell was cast weighing 432,000 pounds, and which exceeded in bigness every bell in the known world. The height of this enormous bell is 19 feet, its circumference at the bottom 21 yards 11 inches; its greatest thickness 23 inches. The beam to which this vast machine was fastened being accidentally burnt, the bell fell down, and a fragment was broken off towards the bottom, which left an aperture large enough to admit two persons abreast without stooping.\n\nThe palace, inhabited by the ancient czars, stands at the extremity of the Kremlin. Part of this palace is old, and remains in the same state in which it was built under Ivan Vasilievitch I. The remainder has been successively added at different intervals, without any plan, and in various styles of architecture, which has produced a motley pile of building, remarkable for nothing but the incongruity of the several structures. The top is thickly set with numerous little gilded spires and globes; and a large portion of the front is decorated with the arms of\nof all the provinces which compose the Russian empire.\n\nThe apartments are in general exceedingly small, excepting one single room called the council chamber, in which the ancient czars used to give audience to foreign ambassadors, and which has been repeatedly described by several English travellers who visited Moscow before the imperial residence was transferred to Peterburgh. The room is large and vaulted, and has in the centre an enormous pillar of stone which supports the ceiling. In this palace Peter the Great came into the world, in the year 1672. In that part called the treasury are deposited the crown, jewels, and royal robes, used at the coronation of the sovereigns, besides several curiosities relative to the history of the country. Of the great number of churches contained in this city, two in particular, namely, that of St Michael and that of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, are remarkable; the one for being the place where the sovereigns of Russia were formerly interred, and the other where they are crowned. These edifices, which are situated in the Kremlin, are both in the same style of architecture; and their exterior form, though modelled according to the ancient style of the country, is not absolutely elegant. In the cathedral of St Michael, which contains the tombs of the Russian sovereigns, the bodies are not, as with us, deposited in vaults, or beneath the pavement, but are entombed in raised sepulchres, mostly of brick, in the shape of a coffin, and about two feet in height. When Mr Coxe visited the cathedral, the most ancient were covered with pallis of red cloth, others of red velvet, and that of Peter II. with gold tissue, bordered with silver fringe and ermine. Each tomb has at its lower extremity a small silver plate, upon which is engraved the name of the deceased sovereign, and the era of his death.\n\nThe cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which has long been appropriated to the coronation of the Russian sovereigns, is the most splendid and magnificent in Moscow. The screen is in many parts covered with plates of solid silver and gold richly worked. From the centre of the roof hangs an enormous chandelier of maffy silver, weighing 2940 pounds: it was made in England, and was a present from Moroloff, prime minister and favourite of Alexey Michaelovitch. The sacred utensils and episcopal vestments are extraordinarily rich, but the taste of the workmanship is in general rude, and by no means equal to the materials. Many of the paintings which cover the inside walls are of a colossal size: some are very ancient, and were executed so early as in the latter end of the 15th century. It contains, amongst the rest a head of the Virgin, supposed to have been delineated by St Luke, and greatly celebrated in this country for its sanctity and the power of working miracles. Its face is almost black; its head is ornamented with a glory of precious stones, and its hands and body are gilded, which gives it a most grotesque appearance. It is placed in the screen, and enclosed within a large silver covering, which is only taken off on great festivals, or for the curiosity of strangers. In this cathedral are deposited the remains of the Russian patriarchs.\n\nThe place in the Khitaigorod, where the public archives are deposited, is a strong brick building, containing several vaulted apartments with iron doors. These archives, consisting of a numerous collection of state papers, were crowded into boxes and thrown aside like common lumber, until the empress Catharine ordered them to be revised and arranged. In conformity to this mandate, Mr Muller has divided them in chronological order with such perfect regularity, that any single document may be inspected with little trouble. They are enclosed in separate cabinets with glass doors: those relative to Russia are all classified according to the several provinces which they concern; and over each cabinet is inscribed the name of the province to which it is appropriated. In the same manner the manuscripts relative to foreign kingdoms are placed in separate divisions under the respective titles of Poland, Sweden, England, France, Germany, &c.\n\nThe university of Moscow, all situated in the Khitaigorod, was founded, at the instance of Count Shuvaloff, by the empress Elizabeth, for 600 students; who are clothed, boarded, and instructed, at the expense of the crown. Besides this institution, there are two gymnasia or seminaries for the education of youth, endowed also by Elizabeth; in which are taught, by twenty-three professors, divinity, classics, philosophy, the Greek, Latin, Russian, German, French, Italian, and Tartar languages; history, geography, mathematics, architecture, fortification, artillery, algebra, drawing and painting, music, fencing, dancing, reading and writing.\n\nMoscow is the centre of the inland commerce of Russia, and particularly connects the trade between Europe and Siberia. The only navigation to this city is formed by the Moskva, which falling into the Oka near Columna, communicates by means of that river with the Volga. But as the Moskva is only navigable in spring upon the melting of the snows, the principal merchandise is conveyed to and from Moscow upon sledges in winter. The whole of the retail trade is carried on in the Khitaigorod; where, according to a custom common in Russia, as well as in most kingdoms of the East, all the shops are collected together in one spot. The place is like a kind of fair, consisting of many rows of low brick buildings; the interval between them resembling alleys. These shops or booths occupy a considerable space; they do not, as with us, make part of the houses inhabited by the tradesmen, but are quite detached from their dwellings, which for the most part are at some distance in another quarter of the town. The tradesman comes to his shop in the morning; remains there all day, and returns home to his family in the afternoon. Every trade has its separate department; and they who sell the same goods have booths adjoining to each other. Furs and skins form the most considerable article of commerce in Moscow; and the shops which vend these commodities occupy several streets.\n\nAmongst the curiosities of Moscow, the market for the sale of houses is not the least remarkable. It is held in a large open space in one of the suburbs; and exhibits a great variety of ready made houses, thickly strewed upon the ground. The purchaser who wants a dwelling, repairs to this spot, mentions the number of rooms he requires, examines the different timbers, which are regularly numbered, and bargains for that which suits him. The house is sometimes paid for on the spot, and taken away by the purchaser; or sometimes the vender contracts to transport and erect it upon the place where it is designed to stand. It may appear incredible to assert, that a dwelling may be thus bought.\nMOSCOW bought, removed, raised and inhabited, within the space of a week; but we shall conceive it practicable by considering that these ready made houses are in general merely collections of trunks of trees tenoned and mortised at each extremity into one another, so that nothing more is required than the labour of transporting and adjusting them. But this summary mode of building is not always peculiar to the meaner hovels; as wooden structures of very large dimensions and handsome appearance are occasionally formed in Russia with an expedition almost inconceivable to the inhabitants of other countries. A remarkable instance of this despatch was displayed the last time the empress came to Moscow. Her majesty proposed to reside in the mansion of Prince Galitzin, which is esteemed the completest edifice in this city; but as it was not sufficiently spacious for her reception, a temporary addition of wood, larger than the original house, and containing a magnificent suite of apartments, was begun and finished within the space of six weeks. This meteor-like fabric was so handsome and commodious, that the materials which were taken down at her majesty's departure, were to be re-constructed as a kind of imperial villa upon an eminence near the city. Mr Coxe mentions an admirable police in this city for preventing riots, or for stopping the concourse of people in case of fires, which are very frequent and violent in those parts, where the houses are mostly of wood, and the streets are laid with timber. At the entrance of each street there is a chevaux-de-frise gate, one end whereof turns upon a pivot, and the other rolls upon a wheel; near it is a canteen box in which a man is occasionally stationed. In times of riot or fire the sentinel shuts the gate, and all passage is immediately stopped.\n\nAmong the public institutions of Moscow, the most remarkable is the Foundling Hospital, endowed in 1764 by the empress Catharine, and supported by voluntary contributions and legacies, and other charitable gifts. In order to encourage donations, her majesty granted to all benefactors some valuable privileges, and a certain degree of rank in proportion to the extent of their liberality. Among the principal contributors must be mentioned a private merchant named Dimidoff, a person of great wealth, who has expended in favour of this charity above 100,000l. The hospital, which is situated in a very airy part of the town upon a gentle ascent near the river Moskva, is an immense pile of building of a quadrangular shape, part of which was only finished when Mr Coxe (whose account we are transcribing) was at Moscow. It contained, at that time, three thousand foundlings; and, when the whole is completed, will receive eight thousand. The children are brought to the porter's lodge, and admitted without any recommendation. The rooms are lofty and large; the dormitories, which are separate from the work rooms, are very airy, and the beds are not crowded: each foundling, even each infant, has a separate bed. The children remain two years in the nursery, when they are admitted into the lowest class; the boys and girls continue together until they are seven years of age, at which time they are separated. They all learn to read, write, and cast accounts. The boys are taught to knit; they occasionally card hemp, flax, and wool, and work in the different manufactures. The girls learn to knit, net, and all kinds of needle work; they spin and weave lace; they are employed in cookery, baking, and house work of all sorts. At the age of fourteen the foundlings enter into the first class; when they have the liberty of choosing any particular branch of trade; and for this purpose there are different species of manufactures established in the hospital, of which the principal are embroidery, silk stockings, ribbands, lace, gloves, buttons, and cabinet work. A separate room is appropriated to each trade. Some boys and girls are instructed in the French and German languages, and a few boys in the Latin tongue; others learn music, drawing, and dancing.","sp":47,"ep":50},{"h":"MOSEHEIM","t":"John Laurence, an illustrious German divine, was born in 1695, of a noble family, which might seem to open to his ambition a fair path to civil promotion; but his zeal for the interests of religion, his thirst after knowledge, and particularly his taste for sacred literature, induced him to consecrate his talents to the service of the church. The German universities loaded him with literary honours; the king of Denmark invited him to settle at Copenhagen; the duke of Brunswick called him thence to Helmstadt, where he filled the academical chair of divinity; was honoured with the character of ecclesiastical counsellor to the court; and presided over the seminaries of learning in the duchy of Wolfenbuttel and the principality of Blackenburgh. When a design was formed of giving an uncommon degree of lustre to the universities of Gottingen, by filling it with men of the first rank in letters, Dr Mohein was deemed worthy to appear at the head of it, in quality of chancellor; and here he died, in 1755, universally lamented. In depth of judgement, in extent of learning, in purity of taste, in the powers of eloquence, and in a laborious application to all the various branches of erudition and philosophy, he had certainly very few superiors. His Latin translation of Cudworth's Intellectual System, enriched with large Mosquito annotations, discovered a profound acquaintance with ancient learning and philosophy. His illustrations of the Scriptures, his labours in defence of Christianity, and the light he cast upon religion and philosophy, appear in many volumes of sacred and profane literature; and the Ecclesiastical History, from the birth of Christ to the beginning of the 18th century, is unquestionably the best that is extant.

Pharaoh king of Egypt, perceiving that the Hebrews were become a formidable nation, issued forth an edict commanding all the male children to be put to death. To avoid this cruel edict, Jochebed, the mother of Moses, having concealed her son for three months, at length made an ark or basket of bulrushes, daubed it with pitch, laid the child in it, and exposed him on the banks of the Nile. Thermuthis the king's daughter, who happened to be walking by the river's side, perceived the floating cradle, commanded it to be brought to her, and struck with the beauty of the child, determined to preserve his life. In three years afterwards the princess adopted him for her own son, called his name Moses, and caused him be diligently instructed in all the learning of the Egyptians. But his father and mother, to whom he was restored by a fortunate accident, were at still greater pains to teach him the history and religion of his fathers. Many things are related by historians concerning the first period of Moses's life, which are not to be found in the Old Testament. According to Josephus and Eusebius, he made war on the Ethiopians, and completely defeated them. They add, that the city Saba, in which the enemy had been forced to take refuge, was betrayed into his hands by the king's daughter, who became deeply enamoured of him, when she beheld from the top of the walls his valorous exploits at the head of the Egyptian army. But as the truth of this expedition is more than doubtful, we shall therefore confine ourselves to the narrative of sacred writ, which commences at the fortieth year of Moses's life. He then left the court of Pharaoh, and went to visit his countrymen the Hebrews, who groaned under the ill usage and opprobrium of their unfeeling masters. Having perceived an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, he slew the Egyptian, and buried him in the sand. But he was obliged, in consequence of this murder, to fly into the land of Midian, where he married Zipporah, daughter of the priest Jethro, by whom he had two sons, Gerhohm and Eliezer. Here he lived 40 years; during which time his employment was to tend the flocks of his father-in-law. Having one day led his flock towards Mount Horeb, God appeared to him in the midst of a bush which burned with fire but was not consumed, and commanded him to go and deliver his brethren from their bondage. Moses at first refused to go; but was at length prevailed on by two miracles.\nracles which the Almighty wrought for his conviction. Upon his return to Egypt, he, together with his brother Aaron, went to the court of Pharaoh, and told him that God commanded him to let the Hebrews go to offer sacrifices in the desert of Arabia. But the impious monarch disregarded this command, and caused the labour of the Israelites to be doubled. The messengers of the Almighty again returned to the king, and wrought a miracle in his sight, that they might move his heart, and induce him to let the people depart. Aaron having cast down his miraculous rod, it was immediately converted into a serpent; but the same thing being performed by the magicians, the king's heart was hardened more and more; and his obstinacy at last drew down the judgements of the Almighty on his kingdom, which was afflicted with ten dreadful plagues. The first was the changing of the waters of the Nile and of all the rivers into blood, so that the Egyptians died of thirst. In consequence of the second plague, the land was covered with innumerable swarms of frogs, which entered even into Pharaoh's palace. By the third plague, the dust was converted into lice, which cruelly tormented both man and beast. The fourth plague was a multitude of destructive flies which spread throughout Egypt, and infected the whole country. The fifth was a sudden pestilence, which destroyed all the cattle of the Egyptians, without injuring those of the Israelites. The sixth produced numberless ulcers and fiery boils upon man and upon beast. The seventh was a dreadful storm of hail, accompanied with thunder and lightning, which destroyed every thing that was in the field, whether man or beast, and spared only the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel dwelt. By the eighth plague swarms of locusts were brought into the country, which devoured every green herb, the fruit of the trees and the produce of the harvest. By the ninth plague thick darkness covered all the land of Egypt, except the dwellings of the children of Israel. The tenth and last plague was the death of the firstborn in Egypt, who were all in one night cut off by the destroying angel, from the firstborn of the king to the firstborn of the slaves and of the cattle. This dreadful calamity moved the heart of the hardened Pharaoh, and he at length consented to allow the people of Israel to depart from his kingdom.\n\nProfane authors who have spoken of Moses, seem to have been in part acquainted with these mighty wonders. That he performed miracles, must have been allowed by many, by whom he was considered as a famous magician; and he could scarcely appear in any other light to men who did not acknowledge him for the messenger of the Almighty. Both Diodorus and Herodotus mention the distressed state to which Egypt was reduced by these terrible calamities. The Hebrews, amounting to the number of 650,000 men, without reckoning women and children, left Egypt on the 15th day of the month Nisan, which, in memory of this deliverance, was thenceforth reckoned the first month of their year. Scarcely had they reached the shore of the Red sea when Pharaoh with a powerful army set out in pursuit of them. On this occasion Moses stretched forth his rod upon the sea; and the waters thereof being divided, remained suspended on both sides till the Hebrews passed through dry-footed.\u2014The Egyptians determined to follow the same course; but God caused a violent wind to blow, which brought back the waters to their bed, and the whole army of Pharaoh perished in the waves.\n\nAfter the miraculous passage of the Red sea, the army proceeded towards Mount Sinai, and arrived at Marah, where the waters were bitter; but Moses, by calling a tree into them, rendered them fit for drinking. Their tenth encampment was at Rephidim; where Moses drew water from the rock in Horeb, by smiting it with his rod. Here likewise Amalek attacked Israel. While Joshua fought against the Amalekites, Moses stood on the top of a hill, and lifted up his hands; in consequence of which the Israelites prevailed, and cut their enemies in pieces. They at length arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai on the third day of the ninth month after their departure from Egypt. Moses having ascended several times into the mount, received the law from the hand of God himself in the midst of thunders and lightnings, and concluded the famous covenant betwixt the Lord and the children of Israel. When he descended from Sinai, he found that the people had fallen into the idolatrous worship of the golden calf. The messenger of God, shocked at such ingratitude, broke in pieces the tables of the law which he carried in his hands, and put 23,000 of the transgressors to the sword. He afterwards reascended into the mountain, and there obtained new tables of stone on which the law was inscribed. When Moses descended, his face shone so that the Israelites dared not to come nigh unto him, and he was obliged to cover it with a veil. The Israelites were here employed in constructing the tabernacle according to a pattern shown them by God. It was erected and consecrated at the foot of the Mount Sinai on the first day of the first month of the second year after their departure from Egypt; and it served the Israelites instead of a temple till the time of Solomon, who built a house for the God of his fathers after a model shown him by David.\n\nMoses having dedicated the tabernacle, he consecrated Aaron and his sons to be its ministers, and appointed the Levites to its service. He likewise gave various commandments concerning the worship of God and the political government of the Jews. This was a theocracy in the full extent of the word. God himself governed them immediately by means of his servant Moses, whom he had chosen to be the interpreter of his will to the people; and he required all the honours belonging to their king to be paid unto himself. He dwelt in his tabernacle, which was situated in the middle of the camp, like a monarch in his palace. He gave answers to those who consulted him, and himself denounced punishments against the transgressors of his laws. This properly was the time of the theocracy, taken in its full extent; for God was not only considered as the divinity who was the object of their religious worship, but as the sovereign to whom the honours of supreme majesty were paid. The case was nearly the same under Joshua; who, being filled with the spirit of Moses, undertook nothing without consulting God. Every measure, both of the leader and of the people, was regulated by the direction of the Almighty, who rewarded their fidelity and obedience by a series of miracles, victories, and successes. After Moses had regulated every thing regarding the civil administration,\ntion, and the marching of the troops, he led the Israelites to the confines of Canaan, to the foot of Mount Nebo. Here the Lord commanded him to ascend into the mountain; whence he showed him the promised land, whereto he was not permitted to enter. He immediately after yielded up the ghost, without sickness or pain, in the 120th year of his age, and 1451 years before Jesus Christ.\n\nMoses is incontestably the author of the first five books of the Old Testament, which go by the name of the Pentateuch; and which are acknowledged to be inspired, by the Jews and by Christians of every persuasion. Some, however, have denied that Moses was the author of these books; and have founded their opinion on this, that he always speaks of himself in the third person. But this manner of writing is by no means peculiar to Moses; it occurs also in several ancient historians; such as Xenophon, Caesar, Josephus, &c., who possessed more modesty or good sense than some modern historians, whose egotism is altogether disgusting, have not like them left to posterity a spectacle of ridiculous vanity and self-conceit. After all, it is proper to observe, that profane authors have related many falsehoods and absurdities concerning Moses, and concerning the origin and the religion of the Jews, with which they were but little acquainted. Plutarch, in his book concerning Isis and Osiris, says that Judah and Hieroofolmus were brothers, and descended from Typhon; and that the former gave his name to the country and its inhabitants, and the latter to the capital city. Others say that they came from Mount Ida in Phrygia. Strabo is the only author who speaks anything like reason and truth concerning them; though he too says that they were descended from the Egyptians, and considers Moses their legislator as an Egyptian priest. He acknowledges, however, that they were a people strictly just and sincerely religious. Other authors by whom they are mentioned, seem not to have had the smallest acquaintance either with their laws or their worship. They frequently confound them with the Christians, as is the case with Juvenal, Tacitus, and Quintilian.","sp":50,"ep":52},{"h":"MOSKITO","t":"or Mosquito Country, is situated in North America, between 85 and 88 degrees of west longitude, and between 13 and 15 degrees of north latitude; having the north sea on the north and east, Nicaragua on the south, and Honduras on the west; and indeed the Spaniards esteem it a part of the principality of Honduras, though they have no colonies in the Mosquito country. When the Spaniards first invaded this part of Mexico, they massacred the greatest part of the natives, which gave those that escaped into the inaccessible part of the country an insuperable aversion to them; and they have always appeared ready to join any Europeans that come upon their coasts against the Spaniards, and particularly the English, who frequently come hither; and the Mosquito men being excellent marksmen, the English employ them in striking the manati fish, &c., and many of the Mosquito Indians come to Jamaica, and sail with the English in their voyages.\n\nThese people are so situated between morasses and inaccessible mountains, and a coast full of rocks and shoals, that no attempts against them by the Spaniards, whom they mortally hate, could ever succeed. Nevertheless, they are a mild inoffensive people, of great morality and virtue, and will never trust a man who has once deceived them. They have so great a veneration towards the English, that they have spontaneously put themselves and their lands under the protection and dominion of the crown of England. This was first done when the duke of Albermarle was governor of Jamaica, and the king of the Moskitos received a commission from his grace, under the seal of that island; and since this time they have been steady in their alliance with the English.

In these galleries the Turks wash themselves before they go into the mosque. In each mosque there is a great number of lamps; and between these hang many crystal rings, ostriches eggs, and other curiosities, which, when the lamps are lighted, make a fine show. As it is not lawful to enter the mosque with stockings or shoes on, the pavements are covered with pieces of stuff sewed together, each being wide enough to hold a row of men kneeling, sitting, or prostrate. The women are not\nnot allowed to enter the mosque, but stay in the porches without. About every mosque there are six high towers, called minarets, each of which has three little open galleries, one above another; these towers, as well as the mosques, are covered with lead, and adorned with gilding and other ornaments; and from thence, instead of a bell, the people are called to prayers by certain officers appointed for that purpose. Most of the mosques have a kind of hospital belonging to them, in which travellers of what religion ever, are entertained three days. Each mosque has also a place called tarbe, which is the burying-place of its founders; within which is a tomb six or seven feet long, covered with green velvet or satin; at the ends of which are two tapers, and round it several leeks for those who read the Koran and pray for the souls of the deceased.","sp":52,"ep":53},{"h":"MOSS","t":"or MOSSES. See MUSCI, BOTANY Index.\n\nMoss on Trees, in gardening. The growth of large quantities of moss on any kind of tree is a detriment of very bad consequence to its increase, and much damages the fruit of the trees of our orchards.\n\nThe present remedy is the scraping it off from the body and large branches by means of a kind of wooden knife that will not hurt the bark, or with a piece of rough hair cloth, which does very well after a soaking rain. But the most effectual cure is the taking away the cause. This is to be done by draining off all the superfluous moisture from about the roots of the trees, and may be greatly guarded against in the first planting of the trees, by not setting them too deep.\n\nIf trees stand too thick in a cold ground, they will always be covered with mosses; and the best way to remedy the fault is to thin them. When the young branches of trees are covered with a long and shaggy moss, it will utterly ruin them; and there is no way to prevent it but to cut off the branches near the trunk, and even to take off the head of the tree if necessary; for it will sprout again; and if the cause be in the mean time removed by thinning the plantation, or draining the land and stirring the ground well, the young shoots will continue clear after this.\n\nIf the trees be covered with moss in consequence of the ground's being too dry, as this will happen from either extreme in the soil, then the proper remedy is the laying mud from the bottom of a pond or river pretty thick about the root, opening the ground to some distance and depth to let it in; this will not only cool it, and prevent its giving growth to any great quantity of moss, but it will also prevent the other great mischief which fruit-trees are liable to in dry grounds, which is the falling off of the fruit too early.\n\nThe mosses which cover the trunks of trees, as they always are freest and most vigorous on the side which points to the north, if only produced on that, serve to preserve the trunk of the tree from the severity of the north winds, and direct the traveller in his way, by always plainly pointing out that part of the compass.\n\nMoss is also a name given to boggy ground in many parts of England, otherwise called a fen and bog.\n\nIn many of these grounds, as well in England and Ireland as in other parts of the world, there are found vast numbers of trees standing with their stumps erect, and their roots piercing the ground in a natural posture as when growing. Many of these trees are broken or cut off near the roots, and lie along, and this usually in a north-east direction. People who have been willing to account for this, have usually resolved it into the effect of the deluge in the days of Noah; but this is a very wild conjecture, and is proved false by many unanswerable arguments. The waters of this deluge might indeed have washed together a great number of trees, and buried them under loads of earth; but then they would have lain irregularly and at random; whereas they all lie lengthwise from south-west to north-east, and the roots all stand in their natural perpendicular posture, as close as the roots of trees in a forest.\n\nBesides, these trees are not all in their natural state, but many of them have the evident marks of human workmanship upon them, some being cut down with an axe, some split, and the wedges still remaining in them; some burnt in different parts, and some bored through with holes. These things are also proved to be of a later date than the deluge, by other matters found among them, such as utensils of ancient people, and coins of the Roman emperors.\n\nIt appears from the whole, that all the trees which we find in this fossil state, originally grew in the very places where we now find them, and have only been thrown down and buried there, not brought from elsewhere. It may appear indeed an objection to this opinion, that most of these fossil trees are of the fir kind; and that Caesar says expressly, that no firs grew in Britain in his time; but this is easily answered, by observing, that these trees, though of the fir kind, yet are not the species usually called the fir, but pitch-tree; and Caesar has nowhere said that pitch-trees did not grow in England. Norway and Sweden yet abound with these trees; and there are at this time whole forests of them in many parts of Scotland, and a large number of them wild upon a hill at Wareton in Staffordshire to this day.\n\nIn Hatfield marsh, where such vast numbers of the fossil trees are now found, there has evidently once been a whole forest of them growing. The last of these was found alive, and growing in that place within 70 years last past, and cut down for some common use.\n\nIt is also objected by some to the system of the firs growing where they are found fossil, that these countries are all bogs and moors, whereas these sorts of trees grow only in mountainous places. But this is founded on an error; for though in Norway and Sweden, and some other cold countries, the fir kinds all grow upon barren and dry rocky mountains, yet in warmer places they are found to thrive as well on wet plains. Such are found plentifully in Pomerania, Livonia, and Courland, &c., and in the west parts of New England there are vast numbers of fine stately trees of them in low grounds. The whole truth seems to be, that these trees love a sandy soil; and such as is found at the bottoms of all the mosses where these trees are found fossil. The roots of the fir kind are always found fixed in these; and those of oaks, where they are found fossil in this manner, are usually found fixed in clay; so that each kind of tree is always found rooted in the places where they stand in their proper soil; and there is no doubt to be made but that they originally\nginally grew there. When we have thus found that all the fossil trees we meet with once grew in the places where they are now buried, it is plain that in these places there were once noble forests, which have been destroyed at some time; and the question only remains how by whom they were destroyed. This we have reason to believe, by the Roman coins found among them, was done by the people of that empire, and that at the time when they were established or establishing themselves here.\n\nTheir own historian tells us, that when their armies pursued the wild Britons, these people always sheltered themselves in the miry woods and low watery forests. Caesar expressly says this; and observes, that Cassibelanus and his Britons, after their defeat, passed the Thames, and fled into such low marshes and woods, that there was no pursuing them; and we find that the Silures secured themselves in the same manner when attacked by Ostorius and Agricola. The same thing is recorded of Venutius king of the Brigantes, who fled to secure himself into the boggy forests of the midland part of this kingdom: and Hero dian expressly says, that in the time of the Romans pushing their conquests in these islands, it was the custom of the Britons to secure themselves in the thick forests which grew in their boggy and wet places, and when opportunity offered, to issue out thence and fall upon the Romans. The consequence of all this was the destroying all these forests; the Romans finding themselves so plagued with parties of the natives issuing out upon them at times from these forests, that they gave orders for the cutting down and destroying all the forests in Britain which grew on boggy and wet grounds. These orders were punctually executed; and to this it is owing that at this day we can hardly be brought to believe that such forests ever grew with us as are now found buried.\n\nThe Roman historians all agree, that when Suetonius Paulinus conquered Anglesea, he ordered all the woods to be cut down there, in the manner of the Roman generals in England: and Galen tells us, that the Romans, after their conquest in Britain, kept their soldiers constantly employed in cutting down forests, draining of marshes, and paving of bogs. Not only the Roman soldiers were employed in this manner, but all the native Britons made captives in the wars were obliged to assist in it: and Dion Cassius tells us, that the emperor Severus lost no less than 50,000 men in a few years time in cutting down the woods and draining the bogs of this island. It is not to be wondered at, that such numbers executed the immense destruction which we find in these buried forests. One of the greatest subterranean treasures of wood is that near Hatfield; and it is easy to prove, that these people, to whom this havoc is thus attributed, were upon the spot where these trees now lie buried. The common road of the Romans out of the south into the north, was formerly from Lindum (Lincoln), to Segelochum (Little Burrow upon Trent), and from thence to Danum (Doncaster), where they kept a standing garrison of Cripinian horse. A little off on the east, and north-east of their road, between the two last named towns, lay the borders of the greatest forest, which swarmed with wild Britons, who were continually making their forays out, and their retreats into it again, intercepting their provisions, taking and destroying their carriages, killing their allies and passengers, and disturbing their garrisons. This at length to exasperate the Romans, that they were determined to destroy it; and to do this safely and effectually, they marched against it with a great army, and encamped on a great moor not far from Finnings: this is evident from their fortifications yet remaining.\n\nThere is a small town in the neighbourhood called Quesfeld; and as the termination field seems to have been given only in remembrance of battles fought near the towns whose names ended with it, it is not improbable that a battle was fought here between all the Britons who inhabited this forest and the Roman troops under Ostorius. The Romans flew many of the silos, and drove the rest back into this forest, which at that time overspread all this low country. On this the conquerors taking advantage of a strong south-west wind, set fire to the pitch-trees, of which this forest was principally composed; and when the greater part of the trees were thus destroyed, the Roman soldiers and captive Britons cut down the remainder, except a few large ones which they left standing as memorials of the destruction of the rest. These fingle trees, however, could not stand long against the winds, and these falling into the rivers which ran through the country, interrupted their currents; and the water then overspreading the level country, made one great lake, and gave origin to the moles or moory bogs, which were afterwards formed there, by the workings of the waters, the precipitation of earthy matter from them, and the putrefaction of rotten boughs and branches of trees, and the vast increase of water-moss and other such plants which grow in prodigious abundance in all these parts of places. Thus were these burnt and felled trees buried under a new-formed spongy and watery earth, and afterwards found on the draining and digging through this earth again.\n\nHence it is not strange that Roman weapons and Roman coins are found among these buried trees; and hence it is that among the buried trees some are found burnt, some chopped and hewn; and hence it is that the bodies of the trees all lie by their proper roots, and with their tops lying north-east, that is, in that direction in which a south-west wind would have blown them down: hence also it is, that some of the trees are found with their roots lying flat, these being not cut or burned down, but blown up by the roots afterwards when left fingle; and it is not wonderful, that such trees as these should have continued to grow even after their fall, and shoot up branches from their sides which might easily grow into high trees. Phil. Transl. No 275.\n\nBy this system it is also easily explained why the moor soil in the country is in some places two or three yards thicker than in others, or higher than it was formerly, since the growing up of peat-earth or bog-ground is well known, and the soil added by overflowing of waters is not a little.\n\nAs the Romans were the destroyers of this great and noble forest, so they were probably also of the several other ancient forests; the ruins of which furnish us with the bog-wood of Staffordshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and other counties. But as the Romans were not much in Wales, in the Isle of Man, or\nin Ireland, it is not to be supposed that forests cut down by thieves people gave origin to the foill wood found there; but though they did not cut down these forests, others did; and the origin of the bog-wood is the same with them and with us. Hollinghead informs us, that Edward I. being not able to get at the Welsh because of their hiding themselves in boggy woods, gave orders at length that they should all be destroyed by fire and by the axe; and doubtless the roots and bodies of trees found in Pembrokeshire under ground, are the remains of the execution of this order. The foill wood in the bogs of the island of Man is doubtless of the same origin, though we have not any accounts extant of the time or occasion of the forests there being destroyed; but as to the foill trees of the bogs of Ireland, we are expressly told, that Henry II. when he conquered that country, ordered all the woods to be cut down that grew in the low parts of it, to secure his conquests, by cutting away the places of resort of rebels. For a fuller detail of the natural history of mists, see Essays on this subject by the Rev. Mr Rennie of Kilflyth.\n\nMOVING-MOSS. We have an account in the Philosophical Transactions of a moving moss near Churchtown in Lancashire, which greatly alarmed the neighbourhood as miraculous. The moss was observed to rise to a surprising height, and soon after sunk as much below the level, and moved slowly towards the south.\n\nA very surprising instance of a moving moss is that of Solway in Scotland, which happened in the year 1771, after severe rains which had produced terrible inundations of the rivers in many places. For the better understanding of this event, we shall give the following description of the spot of ground where it happened. Along the side of the river Esk there is a vale, about a mile broad, less or more in different places. It is bounded on the south-east by the river Esk, and on the north-west by a steep bank 30 feet in height above the level of the vale. From the top of the bank the ground rises in an easy ascent for about a quarter of a mile, where it is terminated by the moss; which extends about two miles north and south, and about a mile and a half east and west, and is bounded on the north-west by the river Sark. It is probable that the solid ground from the top of the bank above the vale was continued in the same direction under the moss, before its eruption, for a considerable space; for the moss at the place where the eruption happened, was inclined towards the sloping ground. From the edge of the moss there was a gully or hollow, called by the country people the gap, and said to be 30 yards deep where it entered the vale; down which ran a small rill of water, which was often dry in summer, having no supply but what filtered from the moss. The eruption happened at the head of this gap, on Saturday November 16, 1771, about ten or eleven at night, when all the neighbouring rivers and brooks were prodigiously swelled by the rains. A large body of the moss was forced, partly by the great fall of rain, and partly by some springs below it, into a small beck or burn, which runs within a few yards of its border to the south-east. By the united pressure of the water behind it, and of this beck, which was then very high, it was carried down a narrow glen between two banks about 300 feet high, into a wide and spacious plain, over part of which it spread with great rapidity. The moss continued for some time to send off considerable quantities; which, being borne along by the torrent on the back of the first great body, kept it for many hours in perpetual motion, and drove it still farther on. This night at least 420 acres of fine arable land were covered with moss from 3 to 12 or 15 feet deep. Several houses were destroyed, a good deal of corn loft, &c. but all the inhabitants escaped. When the waters subsided, the moss also ceased to flow; but two pretty considerable streams continued to run from the heart of it, and carried off some pieces of mossy matter to the place where it burst. There they joined the beck already mentioned; which, with this addition, refilled its former channel; and, with a little affluence from the people of the neighbourhood, made its way to the Esk, through the midst of that great body of moss which obstructed its course. Thus, in a great measure drained, the new moss fell several feet, when the fair weather came in the end of November, and settled in a firmer and more solid body on the lands it had overrun. By this inundation about 800 acres of arable ground were overflowed before the moss stopped, and the habitations of 27 families destroyed. Tradition has preserved the memory of a similar inundation in Monteith in Scotland. A moss there altered its course in one night, and covered a great extent of ground.\n\nMoss Troopers, a rebellious sort of people in the north of England, who lived by robbery and rapine, not unlike the tories in Ireland, the bucaniers in Jamaica, or banditti of Italy.

The ancients, however, thought differently. Some of them defined it to be a passage out of one state into another; which conveys no idea to him who\nMotion.\n\nwho is ignorant of the nature of motion.\u2014The Peripatetic definition has been mentioned elsewhere and shown to be wholly unintelligible, as well as their celebrated division of motion into four classes, belonging to the three categories, quality, quantity, and where; (see Several definitions of Metaphysics, No 188, 189, 190.) The Cartesians, too, among the moderns, pretend to define motion, by calling it a passage or removal of one part of matter, out of the neighbourhood of those parts to which it is immediately contiguous, into the neighbourhood of others. Borelli defines motion to be the successive passage of a body from place to place. Others say that it is the application of a body to different parts of infinite and immoveable space; and a late writer * of uncommon acuteness has given as a definition of motion\u2014change of place.\n\nWe have elsewhere offered our opinion of every possible attempt to define motion: but as the author of the last quoted definition has endeavoured to obviate such objections as ours, candour requires that he be heard for himself. \"It is said (he observes) by some, that change implies motion, and therefore cannot be a part of its definition, being the very thing defined. To this I answer, We are speaking of the sensible idea of motion, as it appears to our sight; now changes do appear to our view, and to all our senses, which give us no idea of motion. Changes in heat or cold; in colour, flavour, smell, sound, hardness, softness, pain, pleasure; in these, and many other ideas, changes do not produce ideas like that produced by a ball rolling or a stone falling. We may perhaps ultimately trace them to motion, but to insensible motions; to motions which arise only in reflection, and constitute no part of the actual idea of change. We can therefore conceive of change, without conceiving at the same time of motion.\u2014Change is a generic idea, including many species; motion, as a sensible idea, is a species of that genus. Change is therefore a necessary part of the definition of motion; it marks the genus of the thing defined. Motion is a change; but as there are many species of change, which of those species is motion? The answer is, It is a change of place. This marks the species; and distinguishes it from change of colour, of temperament and figure.\"\n\nThis is the ablest defence of an attempt to define motion that we have ever seen; and at first view the definition itself appears to be perfect. Aristotle, the prince of definers, \"confiders a definition as a speech declaring what a thing is. Everything essential to the thing defined, and nothing more, must be contained in the definition. Now the essence of a thing consists of these two parts: first, what is common to it with other things of the same kind; and secondly, what distinguishes it from other things of the same kind. The first is called the genus of the thing; the second, its specific difference. The definition, therefore, consists of these two parts.\"\n\nIn obedience to this rule, the definition under consideration seems to consist of the genus, signified by the word change; and of the specific difference, denoted by the words of place. But does the speech change of place really declare what motion is? We cannot admit that it does; as, in our apprehension, a change of place is the effect of motion, and not motion itself. Suppose a lover of dialectic undertaking to define the stroke by which he saw his neighbour wounded with a bludgeon; what should we think of his art were he to call it a contusion on the head? He might say that contusion is a general term, as contusions may be produced on the arms, on the legs, and on various parts of the body; and as there are many species of contusion, if he were asked which of those species was the stroke to be defined, he might answer, \"a contusion on the head.\" Here would be apparently the genus and specific difference; the former denoted by contusion, and the latter by the words on the head. But would this be a definition of a stroke? No, surely: a contusion on the head may be the effect of a stroke; but it can no more be the stroke itself, than a blow can be a bludgeon, or a flesh wound the point of a sword. Equally evident it is, that a change of place cannot be motion; because every body must have been actually moved before we can discern, or even conceive, a change of its place.\n\nThe act of changing the place would perhaps come nearer to a definition of motion; but so far would it be from \"a speech declaring what motion is,\" that we are confident a man who had never by any of his senses perceived a body in actual motion, would acquire no ideas whatever from the words \"act of changing place.\" He might have experienced changes in heat, cold, smell, and sound; but he could not possibly combine the ideas of such changes with the signification of the word place, were he even capable of understanding that word, which to us appears to be more than doubtful. (See Metaphysics, No 42, 43.)\n\nThe distinctions of motion into different kinds have been no less various, and no less insignificant, than the several definitions of it. The moderns who reject the two into Peripatetic division of motion into four classes, yet consider it themselves as either absolute or relative. Thus we are told, that \"absolute motion is the change of absolute place, and that its celerity must be measured by the quantity of absolute space which the moving body runs through in a given time.\" Relative motion, on the other hand, is a mutation of the relative or vulgar place of the moving body, and has its celerity estimated by the quantity of relative space run through.\"\n\nNow it is obvious, that this distinction conveys no ideas without a farther explanation of the terms by which it is expressed; but that explanation is impossible to be given. Thus, before we can understand what absolute motion is, we must understand what is meant by absolute place. But absolute place is a contradiction; for all place is relative, and consists in the positions of different bodies with regard to one another. Were a globe in the regions of empty space to be put in motion by Almighty Power, and all the rest of the corporeal world to be soon afterwards annihilated, the motion would undoubtedly continue unchanged; and yet, according to this distinction, it would be at first relative, and afterwards absolute. That the beginning of such a motion would be perceptible, and the remainder of it imperceptible, is readily granted; but on this account to consider it as of two kinds, is as absurd as to suppose the motion of the minute hand of a clock to be the Carrefiers and of Newton affected by our looking at it.\n\nLeaving therefore these unintelligible distinctions, reflecting we now come to consider a question full of a very abstruse nature, but much agitated among philosophers, viz.\nviz. What is the original source of motion in the creation? Is it natural to matter? or are we to attribute it to the immediate and continual agency of some immaterial being? The former has been strenuously argued by the Cartesians, and the latter by the Newtonians. The arguments of the former, founded upon the chimerical hypothesis of vortices and the original construction of matter, were evidently inconclusive; and the hypothesis of Sir Isaac Newton, who asserted that it was naturally incapable of motion, appeared more probable. To account for the quantity of motion in the universe, therefore, it became necessary to have recourse either to the Deity, or to some subordinate spiritual agent; and this became the more necessary, as the doctrine of an absolute vacuum in the celestial spaces, that is, throughout the incomparably greatest part of the creation, was one of the fundamental maxims of the system. As it was absolutely denied that matter existed in these spaces, and it was plain that the celestial bodies affected one another at immense distances, the powers of attraction and repulsion were naturally called in as the sources of motion by their impulse upon inert and sluggish matter. These being admitted, a speculation ensued concerning their nature. Spiritual, it was confessed, they were; but whether they were to be accounted the immediate action of the divine Spirit himself, or that of some subordinate and inferior spirit, was a matter of no little dispute. Sir Isaac Newton, towards the latter part of his life, began to relax somewhat of the rigidity of his former doctrine; and allowed that a very subtle medium, which he called ether, might be the cause of attraction and repulsion, and thus of the whole phenomena of nature. Since his time the multitude of discoveries in electricity, the similarity of that fluid to fire and light, with the vast influence it has on every part of the creation with which we are acquainted, have rendered it very probable that the ether mentioned by Sir Isaac is no other than the element of fire, \"the most subtle and elastic of all bodies, which seems to pervade and expand itself throughout the whole universe.\" Electrical experiments show that this mighty agent is everywhere present, ready to break forth into action if not restrained and governed with the greatest wisdom. Being always restless and in motion, it actuates and enlivens the whole visible mass; is equally fitted to produce and to destroy; distinguishes the various stages of nature, and keeps up the perpetual round of generations and corruptions, pregnant with forms which it constantly sends forth and reforms. So quick in its motions, so subtle and penetrating in its nature, so extensive in its effects, it feareth no other than the vegetative soul or vital spirit of the world.\n\n\"The animal spirit in man is the instrument both of sense and motion. To suppose sense in the corporeal world would be gross and unwarranted; but locomotive faculties are evident in all its parts. The Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Stoics, held the world to be an animal; though some of them have chosen to consider it as a vegetable. However, the phenomena do plainly show, that there is a spirit that moves, and a mind or providence that presides. This providence, Plutarch faith, was thought to be in regard to the world what the soul is in regard to man. The order and course of things, and the experiments we daily make, show that there is a mind which governs and activates this mundane system as the proper and real agent and cause; and that the inferior instrumental cause is pure ether, fire, or the substance of light, which is applied and determined by an infinite mind in the macrocosm or universe, with unlimited power, and according to stated rules, as it is in the microcosm with limited power and skill by the human mind. We have no proof either from experiment or reason of any other agent or efficient cause than the mind or spirit. When, therefore, we speak of corporeal agents, or corporeal causes, this is to be understood in a different, subordinate, and improper sense; and such an agent we know light or elementary fire to be.\"\n\nThat this elementary fire, absorbed and fixed in all experimental bodies, may be the cause of the universal principle of gravity, is made sufficiently evident by numberless experiments. Homberg having calcined in the focus of a burning glass some regulus of antimony, found that the immediate cause of the operation, sent up a thick smoke, and thereby lost a considerable part of its own substance. It is vain to allege that any heterogeneous matter floating in the air, or that the air itself, may have been hurried into the mass by the action of the fire, and that by this additional matter the weight was increased; for it is known experimentally, that if a quantity of metal be even hermetically secured within a vessel of glass to keep off the air and all foreign matter, and the vessel be placed for some time in a strong fire, it will exhibit the same effect. \"I have seen the operation performed (says Mr Jones) on two ounces of pewter filings, hermetically sealed up in a Florence flask, which in two hours gained 55 grains, that is nearly one seventh. Had it remained longer in the fire, it might probably have gained something more; as, in one of Mr Boyle's experiments, steel filings were found to have gained a fourth.\n\nOf accounting for these effects there are but two possible ways: 1. If the quantity of matter be the same, or, in the case of calcination, be somewhat less, after being exposed to the action of the fire, while the gravity of the whole is become greater; then does it follow, that gravity is not according to the quantity of matter, and of course is not one of its properties. 2. If there be an increase of the mass, it can be imputed to nothing but the matter of light or fire entangled in its passage through the substance, and so fixed in its pores, or combined with its solid parts, as to gravitate together with it. Yet it is certain, from the phenomenon of light darting from the sun, that this elementary fire does not gravitate till it is fixed in metal, or some other solid substance.\u2014Here then we have a fluid which gravitates, if it gravitate at all, in some cases and not in others. So that which way ever the experiment be interpreted, we are forced to conclude that elementary or solar fire may be the cause of the law of gravitation.\"\n\nThat it is likewise in many cases the cause of repulsion, is known to every one who has seen it fuse metals, and convert water and mercury into elastic vapour. But there is a fact recorded by Mr Jones, which seems to evince that the same fluid, which as it issues from the sun exhibits itself in the form of light and heat, is in other circumstances converted into a very fine air,\nor cold aether, which rushes very forcibly towards the body of that luminary. \"As a sequel to what has been observed (says he) concerning the impregnation of solid substances with the particles of fire, give me leave to subjoin an experiment of M. de Stair. He tells us, that upon heating red lead in a glass, whence the air was exhausted by the rays of the sun collected in a burning glass, the vessel in which the said red lead was contained burst in pieces with a great noise. Now, as all explosions in general must be ascribed either to an admission of the air into a rarefied space, or to what is called the generation of it; and as air was not admitted upon this occasion, it must have been generated from the calx within the vessel; and certainly so, because Dr Hales has made it appear that this substance, like crude tartar and many others, will yield a considerable quantity of air in distillation. What went into the metal therefore as fire, came out of it again as air; which in a manner forces upon us conclusions of ineffinable value in natural philosophy, and such as may carry us very far into the most sublime part of it.\"\n\nOne of the conclusions which the ingenious author thinks thus forced upon us, is, that the motion of the planets round the sun, as well as round their own axes, is to be attributed to the continual agency of this fluid, under its two forms of elementary fire and pure air. As fire and light, we know that it rushes with inconceivable rapidity from the body of the sun, and penetrates every corporeal substance, exerting itself sometimes with such force as nothing with which we are acquainted is able to resist. If it be indeed a fact, that this elementary fire, or principle of light and heat, afterwards cools, and becomes pure air, there cannot be a doubt, but that under such a form it will return with great force; though surely in a somewhat different direction, towards the sun, forming a vortex, in which the planets are included, and by which they must of course be carried round the centre. Mr Jones does not suppose that the air into which the principle of light and heat is converted, is of so gross a nature as our atmosphere. He rather considers it as cold aether, just as he represents light to be ather heated: but he maintains, that this aether, in its aerial form, though not fit for human respiration, is a better pabulum of fire than the air which we breathe.\n\nThis theory is exceedingly plausible; and the author supports it by many experiments. He has not, indeed, convinced us that the solar light is converted or convertible into pure air; but he has, by just reasoning from undoubted facts, proved that the whole expanse of heaven, as far as comets wander, is filled not only with light, which is indeed obvious to the senses, but also with a fluid, which, whatever it may be called, supplies the place of the air in feeding the fire of these ignited bodies.\n\nThat the motion of the heavenly bodies should result from the perpetual agency of such a medium, appears to us a much more rational hypothesis, than that which makes them act upon each other at immense distances through empty space. But the hypothesis is by no means to complete a solution of the phenomena as some of its fond admirers pretend to think it. This fluid, whether called aether, heat, light, or air, is still material; and the question returns upon him who imagines that it is sufficient to account for gravitation, repulsion, magnetism, and cohesion, &c. \"What moves the fluid itself, or makes the parts of which it is composed cohere together?\" However widely it may be extended, it is incapable of positive infinity; and therefore may be divided into parts separated from each other; so that it must be held together by a foreign force, as well as a ball of lead, or a piece of wax. As matter is not essentially active, the motion of this aether, under both its forms, must likewise be considered as an effect, for which we do not think that any propelling power in the body of the sun can be admitted as a sufficient cause. For how comes the sun to possess that power, and what makes the fluid return to the sun? We have no notion of power, in the proper sense of the word, but as intelligence and volition; and, by the pious and excellent author of the Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy, we are certain that the sun was never supposed to be intelligent.\n\nBishop Berkeley, who admits of light or aether as it is there, the instrumental cause of all corporeal motion, gets rid of this difficulty, by supposing, with the ancients, that some supernatural agent is animated. According to the Pythagoreans and Platonists (says his Lordship*), *Siris, there is a life infused throughout all things; the \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 No 277, \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, an intellectual and artificial fire, an inward principle, animal spirit, or natural life, producing and forming within, as art doth without; regulating, moderating, and reconciling the various motions, qualities, and parts of this mundane system. By virtue of this life, the great masses are held together in their ordinary courses, as well as the minutest particles governed in their natural motions, according to the several laws of attraction, gravity, electricity, magnetism, and the rest. It is this gives instincts, teaches the spider her web, and the bee her honey. This it is that directs the roots of plants to draw forth juices from the earth, and the leaves and cortical vessels to separate and attract such particles of air and elementary fire as suit their respective natures.\"\n\nThis life or animal spirit seems to be the same thing which Cudworth calls plastic nature, and which has been considered elsewhere. (See Metaphysics, No 200, and Plastic Nature). We shall therefore dismiss it at present, with just admitting the truth of the bishop's position, \"that if nature be supposed the life of the world, animated by one soul, compacted into one frame, and directed or governed in all its parts by one supreme and distinct intelligence, this system cannot be accused of atheism, though perhaps it may of mistake or impropriety.\"\n\nA theory of motion somewhat similar to that of Berkeley, though in several respects different from it, was not many years ago stated with great clearness, and supported with much ingenuity, in An Essay on the Powers and Mechanism of Nature, intended to improve, and more firmly establish, the grand superstructure of the Newtonian system. Mr Young, the author of the essay, admits with most other philosophers of the present age, that body is composed of atoms which are impenetrable to each other, and may be denominated solid. These atoms, however, he does not consider as primary and simple elements, incapable of resolution into principles;\nMotion principles; but thinks that they are formed by certain motions of the parts of a substance immaterial and essentially active.\n\nAs this notion is uncommon, and the offspring of a vigorous mind, we shall consider it more attentively under the article Plastic Nature. It is mentioned at present as a necessary introduction to the author's theory of motion, of which he attributes both the origin and the continuance to the agency of this elementary substance pervading the most solid atoms of the densest bodies. Of every body and every atom he holds the constituent principles to be essentially active; but those principles act in such a manner as to counterbalance each other; so that the atom or body considered as a whole is inert, unless in so far as it resists the compulsion or separation of its parts. No body or atom can of itself begin to move, or continue in motion for a single instant; but being pervious to the active substance, and coalescing with it, that substance, when it enters any body, it carries it along with it, till meeting some other body in the way, either the whole of the active substance lodged in the former body passes into the obstacle, in which case the impelling body instantly ceases to move; or else part of that substance passes into the obstacle, and part remains in the impelling body; and in this case both bodies are moved with a velocity in proportion to the quantity of matter which each contains, combined with the quantity of active substance by which they are respectively penetrated.\n\nIn order to pave the way for his proof of the existence of one uniform active substance, he observes, that change being an essentially constituent part of motion, and change implying action, it follows that all motion implies action, and depends on an active cause. Every motion (he continues) has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning is a change from rest to motion; the middle is a continuance in motion; the end is a change from motion to rest. He then proceeds to show, that the beginning of motion is by an action begun; the continuance of motion by an action continued; and the end of motion by a cessation of action.\n\n\"The first of these positions is admitted by everybody. That the continuance of motion is by an action continued, will be proved, if it shall be shown that the continuance of a motion is nothing different from its beginning, in regard to any point of time assumed in the continued motion. Now the beginning of motion (he says) consists in the beginning of change of place. But if any given portions of time and of space are assumed, a body beginning to move in the commencement of that time, and in the first portion of the space assumed, then and there begins that particular motion; and whether before the body began to move in that space it was moving in other spaces and times, has no relation to the motion in question; for this being in a space and time altogether distinct, is a distinct motion from any which might have preceded it immediately, as much as from a motion which preceded it a thousand years before. It is therefore a new motion begun; and so it may be said of every assumable point in the continued motion. The term continued serves only to connect any two distinct motions, the end of one with the beginning of the other; but does not destroy their distinctness.\"\n\nHe then proceeds to combat, which he does very successfully, the arguments by which the more rigid Newtonians endeavour to prove that a body in motion will continue to be moved by its own inertia, till kept by some opposite force. Having done this, he establishes the contrary conclusion by the following syllogisms:\n\n\"I. Whatever requires an active force to stop its motion, is disposed to move.\nEvery body in motion requires an active force to stop its motion;\nTherefore every body in motion is disposed to move.\n\nII. Whatever is disposed to motion is possessed of action.\nBut a body in motion is disposed to continue in motion;\nTherefore a body in motion is possessed of action.\n\nThus it appears, that the middle part of any motion is action equally with the beginning.\n\nThe last part of motion is its termination. It is admitted that all motion is terminated by an action contrary to the direction of the motion. It is admitted, too, that the moving body acts at the time its motion is destroyed. Thus the beginning and the end of any uniform motion are confessed to be actions; but all the intermediate continuation which connects the beginning with the end is denied to be action. What can be more unaccountable than this denial? Is it not more consonant to reason and analogy, to ascribe to the whole continued motion one uninterrupted action? Such a conclusion true philosophy, we think, requires us to make.\n\n\"To move or act, is an attribute which cannot be conceived to exist without a substance. The action of a body in motion is indeed the attribute of the body, and the body relatively to its own motion is truly a substance, having the attribute or quality of motion. But the body being a name figuring a combination of certain ideas, which ideas are found to arise from action (see Plastic Nature), that action which is productive of those ideas whose combination we denominate body, is of the nature of an attribute so long as it is considered as constituted of action.\u2014To this attribute we must necessarily assign its substance. The actions which constitute body must be actions of something, or there must be something which acts. What then is this active something from whose agency we get the idea of body, or whose actions constitute body? Is it not sufficient that it is something active? A name might be surely given it, but a name would not render the idea more clear. Its description may be found in every sensation; it is colour to the eye, flavour to the palate, odour to the nose, sound to the ear, and feeling to the touch; for all our sensations are but so many ways in which this active something is manifested to us. A substratum of solidity philosophers have imagined to exist, and have in vain sought to find. Our active substance is the substratum so long sought for, and with so little success. We give it a quality by which it may be perceived; it acts. One modification of action produces matter, another generates motion. These modifications of action are modes of the active substance, whose presence is action; matter and motion constitute...\"\nconstitute the whole of nature. There is therefore throughout nature an active substance, the constituent essence of matter, and immediate natural agent in all effects.\n\nBy an argument which we do not think very conclusive, our author determines this active substance to be unintelligent. \"In our sensations individually, not discovering (says he) the traces, not seeing the characters of intelligence, but finding only action present and necessary, our inferences go no farther than our observations warrant us to do; and we conclude in all these things an action only, and that action unintelligent.\" Having given our opinion of real agency elsewhere (see Metaphysics, No. 118.), we shall not here stop to examine this reasoning.\u2014We may however ask, Whether all our sensations individually be not excited for a certain end? If they be, according to our author's mode of arguing in another place, the exciting agent should be an intelligent being. By this we are far from meaning to deny the reality of a secondary or instrumental cause of sensation which is destitute of intelligence. We are strongly inclined to think that there is such a cause, though our persuasion results not from this argument of our author's. In our opinion, he reasons better when he says, \"that a subordinate agent constructed as the matter of creation, invested with perpetual laws, and producing agreeably to those laws all the forms of being, through the varieties of which inferior intelligences can, by progressive steps, arrive ultimately at the supreme contriver, is more agreeable to our ideas of dignity, and tends to impress us with more exalted sentiments, than viewing the Deity directly in all the individual impressions we receive, divided in the infinity of particular events, and unlawful, by his continual preface in operations to our view insignificant and mean.\"\n\nThis active substance, or secondary cause, our author concludes to be neither matter nor mind. \"Matter (says he) is a being, as a whole quietest and inactive, but constituted of active parts, which resist separation, or cohere, giving what is usually denominated solidity to the mass. Mind is a substance which thinks. A being which should answer to neither of these definitions, would be neither matter nor mind; but an immaterial, and, if I may so say, an immental substance.\" Such is the active substance of Mr Young, which, considered as the cause of motion, seems not to differ greatly from the plastic nature, hyloarchical principle, or vis gentrix, of others. The manner in which it operates is indeed much more minutely detailed by our author than by any other philosopher, ancient or modern, with whose writings we have any acquaintance.\n\n\"Every thing (he says) must be in its own nature either disposed to rest or motion; consequently the active substance must be considered as a being naturally either quietest or motive. But it cannot be naturally quietest; for then it could not be active, because activity, which is a tendency to motion, cannot originate in a tendency to rest. Therefore the active substance is by nature motive, that is, tending to motion. The active substance is not solid, and does not resist penetration. It is therefore incapable of impelling or of sustaining impulse. Whence it follows, that as it tends to move, and is incapable of having its motion impeded by impulse, it must actually and continually move: in other words, motion is essential to the active substance.\n\n\"In order that this substance may act, some other thing upon which it may produce a change is necessary; for whatever suffers an action, receives some change. The active substance, in acting on some other thing, must impart and unite itself thereto; for its action is communicating its activity. But it cannot communicate its activity without imparting its substance: because it is the substance alone which produces activity, and the quality cannot be separated from the substance. Therefore the active substance acts by uniting itself with the substance on which it acts. The union of this substance with bodies, is not to be conceived of as a junction of small parts intimately blended together and attached at their surfaces; but as an entire diffusion and incorporation of one substance with another in perfect coexistence. As bodies are not naturally active, whenever they become so, as they always do in motion, it must be by the accession of some part of the active substance. The active substance being imparted to a body, penetrates the most solid or resisting parts, and does not reside in the pores without, and at the surfaces of the solid parts. For the activity is imparted to the body itself; and not to its pores, which are no parts of the body: therefore if the active substance remained within the pores, the cause would not be present with its effect; but the cause would be in one place and the effect in another, which is impossible.\n\n\"Bodies by their impulse on others lose their activity in proportion to the impulse. This is matter of observation. Bodies which suffer impulse acquire activity in proportion to the impulse. This also is matter of observation. In impulse, therefore, the active substance passes out of the impelling body into the body impelled. For since bodies in motion are active, and activity consists in the presence of the active substance, and by impulse bodies lose their activity, therefore they lose their active substance, and the loss is proportional to the impulse. Bodies impelled acquire activity; therefore acquire active substance, and the acquisition is proportioned to the impulse. But the active substance lost by the impelling body ought to be concluded to be that found in the other; because there is no other receptacle than the impelled body to which the substance parted from can be traced, nor any other source than the active body whence that which is found can be derived. Therefore, in impulse, the active substance ought to be concluded to pass from the impelling body to the body impelled. The flowing of such a substance is a sufficient cause of the communication of activity, and no other rational cause can be assigned.\n\n\"The continued motion of a body depends not upon its inertia, but upon the continuance of the active substance within the body. The motion of a body is produced by the motion of the active substance in union with the body. It being evident, that since the active substance itself does always move, whatever it is united to will be moved along with it, if no obstacle prevent. In mere motion, the body moved is the patient, and the active substance the agent. In impulse,\nimpulse, the body in motion may be considered as an agent, as it is made active by its active substance.\u2014While the active substance is flowing out of the active body into the obstacle or impelled body, the active body will press or impel the obstacle. For while the active substance is yet within the body, although flowing through it, it does not cease to impart to the body its own nature, nor can the body cease to be active because not yet deprived of the active substance. Therefore during its passing out of the body, such portion of the active substance as is yet within, is urging and disposing the body to move, in like manner as if the active substance were continuing in the body; and the body being thus urged to move, but impeded from moving, presses or impels the obstacle.\n\n\"We see here (says our author) an obvious explanation of impulse; it consists in the flowing of the active substance from a source into a receptacle;\" and he thinks, that although the existence of such a substance had not been established on any previous grounds, the communication of motion by impulse does alone afford a sufficient proof of its reality.\n\nHe employs the agency of the same substance to account for many other apparent activities in bodies, such as those of fire, electricity, attraction, repulsion, elasticity, &c. All the apparent origins of corporeal activity serve, he says, to impart the active substance to bodies; \"and where activity is without any manifest origin, the active substance is derived from an invisible source.\"\n\nOur limits will not permit us to attend him in his solution of all the apparent activities in bodies; but the orbicular motions of the planets have been accounted for in so many different ways by philosophers ancient and modern, and each account has been so little satisfactory to him who can think, and wishes to trace effects from adequate causes, that we consider it as our duty to furnish our readers with the account of this phenomenon which is given by Mr Young.\n\nThe question which has been so long agitated, \"Whence is the origin of motion?\" our author considers as implying an absurdity. \"It supposes (says he) that rest was the primitive state of matter, and that motion was produced by a subsequent act. But this supposition must ever be rejected, as it is giving precedence to the inferior, and inverting the order of nature.\" The substance which he holds to be the basis of matter is essentially active; and its action is motion. This motion, however, in the original element, was power without direction, agency without order, activity to no end. To this power it was necessary that a Law should be superadded; that its agency should be guided to some regular purpose, and its motion confine to the production of some uniform effects. Our author shows, or endeavours to show, by a process of reasoning which shall be examined elsewhere, that the primary atoms of matter are produced by the circular motion of the parts of this substance round a centre; and that a similar motion of a number of these atoms around another centre common to them all, produces what in common language is called a solid body; a cannon ball, for instance, the terrestrial globe, and the body of the sun, &c. In a word, he fails to prove, and with no small success, that a principle of union is implied in the revolving or circulating movements of the active substance.\n\n\"But we may also assume (he says) a priori, that a principle of union is a general law of nature; because we see in fact all the component parts of the universe are united systems, which successively combine into larger unions, and ultimately form one whole.\" Let us then suppose the sun with all his planets, primary and secondary, to be already formed for the purpose of making one system, and the orbits of all of them, as well as these great bodies themselves, to be pervaded by the active substance, which necessarily exists in a state of motion, and is the cause of the motion of every thing corporeal. \"If to this motion a principle of union be added, the effect of such a principle would be a determination of all the parts of the active substance, and of course all the bodies to which it is united, towards a common centre, which would be at rest, and void of any tendency in any direction. But this determination of all the parts of the system towards a common centre, tends to the destruction both of the motion of the active substance and of the system; for though all the parts continually approximate from a circumference towards a centre, the sun and planets would at last meet, and form one solid and quiescent mass. But to preserve existence, and consequently motion, is the first law of the active substance, as of all being; and it cannot be doubted, that to preserve distinct the several parts of the solar system, is the first law given to the substance actuating that system. The union of the system is a subsequent law.\n\n\"When the direct tendency of any inferior law is obviated by a higher law, the inferior law will operate indirectly in the manner the nearest to its direct tendency that the superior law will permit. If a body in motion be obliquely obstructed, it will move on in a direction oblique to its first motion. Now the law of union, which pervades the solar system, being continually obstructed by the law of self-preservation, the motion of the active substance, and of the bodies to which it is united, can be no other than a revolving motion about the common centre of approach, towards which all the parts have a determination. But when this revolution has actually taken place, it gives birth to a new tendency, which supersedes the operation of the law of self-preservation. It has been shown, that the motion essential to the active substance, required to be governed by some law to give being to an orderly state of things. Now, there are motions simple and motions complex; the more simple is in all things first in order, and out of the more simple the more complex arises in order posterior. The most simple motion is rectilinear; therefore a rectilinear motion is to be considered as that which is the original and natural state of things, and consequently that to which all things tend. It will follow from hence, that when any portion of active substance in which the law of union operates, has in the manner above explained been compelled to assume a revolving motion, that is, a motion in some curve; a tendency to a rectilinear motion will continually exist in every part of the revolving portion, and in every point of the curve which it describes during its revolution. And this rectilinear tendency will be a tendency to recede from the centre in every point.\npoint of the revolving orbit, and to proceed in a tangent to the orbit at each point. These two tendencies, if not originally equal, must necessarily in all cases arrive at an equality. For the tendency towards the centre, called the centripetal tendency, that is, the law of union, operating first, if we suppose the motion approaches the centre, the tendency to recede from it, called the centrifugal tendency, will have its proportion to the centripetal continually increased as the orbit of revolution grows less, so as ultimately to equal the centripetal tendency, and restrain the motion from its central course, at which point it will no longer seek the centre but revolve round it.\n\nAs our author holds that every atom of matter is formed by the motion of parts of the active substance, and every body formed by the motion of atoms; so he maintains, not only that the sun, moon, earth, planets, and stars, are penetrated by the same substance, but that each is the centre of a vortex of that substance, and that these vortices some are included within others. \"The subtle revolving fluid, the centre of whose vortex the earth occupies, not only surrounds but pervades the earth, and other vortices their earths, to their centres; and the earth and planets are by its revolutions carried around on their own axes. The earth is an inactive mass, and all its component masses are feverishly as well as collectively inactive; but the earth and all its parts have various collective and separate movements, imparted from the fluid which surrounds, pervades, and constitutes it. Being immersed together with its proper surrounding sphere or vortex in the larger sphere or vortex of the sun, it is carried thereby in a larger orbit about the sun, at the same time that by the revolution of its proper sphere it rotates on its own axis.\"\n\nSuch is the most complete view which our limits will permit us to give of Mr Young's theory of motion. To the philosopher who considers experiment as the only test of truth, and who in all his inquiries employs his hands more than his head, we are fully aware that it will appear in no better light than as \"the baseless fabric of a vision.\" Even to the intellectual philosopher who is not frightened at the word metaphysic, we are afraid that such an active substance as the author contends for, will appear as inadequate to the production of the phenomena of gravitation and repulsion as the material ether of Mr Jones and his followers. A being void of intelligence, whether it be material or immaterial, quiescent or active, cannot be the subject of law, in the proper sense of the word. The laws of which Mr Young speaks as necessary to regulate the motions of the active substance, must be mere forces, applied by some extrinsic and superior power. And since \"motion, as it is essential to the active substance, is power without direction, agency without order, activity to no end; since it is of such a nature, that from its unguided agitations there could result neither connexion, order, nor harmony;\" it follows that those extrinsic forces must be perpetually applied, because what is essential to any substance can never be destroyed or changed so long as the substance itself remains.\n\nForces producing order out of confusion, can be applied only by a being possessed of intelligence; and if the immediate and perpetual agency of an intelligent being be necessary to regulate the motions of the active substance, that substance itself may be thought futileless, and its very existence be denied. Entia non sunt multiplicanda ab ipso necesse, is a rule of philosophizing which every man of science acknowledges to be just. And it will hardly be denied, that the immediate and perpetual agency of an intelligent being upon Mr Jones's ethereal fluid, or even upon the matter of solid bodies themselves, would be capable of producing every kind of motion without the intrusiveness of a substance which is neither mind nor matter.\n\nSuch, we conceive, are the objections which our metaphysical readers may make to this theory. Part of their force, however, will perhaps be removed by the ingenious manner in which our author analyzes matter into an immaterial principle. But so much of it remains, that the writer of this article is inclined to believe that no mechanical account can be given of the motions of the heavenly bodies, the growth of plants, and various other phenomena which are usually foiled by attraction and repulsion. In the present age, philosophers in general are strangely averse from admitting the agency of mind; yet as every effect must have a cause, it is surely not irrational to attribute such effects as mechanism cannot produce to the operation either of intelligence or instinct. To suppose the Deity the immediate agent in the great motions of the universe, has been deemed impious; and it must be confessed that very impious conclusions have been deduced from that principle. But there is surely no impiety in supposing, with the excellent bishop of Cloyne, that the fluid which is known to pervade the solar system, and to operate with restless force, may be animated by a powerful mind, which acts intuitively for ends of which it knows nothing. For the existence of such a mind, no other evidence, indeed, can be brought than what is afforded by a very ancient and very general tradition, and by the impossibility of accounting for the phenomena upon principles of mere mechanism. Perhaps some of our more pious readers may be inclined to think that the Supreme Being has committed the immediate government of the various planetary systems to powerful intelligences, or angels, who, as his ministers, direct their motions with wisdom and foresight. Such an opinion is certainly not absurd in itself; and it seems to be countenanced by an ancient writer*, who, though not known by the name of a philosopher, knew as much of the matter as any founder of the most celebrated school.\n\nTo object to either of these hypotheses, as has been sometimes done, that it represents the government of the world as a perpetual miracle, betrays the grossest ignorance; for we might as well call the movements of the bodies of men and brutes, which are certainly produced by minds, miraculous. We do not affirm that either hypothesis is certainly true; but they are both as probable and as satisfactory as the hypothesis which attributes agency to attraction and repulsion to a subtle ether, or to a substance which is neither mind nor matter. Were the immediate agency of intellect to be admitted, there would be no room for many of those disputes which have been agitated among philosophers, about the increase or diminution of motion in\nMotion in the universe; because an intelligent agent, which could begin motion as well as carry it on, might increase or diminish it as he should judge proper. If instinctive agency, or something similar to it, be adopted, there is the same room for investigation as upon the principles of mechanism; because instinct works blindly, according to steady laws imposed by a superior mind, which may be discovered by observation of their effects. As we consider this as by much the most probable hypothesis of the two, we find ourselves involved in the following question: \"If a certain quantity of motion was originally communicated to the matter of the universe, how comes it to pass that the original quantity still remains?\" Considering the many opposite and contradictory motions which since the creation have taken place in the universe, and which have undoubtedly destroyed a great part of the original quantity, by what means has that quantity been restored?\n\nIf this question can be solved by natural means, it must be upon the principles of Newton; for, \"in every case where quantities and relations of quantities are required, it is the province of mathematics to supply the information sought;\" and all philosophers agree that Sir Isaac's doctrine of the composition and resolution of motion, though in what respects the heavenly bodies it may have no physical reality, is so mathematically just, as to be the only principle from which the quantity of motion, or the force of powers, can in any case be computed. If we choose to answer the question, by saying that the motion lost is restored by the interposition of the Deity, then we might as well have had recourse to him at first, and say that he alone is the true principle of motion throughout the creation.\n\nBefore we are reduced to this dilemma, however, it is necessary, in the first place, to inquire whether there is or can be any real diminution of the quantity of motion throughout the universe? In this question the Cartesians take the negative side; and maintain, that the Creator at the beginning impressed a certain quantity of motion on bodies, and that under such laws as that no part of it should be lost, but the same portion of motion should be constantly preserved in matter; and hence they conclude, that if any moving body strike on any other body, the former loses no more of its motion than it communicates to the latter. Sir Isaac Newton takes the contrary side, and argues in the following manner: \"From the various compositions of two motions, it is manifest there is not always the same quantity of motion in the world; for if two balls, joined together by a slender wire, revolve with an uniform motion about their common centre of gravity, and at the same time that centre be carried uniformly in a right line drawn in the plane of their circular motion, the sum of the motions of the two balls, as often as they are in a right line, drawn from their common centre of gravity, will be greater than the sum of their motions when they are in a line perpendicular to that other. Whence it appears, that motion may be both generated and lost. But, by reason of the tenacity of fluid bodies, and the friction of their parts, with the weakness of the elastic power in solid bodies, nature seems to incline much rather to the destruction than the production of motion; and in reality, motion becomes continually less and less. For bodies which are either so perfectly hard or so soft as to have no elastic power, will not rebound from each other; their impenetrability will only stop their motion. And if two such bodies equal to one another be carried with equal but opposite motions, so as to meet in a void space, by the laws of motion they must stop in the very place of concourse, lose all their motion, and be at rest for ever, unless they have an elastic power to give them a new motion. If they have elasticity enough to make them rebound with one-fourth, one-half, or three-fourths, of the force they meet with, they will lose three-fourths, one-half, or one-fourth, of their motion. And this is confirmed by experiments: for if two equal pendulums be let fall from equal heights, so as to strike full upon each other; if those pendulums be of lead or soft clay, they will lose all, or almost all, their motion; and if they be of any elastic matter, they will only retain so much motion as they receive from their elastic power.\"\n\nMotion, therefore, being thus, in the opinion of our celebrated author, lost, or absolutely destroyed, it is necessary to find some cause by which it may be renewed. Such renovation Sir Isaac attributes to active principles; for instance, \"the cause of gravity, whereby the planets and comets preserve their motions in their orbits, and all bodies acquire a great degree of motion in falling; and the cause of fermentation, whereby the heart and blood of animals preserve a perpetual warmth and motion, the inner parts of the earth are kept perpetually warmed; many bodies burn and shine, and the sun himself burns and shines, and with his light warms and cheers all things.\"\n\nElasticity is another cause of the renovation of motion mentioned by Sir Isaac. \"We find but little motion in the world (says he), except what plainly flows either from these active principles, or from the command of the willer.\"\n\nWith regard to the destruction or positive loss of motion, however, we must observe, that notwithstanding the authority of Sir Isaac Newton, it is altogether impossible that any such thing can happen. All moving bodies which come under the cognizance of our senses are merely passive, and acted upon by something which we call powers or fluids, and which are to us totally invisible. Motion, therefore, cannot be lost without a destruction or diminution of one of these powers, which we have no reason to think can ever happen. When two pendulums pull against each other, the motion is the mere effect of the action of gravity; and that action, which in this case is the power, continues to be the very same whether the pendulum moves or moves not. Could motion, therefore, be exhausted in this case, we must suppose, that by separating two pendulums to the same distance from each other, and then letting them come together for a great number of times, they would at last meet with less force than before. But there is certainly not the least foundation for this supposition; and no rational person will take it into his head, that supposing the whole human race had employed themselves in nothing else from the creation to the present day, but separating pendulums and letting them stop each other's motion, they would now come together with less force than they did at first. Power, therefore, which is the cause\nMotion, is absolutely indestructible. Powers may indeed counteract one another, or they may be made to counteract themselves; but the moment that the obstacle is removed, they show themselves in their pristine vigour, without the least symptom of abatement or decay.\n\nWhether, therefore, we reckon the ultimate source of motion to be spiritual or material, it is plain that it must be to our conceptions infinite; neither will the phenomena of nature allow us to give any other explanation than we have done: for no power whatever can lose more than its own quantity; and it seems absurd to think that the Deity would create the world in such a manner that it would ultimately become immoveable, and then have recourse to unknown principles to remedy the supposed defect. On the principle we have now just laid down, however, the matter becomes exceedingly plain and obvious. The Creator at first formed two opposite powers, the action of which is varied according to the circumstances of the bodies upon which they act; and these circumstances are again varied by the action of the powers themselves in innumerable ways upon one another, and the approach of one body to another, or their receding to a greater distance. Where these powers happen to oppose each other directly, the body on which they act is at rest; when they act obliquely, it moves in the diagonal; or if the force acting upon one side is by any means lessened, the body certainly must move towards that side, as is evident from the case of the atmosphere, the pressure of which, when removed from one side of a body, will make it move very violently towards that side; and if we could continually keep off the pressure in this manner, the motion would assuredly be perpetual. We must not imagine that motion is destroyed because it is counteracted; for it is impossible to destroy motion by any means but removing the cause; counteracting the effect is only a temporary obstacle, and must cease whenever the obstacle is removed. Nature, therefore, having in itself an infinite quantity of motion, produces greater or lesser motions, according to the various action of the moving powers upon different bodies or upon one another, without a possibility of the general flock being either augmented or diminished, unless one of the moving powers was to be withdrawn by the Creator; in which case, the other would destroy the whole system in an instant. As to the nature of these great original of the moving powers, we must confess ourselves totally ignorant; nor do we perceive any data from which the nature of them can be investigated. The elements of light, air, &c., are the agents; but in what manner they act, or in what manner they received their action, can be known only to the Creator.\n\nPerpetual Motion, in Mechanics, a motion which is supplied and renewed from itself, without the intervention of any external cause; or it is an uninterrupted communication of the same degree of motion from one part of matter to another, in a circle or other curve returning into itself, so that the same momentum still returns undiminished upon the first mover.\n\nThe celebrated problem of a perpetual motion consists in the inventing a machine, which has the principle of its motion within itself. M. de la Hire has demonstrated the impossibility of any such machine, and finds that it amounts to this, viz., to find a body which is both heavier and lighter at the same time, or to find a body which is heavier than itself.\n\nAnimal Motion, that which is performed by animals at the command of the mind or will.\n\nThough all the motions of animals, whether voluntary or involuntary, are performed by means of the muscles and nerves, yet neither these nor the subtile fluid which resides in them are to be accounted the ultimate sources of animal motion. They depend entirely upon the mind for those motions which are properly to be accounted animal. All the involuntary motions, such as those of the blood, the heart, muscles, organs subservient to respiration and digestion, &c., are to be classed with those of vegetables; for though no vegetables have them in such perfection as animals, there are yet traces of them to be found evidently among vegetables, and that so remarkably, that some have imagined the animal and vegetable kingdoms to approach each other so nearly that they could scarcely be distinguished by a philosophic eye. See Muscle.\n\nThough the motions of animals, however, depend on the action of the mind or of the will, external objects seem originally to have the command of the mind itself; for unless an animal perceive something, it will not be inclined to act. By means of the ideas once received, indeed, and retained in the memory, it acquires a self-moving power, independent of any object present at the time, which is not the case with vegetables; for however they may act from a present impulse, their motions never appear to be derived from any source which may not be accounted strictly mechanical.\n\nAccording to some, motion is the cause of sensation itself; and indeed it seems very probable that the motions of that subtile fluid, called light or electricity, in our bodies always accompany our sensations; but whether these be the cause, or only the medium, of sense, cannot be discovered.\n\nThough all animals are endowed with a power of voluntary motion, yet there is a very great variety in the degrees of that power; to determine which no certain rules can be assigned; neither can we, from the situation and manner of life of animals, derive any probable reason why the motion of one should differ so very much from that of another. This difference does not arise from their size, their ferocity, their timidity, nor any other property that we can imagine. The elephant, though the strongest land animal, is by no means the swiftest in its motions; the horse is much swifter than the bull, though there is not much difference in their size; a greyhound is much swifter than a cat, though the former be much larger, and though both live in the same manner, viz., by hunting. Among insects, the same unaccountable diversity is observable. The louse and flea are both vermin, are both nearly of the same size, and both feed on the bodies of animals; yet there is no comparison between the swiftness of their motions: while the bug, which is much larger than either, seems to have a kind of medium swiftness between both.\u2014This very remarkable circumstance seems not even to depend on the range which animals are obliged to take in order to procure food for themselves: the motion of a snail is slower than that of an earthworm; while that\nthat of many caterpillars is much quicker than either; though we can scarce determine which of the three has the greatest or the least extensive range for its food.\n\nOf all animals the shell fish move the most, in much that some have supposed them to be entirely defective of locomotive powers; and muscles particularly are denied to have any faculty of this kind. Every one knows that these animals can open and shut their shells at pleasure; and it cannot escape observation, that in every muscle there is a fleshy protuberance of a much redder colour than the rest. This has been thought to be a tongue or proboscis, by which the animal takes in its food; but is in reality the instrument of its motion from place to place. This protuberance is divided into two lobes, which perform the office of feet. When the river muscle is inclined to remove from its station, it opens its shell, thrusts out this protuberance, and digs a furrow in the sand; and into this furrow, by the action of the same protuberance, the shell is made to fall in a vertical position. It is recovered out of this into the former horizontal one, by pushing back the sand with the same tentacles, lengthening the furrow, and thus the animal continues its journey by a continual turning topsy-turvy.\u2014Marine muscles perform their motions in the same manner, and by similar instruments. In general they are firmly attached to rocks or small stones by threads about two inches long, which are spun from a glutinous substance in the protuberances already mentioned.\n\nOther animals which inhabit bivalved shells, perform their motions by a kind of leg or foot; which, however, they can alter into almost any figure they please. By means of this leg they can not only sink into the mud, or rise out of it at pleasure, but can even leap from the place where they are; and this can be done by the limpit, which people are apt to imagine one of the most sluggish animals in nature.\u2014When this creature is about to make a spring, it sets its shell on edge, as if to diminish friction; then, stretching out the leg as far as possible, it makes it embrace a portion of the shell, and by a sudden movement, similar to that of a spring let loose, it strikes the earth with its leg, and actually leaps to a considerable distance.\n\nThe spout, or razor-fish, is said to be incapable of moving forward horizontally on the surface; but it digs a hole sometimes two feet deep in the sand, in which it can ascend or descend at pleasure. The leg, by which it performs all its movements, is fleshy, cylindrical, and pretty long; and the animal can at pleasure make it assume the form of a ball. When lying on the surface of the sand, and about to sink into it, the leg is extended from the inferior end of the shell, and makes the extremity of it take on the form of a shovel, sharp on each side, and terminating in a point. With this instrument the animal makes a hole in the sand; after which it advances the leg still farther into it, makes it assume the form of a hook, and with this, as a fulcrum, it obliges the shell to descend into the hole. This operation is continued until the whole shell be covered; and when the animal wishes to regain the surface, it makes the extremity of the leg to assume the form of a ball, and makes an effort to extend it. The ball, however, prevents any farther descent, and the reaction of the muscular effort raises up the whole shell, which operation is continued until it reaches the surface; and it is surprising with what facility these motions are accomplished by an animal seemingly so little qualified to move at all. Another particularity in this fish is, that though it lives among salt water, it abhors salt so much, that when a little is thrown into its hole it instantly leaves it. But it is still more remarkable, that if you once take hold of the spout fish, and then allow it to retire into its hole, it cannot then be driven out by salt; though unless it be taken hold of by the hand, the application of salt will make it come to the surface as often as you please.\n\nAll other shell fish, even those apparently the most sluggish and destitute of any apparatus for motion, are found to be furnished with such instruments as enable them to perform all those movements for which they have any occasion. Thus the scallop, a well-known animal inhabiting a bivalved shell, can both swim upon the surface of water and move upon land. When it happens to be deserted by the tide, it opens its shell to the full extent, and shutting it again with a sudden jerk, the reaction of the ground gives such an impulse to the whole, that it sometimes springs five or six inches from the ground; and by a continued repetition of this action, it gradually tumbles forward until it regains the water. Its method of falling is still more curious. Having attained the surface of the water by means unknown to us, it opens the shell, and puts one half above water, the other with the body of the animal in it remaining below. Great numbers of them are thus frequently seen falling in company with their shells sticking up above water when the weather is fine, and the wind acting upon them as sails; but on the least alarm they instantly shut their shells, and all sink to the bottom together.\n\nThe oyster has generally been supposed one of the most sluggish animals in nature, and totally incapable of voluntary motion; but from the researches of the Abb\u00e9 Dicquemare, this opinion seems to be erroneous. The oyster, like many other bivalved shell-fish, has a power of squirting water out from its body; and this property may easily be observed by putting some of them into a plate with as much sea water as will cover them. The water is ejected with so much force, as not only to repel the approach of ordinary enemies, but to move the whole animal backwards or forwards, in a direction contrary to that in which the water was ejected. It has been also supposed, that oysters are destitute of sensation; but M. Dicquemare has shown, that they not only possess sensation, but that they are capable of deriving knowledge from experience. When removed from such places as are entirely covered with the sea, when destitute of experience, they open their shells and die in a few days; but if they happen to escape this danger, and the water covers them again, they will not open their shells again, but keep them shut, as if warned by experience to avoid a danger similar to what they formerly underwent.\n\nThe motions of the sea-urchin are perhaps more curious and complicated than those of any other animal. It inhabits a beautiful multivalved shell, divided into triangular compartments, and covered with great numbers of prickers; from which last circumstance it receives the name of sea urchin or sea hedgehog. The triangles\nMotion. Triangles are separated from one another by regular belts, and perforated by a great number of holes, from every one of which issues a flaky horn similar to that of a snail, and capable of moving in a similar manner. The principal use of these horns seems to be to fix the animal to rocks or stones, though it likewise makes use of them in its progressive motion. By means of these horns and prickers, it is enabled to walk either on its back or its belly; but it most commonly makes use of those which are near the mouth. Occasionally it has a progressive motion by turning round like a wheel.\n\nThe animals called sea-nettles or medusae, though extremely slow in their motions, are nevertheless evidently capable of moving at pleasure from place to place. The variety of their figure is such, that it is difficult to assign them any determinate figure whatever. In general, however, they resemble a truncated cone, the base of which is applied to the rock to which they adhere. Their colours are various, whitish, brown, red or greenish; the mouth is very large; and when opened appears surrounded with filaments resembling the horns of snails, which being disposed in three rows around it, give the animal the appearance of a flower; and through every one of these the animal has the power of squirting the sea water. The structure of these animals is extremely singular; they consisting all of one organ, viz. a stomach. When searching for food, they extend their filaments, and quickly entangle any small animals that come within their reach. The prey is instantly swallowed, and the mouth that close upon it like a purse; in which state it remains for many days before the nutritive parts are extracted. The animal, though scarcely an inch or an inch and a half in diameter, is nevertheless too dilatable, that it can swallow large whelks and mussels, the shells of which are thrown out by the mouth after the nutritive parts have been exhausted. Sometimes the shell is too large to be voided this way; in which case the body of the animal splits, and the shell is voided through the opening, which in a short time heals up again. The progressive motion of this creature is so slow, that it resembles that of the hour hand of a clock, and is performed by means of innumerable muscles placed on the outside of the body. All these are tubular, and filled with a fluid, which makes them project like prickers. On occasion it can likewise loosen the base of the cone from the rock, and inverting its body, move by means of the filaments already mentioned, which surround the mouth; but even the motion performed in this manner is almost as slow as the other.\n\nSome animals are capable of moving backwards, apparently with the same facility that they do forwards, and that by means of the same instruments which move them forward. The common house fly exhibits an instance of this, and frequently employs this retrograde motion in its ordinary courses; though we cannot know the reason of its employing such an extraordinary method. Another remarkable instance is given by Mr Smellie in the mason-bee. This is one of the solitary species, and has its name from the mode of constructing its nest with mud or mortar. Externally this nest has no regular appearance, but at first sight is taken for a quantity of dirt adhering to the wall; though the internal part be furnished with cells in the same regular manner with the nests of other insects of the bee kind. When this bee leaves its cell, another frequently takes possession of it; in which case a battle never fails to ensue, on the return of the real proprietor. The dispute is decided in the air; and each party endeavours to get above the other, as birds of prey are wont to do in order to give a downward blow. The undermost one, to avoid the stroke, instead of flying forward or laterally, always flies backward. The encounter is so violent, that when they strike, both parties fall to the ground.\n\nVegetable Motion. Though vegetables have not the power of moving from one place to another like animals, they are nevertheless capable of moving their different parts in such a manner as would lead us to suspect that they are actuated by a sort of instinct. Hence many have been induced to suppose, that the animal and vegetable kingdoms are in a manner indistinguishable from one another; and that the highest degree of vegetable life can hardly be known from the lowest degree of animal life. The essential and invariable distinction, however, between the two, is the faculty of sensation, and loco-motion in consequence of it. Were it not, indeed, for the manifestation of sense by moving from one place to another, we should not be able to tell whether vegetables were possessed of sensation or not; but whatever motions they may be possessed of, it is certain that no vegetable has the faculty of moving from one place to another. Some have endeavoured to distinguish the two kingdoms by the digestion of food; alleging that plants have no proper organs, such as a stomach, &c., for taking in and digesting their aliment. But to this it has been replied, that the whole body of a vegetable is a stomach, and absorbs its food at every pore. This, however, seems not to be a sufficient answer. All animals take in their food at intervals, and there is not a single instance of one which eats perpetually. The food is also taken into the body of the animal, and application of the parts made by means of the internal organization of the viscera; but in vegetables, their whole bodies are immersed in their food, and absorb it by the surface, as animal bodies will sometimes absorb liquids when put into them. The roots of a tree indeed will change their direction when they meet with a stone, and will turn from barren into fertile ground; but this is evidently mere mechanism, without any proof of will or sensation; for the nourishment of the root comes not from the stone, but from the earth around it; and the increase in size is not owing to any expansion of the matter which the root already contains, but to the apposition of new matter; whence the increase of size must always take place in the direction from whence the nourishment proceeds. On this principle also may we explain the reason why the roots of a tree, after having arrived at the edge of a ditch, instead of shooting out into the air, will creep down the one side, along the bottom, and up the other.\n\nIn their other movements the vegetables discover nothing like sensation or design. They will indeed uniformly bend towards light, or towards water; but in the one case we must attribute the phenomenon to the action of the elements of light and air upon them; and in the latter, the property seems to be the same with what in other cases we call attraction. Thus, if\nMotion. a root be uncovered, and a wet sponge placed near it in a direction different from that in which the root was proceeding, it will soon alter its position, and turn towards the sponge; and thus we may vary the direction of the root as often as we please. The efforts of a plant to turn from darkness or shade into sunshine are very remarkable; as in order to accomplish this, not only the leaves will be inclined, but even the stems and branches twisted. When a wet sponge is held under the leaves of a tree, they bend down in order to touch it. If a vessel of water be put within six inches of a growing cucumber, in less than 24 hours the latter will alter its direction; the branches will bend towards the water, and never alter their course until they come in contact with it. The most remarkable instance of this kind of motion, however, is, that when a pole is brought near a vine, the latter will turn towards it, and never cease extending its branches till it lays hold of the support.\n\nThe motions of the sensitive plant, and others of the same kind, have been considered as very wonderful; but it is doubtful if any of them be really more so than that of the vine just mentioned. None of these show any kind of propensity to move without an actual touch. A very slight one, indeed, makes the sensitive plant contract, and the whole branch, together with the leaves, bend down towards the earth.\u2014These phenomena are by some ascribed to electricity. Even the motions of the *Hedysarum gyrans*, which at first sight seem so much more surprising than those of the sensitive plant, may it be supposed admit of explanation upon the same principle. The American plant called *Dionaea muscipula*, or Venus's fly-trap, is another example of very wonderful mechanism in vegetables, though even this does not argue any degree of sensation in this plant more than in others. The leaves of the *Dionaea* are jointed, and furnished with two rows of prickles. A number of small glands upon the surface secrete a sweet juice which entices flies to come and settle upon it; but the moment these insects touch the fatal spot, the leaves fold up, and squeeze them to death between the prickles. The leaves fold up in the same manner when the plant is touched with a straw or pin. The *Drosera rotundifolia* and *Lonicera*, round and long-leaved sundew, plants of our own country, not uncommon in boggy ground, possess a similar structure, and perform similar functions.\n\nThe folding up of the leaves of certain plants in the absence of the sun's light, called their sleep, affords another very curious instance of vegetable motion.\u2014Almost all vegetables, indeed, undergo such a remarkable change in the night, that it is difficult to know exactly how many kinds do really sleep. They fold up their leaves in many different ways; but all agree in disposing of them in such a manner as to afford the best protection to the young stems, flower buds or fruit. The leaves of the tamarind tree contract round the young fruit in order to protect it from nocturnal cold; and those of fennel, glycina, and many other papilionaceous plants, dispose of their leaves in the same manner. The leaves of the chickweed, *Alyssum triplicis*, &c., are disposed in opposite pairs. In the night time they rise perpendicularly, and join so close at the top that the flowers are concealed by them. In like manner do the leaves protect the flowers of the *Fida* or *Althaea theo-*\n\nAll these are erected during the night; but those of the white lupine, in time of sleep, hang down.\n\nThe flowers of plants also have motions peculiar to themselves. Many of them during the night are enclosed in their calyxes. Some, particularly those of the German spurge, *Geranium striatum*, and common whitlow grass, when asleep, bend towards the earth; by which means the noxious effects of rain or dew are prevented. All these motions have been commonly ascribed to the sun's rays; and Mr. Smele informs us that in some of the examples above mentioned the effects were evidently to be ascribed to heat: but plants kept in a hot-house, where the temperature of the day and night are alike, contract their leaves, and sleep in the same manner as if they were exposed to the open air; \"whence it appears (says he), that the sleep of plants, is owing rather to a peculiar law, than to a quicker or slower motion of the juices.\" He suspects, therefore, that as the sleep of plants is not owing to the mere absence of heat, it may be occasioned by the want of light; and to ascertain this he proposes an experiment of throwing upon them a strong artificial light. If notwithstanding this light (says he), the plants are not roused, but continue to sleep as usual, then it may be presumed that their organs, like those of animals, are not only irritable, but require the re-poration of some invigorating influence which they have lost while awake, by the agitations of the air and of the sun's rays, by the act of growing, or by some other latent cause.\" On this, however, we must remark, that the throwing of artificial light upon plants cannot be attended with the same consequences as that of the light of the sun, unless the former were as strong as the latter, which is impossible; and even granting that we could procure an artificial light as strong as that of the sun, a difference might be occasioned by the different directions of the rays, those of the sun being very nearly parallel, while the rays of all artificial light diverge very greatly. If therefore, we are to make an experiment of this kind, the rays should be rendered parallel by means of a burning mirror. Here again we would be involved in a difficulty? for the rays of the sun proceed all in one direction; but as of necessity we must employ different mirrors in our experiment, the light must fall upon the plant in different directions, so that we could not reasonably expect the same result as when the plants are directly exposed to the rays of the sun.\n\nThe motion of plants, not being deducible from sensation, as in animals, must be ascribed to that property called irritability; and this property is possessed infallibly by the parts of animals in a greater degree than even by the most irritable vegetable. The muscular fibres will contract on the application of any stimulating substance, even after they are detached from the body to which they belonged. The heart of a frog will continue to beat when pricked with a pin for several hours after it is taken out of the body. The heart of a viper, or of a turtle, beats distinctly from 20 to 30 hours after the death of these animals. When the intestines of a dog, or any other quadruped, are suddenly cut into different portions, all of them crawl about like worms, and contract upon the slightest touch. The heart, intestines, and diaphragm, are the most irritable.\nirritable parts of animal bodies; and to discover whether the quality resides in all plants, experiments should be made chiefly on leaves, flowers, buds, and the tender fibres of the roots.\n\nThe motions of plants are universally ascribed by our author to irritability, to which also we have ascribed them under the article Animal. The term, however, requires an explanation; and to give this in an intelligible manner requires some attention. The most obvious comparison is that of an electrified thread; which on the approach of any unelectrified substance, shows a variety of motions, equally surprising with those of the parts of plants or the muscular fibres cut out of the body. Could we suppose that the electricity of a thread might be preserved after it was cut off from the electrifying substance, it would show as much irritability as even the muscular fibres, or portions of the intestines of animals. We know, from the history of the torpedo, electrical eel, &c., that there are animals in which the electric fluid acts in such a manner as to produce a much more powerful effect than that of giving motion to the leaves of plants. The readiness, therefore, with which this fluid is thrown into agitations when any substance in which it acts is touched, is without doubt the irritability in question; but we have from thence no reason to ascribe sensation to these irritable bodies, than to an electrified bottle when it discharges itself, or makes a cork ball play around it.\n\nIn a paper read before the Academy of Sciences at Paris, by M. Broussonet, the author inclines to confound irritability and sensibility together. \"The different parts of plants (says he) enjoy the faculty of motion; but the motions of a vegetable are very different in their nature from those of an animal: the most sensible, those that are produced with most rapidity in plants, are always influenced by some stimulating cause. Irritability, which is nothing but sensibility made manifest by motion, is a general law to which nature has subjected all living beings; and it is this that continually watches over their preservation. Being more powerful in animals than in plants, it may be often confounded in these last with phenomena that depend on a quite different cause. In the vegetable it is only the organ which is exposed to the action of the stimulating power that moves. Irritation in particular places never produces that prompt combination of sensations which we observe in animals; in consequence of which certain parts are put in motion without being directly affected, and which otherwise might have been passive.\n\n\"The more perfect the organization in the different parts of animals is, the more apparent are the signs of irritability. The parts that come nearest to those of vegetables, and in which of consequence the organization is most imperfect, are the least irritable. The same law holds with regard to plants; but the result is opposite: the signs of irritability are most sensible in proportion to the analogy of the parts with those of animals; and they are imperceptible in those that are dissimilar. This assertion is proved by what we observe in the organs destined in vegetables to perpetuate the species. Those parts alone seem sensible to stimuli; the bark, leaves, stalks, and roots showing no signs of irritability.\n\n\"The motions essentially vital, which have in plants the greatest affinity with those of animals, are the course of the sap, the passage of the air in the trachea, the different positions which the flowers of certain plants take at certain hours of the day, &c. But if we attend to the manner in which all these motions in plants are performed, we shall find that they present a greater number of modifications than the analogous motions that take place in animals. The temperature of the atmosphere, its agitation, light, &c., have great influence on the motions of plants, by accelerating or retarding the course of their fluids; and, as they cannot change their place, these variations produce in them changes more obvious and more uniform than in animals.\"\n\nOur author now proceeds to inform us, that some of the motions of plants are occasioned by the rarity of the juices in plants, and others by their abundance. Of the former kind are those by which the capsules of some plants suddenly burst with a spring, and throw their seeds to some distance. Of the other kind are the actions of the filaments in the parietariae, the inflection of the peduncles of flowers, and of the pistils. \"Those motions (says he) which are particularly observed in the organs destined to the reproduction of the individual, not appearing except in circumstances that render them absolutely necessary, seem in some measure to be the effect of a particular combination: they are, however, merely mechanical; for they are always produced in the same way and in the same circumstances. Thus the role of Jericho, and the dry fruit of several species of meloembryanthemum, do not open but when their vessels are full of water.\n\n\"The sudden disengagement of fluids produces a kind of motion. To this cause we must attribute a great number of phenomena observable in the leaves of several plants, and which do not depend on irritability. The small glands in each leaf of the dionaea are no sooner punctured by an insect, than it instantly folds up and seizes the animal: the puncture seems to operate a disengagement of the fluid which kept the leaf expanded by filling its vesicles. This explanation is the more probable, that in the early state of the vegetation of this plant, when the small glands are hardly evolved, and when probably the juices do not run in sufficient abundance, the leaves are folded up exactly as they appear when punctured by an insect at a more advanced period. We observe a phenomenon similar to this in both species of the drosera (fun-dew), mentioned above. The mechanism here is very easily observable: the leaves are at first folded up; the juices are not yet propelled into the fine hairs with which they are covered; but after they are expanded, the presence of the fluid is manifested by a drop seen at the extremity of each hair: it is by abhorring this fluid that an insect empties the vesicles of the leaf, which then folds up, and resumes its first state: the promptitude of the action is proportioned to the number of hairs touched by the insect. This motion in some degree resembles that which takes place in the limb of an animal kept in a state of flexion by a tumor in the joint; when the matter which obstructed the motion is discharged, the limb instantly returns its former position. The phenomena that depend on the abundance of fluids are particularly evident in plants which grow in wet soils; the drosera and dionaea are of this kind: and it is known by\nMotion by the experiments of Messrs. Du Fay and Du Hamel, that sensitive plants are particularly sensible when the sun is obscured by clouds and the air warm and moist.\n\nThe influence of external causes sometimes modifies the vital motions in plants, that we would be tempted to ascribe them to volition, like those that depend entirely on that faculty in animals. If we set a pole in the ground near a twining plant, it always lays hold of the pole for support, in whatever place we put it. The same thing occurs in the tendrils of the vine; which always attach themselves to the support presented them, on whatever side it may be placed, provided they can reach it: but these motions are entirely vital: the twining plants and the tendrils direct themselves to every quarter, and consequently cannot fail of meeting with the bodies within their reach. These motions are performed as long as the parts continue to grow; but when they cease to elongate, if they have not been able to reach any body on which they can fix, they bend back upon themselves. This and other observations show how far the vital motions in plants may be modified by external causes, and how essentially they differ from those that are the effect of volition in animals.\n\n\"Some plants appear endowed with no sort of motion: some have leaves that can move in different directions: their motions are generally modified by different causes; but none appear so eminently possessed of this quality as the *hedyarum gyrans* of Linnaeus.\u2014No part of this plant shows any signs of irritability upon application of stimuli: and the motion of its foliaceous leaves when the leaflets are agitated by the wind.\u2014When the sun is warm, the little leaves of the hedyarum are also immovable; but when the weather is warm and moist, or when it rains, they move very freely. This motion seems indispensably necessary to the plant; for it begins as soon as the first leaves unfold, and continues even during the night; but in time it grows weaker. In our stoves it is most considerable during the first year; in the second, it is not very sensible: in its native place all the leaves have a motion never observed here. The moving leaflets are most agitated while the plants are in full flower, and the process of fructification goes on. The oscillatory motion is so natural to it, that it not only remains for three or four days in the leaflets of a branch that has been cut off and put in water, but is even continued though the branch be exposed to the air. The leaves seem to perform the office of the heart in vegetables. When a plant is deprived of its leaves, the progress of vegetation is arrested; and such vegetables resemble those animals which have a periodical sleep, induced by a diminution of the action of the heart. Many plants hardly show any signs of motion; many seem also wholly cataleptic; which is rarely if ever found in animals. The footstalks of the flowers of dracocephalum, a Virginian plant, preserve themselves in whatever position they are placed.\n\nMuscular Motion. See Muscle.\n\nMotive, is sometimes applied to that faculty of the human mind, by which we pursue good and avoid evil. Thus Hobbes distinguishes the faculties of the mind into two sorts, the cognitive and motive.\n\nMotoualis, a small nation of Syria, inhabiting to the east of the country of the Druses, in the valley which separates their mountains from those of Damascus; of which the following account is given by Volney in his Travels, vol. ii.\n\nThe characteristic distinction between them and the other inhabitants of Syria (says our author) is, that they, like the Persians, are of the sect of Ali, while all the Turks follow that of Omar or Moaouia. This distinction, occasioned by the schism which in the 36th year of the Hegira arose among the Arabs, respecting the successors of Mahomet, is the cause of an irreconcilable hatred between the two parties. The sectaries of Omar, who consider themselves as the only orthodox, assume the title of Sonnites, which has that signification, and term their adversaries Shiites, that is \"sectaries of Ali.\" The word Motoualis has the same meaning in the dialect of Syria. The followers of Ali, dissatisfied with this name, substitute that of Adlia, which means \"afficers of justice,\" literally \"Jutti-carians;\" a denomination which they have assumed in consequence of a doctrinal point they advance in opposition to the Sonnite faith. A small Arabic treatise, entitled Theological Fragments concerning the Sects and Religions of the World, has the following passage:\n\n\"The sectaries who pretend that God acts only on principles of justice, conformable to human reason, are called Adlia or Jutti-carians. God cannot (say they) command an impracticable worship, nor ordain impossible actions, nor enjoin men to perform what is beyond their ability; but wherever he requires obedience, will bestow the power to obey. He removes the cause of evil, he allows us to reason, and imposes only what is easy, not what is difficult; he makes no man responsible for the actions of another, nor punishes him for that in which he has no part; he imputes not as a crime what himself was created in man; nor does he require him to avoid what destiny has decreed.\u2014This would be injustice and tyranny, of which God is incapable, from the perfection of his being.\" To this doctrine, which diametrically opposes the system of the Sonnites, the Motoualis add certain ceremonies which increase their mutual aversion. They curse Omar and Moaouia as rebels and usurpers; and celebrate Ali and Hosain as saints and martyrs. They begin their ablutions at the elbow, instead of the end of the finger, as is customary with the Turks; they think themselves defiled by the touch of strangers; and, contrary to the general practice of the East, neither eat nor drink out of a vessel which has been used by a person not of their sect, nor will they even sit with such at the same table.\n\nThese doctrines and customs, by separating the Motoualis from their neighbours, have rendered them a distinct society. It is said they have long existed as a nation in this country, though their name has never been mentioned by any European writer before the 18th century; it is not even to be found in the maps of D'Anville: La Roque, who left their country not a hundred years ago, gives them the name of Ame-diens. Be this as it may, in later times their wars, robberies, successes, and various changes of fortune, have rendered them of consequence in Syria. Till about the middle of this century, they only possessed Balbec their capital, and a few places in the valley, and Anti-Lebanon, which seems to have been their original country.\nMotoualis, country. At that period we find them under a like government with the Druzes, that is to say, under a number of Shaiks, with one principal chief of the family of Harrouth. After the year 1750 they established themselves among the heights of Bekaa, and got footing in Lebanon, where they obtained lands belonging to the Maronites, almost as far as Becharrai. They even incommode them so much by their ravages, as to oblige the emir Yousef to attack them with open force and expel them; but on the other side, they advanced along the river even to the neighbourhood of Sour (Tyre). In this situation, Shaik Daher had the address, in 1762, to attach them to his party. The pachas of Saide and Damascus claimed tributes, which they had neglected paying, and complained of several robberies committed on their subjects by the Motoualis; they were delirious of chastising them; but this vengeance was neither certain nor easy. Daher interposed; and by becoming security for the tribute, and promising to prevent any depredations, acquired allies who were able, as it is said, to arm 10,000 horsemen, all resolute and formidable troops. Shortly after they took possession of Sour, and made this village their principal sea port. In 1771 they were of great service to Ali Bey and Daher against the Ottomans. But Emir Yousef having in their absence armed the Druzes, ravaged their country. He was besieging the castle of Djezin, when the Motoualis, returning from Damascus, received intelligence of this invasion. At the relation of the barbarities committed by the Druzes, an advanced corps, of only 500 men, were so enraged, that they immediately rushed forward against the enemy, determined to perish in taking vengeance. But the surprise and confusion they occasioned, and the discord which reigned between the two factions of Manfour and Yousef, so much favoured this desperate attack, that the whole army, consisting of 25,000 men, was completely overthrown.\n\nIn the following year, the affairs of Daher taking a favourable turn, the zeal of the Motoualis cooled towards him, and they finally abandoned him in the catastrophe in which he lost his life. But they have suffered for their imprudence under the administration of the pacha who succeeded him. Since the year 1777, Djezzar, master of Acre and Saide, has incessantly laboured to destroy them. His persecution forced them in 1784 to a reconciliation with the Druzes, and to enter into an alliance with the emir Yousef. Though reduced to less than 700 armed men, they did more in that campaign than 15,000 or 20,000 Druzes and Maronites assembled at Dair-el-Kamar. They alone took the strong fortresses of Mar-Djebaa, and put to the sword 50 or 60 Epirots who defended it. But the misunderstanding which prevailed among the chiefs of the Druzes having rendered abortive all their operations, the pacha has obtained possession of the whole valley, and the city of Balbec itself. At this period not more than 500 families of the Motoualis remained, who took refuge in Anti-Lebanon, and the Lebanon of the Maronites; and, driven as they now are from their native soil, it is probable they will be totally annihilated, and even their very name become extinct.","sp":55,"ep":70},{"h":"MOTTO","t":"in armoury, a short sentence or phrase, carried in a scroll, generally under, but sometimes over, the arms: sometimes alluding to the bearing, sometimes to the name of the bearer, and sometimes containing whatever pleases the fancy of the deviser.

Mr Baker having been favoured with a sight of some of these moulds found in Shropshire, bearing the same types and inscriptions with some of the Roman coins, gave an account of them to the Royal Society. They were found in digging of land, at a place called Ryton in Shropshire, about a mile from the great Watling-street-road. They are all of the size of the Roman denarius, and of little more than the thickness of our halfpenny. They are made of a smooth pot or brick clay, which seems to have been first well cleaned from dirt and sand, and well beaten or kneaded, to render it fit for taking a fair impression. There were a great many of them found together, and there are of them not unfrequently found in Yorkshire; but they do not seem to have been met with in any other kingdom, except that some have been said to be once found at Lyons. They have been sometimes found in great numbers joined together side by side, on one flat piece of clay, as if intended for the casting of a great number of coins at once; and both these, and all the others that have been found, seem to have been of the emperor Severus. They are sometimes found impressed on both sides, and some have the head of Severus on one side and some well known reverse of his on the other. They seem plainly to have been intended for the coinage of money, though it is not easy to say in what manner they can have been employed for that purpose, especially those which have impressions on both sides, unless it may be supposed that they coined two pieces at the same time by the help of three moulds, of which this was to be the middle one. If by disposing these into some sort of iron frame or case, as our letter-founders do the brass moulds for casting their types, the melted metal could be easily poured into them, it would certainly be a very easy method of coining, as such moulds require little time or expense to make, and therefore might be supplied with new ones as often as they happen to break.\n\nThese moulds seem to have been burnt or baked sufficiently to make them hard; but not so as to render them porous like our bricks, whereby they would have lost their smooth and even surface, which in these is plainly so close, that whatever metal should be formed in them would have no appearance like the sand-holes by which counterfeit coins and metals are usually detected.\n\nMoulds of founders of small works are like the frames of coiners: it is in these frames, which are likewise filled with sand, that their several works are fashioned; into which, when the two frames of which the mould is composed, are rejoined, the melted brass is run.\n\nMoulds of letter founders are partly of steel and partly of wood.

For the natural history of mountains, see MOUNTAIN, GEOLOGY Index.\n\nAttraction of Mountains. This is a late discovery, and a very considerable confirmation of Sir Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravity. According to the Newtonian system, an attractive power is not only exerted between those large masses of matter which constitute the sun and planets, but likewise between all comparatively smaller bodies, and even between the smallest particles of which they are composed. Agreeably to this hypothesis, a heavy body, which ought to gravitate or tend toward the centre of the earth, in a direction perpendicular to its surface, supposing the said surface to be perfectly even and spherical, ought likewise, though in a less degree, to be attracted and tend towards a mountain placed on the earth's surface; so that a plumb line, for instance, of a quadrant hanging in the neighbourhood of such a mountain, ought to be drawn from a perpendicular situation, in consequence of the attractive power of the quantity of matter of which it is composed acting in a direction different from that exerted by the whole mass of matter in the earth, and with a proportionably inferior degree of force.\n\nThough Sir Isaac Newton had long ago hinted at an experiment of this kind, and had remarked, that \"a mountain of an hemispherical figure, three miles high and six broad, would not, by its attraction, draw the plumb line two minutes out of the perpendicular (E),\" yet no attempt to ascertain this matter by actual experiment was made till about the year 1738; when the French academicians, particularly Messrs Bouguer and Condamine, who were sent to Peru to measure a degree under the equator, attempted to discover the attractive power of Chimborazo, a mountain in the province of Quito. According to their observations, which were however made under circumstances by no means favourable to an accurate solution of so nice and difficult a problem, the mountain Chimborazo exerted an attraction equal to eight seconds. Though this experiment was not perhaps sufficient to prove satisfactorily even the reality of an attraction, much less the precise quantity of it; yet it does not appear that any steps have been since taken to repeat it.\n\nThrough the munificence of his Britannic majesty, the Royal Society were enabled to undertake the execution of this delicate and important experiment; the astronomer royal was chosen to conduct it. After various inquiries, the mountain Schehallien, situated nearly in the centre of Scotland, was pitched upon as the most proper for the purpose that could be found in this island. The observations were made by taking the meridian zenith distances of different fixed stars, near the zenith, by means of a zenith sector of ten feet radius; first on the south, and afterwards on the north side of the hill, the greatest length of which extended in an east and west direction.\n\nIt is evident, that if the mass of matter in the hill exerted any sensible attraction, it would cause the plumb-line of the sector, through which an observer viewed a star in the meridian, to deviate from its perpendicular situation, and would attract it contrariwise to the\n\n(e) By a very easy calculation it is found that such a mountain would attract the plumb line 1' 18\" from the perpendicular.\nMountains, the two stations, thereby doubling the effect. On the fourth side the plummet would be drawn to the northward, by the attractive power of the hill placed to the northward of it; and on the north side, a contrary and equal deflection of the plumb line would take place in consequence of the attraction of the hill now to the southward of it. The apparent zenith distances of the stars would be affected contrariwise; those being increased at the one station which were diminished at the other: and the correspondent quantities of the deflection of the plumb line would give the observer the sum of the contrary attractions of the hill, acting on the plummet at the two stations; the half of which will of course indicate the attractive power of the hill.\n\nThe various operations requisite for this experiment lasted about four months; and from them it appears that the sum of the two contrary attractions of the mountain Schehallien, in the two temporary observations which were successively fixed half way up the hill (where the effect of its attraction would be greatest), was equal to $11''6$.\u2014From a rough computation, founded on the known law of gravitation, and on an assumption that the density of the hill is equal to the mean density of the earth, it appears that the attraction of the hill should amount to about the double of this quantity. From thence it was inferred that the density of the hill is only about half the mean density of the earth. It does not appear, however, that the mountain Schehallien has ever been a volcano, or is hollow; as it is extremely solid and dense, and seemingly composed of an entire rock.\n\nThe inferences drawn from these experiments may be reduced to the following:\n\n1. It appears, that the mountain Schehallien exerts a sensible attraction; therefore, from the rules of philosophizing, we are to conclude, that every mountain, and indeed every particle of the earth, is endowed with the same property, in proportion to its quantity of matter.\n\n2. The law of the variation of this force, in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances, as laid down by Sir Isaac Newton, is also confirmed by this experiment. For if the force of attraction of the hill had been only to that of the earth, as the matter in the hill to that of the earth, and had not been greatly increased by the near approach to its centre, the attraction thereof must have been wholly insensible. But now, by only supposing the mean density of the earth to be double to that of the hill, which seems very probable from other considerations, the attraction of the hill will be reconciled to the general law of the variation of attraction in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances, as deduced by Sir Isaac Newton from the comparison of the motion of the heavenly bodies with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and the analogy of nature will be preserved.\n\n3. We may now, therefore, be allowed to admit this law, and to acknowledge, that the mean density of the earth is at least double of that at the surface; and consequently that the density of the internal parts of the earth is much greater than near the surface. Hence also, the whole quantity of matter in the earth will be at least as great again, as if it had been all composed of matter of the same density with that at the surface; or will be about four or five times as great as Mountains, if it were all composed of water.\u2014This conclusion, Mr Maskelyne adds, is totally contrary to the hypothesis of some naturalists, who suppose the earth to be only a great hollow shell of matter; supporting itself from the property of an arch, with an immense vacuity in the midst of it. But, were that the case, the attraction of mountains, and even smaller inequalities in the earth's surface, would be very great, contrary to experiment, and would affect the measures of the degrees of the meridian much more than we find they do; and the variation of gravity, in different latitudes, in going from the equator to the poles, as found by pendulums, would not be near so regular as it has been found by experiment to be.\n\n4. As mountains are by these experiments found capable of producing sensible deflections of the plumb lines of astronomical instruments; it becomes a matter of great importance, in the mensuration of degrees in the meridian, either to choose places where the irregular attraction of the elevated parts may be small; or where, by their situation, they may compensate or counteract the effects of each other.\"\n\nFor measuring the heights of mountains, see Barometer.\n\nBurning Mountains. See Aetna, Hecla, Vesuvius; see also Volcano, Geology Index.\n\nMarble Mountains. Of these there are great numbers in Egypt, from which, though immense quantities have been carried off for the multitude of great works erected by the ancient Egyptians: yet in the opinion of Mr Bruce, who passed by them in his journey to Abyssinia, there is still a sufficient supply to build Rome, Athens, Corinth, Syracuse, Memphis, Alexandria, and half a dozen more of such cities.\n\nThe first mountain of this kind mentioned by Mr Bruce is one opposite to Terfowey, consisting partly of green marble, partly of granite, with a red blush upon a gray ground, and square oblong spots. Here he saw a monstrous obelisk of marble very nearly square, broken at the end, and nearly 30 feet long and 19 feet in the face. Throughout the plain there were scattered small pieces of jasper, with green, white, and red spots, called in Italy diafro sanguineus; and all the mountains upon that side seemed to consist of the same materials. From Mr Bruce's description of these mountains, it would appear that they are composed of serpentine, and not of calcareous marble.\n\nWritten Mountain, Mountain of Inscriptions, or Jbel-al-Mokateb, a supposed mountain, or chain of mountains, in the wilderness of Sinai; on which, for a great extent of space, the marble of which the mountain consists is inscribed with innumerable characters, reaching from the ground sometimes to the height of 12 or 14 feet. These were mentioned by a Greek author in the third century, and some of them have been copied by Pococke and other late travellers; but, after all, there is still a very great uncertainty even of the existence of such mountain or mountains. The vast number of these inscriptions, the desert place in which they are found, and the length of time requisite for executing the talk, have induced a notion by no means unnatural, that they are the work of the Israelites during their forty years wandering in the wilderness. Others are of opinion that they contain nothing of any importance,\nMountains importance, but consist merely of the names of travelers and the dates of their journeys.\n\nM. Niebuhr, who visited this country during his travels in the east, made every attempt in his power, though without success, to obtain a sight of this celebrated mountain. On applying to some Greeks at Suez, they all declared that they knew nothing of the writer mountain; they, however, directed him to an Arabian sheik, who had passed all his lifetime in travelling between Suez and Mount Sinai; but he knew no more of it than the former. Understanding, however, that a considerable reward would be given to any person who would conduct them thither, this Arab directed them to another; who pretended not only to know that mountain, but all others upon which there were any inscriptions throughout the desert. On inquiring particularly, however, our travellers found that he was not to be depended upon; so that they were obliged to have recourse to a fourth sheik, who by his conversation convinced them that he had seen mountains with inscriptions in unknown characters upon them. It does not appear, however, that this person was very capable, more than the rest, of leading them to the place they so much wished for; though he conducted them to some rocks upon which there were inscriptions in unknown characters. They are most numerous in a narrow pass between two mountains named Om-er-ridfein; and, says M. Niebuhr, \"the pretended Jibel-el-Mokatteb may possibly be in its neighbourhood.\" Some of these inscriptions were copied by our author; but he does not look upon them to be of any consequence.\n\n\"They seem (says he) to have been executed at idle hours by travellers, who were satisfied with cutting the unpolished rock with any pointed instrument, adding to their names and the date of their journeys some rude figures, which bespeak the hand of a people but little skilled in the arts. When such inscriptions are executed with the design of transmitting to posterity the memory of such events as might afford instructive lessons, greater care is generally taken in the preparation of the stones, and the inscriptions are engraven with more regularity.\"\n\nWhen M. Niebuhr arrived at last at the mountain to which the sheik had promised to conduct him, he did not find any inscriptions; but on climbing up to the top, he found out an Egyptian cemetery, the stones of which were covered with hieroglyphics. The tomb stones are from five to seven feet in length, some standing on end and others lying flat; and \"the more carefully they are examined (says he), the more certainly do they appear to be sepulchral stones, having epitaphs inscribed on them. In the middle of these stones is a building, of which only the walls now remain; and within it are likewise a great many of the sepulchral stones. At one end of the building seems to have been a small chamber, of which the roof still remains. It is supported upon square pillars; and these, as well as the walls of the chamber, are covered with hieroglyphic inscriptions. Through the whole building are various busts executed in the manner of the ancient Egyptians. The sepulchral stones and the busts are of hard and fine grained sandstone.\" M. Niebuhr is of opinion that this cemetery was not the work of the Egyptians themselves, but of some colony which came from Egypt, and had adopted the manners and customs of the people. He supposes that it might have been built by the Arabs, who had conquered Egypt under the shepherd kings, and adopted the Egyptian manners during their residence there. As it must have belonged to an opulent city, however, he owns that there is a great difficulty in accounting for the existence of such a city in the midst of a desert.\n\nThe translator of Volney's travels ascribes these inscriptions to the pilgrims who visit Mount Sinai. But to this, as well as to every other conjecture, there is this objection, that whether the inscriptions be well executed or not, whether they contain matters of importance or not, they ought to have been written in a language which somebody could understand; but from the copies that have been taken of them by Dr. Pococke and others, it does not appear that they could be explained either by him or any other person.\n\nWhen Dr. Clayton, bishop of Clogher, visited this part of the world about the year 1723, he expressed the greatest desire to have the matter concerning this written mountain or mountains ascertained, and even made an offer of 500l. sterling to any literary person who would undertake the journey and endeavour to decipher the inscriptions; but no such person has appeared, and the existence of the mountains is testified only by the superior of a convent at Cairo, who gave that mentioned in the beginning of this article. Until that part of the world, therefore, become more accessible to travellers, there is but little hope that we can come to any certainty in the matter. M. Niebuhr plainly, from his own accounts, had not influence enough with the Arabs to show him almost anything, as they refused to conduct him even to the summit of Mount Sinai.\n\nWhite Mountains.

According to the abb\u00e9 Mariti's description, the summit of it is covered neither with shrubs, turf, nor earth; it consists of a solid mass of white marble, the surface of which is become yellow by the injuries of the air.\n\n\"The path by which you ascend to it (says our author) fills one with terror, as it rises with a winding course between two abysses, which the eye dares scarcely behold. This path is at first pretty broad, but it at length becomes so confined, that one can with difficulty place both feet upon it at the same time. When we had ascended a little higher, we found an Arab stretched out on the path, who made us pay a certain toll for our passage. Here the traveller requires courage. One of the parapets of the path being broken, we clung to the part which remained until we had reached a small grotto, situated very commodiously, as it gave us an opportunity of recovering our breath. When we had refreshed ourselves a little, we pursued our course, which became still more dangerous. Suspended almost from the rock, and having before our eyes all the horror of the...\"\nMOU\n\nMourning the precipice, we could advance only by dragging one foot after the other; so that had the smallest fragment given way under us, we should have been hurried to the bottom of this frightful abyss.\n\n\"This mountain is one of the highest in the province, and one of its most sacred places. It takes its name from the rigorous fast which Christ observed here after having triumphed over the vanities of the world and the power of hell. In remembrance of this miracle, a chapel was formerly constructed on the summit of the mountain. It may be seen from the plain, but we could not approach it, as the path was almost entirely destroyed. It, however, may be accessible on the other side of the mountain, which we did not visit. A great many scattered grottos are seen here; in one of which, according to Quarelinus, were deposited the bodies of several anchorites, which are still entire. I have heard the same thing asserted in the country, but I could never meet with any person who had seen them. Here we enjoyed the most beautiful prospect imaginable. This part of the mountain of Forty Days overlooks the mountains of Arabia, the country of Gilead, the country of the Ammonites, the plains of Moab, the plain of Jericho, the river Jordan, and the whole extent of the Dead Sea.

In Europe, the ordinary colour for mourning is black; in China, it is white; in Turkey, blue or violet; in Egypt, yellow; in Ethiopia, brown. White obtained formerly in Castile on the death of their princes. Herrera observes, that the last time it was used was in 1498, at the death of Prince John. Each people pretend to have their reasons for the particular colour of their mourning: white is supposed to denote purity; yellow, that death is the end of human hopes, in regard that leaves when they fall, and flowers when they fade, become yellow; brown denotes the earth, whither the dead return; black, the privation of life, as being the privation of light: blue expresses the happiness which it is hoped the deceased does enjoy; and purple or violet, sorrow on the one side, and hope on the other, as being a mixture of black and blue.","sp":76,"ep":76},{"h":"MOURNING","t":"among the ancients, was expressed various ways.\n\nAmongst the Jews, on the death of their relations or intimate friends, grief or mourning was signified by weeping, tearing their clothes, smiting their breasts, or tearing them with their nails, pulling or cutting off their hair and beards, walking softly, i.e. barefoot, lying upon the ground, fasting, or eating upon the ground. They kept themselves close shut up in their houses, covered their faces, and abstained from all work, even reading the law, and saying their usual prayers. They neither dressed themselves, nor made their beds, nor shaved themselves, nor cut their nails, nor went into the bath, nor saluted any body: so that suchlike seems to have been an indication of sorrow; and dirtiness, of distress. The time of mourning among the Jews was generally seven days: though this was lengthened or shortened according to circumstances; but 30 days were thought sufficient upon the severest occasions. The different periods of the time of mourning required different degrees of grief, and different tokens of it.\n\nThe Greeks, on the death of friends, showed their sorrow by excluding themselves from all gaiety, entertainments, games, public solemnities, the enjoyment of wine, and the delights of music. They sat in gloomy and solitary places, stripped themselves of all external ornaments, put on a coarse black stuff by way of mourning; tore their hair, shaved their heads, rolled themselves in the dust and mire, sprinkled ashes on their heads, smote their breasts with their palms, tore their faces, and frequently cried out with a lamentable voice and dawling tone, reiterating the interjection \u03b5\u1f30, \u03b5\u1f30, \u03b5\u1f30; hence funeral lamentations were called \u1f18\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2. If they appeared in public during the time of mourning, they had a veil thrown over their faces and heads. During the funeral procession, certain persons called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd marched before, and sung melancholy strains called \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd, \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac and \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac. These vocal mourners sang thrice during the procession round the pile and round the grave. Flutes were also used to heighten the solemnity. At the funerals of soldiers, their fellow soldiers who attended, as a testimony of their affliction, held their shields, their spears, and the rest of their armour, inverted.\n\nThe tokens of private grief among the Romans were the same as those already observed as customary among the Greeks. Black or dark brown were the colours of the mourning habits worn by the men; they were also common to the women. The mourning of the emperors at first was black. In the time of Augustus, the women wore white veils, and the rest of their dress black. From the time of Domitian they wore nothing but white habits, without any ornaments of gold, jewels, or pearls. The men let their hair and beards grow, and wore no wreaths of flowers on their heads while the days of mourning continued. The longest time of mourning was ten months: this was Numa's establishment, and took in his whole year. For a widow to marry during this time was infamous. Mourning was not used for children who died under three years of age. From this age to ten they mourned as many months as the child was years old. A remarkable victory, or other happy event, occasioned the shortening of the time of mourning: The birth of a child, or the attainment of any remarkable honour in the family, certain feasts in honour of the gods, or the consecration of a temple, had the same effect. After the battle of Cannae, the commonwealth decreed that mourning should not be worn for more than 30 days, that the lois might be forgotten as soon as possible. When public magistrates died, or persons of great note, also when any remarkable calamity happened, all public meetings were interrupted, the schools of exercise, baths, shops, temples, and all places of concourse were shut up, and the whole city put on a face of sorrow; the senators laid aside the laelative, and the consuls sat in a lower seat than ordinary. This was the custom of Athens also, and was observed upon the death of Socrates not long after he had been sentenced to death by their judges.\n\nPraeface, or mourning women, (by the Greeks called \u1f11\u03c1\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2), went about the streets; this was customary\nMary among the Jews as well as the Greeks and Romans, (Jerem. ix. 17.)\n\n**MOUSE.** See Mus, Mammalia Index.\n\n**Mouse-Ear.** See Hieracium, Botany Index.\n\n**Mouse-Tail.** See Myosurus, Mammalia Index.\n\n**Dor-Mouse.** See Myoxus, Mammalia Index.\n\n**Shrew-Mouse.** See Sorex,\n\n**MOUSELLE,** the name of an East Indian tree, with white tubular flowers, which fall off every day in great plenty.

The fruit is a pale red cherry, of the shape and size of our white heart cherry, but the footstalk is not quite so long. This fruit has a stone in it, containing a bitter oily kernel. The Indians rub this oil any part stung by a scorpion or bitten by a centipede, which it soon cures. The crows are very fond of the fruit.\n\n**MOUSUL,** or Mosul, a large city of Turkey in Asia, and capital of a beglerbegate, stands on the west bank of the Tigris, in the latitude, according to Mr Ives's observation, of 36\u00b0 30' north. It is surrounded with stone walls, but has many of its streets lying waste. Tavernier speaks of it as a ruined place, with only two blind markets and a sorry castle; yet, he says, that it is much frequented by merchants, and that its basha commands 3000 men. There is a bridge of boats over the Tigris; and the city is a thoroughfare from Persia to Syria, which makes it a place of trade, and which is more augmented by a constant traffic from this place to Bagdad. The country on this side the river is sandy and barren; but on the opposite side it is exceedingly fruitful, yielding good crops of corn and fruit in abundance. Mr Ives says it was the best built city he had seen in Turkey; but had nothing in it to attract the notice of an European. It was besieged for near six months by Nadir Shah without success. Breaches were frequently made in the walls, and assaults continued for three days successively; but the assailants were constantly repulsed, and the breaches made in the daytime repaired during the night. The besieged had unanimously resolved to die rather than to submit. The Turks declared, that should the place be forced to surrender, they were determined to put to death all their wives and daughters first, that they might not fall into the vile hands of the abhorred Persians. The place was therefore defended with uncommon bravery; even the women and children exerted themselves with the greatest alacrity. The Christians behaved in such a manner as to gain the esteem and admiration of the other inhabitants; and some of their churches being demolished, they were afterwards repaired at the expense of government.\n\nIn this city there are a great many mosques, the largest and most stately of which is ornamented on the top with green tiles. At the doors of these houses there are usually inscriptions in gilt letters, declaring the awfulness of the building, as being the house of God. One of them has a minaret which bends like those of Bagdad. Some of the most bigotted Turks say, that Mahomet saluted this minaret as he passed; on which it bent its head in reverence to the prophet, and ever after continued in that situation. The manufacture of this city is muslin (muslin), which is made very strong and pretty fine. In the year 1757 this city and the country adjacent were visited by a dreadful famine, owing to the preceding hard winter, and innumerable multitudes of locusts, by which the fruits of the earth were destroyed. When Mr Ives was there in 1758, the country was comparatively depopulated. Almost all the brute creation had been destroyed for the subsistence of man. During the famine, the people had eaten dogs, and every kind of animal which is held in abhorrence at any other time, not sparing even their own children; and the dead bodies lay in the streets for want of people to bury them. Their fruit trees were also destroyed by the frost; so that when our author was there scarcely any fruit could be had. The neighbouring mountains afford silver mines; and they would yield much quicksilver if the Turks had either the skill or inclination to work them to advantage. Lanza says, that some time ago an Englishman who travelled through this country got two or three bottles of it, which he presented to the basha as a specimen of what might be done in that way; but no farther attempt was made.

In some creatures it is wide and large, in others little and narrow; in some it is formed with a deep incisure into the head, for the better catching and holding of prey, and more easy commination of hard, large, and troublesome food; and in others with a shorter incisure, for the gathering and holding of herbaceous food. In birds it is neatly shaped for piercing the air; hard and horny, to supply the want of teeth; hooked, in the rapacious kind, to catch and hold their prey; long and slender in those that have their food to grope for in moorish places; and broad and long in those that search for it in the mud. Nor is the mouth less remarkable in insects; in some it is forcipated, to catch, hold, and tear the prey; in others aculeated, to pierce and wound animals, and suck their blood; in others, strongly rigid, with jaws and teeth, to gnaw and scrape.","sp":76,"ep":77},{"h":"MOVEMENT","t":"motion, a term frequently used in the same sense with automaton.\n\nThe most usual movements for keeping time are watches and clocks: the first are such as show the parts of time, and are portable in the pocket; the second, such as publish it by sounds, and are fixed as furniture.

A-top of the spring-arbor is the endless screw and its wheel; but in spring clocks, this is a ratchet-wheel with its click, that stops it. That which the main-spring draws, and round which the chain or string is wrapped, is called the fusey; this is ordinarily taper; in large works, going with weights, it is cylindrical, and called the barrel. The small teeth at the bottom of the fusey or barrel, which stop it in winding up, is called the ratchet; and that which stops it when wound up, and is for that end driven up by the spring, the guard-wheel. The wheels are various: the parts of a wheel are, the hoop or rim, the teeth, the cross, and the collet or piece of brass soldered on the arbor or spindle wherein the wheel is riveted. The little wheels playing in the teeth of the larger are called pinions; and their teeth, which are 4, 5, 6, 8, &c. are called leaves; the ends of the spindle are called pivots; and the guttered wheel, with iron spikes at bottom, wherein the line of ordinary clocks runs, the pulley.

There are two kinds of bodies denominated mummies. The first are only carcases dried by the heat of the sun, and by that means kept from putrefaction: these are frequently found in the sands of Libya. Some imagine, that these are the bodies of deceased people buried there on purpose to keep them entire without embalming; others think they are the carcases of travellers who have been overwhelmed by the clouds of sand raised by the hurricanes frequent in those deserts. The second kind of mummies are bodies taken out of the catacombs near Cairo, in which the Egyptians deposited their dead after embalming. See Embalming.\n\nWe have two different substances preserved for medicinal use under the name of mummy, though both in some degree of the same origin. The one is the dried and preserved flesh of human bodies, embalmed with myrrh and spices; the other is the liquor running from such mummies, when newly prepared, or when affected by great heat or damps. The latter is sometimes in a liquid, sometimes of a solid form, as it is preserved in vials well stopped, or suffered to dry and harden in the air. The first kind of mummy is brought to us in large pieces, of a lax and friable texture, light and spongy, of a blackish brown colour, and often damp and clammy on the surface: it is of a strong but disagreeable smell. The second kind of mummy, in its liquid state, is a thick, opaque, and viscous fluid, of a blackish colour, but not disagreeable smell. In its indurated state, it is a dry solid substance, of a fine shining black colour, and close texture, easily broken, and of a good smell; very inflammable, and yielding a scent of myrrh and aromatic ingredients while burning. This, if we cannot be content without medicines from our own bodies, ought to be the mummy used in the shops; but it is very scarce and dear; while the other is so cheap, that it will always be most in use.\n\nAll these kinds of mummies are brought from Egypt.

Mummy has been esteemed revolvent and balsamic; but whatever virtues have been attributed to it, seem to be such as depend more upon the ingredients used in preparing the flesh than in the flesh itself; and it would surely be better to give those ingredients without shocking an addition.\n\nThere are found in Poland a kind of natural mummies, or human bodies preserved without the assistance of art. These lie in considerable numbers in some of the vast caverns in that country. They are dried with the flesh and skin shrunk up almost close to the bones, and are of a blackish colour. In the wars which several ages ago laid waste that country, it was common for parties of the weaker side to retire into these caves, where their enemies, if they found them out, suffocated them by burning straw, &c., at the mouth of the cavern, and then left the bodies; which, being out of the way of injuries from common accidents, have lain there ever since.\n\nMummy, among gardeners, a kind of wax used in grafting and planting the roots of trees, made in the following manner: Take one pound of black pitch, and a quarter of a pound of turpentine; put them together into an earthen pot, and set them on fire in the open air, holding something in your hand to cover and quench the mixture in time, which is to be alternately lighted and quenched till all the nitrous and volatile parts be evaporated.

Long. 4\u00b0 13'. N. Lat. 48\u00b0 15'.\n\nThis city was anciently famous for a victory gained by Caesar over the two sons of Pompey, who had collected an army in Spain after the defeat of their father at Pharsalia. See History of Rome.\n\nThe Pompeys posted their army advantageously on a rising ground, whereof one side was defended by the city of Munda, and the other by a small river which watered the plain, and by a marsh; so that the enemy could not attack them but in front. Caesar likewise drew up his troops with great art, and having advanced a little way from his camp, ordered them to halt, expecting the enemy would abandon their advantageous post, and come to meet him. But as they did not stir, Caesar made as if he intended to fortify himself in that post; which induced the young general, who looked upon this as a sign of fear, to advance into the plain, and attack the enemy before they could secure themselves with any works. Pompey's army was by far the most numerous: for it consisted of 13 legions, 6000 horse, and an incredible number of auxiliaries, among whom were all the forces of Bacchus king of Mauritania, commanded by his two sons, both youths of great valour and bravery. Caesar had 80 cohorts, three legions, to wit, the third, the fifth, and the tenth, and a body of 8000 horse. As the enemy drew near, Caesar betrayed a great deal of uneasiness and concern, as if he were doubtful of the success, knowing he was to engage men no way inferior in valour and experience to his own, and commanded by officers who had on many occasions given signal proofs of their bravery and conduct. Cnecus, the elder of the two brothers, was generally looked upon as an able commander; and Labienus, who had revolted, esteemed scarce inferior to himself.\n\nHowever, the dictator, desirous to put an end to the civil war, either by his own death or that of his rivals, gave the signal for the battle, and fell upon the enemy with his usual vigour and resolution. At the first onset, which was dreadful, the auxiliaries on both sides betook themselves to flight, leaving the Romans to decide their quarrel by themselves. Then the legionaries engaged with a fury hardly to be expressed; Caesar's men being encouraged by the hopes of putting an end to all their labours by this battle, and those of Pompey exerting themselves out of necessity and despair, since most of them expected no quarter, as having been formerly pardoned. Never was victory more obstinately disputed. Caesar's men, who had been always used to conquer, found themselves so vigorously charged by the enemy's legionaries, that they began to give ground; and though they did not turn their backs, yet it was manifest that thence alone kept them in their posts. All authors agree, that Caesar had never been in so great danger; and he himself, when he came back to his camp, told his friends, that he had often fought for victory, but this was the first time he had ever fought for life. Thinking himself abandoned by fortune, which had hitherto favoured him, he had some thoughts of stabbing himself with his own sword, and by a voluntary death preventing the disgrace of a defeat; but returning soon to himself, and concluding it would be more to his reputation to fall by the enemy's hand at the head of his troops, than in a fit of despair, by his own, he dismounted from his horse, and matching a buckler from one of his legionaries, he threw himself like a man in despair into the midst of the enemy; crying out to his men, Are you not ashamed to deliver your general into the hands of boys? At these words, the soldiers of the tenth legion, animated by the example of their general, fell upon the enemy with fresh vigour, and made a dreadful havoc of them. But in spite of their utmost efforts, Pompey's men still kept their ground, and, though greatly fatigued, returned to the charge with equal vigour. Then the C\u00e6sarians began to despair of victory; and the dictator, running through the ranks of his disheartened legionaries, had much ado to keep them together. The battle had already lasted from the rising to the setting of the sun, without any considerable advantage on either side.\n\nAt length a mere accident decided the dispute in favour of the dictator. Bogud, a petty king of Mauritania, had joined Caesar soon after his arrival in Spain, with some squadrons of Numidian horse; but, in the very\nvery beginning of the battle, being terrified at the shouting of the soldiers, intermingled with groans, and the clashing of their arms, he had abandoned his post, and retired with the auxiliaries under his command to a rising ground at a small distance from the enemy's camp. There he continued the whole day an idle spectator of the battle that was fought in the plain. But towards the evening, partly out of shame and partly out of compassion for his friend Caesar, he resolved to fall upon Pompey's camp; and accordingly flew thither with all the forces he had with him. Labienus, apprised of his design, hastened after him to the defence of the camp; which Caesar observing, cried to his legionaries, Courage, fellow soldiers! the victory at length is ours; Labienus flies! This artifice had the desired effect: Caesar's men, believing that Labienus was truly fled, made a last effort, and charged the wing he commanded so briskly, that after a most obstinate dispute they put them to flight.\n\nThough the enemy's left wing was thus entirely defeated, the right wing, where the elder Pompey commanded, still kept their ground for some time. Pompey dismounting from his horse, fought on foot like a private man in the first line, till most of his legionaries being killed, he was forced to save himself by flight from falling into the enemy's hands. Part of his troops fled back to their camp, and part took shelter in the city of Munda. The camp was immediately attacked, and taken sword in hand; and as for the city, Caesar, without loss of time, drew a line of circumvallation round it. This victory was gained on the 16th of the kalends of April, i.e., according to our way of counting, on the 17th day of March, when the Dionysian festival, or the Liberalia, were celebrated at Rome; the very day, as Plutarch observes, in which Pompey the Great, four years before, had set out for the war. In this action Pompey lost 30,000 men; among whom were the famous Labienus, Attius Varus, and 3000 Roman knights. Seventeen officers of distinction were taken, and all the enemy's eagles and ensigns, together with Pompey's falces, which he had assumed as governor of Spain. On Caesar's side, only 2000 men were killed and 500 wounded.","sp":81,"ep":82},{"h":"MUNDIC","t":"or Marcasite, an old name for pyrites of copper or iron.

It contains an amazing collection of jewels, antiquities, and curiosities. The great hall is 118 feet long and 52 broad; and the staircase leading to it, from top to bottom, of marble and gold. In the hall of antiquities are 354 busts and statues of jasper and porphyry, bronzes and marble. In this palace is a library, containing a vast collection of books, and many valuable manuscripts, in most languages, ancient and modern; and a chamber of rarities, among which is the picture of a brave or assassin, who is said to have committed 345 murders with his own hand, and to have been accomplice in, or privy to, 400 more.

The word comes from the Saxon morth \"death;\" which some will have to signify a violent death; whence the barbarous Latin murdurn and modurn.\n\nAmong the number of popular errors, is the notion which has obtained, that the dead body would bleed in the presence or upon the touch of the murderer.\n\nThe crime of murder is punished with death in almost all nations.","sp":84,"ep":84},{"h":"MURDER","t":"or Murther, in law, is thus defined, or rather described, by Sir Edward Coke: \"When a person, of sound memory and discretion, unlawfully killeth any reasonable creature in being, and under the king's peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.\" The best way of examining the nature of this crime will be by considering the several branches of this definition.\n\n1. It must be committed by a person of sound memory and discretion: for lunatics or infants are incapable of committing any crime; unless in such cases where they show a consciousness of doing wrong, and of course a discretion or discernment between good and evil.\n\n2. Next, it happens when a person of such sound discretion unlawfully killeth. The unlawfulness arises from the killing without warrant or excuse; and there must also be an actual killing to constitute murder; for a bare assault, with intent to kill, is only a great misdemeanor, though formerly it was held to be murder. The killing may be by poisoning, striking, starving, drowning, and a thousand other forms of death, by which human nature may be overcome. Of these the most detestable of all is poison; because it can of all others be the least prevented, either by manhood or forethought. And therefore, by the stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 9, it was made treason, and a more grievous and lingering kind of death was inflicted on it than the common law allowed; namely, boiling to death: but this act did not live long, being repealed by 1 Edw. VI. c. 12. There was also, by the ancient common law, one species of killing held to be murder, which may be dubious at this day, as there hath not been an instance wherein it has been held to be murder for many ages past, viz., bearing false witness against another, with an express premeditated design to take away his life, so as the innocent person be condemned and executed. The Gothic laws punished in this case both the judge, the witnesses, and the prosecutor; and, among the Romans, the lex Cornelia de sicariis, punished the false witness with death, as being guilty of a species of assassination. And there is no doubt but this is equally murder in force.\nMurder. conscientious as killing with a sword; though the modern law (to avoid the danger of deterring witneses from giving evidence upon capital prosecutions, if it must be at the peril of their own lives) has not yet punished it as such. If a man, however, do such an act, of which the probable consequence may be, and eventually is, death; such killing may be murder, although no stroke be struck by himself, and no killing may be primarily intended: as was the case of the unnatural son who exposed his sick father to the air against his will, by reason whereof he died; and of the harlot, who laid her child under leaves in an orchard, where a kite struck and killed it. So too, if a man have a beast that is used to do mischief; and he, knowing it, suffers it to go abroad, and it kills a man; even this is manslaughter in the owner; but if he have purposely turned it loose, though barely to frighten people, and make what is called sport, it is with us (as in the Jewish law) as much murder as if he had incited a bear or dog to worry them. If a physician or surgeon give his patient a potion or plaster to cure him, which, contrary to expectation, kills him, this is neither murder nor manslaughter, but misadventure; and he shall not be punished criminally, however liable he might formerly have been to a civil action for neglect or ignorance; but it hath been holden, that if it be not a regular physician or surgeon who administers the medicine, or performs the operation, it is manslaughter at the least. Yet Sir Matthew Hale very justly questions the law of this determination; since physicians and surgeons were in use before licensed physicians and surgeons: wherefore he treats this doctrine as apocryphal, and fitted only to gratify and flatter licentiates and doctors in physic; though it may be of use to make people cautious and wary how they meddle too much in so dangerous an employment. In order also to make the killing murder, it is requisite that the party die within a year and a day after the stroke received, or cause of death administered; in the computation of which the whole day upon which the hurt was done shall be reckoned the first.\n\n3. Farther: The person killed must be \"a reasonable creature in being, and under the king's peace,\" at the time of the killing. Therefore to kill an alien, a Jew, or an outlaw, who are all under the king's peace or protection, is as much murder as to kill the most regular-born Englishman; except he be an alien-enemy, in the time of war. To kill a child in its mother's womb, is now no murder, but a great misprision; but if the child be born alive, and die by reason of the potion or bruises it received in the womb, it seems, by the better opinion, to be murder in such as administered or gave them. As to the murder of bastard children, see Bastard.\n\n4. Lastly, The killing must be committed \"with malice aforethought,\" to make it the crime of murder. This is the grand criterion which now distinguishes murder from other killing: and this malice prepense, malitia praecognita, is not so properly spite or malevolence to the deceased in particular, as any evil design in general; the dictate of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart; un disposition \u00e0 faire une mal choise: and it may be either express, or implied, in law. Express malice is when one, with a fedated deliberate mind and formed design, doth kill another, which formed de-\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\nMurder. only an intent to chastise and not to kill him, the law so far considers the provocation of contumelious behaviour, as to adjudge it only manslaughter, and not murder. In like manner, if one kills an officer of justice, either civil or criminal, in the execution of his duty, or any of his affiants endeavouring to convey the peace, or any private person endeavouring to suppress an affray or apprehend a felon, knowing his authority or the intention with which he interposes, the law will imply malice, and the killer shall be guilty of murder. And if one intends to do another felony, and undignifiedly kills a man, this is also murder. Thus if one shoots at A, and misses him, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case, where one lays poison for A, and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him, this is likewise murder. So also, if one give a woman with child a medicine to procure abortion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman, this is murder in the person who gave it. It were endless to go through all the cases of homicide, which have been adjudged, either expressly or impliedly, malicious; these therefore may suffice as a specimen; and we may take it for a general rule, that all homicide is malicious, and of course amounts to murder, unless where justified by the command or permission of the law; excused on a principle of accident or self-preservation; or alleviated into manslaughter, by being either the involuntary consequence of some act, not strictly lawful, or (if voluntary) occasioned by some sudden and sufficiently violent provocation. And all these circumstances of justification, excuse, or alleviation, it is incumbent upon the prisoner to make out, to the satisfaction of the court and jury, the latter of whom are to decide whether the circumstances alleged are proved to have actually existed; the former, how far they extend to take away or mitigate the guilt. For all homicide is presumed to be malicious, until the contrary appeareth upon evidence.\n\nThe punishment of murder, and that of manslaughter, were formerly one and the same; both having the benefit of clergy; so that none but unlearned persons, who least knew the guilt of it, were put to death for this enormous crime. But now, by several statutes, the benefit of clergy is taken away from murderers, through malice prepense, their abettors, procurers, and counsellors. In atrocious cases it was frequently usual for the court to direct the murderer, after execution, to be hung upon a gibbet in chains near the place where the fact was committed; but this was no part of the legal judgement; and the like is still sometimes practised in the case of notorious thieves. This, being quite contrary to the express command of the Mosaic law, seems to have been borrowed from the civil law; which, besides the terror of the example, gives also another reason for this practice, viz., that it is a comfortable sight to the relations and friends of the deceased. But now, in England, it is enacted by statute 25 Geo. II. c. 37. that the judges, before whom any person is found guilty of wilful murder, shall pronounce sentence immediately after conviction, unless he sees cause to postpone it; and shall in passing sentence direct him to be executed on the next day but one (unless the same shall be Sunday, and then on the Monday following), and that his body be delivered to the surgeons to be dissected and anatomized; and that the judge may direct his body to be afterwards hung in chains, but in nowise to be buried without dissection. And, during the short but awful interval between sentence and execution, the prisoner shall be kept alone, and sustained with only bread and water. But a power is allowed to the judge, upon good and sufficient cause, to reprieve the execution, and relax the other restraints of this act.

This he calls another sort of murrhina work; and it is evident, from all accounts, that the murrhina of Diospolis was a fort\nMurrhine of glass ware, made in imitation of the porcelain or murrha of India. There is some difference in the accounts given by Pliny and Martial of the murrhine vase. The first author says, that they would not bear hot liquors, but that only cold ones were drank out of them. The latter, on the other hand, tells us, that they bore hot liquors very well. If we credit Pliny's account, their porcelain was much inferior to ours in this particular. Some conjecture them to have been of agate, others of onyx, others of coral. Baronius doubts, was farthest out of the way, when he took them to be made of myrrh, congealed and hardened. Some have supposed these vessels to be made of crystal, but this is contrary to the account of all the ancients. The Greeks had the words \u1f00\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, for crystal, and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b7\u03bd for myrrh, very common among them; and therefore, if these vessels had been made of either of these substances, they would in some places have called them symma or crystalline. On the contrary, the most correct among them call them murrhina or morrina. The cups made of crystal, which were also in use at those times were called crystalline, and these murrhina or murrhina, by way of keeping up the distinction; and Martial tells us, that the stone they were made of was spotted or variegated, calling them pocula maculatae muriae. And Statius mentions the crystalline and murrhine cups in the same sentence, but as different things, not the same. Arrian mentions also the \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2; which his interpreters censure as an error of the copies, and would alter into myrrha, the name of the gum myrrh.\n\nPompey is recorded as the first who brought these murrhine vessels out of the east, which he exhibited in his triumph, and dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus.

See BOTANY Index.\n\nMUS\u00c6US, an ancient Greek poet, was, according to Plato and Diodorus Siculus, an Athenian, the son of Orpheus, and chief of the Eleusinian mysteries instituted at Athens in honour of Ceres: or, according to others, he was only the disciple of Orpheus: but from the great resemblance which there was between his character and talents and those of his master, by giving a stronger outline to the figure he was called his son, as those were styled the children of Apollo who cultivated the arts of which he was the tutelar god.\n\nMus\u00e6us is allowed to have been one of the first poets who verified the oracles. He is placed in the Arundelian marbles, epoch 15. 1426 B.C., at which time his hymns are there said to have been received in the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries. Laertius tells us, that Mus\u00e6us not only composed a theogony, but formed a sphere for the use of his companions; yet as this honour is generally given to Chiron, it is more natural to suppose, with Sir Isaac Newton, that he enlarged it with the addition of several constellations after the conquest of the golden fleece. The sphere itself shows that it was delineated after the Argonautic expedition, which is described in the asterisms, together with several other more ancient histories of the Greeks, History of Music, and without any thing later; for the ship Argo was the first long vessel which they had built: hitherto they had used round ships of burden, and kept within sight of the shore; but now, by the dictates of the oracle, and consent of the princes of Greece, the flower of that country sail rapidly through the deep, and guide their ship by the stars.\n\nMus\u00e6us is celebrated by Virgil in the character of hierophant, or priest of Ceres, at the head of the most illustrious mortals who have merited a place in Elysium. Here he is made the conductor of \u00c6neas to the recesses where he meets the shade of his father Anchises.\n\nA hill near the citadel of Athens was called Mus\u00e6um, according to Pausanias, from Mus\u00e6us, who used to retire thither to meditate and compose his religious hymns; at which place he was afterwards buried. The works which went under his name, like those of Orpheus, were by many attributed to Onomacritus. Nothing remains of this poet now, nor were any of his writings extant in the time of Pausanias, except a hymn to Ceres, which he made for the Lycomides. And as these hymns were likewise set to music, and sung in the mysteries by Mus\u00e6us himself in the character of priest, he thence perhaps acquired from future times the title of musician, as well as of poet; the performance of sacred music being probably at first confined to the priesthood in these celebrations, as it had been before in Egypt, whence they originated. However, he is not enumerated among ancient musicians by Plutarch; nor does it appear that he merited the title of son and successor to Orpheus for his musical abilities, so much as for his poetry, piety, and profound knowledge in religious mysteries.","sp":87,"ep":87},{"h":"MUSCA","t":"the FLY; a genus of insects belonging to the order of diptera.

Professors of every liberal art in all the countries of Europe still revere them; particularly the poets, who seldom undertake the slightest work without invoking their aid.\n\nSir Isaac Newton tells us, that the singing women of Ophir were celebrated in Thrace by the name of the Muses; and that the daughters of Pierius, a Thracian, imitating them, were celebrated by the same name.\n\nDiodorus Siculus informs us, that Alcman of Messene, a lyric poet who flourished in the 27th Olympiad, 670 years B.C., makes them the daughters of Uranus and Terra. It has been asserted by some ancient writers, that at first they were only three in number; but Homer, Hesiod, and other profound mythologists, admit of nine (A).\n\nIn his hymn to Apollo, Homer says,\n\n\u2014By turns the nine delight to sing.\n\nAnd Hesiod, in his Theogony, names them all.\u2014They are said fevishly to preside over some art or science, as music, poetry, dancing, astronomy. By some they are called virgins, because the virtues of education appear unalterable: they are called muses from a Greek word which signifies to explain mysteries, because they have taught things the most curious and important to know, and which are above the comprehension of vulgar minds. Each of their names is said to include some particular allegory; Cloe, for instance, has been thus called, because those who are praised in verse acquire immortal fame; Euterpe, on account of the pleasure accruing to those who hear learned poetry; Thalia implies for ever flourishing; Melpomene, that her melody infatuates itself into the inmost recesses of the soul; Terpsichore marks the pleasure which those receive who are versed in the liberal arts; Erato seems to indicate, that the learned command the esteem and friendship of all mankind; Polyhymnia, that many poets are become immortal by the number of hymns which they have addressed to the gods; Urania, that those whom she instructs elevate their contemplations and celebrity to the heavens and the stars; and lastly, the exquisite voice of Calliope has acquired her that appellation, as the inventor and guardian of eloquence and rhetoric.\n\nAn epigram of Callimachus gives the attributes of the Muses in as many lines.\n\nCalliope the deeds of heroes sings;\nGreat Cloe sweeps to history the strings;\nEuterpe teaches minos their silent show;\nMelpomene presides o'er scenes of wo;\nTerpsichore the flute's soft pow'r dispels;\nAnd Erato gives hymns the gods to praise;\nPolyhymnia's skill inspires melodious strains;\nUrania wife, the starry course explains;\nAnd gay Thalia's glass points out where folly reigns.\n\nThis epigram does not, however, exactly correspond with the ideas of other poets, or of the ancient painters, in characterizing the attributes of the Muses.

In proportion as improvement was made in the art of verification, its characters and effects were personified, the number of the Muses increased, and the names they now received referred to the charms of poetry, its celestial origin, the beauty of its language, the pleasure and gaiety it inspires, the song and dance which add to it new charms, and the glory with which it is crowned. Afterwards were associated with them the Graces, whose employment it is to embellish poetry, and Love who is so frequently its object. These ideas took birth in a barbarous country, in Thrace, where Orpheus, Linus, and their disciples, suddenly appeared in the midst of ignorance. The Muses were honoured there on the Pierian mount; and extending their dominion, successively took their stations on Pindus, Parnassus, Helicon, and all those solitary places where the painters of nature, surrounded by the most pleasing images, experience the divine glow of inspiration.\n\nPythagoras, and afterwards Plato, make the Muses the soul of the planets in our system; from whence the imaginary music of the spheres.","sp":88,"ep":89},{"h":"MUSEUM","t":"a name which originally signified a part of the palace of Alexandria, which took up at least one-fourth of the city.

THE art of combining sounds in a manner agreeable to the ear. This combination may be either simultaneous or successive: in the first case, it constitutes harmony; in the last, melody. But though the same sounds, or intervals of sound, which give pleasure when heard in succession, will not always produce the same effect in harmony; yet the principles which constitute the simpler and more perfect kinds of harmony, are almost, if not entirely, the same with those of melody. By perfect harmony, we do not here mean that plenitude, those complex modifications of harmonic sound, which are admired in practice; but that harmony which is called perfect by theorists and artists; that harmony which results from the coalescence of simultaneous sounds produced by vibrations in the proportions of thirds, fifths, and octaves, or their duplicates.\n\nThe principles upon which these various combinations of sound are founded, and by which they are regulated, constitute a science, which is not only extensive but profound, when we would investigate the principles from whence these happy modifications of sound result, and by which they are determined; or when we would explore the sensations, whether mental or corporeal, with which they affect us. The ancient definitions of music are not proportioned in their extent to our present ideas of that art; but M. Rousseau betrays a temerity highly inconsistent with the philosophical character, when from thence he infers, that their ideas were vague and undetermined. Every foul susceptible of refinement and delicacy in taste or sentiment, must be conscious that there is a music in action as well as in sound; and that the ideas of beauty and decorum, of harmony and symmetry, are, if we may use the expression, equally constituent of visible as of audible music. Those illustrious minds, whose comprehensive prospects in every science where taste and propriety prevail took in nature at a single glance, would behold with contempt and ridicule those narrow and microscopic views of which alone their successors in philosophy have discovered themselves capacious. With these definitions, however, we are less concerned, as they bear no proportion to the ideas which are now entertained of music. Nor can we follow M. Rousseau, from whatever venerable sources his authority may be derived, in adopting his Egyptian etymology for the word music. The established derivation from Musa could only be questioned by a paradoxical genius. That music had been practised in Egypt before it was known as an art in Greece, is indeed a fact which cannot be questioned; but it does not thence follow that the Greeks had borrowed the name as well as the art from\nfrom Egypt. If the art of music be so natural to man that vocal melody is practised wherever articulate sounds are used, there can be little reason for deducing the idea of music from the whistling of winds through the reeds that grew on the river Nile. And indeed, when we reflect with how easy a transition we may pass from the accents of speaking to diatonic sounds; when we observe how early children adapt the language of their amusements to measure and melody, however rude; when we consider how early and universally these practices take place\u2014there is no avoiding the conclusion, that the idea of music is connoted to man, and implied in the original principles of his constitution. We have already said, that the principles on which it is founded, and the rules by which it is conducted, constitute a science. The same maxims when applied to practice form an art: hence its first and most capital division is into speculative and practical music.\n\nSpeculative music is, if we may be permitted to use the expression, the knowledge of the nature and use of those materials which compose it; or, in other words, of all the different relations between the high and low, between the harsh and the sweet, between the swift and the slow, between the strong and the weak, of which sounds are susceptible: relations which, comprehending all the possible combinations of music and sounds, seem likewise to comprehend all the causes of the impressions which their succession can make upon the ear and upon the soul.\n\nPractical music is the art of applying and reducing to practice those principles which result from the theory of agreeable sounds, whether simultaneous or successive; or, in other words, to conduct and arrange sounds according to the proportions resulting from consonance, from duration and succession, in such a manner as to produce upon the ear the effect which the composer intends. This is the art which we call composition*. With respect to the actual production of sounds by voices or instruments, which is called execution, this department is merely mechanical and operative: which, only presupposing the powers of sounding the intervals true, of exactly proportioning their degrees of duration, of elevating or depressing sounds according to those gradations which are prescribed by the tone, and to the value required by the time, demands no other knowledge but a familiar acquaintance with the characters used in music, and a habit of expressing them with promptitude and facility.\n\nSpeculative music is likewise divided into two departments; viz. the knowledge of the proportions of sounds or their intervals, and that of their relative durations; that is to say, of measure and of time.\n\nThe first is what among the ancients seems to have been called harmonical music. It shows in what the nature of air or melody consists; and discovers what is consonant or discordant, agreeable or disagreeable, in the modulation. It discovers, in a word, the effects which sounds produce on the ear by their nature, by their force, and by their intervals; which is equally applicable to their consonance and their succession.\n\nThe second has been called rhythmical, because it treats of sounds with regard to their time and quantity. It contains the explication of their continuance, of their proportions, of their measures, whether long or short, quick or slow, of the different modes of time and the parts into which they are divided, that to these the succession of sounds may be conformed.\n\nPractical music is likewise divided into two departments, which correspond to the two preceding.\n\nThat which answers to harmonical music, and which the ancients called melopoea, teaches the rules for combining and varying the intervals, whether consonant or dissonant, in an agreeable and harmonious manner.\n\nThe second, which answers to the rhythmical music, and which they called rhythmopoea, contains the rules for applying the different modes of time, for understanding the feet by which verses were scanned, and the diversities of measure; in a word, for the practice of the rhythmus.\n\nMusic is at present divided more simply into melody and harmony; for since the introduction of harmony, the proportion between the length and shortness of sounds, or even that between the distance of returning cadences, are of less consequence amongst us. For it often happens in modern languages, that the verses assume their measures from the musical air, and almost entirely lose the small share of proportion and quantity which in themselves they possess.\n\nBy melody the successions of sound are regulated in such a manner as to produce pleasing airs. See Melody.\n\nHarmony consists in uniting to each of the sounds, in a regular succession, two or more different sounds, which simultaneously striking the ear soothe it by their concurrence. See Harmony.\n\nMusic, according to Rousseau, may be, and perhaps likewise ought to be, divided into the physical and the imitative. The first is limited to the mere mechanism of sounds, and reaches no farther than the external senses, without carrying its impressions to the heart, and can produce nothing but corporeal sensations more or less agreeable. Such is the music of songs, of hymns, of all the airs which only consist in combinations of melodious sounds, and in general all music which is merely harmonious.\n\nIt may, however, be questioned, whether every sound, even to the most simple, is not either by nature or by early and confirmed association, imitative. If we may trust our own feelings, there is no such thing in nature as music which gives mechanical pleasure alone. For if so, it must give such pleasure as we receive from tastes, from odours, or from other grateful titillations; but we absolutely deny that there are any musical sensations or pleasures in the smallest degree analogous to these. Let any piece of music be resolved into its elementary parts and their proportions, it will then easily appear from this analysis, that sense is no more than the vehicle of such perceptions, and that mind alone can be susceptible of them. It may indeed happen, from the number of the performers and the complication of the harmony, that meaning and sentiment may be lost in the multiplicity of sounds; but this, though it may be harmony, loses the name of music.\n\nThe second department of this division, by lively and accentuated inflections, and by sounds which may be said to speak, expresses all the passions, paints every possible picture, reflects every object, subjects the whole of nature to its skilful imitations, and impresses even on the heart and soul of man sentiments proper to affect them in the most sensible manner. This, continues\nnues he, which is the genuine lyric and theatrical music, was what gave double charms and energy to ancient poetry; this is what, in our days, we exert ourselves in applying to the drama, and what our fingers execute on the stage. It is in this music alone, and not in harmonics or the refinement of nature, that we must expect to find accounts of those prodigious effects which it formerly produced.\n\nBut, with M. Rousseau's permission, all music which is not in some degree characterized by these pathetic and imitative powers, deserves no better name than that of a musical jargon, and can only be effectuated by such a complication and intricacy of harmony, as may confound, but cannot entertain the audience. This character, therefore, ought to be added as essential to the definition of music; and it must be attributed to our neglect of this alone, whilst our whole attention is bestowed on harmony and execution, that the best performances of our artists and composers are heard with little indifference and obduracy, nor ever can conciliate any admirers, but such as are induced, by pedantry and affectation, to pretend what they do not feel. Still may the curse of indifference and inattention pursue and harrow up the souls of every composer or performer, who pretends to regale our ears with this musical legerdemain, till the grin of scorn, or the hiss of infamy, teach them to correct this depravity of taste, and entertain us with the voice of nature!\n\nWhilst moral effects are sought in the natural effects of sound alone, the scrutiny will be vain, and disputes will be maintained without being understood; but sounds, as representatives of objects, whether by nature or association, introduce new scenes to the fancy and new feelings to the heart; not from their mechanical powers, but from the connection established by the Author of our frame between sounds and the object which either by natural resemblance or unavoidable association they are made to represent.\n\nIt would seem that music was one of those arts which were first discovered; and that vocal was prior to instrumental music, if in the earliest ages there was any music which could be said to be purely instrumental. For it is more than probable, that music was originally formed to be the vehicle of poetry; and of consequence, though the voice might be supported and accompanied by instruments, yet music was never intended for instruments alone.\n\nWe are told by ancient authors, that all the laws, whether human or divine, exhortations to virtue, the knowledge of the characters and actions of gods and heroes, the lives, and achievements of illustrious men, were written in verse, and sung publicly by a quire to the sound of instruments; and it appears from the Scriptures, that such from the earliest times was the custom among the Israelites. Nor was it possible to find means more efficacious for impressing on the mind of man the principles of morals, and inspiring the love of virtue. Perhaps, however, this was not the result of a premeditated plan; but inspired by sublime sentiments and elevation of thought, which in accents that were suited and proportioned to their celestial nature endeavoured to find a language worthy of themselves and expressive of their grandeur.\n\nIt merits attention, that the ancients were duly sensible of the value and importance of this divine art, not only as a symbol of that universal order and symmetry which prevails through the whole frame of material and intelligent nature, but as productive of the most momentous effects both in moral and political life. Plato and Aristotle, who disagreed almost in every other maxim of politics, are unanimous in their approbation of music, as an efficacious instrument in the formation of the public character and in conducting the state; and it was the general opinion, that whilst the gymnastic exercises rendered the constitution robust and hardy, music humanized the character, and softened those habits of roughness and ferocity by which men might otherwise have degenerated into savages. The gradations by which voices were exerted and tuned, by which the invention of one instrument succeeded to another, or by which the principles of music were collected and methodized in such a manner as to give it the form of an art and the dignity of a science, are topics so fruitful of conjecture and so void of certainty, that we must leave them to employ minds more speculative and inventions more prolific than ours, or transfer them to the History of Music as a more proper place for such diligences. For the amusement of the curious, Rousseau in his Musical Dictionary, Plates C and N, has transcribed some fragments of Grecian, Persian, American, Chinese, and Swiss music, with which performers may entertain themselves at leisure. When they have tried the pieces, it is imagined they will be less languidly fond than that author of ascribing the power of music to its affinity with the national accents where it is composed. This may doubtless have its influence; but there are other causes more permanent and less arbitrary to which it owes its most powerful and universal charms.\n\nThe music now most generally celebrated and practiced is that of the Italians, or their successful imitators. The English, from the invasion of the Saxons, to that more late though lucid era in which they imbibed the art and copied the manner of the Italians, had a music which neither pleased the soul nor charmed the ear. The primitive music of the French deserves no higher panegyric. Of all the barbarous nations, the Scots and Irish seem to have possessed the most affecting original music. The first consists of a melody characterized by tenderness; it melts the soul to a pleasing penitive languor. The other is the native expression of grief and melancholy. Tassoni informs us, that in his time a prince from Scotland had imported into Italy a lamentable kind of music from his own country; and that he himself had composed pieces in the same spirit. From this expressive though laconic description, we learn, that the character of our national music was even then established; yet so gross is our ignorance and credulity, that we ascribe the best and most impassioned airs which are extant among us to David Rizzio; as if an Italian lutenist, who had lived so short a time in Scotland, could at once, as it were by inspiration, have imbibed a spirit and composed in a manner so different from his own. It is yet more surprising that Geminiani should have entertained and published the same prejudice, upon the miserable authority of popular tradition alone; for the fact is authenticated by no better credentials. The primitive music of the Scots may be divided into the martial, the pastoral, and the fiddle. The first consists either\neither in marches, which were played before the chieftains, in imitation of the battles which they fought, or in lamentations for the catastrophes of war and the extinction of families. These wild effusions of natural melody preserve several of the rules prescribed for composition. The strains, though rude and untutored, are frequently terrible or mournful in a very high degree. The port or march is sometimes in common, sometimes in treble time; regular in its measures, and exact in the distance between its returning cadences; most frequently, though not always, loud and brisk. The pi-broch, or imitation of battles, is wild, and abrupt in its transitions from interval to interval and from key to key; various and deftly in its movements; frequently irregular in the return of its cadences; and in short, through the whole, seems inspired with such fury and enthusiasm, that the hearer is irresistibly infected with all the rage of precipitate courage, notwithstanding the rudeness of the accents by which it is kindled. To this the pastoral forms a striking contrast. Its accents are plaintive, yet soothing; its harmony generally flat; its modulations natural and agreeable; its rhythm simple and regular; its returning cadences at equal distance; its transitions from one concinnous interval to another, at least for the most part; its movements slow, and may be either in common or treble time. It scarcely admits of any other harmony than that of a simple bass. A greater number of parts would cover the air and destroy the melody. To this we shall add what has been said upon the same subject by Dr Franklin. Writing to Lord K\u2014\u2014\u2014, he proceeds thus:\n\n\"Give me leave, on this occasion, to extend a little the sense of your position, 'That melody and harmony are separately agreeable, and in union delightful,' and to give it as my opinion, that the reason why the Scotch tunes have lived so long, and will probably live for ever (if they escape being stifled in modern affected ornament), is merely this, that they are really compositions of melody and harmony united, or rather that their melody is harmony. I mean, the simple tunes sung by a single voice. As this will appear paradoxical, I must explain my meaning. In common acceptation, indeed, only an agreeable succession of sounds is called melody; and only the coexistence of agreeable sounds, harmony. But since the memory is capable of retaining for some moments a perfect idea of the pitch of a past sound, so as to compare it with the pitch of a succeeding sound, and judge truly of their agreement or disagreement, there may and does arise from thence a sense of a harmony between the present and past sounds, equally pleasing with that between two present sounds. Now the construction of the old Scotch tunes is this, that almost every succeeding emphatic note is a third, a fifth, an octave, or in short some note that is in concord with the preceding note. Thirds are chiefly used, which are very pleasing concords. I use the word emphatic, to distinguish those notes which have a first laid on them in fingering the tune, from the lighter connecting notes that serve merely, like grammar-articles in common speech, to tack the whole together.\n\n\"That we have a most perfect idea of a sound just past, I might appeal to all acquainted with music, who know how easy it is to repeat a sound in the same pitch with one just heard. In tuning an instrument, a good ear can as easily determine that two strings are in unison by sounding them separately, as by sounding them together; their disagreement is also as easily, I believe I may say more easily and better distinguished when sounded separately; for when sounded together, though you know by the beating that one is higher than the other, you cannot tell which it is. I have ascribed to memory the ability of comparing the pitch of a present tone with that of one past. But if there should be, as possibly there may be, something in the ear similar to what we find in the eye, that ability would not be entirely owing to memory. Possibly the vibrations given to the auditory nerves by a particular sound may actually continue for some time after the cause of these vibrations is past, and the agreement or disagreement of a subsequent sound become by comparison with them more discernible. For the impression made on the visual nerves by a luminous object will continue for 20 or 30 seconds.\"\n\nAfter some experiments to prove the permanency of visible impressions, he continues thus:\n\n\"Farther, when we consider by whom these ancient tunes were composed, and how they were first performed, we shall see that such harmonical succession of sounds was natural and even necessary in their construction. They were composed by the minstrels of those days, to be played on the harp accompanied by the voice. The harp was strung with wire, which gives a sound of long continuance; and had no contrivance like that of the modern harpsichord, by which the sound of the preceding note can be stopt the moment a succeeding note begins. To avoid actual discord, it was therefore necessary that the succeeding emphatic note should be a chord with the preceding, as their sounds must exist at the same time. Hence arose that beauty in those tunes that has so long pleased, and will please for ever, though men scarce know why. That they were originally composed for the harp, and of the most simple kind, I mean a harp without any half-notes but those in the natural scale, and with no more than two octaves of strings, from C to C, I conjecture from another circumstance; which is, that not one of those tunes really ancient, has a single artificial half-note in it; and that in tunes where it is most convenient for the voice to use the middle notes of the harp, and place the key in F, there the B, which if used should be a B flat, is always omitted, by passing over it with a third. The connoisseurs in modern music will say I have no taste; but I cannot help adding, that I believe our ancestors, in having a good song, distinctly articulated, sung to one of those tunes, and accompanied by the harp, felt more real pleasure than is communicated by the generality of modern operas, exclusive of that arising from the scenery and dancing. Most tunes of late composition, not having this natural harmony united with their melody, have recourse to the artificial harmony of a bass, and other accompanying parts. This support, in my opinion, the old tunes do not need, and are rather confused than aided by it. Whoever has heard James Oswald play them on his violincello, will be less inclined to dispute this with me. I have more than once seen tears of pleasure in the eyes of his auditors: and yet I think, even his playing those tunes would...\"\nwould please more if he gave them less modern ornament.\"\n\nAs these observations are for the most part true, and always ingenious, we need no other apology for quoting them at length. It is only proper to remark, that the transition in Scots music by consonant intervals, does not seem, as Dr Franklin imagines, to arise from the nature of the instruments upon which they played. It is more than probable, that the ancient British harp was not strung with wire, but with the same materials as the Welsh harps at present. These strings have not the same permanency of tone as metal; so that the sound of a preceding emphatic note must have expired before the subsequent accented note could be introduced. Besides, they who are acquainted with the manoeuvre of the Irish harp, know well that there is a method of discontinuing sounds no less easy and effectual than upon the harpsichord. When the performer finds it proper to interrupt a note, he has no more to do but return his finger gently upon the string immediately struck, which effectually stops its vibration.\n\nThat species of Scots music which we have distinguished by the name of fiddle seems now limited to reels and country-dances. There may be either in common or treble time. They most frequently consist of two strains: each of these contains eight or twelve bars. They are truly rhythmical; but the mirth which they excite seems rather to be inspired by the vivacity of the movement, than either by the force or variety of the melody. They possess a manoeuvre and expression peculiar to themselves, which it is impossible to describe, and which can only be exhibited by good performers.\n\nHaving thus far pursued the general idea of music, we shall, after the history, give a more particular detail of the science.\n\n**HISTORY OF MUSIC.**\n\nMusic is capable of so infinite a variety, so greatly does the most simple differ from the most complex, and so multiplied are the degrees between these two extremes, that in no age could the incidents respecting that fascinating art have been few or uninteresting. But, that accounts of these incidents should have been handed down to us, scanty and imperfect, is no matter of surprise, when we recollect that the history of music is the history only of sounds, of which writing is a very inadequate medium; and that men would long employ themselves in the pleasing exercise of cultivating music before they possessed either the ability or the inclination to record their exertions.\n\nNo accurate traces, therefore, of the actual state of music, in the earlier ages of the world, can be discerned. Our ideas on the subject have no foundation firmer than conjecture and analogy.\n\nIt is probable, that among all barbarous nations some degree of similarity is discernible in the style of their music. Neither will much difference appear during the first dawns of civilization. But in the more advanced periods of society, when the powers of the human mind are permitted without obstacle to exert their native activity and tendency to invention, and are at the same time affected by the infinite variety of circumstances and situations which before had no existence, and which in one case accelerate, and in another retard; then that similarity, once so distinguishable, gives place to the endless diversity of which the subject is capable.\n\nThe practice of music being universal in all ages and all nations, it would be absurd to attribute the invention of the art to any one man. It must have suffered a regular progression, through infancy, childhood, and youth, before it could arrive at maturity. The first attempts must have been rude and artless. Perhaps the first flute was a reed of the lake.\n\nNo nation has been able to produce proofs of antiquity so indisputable as the Egyptians. It would be vain, therefore, to attempt tracing music higher than the history of Egypt.\n\nBy comparing the accounts of Diodorus Siculus and of Plato, there is reason to suppose, that in very ancient times the study of music in Egypt was confined to the priesthood, who used it only on religious and solemn occasions; that, as well as sculpture, it was circumscribed by law; that it was esteemed sacred, and forbidden to be employed on light or common occasions; and that innovation in it was prohibited: But what the style or relative excellence of this very ancient music was, there are no traces by which we can form an accurate judgement. After the reigns of the Pharaohs, the Egyptians fell by turns under the dominion of the Ethiopians, the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans. By such revolutions, the manners and amusements of the people, as well as their form of government, must have been changed. In the age of the Ptolemies, the musical games and contests instituted by those monarchs were of Greek origin, and the musicians who performed were chiefly Greek.\n\nThe most ancient monuments of human art and industry, at present extant at Rome, are the obelisks brought thither from Egypt, two of which are said to have been erected by Sesostris at Heliopolis, about 400 years before the siege of Troy. These were by the order of Augustus brought to Rome after the conquest of Egypt. One of them called *guglia rossa*, or the broken pillar, which during the sacking of the city in 1527 was thrown down and broken, still lies in the Campus Martius. On it is seen the figure of a musical instrument of two strings, and with a neck. It resembles much the calafione still used in the kingdom of Naples.\n\nThis curious relic of antiquity is mentioned, because it affords better evidence than, on the subject of ancient music, is usually to be met with, that the Egyptians, at so very early a period of their history, had advanced to a considerable degree of excellence in the cultivation of the arts. By means of its neck, this instrument was capable, with only two strings, of producing a great number of notes. These two strings, if tuned fourths to each other, would furnish that series of sounds called by the ancients *heptachord*, which...\nwhich consists of a conjunct tetrachord as B, C, D, E; E, F, G, A; if tuned fifths, they would produce an octave, or two disjunct tetrachords. The calactone is tuned in this last manner. The annals of no nation other than Egypt, for many ages after the period of the obelisk at Heliopolis, exhibit the vestige of any contrivance to shorten strings during performance by a neck or finger-board. Father Montfaucon observes, that after examining 500 ancient lyres, harps, and citharas, he could discover no such thing.\n\nEgypt indeed seems to have been the source of human intelligence, and the favorite residence of genius and invention. From that celebrated country did the Greeks derive their knowledge of the first elements of those arts and sciences in which they afterwards so eminently excelled. From Greece again did the Romans borrow their attainments in the same pursuits. And from the records of those different nations have the moderns been enabled to accomplish so wonderful an improvement in literature.\n\nThe Hermes or Mercury of the Egyptians, named Trismegistus, or thrice illustrious, who was, according to Sir Isaac Newton, the secretary of Osiris, is celebrated as the inventor of music. It has already been observed, that no one person ought strictly to be called the inventor of an art which seems to be natural to, and coeval with, the human species; but the Egyptian Mercury is without doubt entitled to the praise of having made striking improvements in music, as well as of having advanced in various respects the civilization of the people, whose government was chiefly committed to his charge. The account given by Apollodorus of the manner in which he accidentally invented the lyre, is at once entertaining and probable. \"The Nile (says Apollodorus), after having overflowed the whole country of Egypt, when it returned within its natural bounds, left on the shore a great number of dead animals of various kinds, and among the rest a tortoise; the flesh of which being dried and waited by the sun, nothing remained within the shell but nerves and cartilages, and these being braced and contracted by the drying heat became sonorous. Mercury, walking along the banks of the Nile, happened to strike his foot against this shell; and was so pleased with the sound produced, that the idea of a lyre started into his imagination. He constructed the instrument in the form of a tortoise, and strung it with the dried sinews of dead animals.\"\n\nHow beautiful to conceive the energetic powers of the human mind in the early ages of the world, exploring the yet undiscovered capabilities of nature, and directed to the inexhaustible store by the finger of God in the form of accident!\n\nThe monaulos, or single flute, called by the Egyptians phutinx, was probably one of the most ancient instruments used either by them or any other nation. From various remains of ancient sculpture, it appears to have been shaped like a bull's horn, and was at first, it may be supposed, no other than the horn itself. Before the invention of flutes, as no other instrument except those of percussion were known, music must have been little more than metrical. When the art of refining and lengthening sounds was first discovered, the power of music over mankind, from the agreeable surprise occasioned by soft and extended notes, was probably irresistible. At a time when all the rest of the world was involved in savage ignorance, the Egyptians were possessed of musical instruments capable of much variety and expression.\u2014Of this the astonishing remains of the city Thebes still subsisting afford ample evidence. In a letter from Mr Bruce, ingrafted in Dr Burney's history of Music, there is given a particular description of the Theban harp, an instrument of extensive compass, and exquisite elegance of form. It is accompanied with a drawing taken from the ruins of an ancient sepulchre at Thebes, supposed by Mr Bruce to be that of the father of Sesostris.\n\nOn the subject of this harp, Mr Bruce makes the following striking observation. \"It overturns all the accounts of the earliest state of ancient music and instruments in Egypt, and is altogether, in its form, ornaments, and compass, an incontrovertible proof, stronger than a thousand Greek quotations, that geometry, drawing, mechanics, and music, were at the greatest perfection when this harp was made; and that what we think in Egypt was the invention of arts was only the beginning of the era of their restoration.\"\n\nIndeed, when the beauty and powers of this harp, along with the very great antiquity of the painting which represents it, are considered, such an opinion as that which Mr Bruce hints at, does not seem to be devoid of probability.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that during the reigns of the Ptolemies, who were voluptuous princes, music must have been much cultivated and encouraged. The father of Cleopatra, who was the last of that race of kings, derived his title of auletes, or flute player, from his excessive attachment to the flute. Like Nero, he used to array himself in the dress of a tibicen, and exhibit his performance in the public musical contests.\n\nSome authors, particularly Am. Marcellinus and M. Pau, refuse to the Egyptians, at any period of their history, any musical genius, or any excellence in the art; but the arguments used to support this opinion seem to be inconclusive, and the evidences of the opposite doctrine appear to be incontrovertible.\n\nThe sacred Scriptures afford almost the only materials from which any knowledge of Hebrew music can be drawn. In the rapid sketch, therefore, of ancient music which we mean to exhibit, a very few observations are all which can properly be given to that department of our subject.\n\nMoses, who led the Israelites out of Egypt, was educated by Pharaoh's daughter in all the literature and elegant arts cultivated in that country. It is probable, therefore, that the taste and style of Egyptian music would be infused in some degree into that of the Hebrews. Music appears to have been interwoven through the whole tissue of religious ceremony in Palestine. The priesthood seem to have been musicians hereditarily and by office. The prophets appear to have accompanied their inspired effusions with music; and every prophet, like the present improvisatori of Italy, seems to have been accompanied by a musical instrument.\n\nMusic, vocal and instrumental, constituted a great part of the funeral ceremonies of the Jews. The pomp and expense used on these occasions advanced by degrees to an excessive extent. The number of flute-players in the processions amounted sometimes to several hundreds.\nhundreds, and the attendance of the guests continued frequently for 30 days.\n\nThe Hebrew language abounds with consonants, and has so few vowels, that in the original alphabet they had no characters. It must, therefore, have been harsh and unfavourable to music. Their instruments of music were chiefly those of percussion; so that, both on account of the language and the instruments, the music must have been coarse and noisy. The vast numbers of performers too, whom it was the task of the Hebrews to collect together, could with such a language and such instruments produce nothing but clamour and jargon. According to Josephus, there were 200,000 musicians at the dedication of Solomon's temple. Such are the circumstances from which only an idea of Hebrew music can be formed; for the Jews, neither ancient nor modern, have ever had any characters peculiar to music; and the melodies used in their religious ceremonies have at all times been entirely traditional.\n\nCadmus, with the Phoenician colony which he led into Greece, imported at the same time various arts into that country. By the affluence of his Phoenician artificers, that chief discovered gold in Thrace and copper at Thebes. At Thebes that metal is still termed cadmia. Of these materials, and of iron, they formed to themselves armour and instruments of war. These they struck against each other during their dances at sacrifices, by which they first obtained the idea of music. Such is the account given of the origin of that species of music in Greece produced by instruments of percussion. The invention of wind instruments in Greece is attributed to Minerva; and to the Grecian Mercury is assigned, by the poets and historians of that country, the honour of many discoveries probably due to the Egyptian Hermes, particularly the invention of stringed instruments. The lyre of the Egyptian Mercury had only three strings; that of the Grecian seven: the last was perhaps no more than an improvement on the other. When the Greeks deified a prince or hero of their own country, they usually assigned him an Egyptian name, and with the name bestowed on their new divinity all the actions, attributes, and rites of the original.\n\nThe Grecian lyre, although said to have been invented by Mercury, was cultivated principally by Apollo, who first played upon it with method, and accompanied it with the voice. The celebrated contest between him and Marsyas is mentioned by various authors; in which, by conjoining the voice with his lyre (a combination never before attempted), his music was declared superior to the flute of Marsyas. The progress of the lyre, according to Diodorus Siculus, is the following. \"The modes added to the Grecian lyre the string called melos; Linus that of lichanos; and Orpheus and Thamyris those strings which are named hypate and parhypate.\" It has been already mentioned, that the lyre invented by the Egyptian Mercury had but three strings. By putting these circumstances together, we may perhaps acquire some knowledge of the progress of music, or at least of the extension of its scale in the highest antiquity. Melos, in the Greek music, is the fourth sound of the second tetrachord of the great system, and first tetrachord invented by the ancients, answering to our A, on the fifth line in the base. If this sound then was added to the former three, it proves that the most ancient tetrachord was that from E in the base to A; and that the three original strings in the Mercurian and Apollonian lyre were tuned E, F, G, which the Greeks call hypate melos, parhypate melos, and melos diatones: The addition, therefore, of melos to these, completed the first and most ancient tetrachord E, F, G, A. The string lichanos again being added to these, and answering to our D on the third line in the base, extended the compass downwards, and gave the ancient lyre a regular series of five sounds. The two strings hypate and parhypate, corresponding with our B and C in the base, completed the heptachord or seven sounds b, c, d, e, f, g, a; a compass which received no addition till after the days of Pindar.\n\nIt might perhaps be expected, that in a history of Greek music something ought to be said concerning the muses, Apollo, Bacchus, and the other gods and demi-gods, who in the mythology of that country appear to have promoted and improved the art. But such a discussion would be too diffusive, and involve too much foreign matter for the plan we have chosen to adopt. We cannot avoid, however, making a few observations on the poems of Homer, in so far as connected with our subject. It has been imagined, with much appearance of probability, that the occupation of the first poets and musicians of Greece resembled that of the Celtic and German bards and the bards of Iceland and Scandinavia. They sung their poems in the streets of cities and in the palaces of princes. They were treated with high respect, and regarded as inspired persons. Such was the employment of Homer. His poems, so justly celebrated, exhibit the most authentic picture that can be found in the annals of antiquity, although perhaps somewhat highly coloured, of the times of which he wrote and in which he lived. Music is always named throughout the Iliad and Odyssey with rapture; but as in these poems no mention is made of instrumental music unaccompanied with poetry and singing, a considerable share no doubt of the poet's praises is to be attributed to the poetry. The instruments most frequently named are the lyre, the flute, and the syrinx. The trumpet appears not to have been known at the siege of Troy, although it had come to be in use in the days of Homer himself. From the time of Homer till that of Sappho, there is almost a total blank in literature. Only a few fragments remain of the works of those poets and musicians whose names are preserved as having flourished between those periods (a). During the century which elapsed between the days of Sappho and those of Anacreon, no literary productions are preserved entire.\n\n(a) Hesiod lived so near to Homer, that it has been disputed which of them is the most ancient. It is now, we believe, universally admitted, that the palm of antiquity is due to Homer; but we consider them as having both flourished in the same era.\nFrom Anacreon to Pindar there is another chasm of near a century. Subsequent to this time, the works still extant of the three great tragic poets, \u00c6schylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, together with those of Plato, Aristotle, Aristozenus, Euclid, Theocritus, Callimachus, Polybius, and many others, produced all within a space less than 300 years, distinguish this illustrious and uncommon period as that in which the whole powers of genius seem to have been exerted to illuminate and instruct mankind in future ages. Then it was that eloquence, poetry, music, architecture, history, painting, sculpture, like the spontaneous blossoms of nature, flourished without the appearance of labour or of art.\n\nThe poets, as well epic as lyric and elegiac, were all likewise musicians; so strictly connected were music and poetry for many ages. It would afford amusement to collect the biographical anecdotes of these favourites of genius, and to assign to each the respective improvements made by him in music and poetry; but our limits do not admit of so extensive a disquisition; for which, therefore, reference must be made to the editors and commentators of these authors, and to the voluminous histories of music lately published.\n\nThe invention of notation and musical characters marked a distinguished era in the progress of music. There are a diversity of accounts respecting the person to whom the honour of that invention is due; but the evidences seem to preponderate in favour of Terpander, a celebrated poet and musician, to whose genius music is much indebted. He flourished about the 27th Olympiad, or 671 years before Christ.\n\nBefore that valuable discovery, music being entirely traditional, must have depended much on the memory and taste of the performer.\n\nThere is an incident mentioned in the accounts handed down to us of the Olympic games, which may serve in some degree to mark the character of music at the time in which it happened. Lucian relates that a young flute-player named Harmonides, at his first public appearance in these games, began a solo with so violent a blast, on purpose to surprise and elevate the audience, that he breathed his last breath into his flute, and died on the spot. When to this anecdote, wonderful to us, and almost incredible, is added the circumstance, that the trumpet-players at these public exhibitions expressed an excess of joy when they found their exertions had neither rent their cheeks nor burst their blood-vessels, some idea may be formed of the noisy and vociferous style of music which then prevailed; and from such facts only can any opinion be obtained of the actual state of ancient music.\n\nIn whatever manner the flute was played on, there is no doubt that it was long in Greece an instrument of high favour, and that the flute-players were held in much estimation. The flute used by Ismenias, a celebrated Theban musician, cost at Corinth three talents, or \u00a381l. 5s. If, says Xenophon, a bad flute-player would pass for a good one, he must, like the great flute-players, expend large sums on rich furniture, and appear in public with a great retinue of servants.\n\nThe ancients, it appears, were not less extravagant in gratifying the ministers of their pleasures than ourselves. Amoebeus, a harper, was paid an Attic talent, or \u00a393l. 15s. per day for his performance (B).\n\nIt is proper to add, that the celebrated musicians of Greece who performed in public were of both sexes; and that the beautiful Lamia, who was taken captive by Demetrius, in the sea engagement in which he vanquished Ptolemy Soter, and who herself captivated her conqueror, was a public performer, as well as were many other elevated female spirits, who are recorded by ancient authors in terms of admiration, and of whom, did our limits here admit of biography, we would treat with pleasure. The philosophers of Greece, whose capacious minds grasped every other object of human intelligence, were not inattentive to the theory of music, or the philosophy of sound. This department of science became the source of various sects, and of much diversity of opinion.\u2014The founders of the most distinguished sects were Pythagoras and Aristoxenus.\n\nLike every other people, the Romans, from their Roman first origin as a nation, were possessed of a species of music which might be distinguished as their own. It appears to have been rude and coarse, and probably was a variation of the music in use among the Etruscans and other tribes around them in Italy; but as soon as they began to open a communication with Greece, from that country, with their arts and philosophy, they borrowed also their music and musical instruments. No account, therefore, of Roman music is to be expected that would not be a repetition of what has been said on the subject of the music of Greece.\n\nThe excessive vanity of Nero with respect to music, vanity of displayed in his public contortions for superiority with the most celebrated professors of the art in Greece and Rome, is known to every one conversant in the history of Rome. The solicitude with which that detestable tyrant attended to his voice is curious, and will throw some light on the practices of singers in ancient times. He was in the habit of lying on his back, with a thin plate of lead on his stomach. He took frequent emetics and cathartics, abstained from all kinds of fruits and such meats as were held to be prejudicial to singing. Apprehensive of injuring his voice, he at length desisted from haranguing the soldiery and the senate; and after his return from Greece established an officer (Phonaeus) to regulate his tones in speaking.\n\nMost nations have consented in introducing music into their religious ceremonies. That art was early admitted into the rites of the Egyptians and Hebrews; and that it constituted a considerable part of the Greek and Roman religious service, appears from the writings of many ancient authors. The same pleasing art soon obtained an introduction into the Christian church, as the Acts of the Apostles discover in many passages. There remain no specimens of the music employed in the worship of the primitive Christians; but probably it was at first the same with that used in the Pagan rites of the Greeks and Romans. The practice\n\n(B) Roscius gained 500 sesterces, or 403l. 9s. 2d. sterling.\npractice of chanting the psalms was introduced into the western churches by St Ambrose, about 350 years after Christ. In the year 600, the method of chanting was improved by St Gregory the Great. The Ambrosian chant contained four modes. In the Gregorian the number was doubled. So early as the age of Constantine the Great, prior to either of the periods last mentioned, when the Christian religion first obtained the countenance of power, instrumental music came to be introduced into the service of the church.\n\nIn England, according to Bishop Stillington, music was employed in the church service, first by St Augustine, and afterwards much improved by St Dunstan, who was himself an eminent musician, and who is said to have first furnished the English churches and convents with the organ. The organ, the most majestic of all instruments, seems to have been an improvement of the hydraulica or water organ of the Greeks.\n\nThe first organ seen in France was sent from Constantinople in 757, as a present to King Pepin from the emperor Constantine Copronymus VI. In Italy, Germany, and England, that instrument became frequent during the 10th century.\n\nDuring the dark ages no work of genius or taste in any department of science seems to have been produced in any part of Europe; and except in Italy, where the cultivation of music was rather more the object of attention, that art was neglected equally with all others. There has always been observed a correspondence in every country between the progress of music and the cultivation of other arts and sciences. In the middle ages, therefore, when the most fertile provinces of Europe were occupied by the Goths, Huns, Vandals, and other barbarous tribes, whose language was as harsh as their manners were savage, little perfection and no improvement of music is to be looked for. Literature, arts, and refinements, were encouraged more early at the courts of the Roman pontiffs than in any other country; and owing to that circumstance it is, that the scale, the counterpoint, the best melodies, the dramas religious and secular, the chief graces and elegancies of modern music, have derived their origin from Italy. In modern times, Italy has been to the rest of Europe what ancient Greece was to Rome. The Italians have aided the civilization of their conquerors, and enlightened the minds of those whose superior prowess had enslaved them.\n\nHaving mentioned counterpoint, it would be improper not to make one or two observations on an invention which is supposed to have been the source of great innovation in the practice of music. Counterpoint, or music in parts, seems to be an invention purely modern. The term harmony meant in the language of antiquity what is now understood by melody. Guido, a monk of Arezzo in Tuscany, is, in the general opinion, supposed to have entertained the first idea of counterpoint about the year 1022: an art which, since his time, has experienced gradual and imperceptible improvements, far exceeding the powers or comprehension of any one individual. The term counterpoint, or contra punctum, denotes its own etymology and import. Musical notation was at one time performed by small points; and the present mode is only an improvement of that practice. Counterpoint, therefore, denotes the notation of harmony or music in parts, by points opposite to each other. The improvements of this important acquisition to the art of music kept pace at first with those of the organ; an instrument admirably adapted to harmony: And both the one and the other were till the 13th century employed chiefly in sacred music. It was at this period that sacred music began to be cultivated.\n\nBefore the invention of characters for time, music in parts must have consisted entirely of simple counterpoint, or note against note, as is still practised in psalmody. But the happy discovery of a time-table extended infinitely the powers of combined sounds. The ancients had no other resource to denote time and movement in music except two characters (\u2014), equivalent to a long and a short syllable. But time is of such importance in music, that it can impart meaning and energy to the repetition of the same sound. Without it variety of tones has no effect with respect to gravity and acuteness. The invention of the time-table is attributed by almost all the writers of the music of the last and present century to John de time-table. Muris, who flourished about the year 1330. But in a manuscript of John de Muris himself, bequeathed to the Vatican library by the Queen of Sweden, that honour seems to be yielded to Magister Franco, who appears to have been alive as late as 1083. John de Muris, however, who there is some cause to believe was an Englishman, though not the inventor of the cantus mensurabilis, did certainly by his numerous writings greatly improve it. His tract on the Art of Counterpoint is the most clear and useful essay on the subject of which those times can boast.\n\nIn the 11th century, during the first crusade, Europe began to emerge from the barbarous stupidity and ignorance which had long overwhelmed it. While its inhabitants were exercising in Asia every species of rapine and pious cruelty, art, ingenuity, and reason, infallibly civilized and softened their minds. Then it was that the poets and songsters, known by the name of Troubadours, who first appeared in Provence, instituted a new profession; which obtained the patronage of the count of Poitou, and many other princes and barons, who had themselves cultivated music and poetry with success. At the courts of their munificent patrons the troubadours were treated with respect. The ladies, whose charms they celebrated, gave them the most generous and flattering reception. The success of some inspired others with hopes, and excited exertions in the exercise of their art; impelling them towards perfection with a rapidity which the united force alone of emulation and emolument could occasion. These founders of modern versification, constructing their songs on plans of their own, classical authority, either through ignorance or design, was entirely disregarded. It does not appear, however, during the cultivation and favour of Proven\u00e7al literature, that any one troubadour so far outstripped the rest as to become a model of imitation. The progress of taste must ever be impeded by the ignorance and caprice of those who cultivate an art without science or principles.\n\nDuring almost two centuries after the arrangement of\nof the scale attributed to Guido, and the invention of the time-table ascribed to Franco; no remains of secular music can be discovered, except those of the troubadours or Proven\u00e7al poets. In the simple tunes of these bards no time indeed is marked, and but little variety of notation appears: It is not difficult, however, to discover in them the germs of the future melodies, as well as the poetry of France and Italy. Had the poetry and music of the troubadours been treated of in an agreeable manner by the writers who have chosen that subject, it would have been discovered to be worthy of attention; the poetry, as interesting to literature; the melody to which it was sung, as curious to the musical historian.\n\nAlmost every species of Italian poetry is derived from the Proven\u00e7als. Air, the most captivating part of secular vocal music, seems to have had the same origin. The most ancient strains that have been spared by time, are such as were set to the songs of the troubadours. The Proven\u00e7al language began to be in favour with poets about the end of the 13th century. In the 12th it became the general vehicle, not only of poetry, but of prose, to all who were ignorant of Latin. And these were not the laity only. At this period violars, or performers on the vielle or viol, juglars or flute-players, musars or players on other instruments, and comedians or comedians, abounded all over Europe. This swarm of poet-musicians, who were formerly comprehended in France under the general title of jongleurs, travelled from province to province, fingering their verses at the courts of princes. They were rewarded with clothes, horses, arms, and money. Jongleurs or musicians were employed often to sing the verses of troubadours, who themselves happened to be deficient in voice or ignorant of music. The term troubadour, therefore, implies poetry as well as music. The jongleurs, menestriers, strollers, or minstrels, were frequently musicians, without any pretensions to poetry. These last have been common at all times; but the troubadour or bard has distinguished a particular profession, either in ancient or modern times, only during the early dawns of literature.\n\nIn the 13th century the songs were on various subjects; moral, merry, amorous: and at that time melody seems to have been little more than plain song or chanting. The notes were square, and written on four lines only like those of the Roman church in the cliff C, and without any marks for time. The movement and embellishments of the air depended on the abilities of the finger. Since that time, by the cultivation of the voice modern music has been much extended, for it was not till towards the end of St Lewis's reign that the fifth line began to be added to the stave. The singer always accompanied himself with an instrument in unison.\n\nAs the lyre is the favourite instrument in Grecian poetry, so the harp held the same place in the estimation of the poets who flourished in the period of which we at present speak. A poet of the 14th century, Machau, wrote a poem on the subject of the harp alone; in which he affixes to each of its 25 strings an allegorical name; calling one liberality, another wealth, &c.\n\nThe instrument which frequently accompanied, and indeed disputed the pre-eminence with the harp, was the viol. Till the 16th century this instrument was furnished with frets; after that period it was reduced to four strings: and still under the denomination of viola holds the first place among treble instruments. The viol was played with a bow, and differed entirely from the vielle, the tones of which were produced by the friction of a wheel: The wheel performed the part of a bow.\n\nBritish harpers were famous long before the conquest. The bounty of William of Normandy to his fiddler or bard is recorded in the Doomsday book. The harp seems to have been the favourite instrument in Britain for many ages, under the British, Saxon, Danish, and Norman kings. The fiddle, however, is mentioned so early as 1200 in the legendary life of St Christopher. The ancient privileges of the minstrels at the fairs of Chester are well known in the history of England.\n\nThe extirpation of the bards of Wales by Edward I. is likewise too familiar an incident to be particularly mentioned here. His persecuting spirit, however, seems to have been limited to that principality; for we learn, that at the ceremony of knighting his son, a multitude of minstrels attended.\n\nIn 1315, during the reign of Edward II., such extensive privileges were claimed by the minstrels, and so many dissolute persons assumed that character, that it became necessary to restrain them by express laws.\n\nThe father of our genuine poetry, who in the 14th century enlarged our vocabulary, polished our numbers, and with acquisitions from France and Italy augmented our store of knowledge (Chaucer), entitles one of his poems The History of St Cecilia; and the celebrated patroness of music must no doubt be mentioned in a history of the art. Neither in Chaucer, however, nor in any of the histories or legendary accounts of this saint, does anything appear to authorize the religious veneration paid to her by the votaries of music; nor is it easy to discover whence it has arisen.\n\nAs an incident relative to the period of which we speak, it may be mentioned, that, according to Spelman, the appellation of Doctor was not among the degrees granted to graduates in England sooner than the reign of King John, about 1207; although, in Wood's history of Oxford, that degree is said to have been conferred, even in music, in the reign of Henry II. It is known that the title was created on the continent in the 12th century; and as, during the middle ages, music was always ranked among the seven liberal arts, it is likely that the degree was extended to it.\n\nAfter the invention of printing, an art which has tended to disseminate knowledge with wonderful rapidity among mankind, music, and particularly counterpoint, became an object of high importance. The names of the most eminent composers who flourished in England, from that time to the Reformation, were, Fairfax, William of Newark, Shervington, Turges, Banister, Tudor, Taverner, Tye, Johnson, Parsons; to whom may be added John Mirkbeck, who set the whole English cathedral service to music.\n\nBefore this period Scottish music had advanced to a high degree of perfection. James I. was a great music composer of airs to his own verses; and may be considered\ndered as the father of that plaintive melody which in Scotch tunes is so pleasing to a taste not vitiated by modern affectation. Besides the testimony of Fordun and Major, who may be suspected of being under the influence of national prejudice, we have that of Alessandro Tassoni, to the musical skill of that accomplished prince. \"Among us moderns (says this foreigner) we may reckon James king of Scotland, who not only composed many sacred pieces of vocal music, but also of himself invented a new kind of music, plaintive and melancholy, different from all others; in which he has been initiated by Carlo Gesualdo prince of Venosa, who in our age has improved music with new and admirable inventions.\"\n\nUnder such a genius in poetry and music as King James I., it cannot be doubted that the national music must have been greatly improved. We have seen that he composed several anthems, or vocal pieces of sacred music, which shows that his knowledge of the science must have been very considerable. It is likewise known, that organs were by him introduced into the cathedrals and abbeys of Scotland, and choir-service brought to such a degree of perfection, as to fall little short of that established in any country of Europe.\n\nBy an able and ingenious antiquary + the great era of music, as of poetry, in Scotland, is supposed to have been from the beginning of the reign of James I. down to the end of the reign of James V. During that period flourished Gavin Douglas bishop of Dunkeld, Ballenden archdeacon of Murray, Durbar, Henshaw, Scott, Montgomery, Sir David Lindsay, and many others, whose fine poems have been preserved in Bannatyne's Collection, and of which several have been published by Allan Ramsay in his Evergreen.\n\nBefore the Reformation, as there was but one religion, there was but one kind of sacred music in Europe, plain chant, and the descant built upon it. That music likewise was applied to one language only, the Latin. On that account, the compositions of Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Flanders, and England, kept pace in a great degree with each other in style and excellence. All the arts seem to have been the companions, if not the produce, of successful commerce; they appeared first in Italy, then in the Hanseatic towns, next in the Netherlands; and during the 16th century, when commerce became general, in every part of Europe.\n\nIn the 16th century music was an indispensable part of polite education: All the princes of Europe were instructed in that art. There is a collection preserved in manuscript called Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book. If her majesty was able to execute any of the pieces in that book, the music must have been a great player; a month's practice would not be sufficient for any matter now in Europe to enable him to play one of them to the end. Tallis, singularly profound in musical composition, and Bird, his admirable scholar, were two of the authors of this famous collection.\n\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth, the genius and learning of the British musicians were not inferior to any on the continent; an observation scarcely applicable at any other period of the history of this country. Sacred music was the principal object to study all over Europe.\n\nThe most eminent musical theorists of Italy, who flourished in the 16th century, were, Franchinus Gaffurius, or Gafforio of Lodi, Pietro Aaron of Florence, Lodovico Fogliano, Giov. Spato, Giov. Marzio da Terentino Lanfranco, Steffano Uanneo, Antonio Francesco Done, Luigi Dentice, Nicola Vicentini, and Gioteffo Zarlino, the most general, voluminous, and celebrated theorist of that period, Vincentio Galilei, a Florentine nobleman, and father of the great Galileo Galilei, Maria Artule of Bologna, Oraele Teggrini, Pietro Pontio, and Lodovico Zacconi.\n\nThe principal Roman authors were, Giovanni Anmuccia, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, justly celebrated, Ruggiero Giovanelli, Luca Marenzio, who brought to perfection madrigals, the most cheerful species of secular music.\n\nOf the Venetians, Adrian Willaert is allowed to be at the head.\n\nAt the head of the Neapolitans is deservedly placed Rocco Rodio.\n\nAt Naples, too, the illustrious dilettante, Don Carlo Gesualdo prince of Venosa, is highly celebrated. He seems, however, to have owed much of his fame to his high rank.\n\nLombardy might also furnish an ample list of eminent musicians during the 16th century, of whom, however, our limits will not admit of a particular enumeration:\n\nThe chief of them were, Conlanzo Porta, Gasoldi, Biffi, Cima, Vocchi, and Monteverde.\n\nAt Bologna, besides Artuli already mentioned, Andrea Rota of the same city appears to have been an admirable contrapunctist.\n\nFrancisco Cortecchia, a celebrated organist and composer, and Alessandro Striggio, a lutanist and voluminous composer, were the most eminent Florentines.\n\nThe inhabitants of the extensive empire of Germany have long made music a part of general education. They hold the place, next to Italy, among the most successful cultivators of the art. During the 16th century, their most eminent composers of music and writers on the subject were, Geo. Reischius, Michael Rofwick, Andreas Ornithoparchus, Paul Hofhaimer, Lufteinus, Henry Loris or Lorit, Faber, Fink, Hofman, and many others whom it would be tedious to mention; and for a particular account of whole treatises and compositions we must refer to more voluminous histories of music.\n\nIn France, during the 16th century, no art except the art of war made much progress in improvement. Ronfard, Baif, Gondimel, Claud le Jeune, Cauroy, and Maudit, are the chief French musicians of that period.\n\nIn Spain, music was early received into the circle of studies in the universities. The musical professorship at Salamanca was founded and endowed by Alfonso the Wise, king of Castile.\n\nOne of the most celebrated of the Spanish musicians was Francis Salinas, who had been blind from his infancy. He was a native of Burgos.\n\nD. Cristoforo Morales, and Tomaso Lodovico da Vittorio, deserve likewise to be mentioned; and to mention them is all we can attempt; the purpose of which is, to excite more minute inquiry by those who may choose to investigate the subject particularly.\n\nThe Netherlands, likewise, during the period of which we have been speaking, produced eminent composers;\nof whom we may mention Verletot, Gombert, Arka-\ndelt, Berchem, Richafort or Ricciafort, Crequillon Le\nCock or Le Coq, Canis, Jacob Clemens Non Papa,\nPierre Manchicourt, Balton, Kerl, Rore, Orlandi di\nLafl\u00f2, and his sons Ferdinand and Redolph.\n\nIn the 17th century, the musical writers and com-\nposers who acquired fame in England, were, Dr Na-\nthanael Giles, Thomas Tomkins, and his son of the\nsame name; Elway Bevin, Orlando Gibbons, Dr Wil-\nliam Child, Adrian Batten, Martin Pierson, William\nLawes, Henry Lawes, Dr John Willon, John Hil-\nton, John Playford, Captain Henry Cook, Pelham\nHumphrey, John Blow, William Turner, Dr Chris-\ntopher Gibbons, Benjamin Rogers, and Henry Pur-\ncell. Of these, Orlando Gibbons, Pelham Humphrey,\nand Henry Purcell, far excelled the rest.\n\nAbout the end of the reign of James I., a music-lec-\nture or professorship was founded in the university of\nOxford by Dr William Hychin.\n\nIn the reign of Charles I., a charter was granted to\nthe musicians of Westminster, incorporating them, as\nthe king's musicians, into a body politic, with powers\nto prosecute and fine all who, except themselves,\nshould \"attempt to make any benefit or advantage of\nmusic in England or Wales;\" powers which in the\nsubsequent reign were put in execution.\n\nAbout the end of the reign of Charles II., a pas-\nsion seems to have been excited in England for the\nviolin, and for pieces expressly composed for it, in\nthe Italian manner (b). Prior to 1650, there was\nlittle other music except masses and madrigals, the two\nprincipal divisions of sacred and secular music; but from\nthat time to the present, dramatic music becomes the\nchief object of attention. The music of the church\nand of the chamber continued indeed to be culti-\nvated in Italy with diligence, and in a learned and\nelaborate style, till near the middle of the century;\nyet a revolution in favour of melody and expression\nwas preparing, even in sacred music, by the success\nof dramatic composition, consisting of recitation and\nmelodies for a single voice. Such melodies began\nnow to be preferred to music of many parts; in which\ncanons, fugues, and full harmony, had been the pro-\nductions which chiefly employed the master's study\nand the hearer's attention.\n\nSo late as the beginning of the 18th century, ac-\ncording to Riccoboni, the performers in the operas\nof Germany, particularly at Hamburg, \"were all\ntradesmen or handicrafts. Your shoemaker (says he)\nwas often the first performer on the stage; and you\nmight have bought fruit and sweetmeats of the same\ngirls, whom the night before you had seen in the cha-\nracters of Armida or Semiramis. Soon, however, the\nGerman opera arose to a more respectable situation; and\neven during the 17th century many eminent composers\nflourished in that country.\n\nThe list of great musicians which France produced\nduring the early part of the same century is not nu-\nmerous. Music seems to have been but little culti-\nvated in that country, till the operas of Lulli, under\nthe powerful patronage of Louis XIV., excited public\nattention.\n\nThe favourite singing-master and composer of France,\nabout the middle of the 17th century, was Michael\nLambert. John Baptist Lulli, soon after this time,\nrose from the rank of a menial servant to fame, opulence,\nand nobility, by his skill in musical compositions. The\ncelebrated singer La Rochois was taught singing and\nacting by Lulli.\n\nLa Maupin the successor of La Rochois, on ac-\ncurious count of her extraordinary character and romantic ad-\nventures, deserves to be mentioned. She eloped from a French\nher husband with a fencing-master, of whom she learned\nthe small sword. She became an excellent fencer. At\nMarfelles she entertained a strange attachment to a young\nlady, who was seized with a whimsical fondness in re-\nturn, on account of which the latter was confined in a\nconvent. La Maupin obtained admission into the same\nconvent as a novice. She set fire to the building, and\nin the confusion carried off her favourite. At Paris\nwhen she appeared on the stage in 1695, Domeni a\nfinger having affronted her, she put on men's clothes,\nand inflicted on his drawing his sword and fighting her.\nWhen he refused, she caned him, and took from him\nhis watch and snuff-box as trophies of her victory. At\na ball given by Monseigneur brother of Louis XIV., she\nagain put on men's clothes; and having behaved im-\npertinently to a lady, three of the lady's friends, suppo-\ning La Maupin to be a man, called her out. She\nkilled them all; and returning coolly to the ball, told\nthe story to Monseigneur, who obtained her pardon. She\nbecame afterwards mistress to the elector of Bavaria.\nThis prince quitting her for the countess of Arcos,\nsent her by the count, husband of that lady, a purse of\n40,000 livres. She threw it at the count's head, tell-\ning him, it was a recompense worthy of such meanness\nas he displayed. At last, feigned with a fit of devotion,\nshe recalled her husband, and spent the remainder of\nher life in piety. She died in 1707 at the age only of\n34.\n\nThe English musician whom we last mentioned was Chief com-\nthe celebrated Purcell. After his time the chief com-\nposers for the church were Clarke, Dr Holden, Dr the church\nCreyghton, Tucker, Aldrich, Golwin, Weldon, Dr in England.\nCrofts, Dr Greene, Boyce, and Nares; to whom may\nbe added John Stanley, who attained high proficiency\nin music, although from two years old totally deprived\nof sight.\n\nThe annals of modern music have hitherto furnish-\ned no event so important to the progress of the art as\nthe invention of recitative or dramatic melody; a style\nof music which resembles the manner of the ancient\nrhapsodists.\n\nThe Orfeo of Politian was the first attempt at mu-\nFirst musi-\nsical drama. It was afterwards perfected by Meta-\ncal drama.\nsio. No musical dramas similar to those afterwards\nknown\n\n(b) The most celebrated violin players of Italy, from the 16th century to the present time, have been Fa-\nrina, M. Angelo Rossi, Buiani the violin-master of Corelli, the admirable Angelico Corelli himself, Torelli,\nAlberti, Albenoni, Tessarini, Vivaldi, Geminiani one of the most distinguished of Corelli's scholars, Tartini,\nVeracini, Barbella, Locatelli, Ferrari, Martini, Boccherini, and Giardini.\nknown by the names of opera and oratorio, had existence in Italy before the beginning of the 17th century. It was above the 1650s, or a little before that time, that eunuchs were first employed for singing in Italy.\n\nThere seem to have been no singing eunuchs in ancient times, unless the galli or archigalli, priests of Cybele, were such. Caltration has, however, at all times been practised in eastern countries, for the purpose of furnishing to tyrannic jealousy guards of female chastity; but never, so far as modern writers on the subject have discovered, merely to preserve the voice, till about the end of the 16th century.\n\nAt Rome, the first public theatre opened for the exhibition of musical dramas, in modern times, was il Torre de Nona, where in 1671 Gialone was performed. In 1679, the opera of Don Amore, set by the famous organist Bernardo Pasquini, was represented at Nilla Sala de Signori Capranica; a theatre which still subsists. In the year 1680, L'Onella negli Amore was exhibited; the first dramatic composition of the elegant, profound, and original Alessandro Scarlatti.\n\nThe inhabitants of Venice have cultivated and encouraged the musical drama with more zeal and diligence than the rest of Italy, during the end of the last and beginning of the present century; yet the opera was not established in Venice before the year 1637. In that year the first regular drama was performed. It was Andromeda.\n\nIn 1680 the opera of Berenice was exhibited at Padua with such astonishing splendour as to merit notice. There were choruses of 100 virgins, 100 soldiers, 100 horsemen in iron armour, 40 cornets of horse, 6 trumpeters on horseback, 6 drummers, 6 ensigns, 6 sackbuts, 6 great flutes, 6 minstrels playing on Turkish instruments, 6 others on octave flutes, 6 pages, 3 sergeants, 6 cymbalists. There were 12 huntmen, 12 grooms, 6 coachmen for the triumph, 6 others for the procession, 2 lions led by two Turks, 2 elephants by two others, Berenice's triumphal car drawn by 4 horses, 6 other cars with prisoners and spoils drawn by 12 horses, 6 coaches. Among the scenes and representations in the first act were, a vast plain with two triumphal arches, another plain with pavilions and tents, and a forest for the chase. In act third, the royal dressing room completely furnished, stables with 100 live horses, portico adorned with tapestry, and a stupendous palace in perspective. At the end of the first act were representations of every kind of chase, wild boar, stag, deer, bears. At the end of the third act, an enormous globe, descending as from the sky, divided itself into other globes suspended in the air, and ornamented with emblematical figures of time, fame, honour, &c.\n\nEarly in the last century, machinery and decoration usurped the importance due to poetry and music in such exhibitions.\n\nFew instances occur of musical dramas at Naples till the beginning of the present century. Before the time of the elder Scarlatti, it seems as if Naples had been less fertile in great contrapuntists, and less diligent in the cultivation of dramatic music, than any other state of Italy. Since that time all the rest of Europe has been furnished with composers and performers from that city.\n\nThe word opera seems to have been familiar to French English poets from the beginning of the last century and English recitative, a recent innovation even in Italy, is mentioned by Ben Jonson so early as 1617. From this time it was used in masques, occasionally in plays, and in cantatas, before a regular drama wholly set to music was attempted. By the united abilities of Quinault and Lulli, the opera in France had arisen to high favour. This circumstance afforded encouragement to several attempts at dramatic music in England by Sir William D'Avenant and others, before the music, language, or performers of Italy were employed on our stage. Pieces, styled dramatic operas, preceded the Italian opera on the stage of England. These were written in English, and exhibited with a profuse decoration of scenery and habits, and with the best fingers and dancers that could be procured: Plyche and Circe are entertainments of this kind: The Tempest and Macbeth were acted with the same accompaniments.\n\nDuring the 17th century, whatever attempts were made in musical drama, the language sung was always English. About the end of that century, however, Italian singing began to be encouraged, and vocal as well as instrumental musicians from that country began to appear in London.\n\nThe first musical drama, performed wholly after the Italian manner in recitative for the dialogue or narrative parts, and measured melody for the airs, was Arfino\u00eb Queen of Cyprus, translated from an Italian opera of the same name, written by Stanzani of Bologna. The English version of this opera was set to music by Thomas Clayton, one of the royal band, in the reign of William and Mary. The fingers were all English: Mells Hughes, Leveredge, and Cook; Mrs Tofts, Mrs Crofs, and Mrs Lyndey. The translation of Arfino\u00eb, and the music to which it is set, are execrable; yet such is the charm of novelty, that this miserable performance, deserving neither the name of a drama by its poetry, nor of an opera by its music, sustained 24 representations, and the second year 11.\n\nOperas, notwithstanding their deficiencies in poetry, music and performance (no foreign composer or eminent finger having yet arrived), became so formidable to our actors at the theatres, that it appears from the Daily Courant, 14th January 1707, a subscription was opened \"for the encouragement of the comedians acting in the Haymarket, and to enable them to keep the diversion of plays under a separate interest from operas.\"\n\nMr Addison's opera of Rosamond appeared about this time; but the music set by Clayton is so contemptible, that the merit of the poetry, however great, could not of itself long support the piece. The choice of so mean a composer as Clayton, and Mr Addison's partiality to his abilities, betray a want of musical taste in that elegant author.\n\nThe first truly great finger who appeared on the stage of Britain was Cavalier Nicolino Grimaldi, commonly known by the name of Nicolini. He was a Neapolitan; and though a beautiful finger indeed, was still more eminent as an actor. In the Tatler, No. 115, the elegance and propriety of his action are particularly described. Recently before his appearance, Valentini Urbani, and a female finger called The vol. i. No. 3 R Baronesi.\nBarcheys arrived. Margarita de l'Epini, who afterwards married Dr Pepusch, had been in this country some time before.\n\nThe first opera performed wholly in Italian, and by Italian singers, was Almazide. As at present, so at that time, operas were generally performed twice a week.\n\nArrival of Handel in England.\n\nThe year 1710 is distinguished in the annals of music by the arrival in Britain of George Frederick Handel. Handel had been in the service of the elector of Hanover, and came first to England on a visit of curiosity. The fame of this great musician had penetrated into this country before he himself arrived in it; and Aaron Hill, then in the direction of the Haymarket theatre, instantly applied to him to compose an opera. It was Rinaldo; the admirable music of which he produced entirely in a fortnight. Soon after this period appeared, for the first time as an opera singer, the celebrated Mrs Anastasia Robinson. Mrs Robinson, who was the daughter of a portrait painter, made her first public exhibitions in the concerts at York buildings; and acquired so much the public favour, that her father was encouraged to take a house in Golden Square, for the purpose of establishing weekly concerts and assemblies, in the manner of Conversazioni, which became the resort of the most polite audiences.\n\nSoon after Mrs Robinson accepted an engagement at the Opera, where her salary is said to have been 100l. and her other emoluments equal to that sum. She quitted the stage in consequence of her marriage with the gallant earl of Peterborough, the friend of Pope and Swift. The eminent virtues and accomplishments of this lady, who died at the age of 88, entitled her to be mentioned even in a compend too short for biography.\n\nThe conducting the opera having been found to be more expensive than profitable, it was entirely suspended from 1717 till 1720, when a fund of 50,000l. for supporting and carrying it on was subscribed by the first personages of the kingdom. The subscribers, of whom King George I. was one for 1000l., were formed into a society, and named The Royal Academy of Music. Handel was commissioned to engage the performers: For that purpose he went to Dresden, where Italian operas were at that time performed in the most splendid manner at the court of Augustus elector of Saxony, than king of Poland. Here Handel engaged Senefino-Berenstadt, Bofchi, and the Duranstanti.\n\nIn the 1723, the celebrated Francesca Cuzzoni appeared as a first-rate singer; and two years afterwards arrived the distinguished rival Signora Faustina Bordoni.\n\nIn a cantabile air, though the notes Cuzzoni added were few, she never lost an opportunity of enriching the cantilena with the most beautiful embellishments. Her shake was perfect. She possessed a creative fancy; and she enjoyed the power of occasionally accelerating and retarding the measure in the most artificial and able manner, by what is in Italy called tempo rubato. Her high notes were unrivalled in clearness and sweetness. Her intonations were so just and so fixed, that it seemed as if she had not the power to hang out of tune.\n\nFaustina Bordoni, wife of the celebrated Saxon composer Haff\u00e9, invented a new kind of singing, by running divisions, with a neatness and velocity which astonished all who heard her. By taking her breath imperceptibly, she had the art of sustaining a note apparently longer than any other finger. Her beats and trills were strong and rapid; her intonation perfect. Her professional perfections were enhanced by a beautiful face, fine symmetry of figure, and a countenance and gaiture on the stage which indicated an entire intelligence and possession of the several parts allotted to her.\n\nThese two angelic performers excited so signally the attention of the public, that a party spirit between the abettors of the one and of the other was formed, as violent and as inveterate almost as any of those that had ever occurred relative to matters either theological or political; yet so distinct were their styles of singing, so different their talents, that the praise of the one was no reproach to the other.\n\nIn less than seven years, the whole 50,000l. subscribed by the Royal Academy, besides the produce of admission to non-subscribers, was expended, and the governor and directors of the society relinquished the idea of continuing their engagements; consequently, at the close of the season 1727, the whole band of fingers dispersed. The next year we find Senefino, Faustina, Balde, Cuzzoni, Nicolini, Farinelli, and Bofchi, at Venice.\n\nHandel, however, at his own risk, after a suspension of about a twelvemonth, determined to recommence the Opera; and accordingly engaged a band of performers entirely new. These were Signor Bernacchi, Signora Merighi, Signora Strada, Signor Anabile Pio Fabri, his wife, Signora Bertoldi, and John Godfried Reinichenbinder.\n\nThe sacred musical drama, or oratorio, was invented early in the 14th century. Every nation in Europe of the oratorio, and seems first to have had recourse to religious subjects for its introduction dramatic exhibitions. The oratorios had been common in Italy during the last century. They had never been to England, publicly introduced in England, till Handel, stimulated by the rivalry of other adventurers, exhibited in 1732 his oratorios of Esther, and of Acis and Galatea, the last of which he had composed twelve years before for the duke of Chandos's chapel at Cannons. The most formidable opposition which Handel met with in his conduct of the Italian opera was a new theatre for exhibiting these operas, opened by subscription in Lincoln's-inn Fields, under the conduct of Nicola Porpora, a respectable composer. A difference having occurred between Handel and Senefino; Senefino had for some time deserted the Haymarket, where Handel managed, and was now engaged at the rival theatre of Lincoln's-inn Fields. To supply the place of Senefino, Handel brought over Giovanni Carefini, a singer of the most extensive powers. His voice was at first a powerful and clear soprano: Afterwards it changed into the fullest, finest, deepest counter-tenor that has perhaps ever been heard. Carefini's person was tall, beautiful, and majestic. He rendered every thing he sung interesting by energy, taste, and judicious embellishment. In the execution of difficult divisions from the chest, his manner was articulate and admirable. It was the opinion of Haff\u00e9, as well as other eminent professors,\nthat whoever had not heard Carestini, was unacquainted with the most perfect style of singing. The opera under the direction of Porpora was removed to the Haymarket, which Handel had left. Handel occupied the theatre of Lincoln's Inn Fields; but his rivals now acquired a vast advantage of attraction, by the accession of Carlo Broschi detto Farinelli to their part, who at this time arrived. This renowned singer seems to have transcended the limits of all anterior vocal excellence. No vocal performer of the present century has been so unanimously allowed to possess an uncommon power, sweetness, extent, and agility of voice, as Farinelli. Nicolini, Seneffo, and Carestini, gratified the eye as much by the dignity, grace, and propriety of their action and deportment, as the ear, by the judicious use of a few notes within the limits of a small compass of voice; but Farinelli, without the affluence of significant gestures or graceful attitudes, enchanted and astonished his hearers, by the force, extent, and mellifluous tones of the mere organ, when he had nothing to execute, articulate, or express.\n\nThough during the time of singing he was as motionless as a statue, his voice was so active that no intervals were too close, too wide, or too rapid, for his execution.\n\nHandel having lost a great part of his fortune by the opera, was under the necessity of trying the public gratitude in a benefit, which was not disgraced by the event. The theatre, for the honour of the nation, was so crowded, that he is said to have cleared 800l.\n\nAfter a fruitless attempt by Heidegger, the coadjutor of Handel in the conduct of the opera, and patentee of the King's Theatre in Haymarket, to procure a subscription for continuing it, it was found necessary to give up the undertaking.\n\nIt was about this time that the statue of Handel was erected in Vauxhall, at the expense of Mr Tyers, proprietor of those gardens.\n\nThe next year (1739) Handel carried on oratorios at the Haymarket, as the opera there was suspended. The earl of Middlesex now undertook the troublesome office of impresario of the Italian opera. He engaged the King's theatre, with a band of singers from the continent almost entirely new. Caluppi was his composer. Handel, almost ruined, retired at this time to Ireland, where he remained a considerable time. In 1744 he again attempted oratorios at the King's theatre, which was then, and till 1746, unoccupied by the opera, on account of the rebellion.\n\nThe arrival of Giardini in London this year forms a memorable era in the history of instrumental music of England. His powers on the violin were unequalled. The same year Dr Croza, then manager of the opera, eloped, leaving the performers, and innumerable trades people, his creditors. This incident put an end to operas of all kinds for some time.\n\nThis year a comic opera, called *Il Filosofo di Campagna*, composed by Caluppi, was exhibited, which surpassed in musical merit all the comic operas performed in England till the *Bionda Figliola*. Signora Paganini acquired such fame by the airs allotted to her in that piece, that the crowds at her benefit were beyond example. Caps were lost, gowns torn in pieces, and ladies in full dress, without servants or carriages, were obliged to walk home, amidst the merriment of the spectators on the streets.\n\nAt this period the arrival of Giovanni Manzoli marked a splendid era in the annals of musical drama, by conferring on serious opera a degree of importance to which it had seldom yet arisen since its establishment in England. Manzoli's voice was the most powerful and voluminous soprano that had been heard since the time of Farinelli: His manner of singing was grand, and full of taste and dignity.\n\nAt this time Tenducci, who had been in England some time before, and was now returned much improved, performed in the station of second man to Manzoli.\n\nGaetano Guadagni made a great figure at this time. He had been in this country early in life (1748), as a ferocious man in a burletta troop of singers. His voice was then a full and well-toned counter tenor; but he sung wildly and carelessly. The excellence of his voice, however, attracted the notice of Handel, who assigned him the parts in his oratorios, the Messiah and Samson, which had been originally composed for Mrs Cibber. He quitted London for the first time about 1753. The highest expectations of his abilities were raised by fame before his second arrival, at the time of which we treat. As an actor he seems to have had no equal on any stage in Europe. His figure was uncommonly elegant and noble; his countenance replete with beauty, intelligence, and dignity; his attitudes were full of grace and propriety. Those who remember his voice when formerly in England were now disappointed: It was comparatively thin and feeble: He had now changed it to a soprano, and extended its compass from six or seven notes to fourteen or fifteen. The music he sung was the most simple imaginable; a few notes with frequent pauses, and opportunities of being liberated from the composer and the band, were all he required. In these effusions, seemingly extemporaneous, he displayed the native power of melody unaided by harmony or even by unanimous accompaniment: The pleasure he communicated proceeded principally from his artful manner of diminishing the tones of his voice, like the dying notes of the Rollan harp. Most other singers affect a swell, or *mezza voce*; but Guadagni, after beginning a note with force, attenuated it so delicately that it possessed all the effect of extreme distance. During the season 1770 and 1771, Tenducci was the immediate successor of Guadagni. This performer, who appeared in England first only as a singer of the second or third class, was during his residence in Scotland and Ireland so much improved as to be well received as first man, not only on the stage of London, but in all the great theatres of Italy.\n\nIt was during this period that dancing seemed first to gain the ascendancy over music by the superior talents of Mademoiselle Heineil, whose grace and execution were so perfect as to eclipse all other excellence.\n\nIn the first opera performed this season (*Lucco Vero*) appeared Miss Cecilia Davies, known in Italy by the name of L'Inglesiina. Miss Davies had the honour of being the first English woman who had ever been thought worthy of singing on any stage in Italy. She even performed with eclat the principal female characters on many of the great theatres of that country.\n\nGabrielli\nGabrielli only on the Continent was said to surpass her. Her voice, though not of great volume, was clear and perfectly in tune; her shake was open and distinct, without the flaccidity of the French cadence. The flexibility of her throat rendered her execution equal to the most rapid divisions.\n\nNext season introduced Venanzio Ravigini, a beautiful and animated young man; a composer as well as a singer.\u2014His voice was sweet, clear, flexible; in compass more than two octaves.\n\nThe season 1775 and 1776 was rendered memorable by the arrival of the celebrated Caterina Gabrielli, styled early in life La Cucchetina, being the daughter of a cardinal's cook at Rome. She had, however, in her countenance and deportment no indications of low birth. Her manner and appearance depicted dignity and grace. So great was her reputation before her arrival in England for singing and for caprice, that the public, expecting perhaps in both too much, were unwilling to allow her due praise for her performance, and were apt to ascribe everything she did to pride and influence. Her voice, though exquisite, was not very powerful. Her chief excellence having been the neatness and rapidity of her execution, the surprise of the public must have been much diminished on hearing her after Miss Davies, who sung many of the same songs in the same style, and with a neatness so nearly equal, that common hearers could distinguish no difference. The discriminating critic, however, might have discovered a superior sweetness in the natural tone of Gabrielli's voice, an elegance in the finishing of her musical periods or passages, an accent and precision in her divisions, superior not only to Miss Davies, but to every other singer of her time. In slow movements her pathetic powers, like those in general of performers most renowned for agility, were not exquisitely touching.\n\nAbout the time of which we have been treating, the proprietors of the Pantheon ventured to engage Aguari at the enormous salary of \u00a3100 per night, for singing two songs only! Lucrezia Aguari was a truly wonderful performer. The lower part of her voice was full, round, and of excellent quality; its compass amazing. She had two octaves of fair natural voice, from A on the fifth line in the bass to A on the sixth line in the treble, and beyond that in alto she had in early youth more than another octave. She has been heard to ascend to Bb in altissimo. Her shake was open and perfect; her intonation true; her execution marked and rapid; the style of her singing, in the natural compass of her voice, grand and majestic.\n\nIn 1776 arrived Anna Pozzi, as successor to Gabrielli. She possessed a voice clear, sweet, and powerful; but her inexperience, both as an actress and as a singer, produced a contrast very unfavourable to her when compared with so celebrated a performer as Gabrielli. After that time, however, Pozzi, with more study and knowledge, became one of the best and most admired female singers in Italy.\n\nAfter the departure of Aguari for the second and last time, the managers of the Pantheon engaged Georgi as her successor. Her voice was exquisitely fine, but totally uncultivated. She was thereafter employed as the first woman in the operas of the principal cities of Italy.\n\nDuring the seasons 1777 and 1778, the principal Roncaglia fingers at the opera in London were Francesco Roncaglia and Francesca Danze, afterwards Madame Le Brun.\n\nRoncaglia possessed a sweet toned voice; but of the three great requisites of a complete stage finger, pathos, grace, and execution, which the Italians call cantabile, grazioso, and brasura, he could lay claim only to the second. His voice, a voce de camera, when confined to the grazioso in a room, left nothing to be wished for.\n\nDanze had a voice well in tune, a good shake, great execution, prodigious compass, with great knowledge of music; yet the pleasure her performance imparted was not equal to these accomplishments. But her object was not so much pathos and grace, as to surprise by the imitation of the tone and difficulties of instruments.\n\nThis year Gasparo Pacchierotti appeared in London, whither his high reputation had penetrated long before. The natural tone of his voice was interesting, sweet and pathetic. His compass downwards was great, with an ascent up to Bb, and sometimes to C in alto. He possessed an unbounded fancy, and the power not only of executing the most difficult and refined passages, but of inventing embellishment entirely new. Ferdinando Bertoni, a well-known composer, came along with Pacchierotti to Britain.\n\nAbout this time dancing became an important branch of the amusements of the opera house. Mademoiselle Gain attended Heinel, M. Veltris le Jeune, Mademoiselle Bacelli, had, over music during some years, delighted the audience at the opera; but on the arrival of M. Veltris P'Axin\u00e8, pleasure was a house exchanged for ecstasy. In the year 1781, Pacchierotti had by this time been so frequently heard, that his singing was no impediment to conversation; but while the elder Veltris was on the stage, not a breathing was to be heard. Those lovers of music who talked the loudest while Pacchierotti sang, were in agonies of terror lest the graceful movements of Veltris, le dieu de la danse, should be disturbed by audible approbation. After that time, the most mute and respectful attention was paid to the manly grace of Le Picq, and the light fantastic toe of the younger Veltris; to the Rossis, the Theodores, the Coulons, the Hillingburghs; while the flighted fingers were disturbed, not by the violence of applause, but the clamour of inattention.\n\nThe year 1784 was rendered a memorable era in the annals of music by the splendid and magnificent manner in which the birth and genius of Handel were commemorated in Westminster Abbey and the Pantheon, by five performances of pieces selected from his own works, and executed by a band of more than 500 voices and instruments, in the presence and under the immediate auspices of their majesties and the first personages of the kingdom. The commemoration of Handel has been since established as an annual musical festival for charitable purposes; in which the number of performers and the perfection of the performances have continued to increase. In 1785 the band, vocal and instrumental, amounted to 616; in 1786 to 741; in 1787 to 806; and in subsequent years to still greater numbers.\n\nDr Burney published An Account of the Musical Performances in Commemoration of Handel, for the benefit.\nbenefit of the Musical Fund. The members and guardians of that fund are now incorporated under the title of Royal Society of Musicians. See Handel.\n\nThis year Pacchierotti and his friend Bertoni left England. About the same time our country was deprived of the eminent composer Sacchini, and Giarini the greatest performer on the violin now in Europe.\n\nAs a compensation for these losses, this memorable year is distinguished by the arrival of Madame Mara, whose performance in the commemoration of Handel in Westminster Abbey inspired an audience of 3000 of the first people of the kingdom, not only with pleasure but with eclat and rapture.\n\nRubinelli. In 1786 arrived Giovanni Rubinelli. His voice was a true and full contralto from C in the middle of the scale to the octave above. His style was grand; his execution neat and distinct; his taste and embellishments new, select, and masterly.\n\nA new dance by N. Noverre. In 1788 a new dance, composed by the celebrated M. Noverre, called Cupid and Psyche, was exhibited along with the opera La Locandiera, which produced an effect so uncommon as to deserve notice. So great was the pleasure it afforded to the spectators, that Noverre was unanimously brought on the stage and crowned with laurel by the principal performers. This, though common in France, was a new mark of approbation in England.\n\nMarchesi. This year arrived Signor Luige Marchesi, a singer whose talents have been the subject of praise and admiration on every great theatre of Europe. Marchesi's style of singing was not only elegant and refined in an uncommon degree, but often grand and full of dignity, particularly in his recitative and occasional low notes. His variety of embellishment and facility of running extempore divisions were wonderful. Many of his graces were elegant and of his own invention.\n\nThe three greatest Italian singers of these times were certainly Pacchierotti, Rubinelli, and Marchesi. In discriminating the several excellencies of these great performers, a very respectable judge, Dr Burney, has particularly praised the sweet and touching voice of Pacchierotti; his fine shake, his exquisite taste, his great fancy, and his divine expression in pathetic songs: Of Rubinelli's voice, the fulness, steadiness, and majesty, the accuracy of his intonations, his judicious graces: Of Marchesi's voice, the elegance and flexibility, his grandeur in recitative, and his boundless fancy and embellishments.\u2014Having mentioned Dr Burney, we are in justice bound to acknowledge the aid we have derived from his history; a work which we greatly prefer to every other modern production on the subject.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 18th century many eminent composers flourished on the continent; such as Jomelli, the family of the Bachs, Gluck, Haydn, and many others, whose different styles and excellencies would well deserve to be particularized, would our limits permit. With the same regard to brevity, we can do no more than just mention the late king of Prussia, the late elector of Bavaria, and Prince Lobkowitz, as eminent dilettanti of modern times.\n\nBesides the opera singers whom we have mentioned, our theatres and public gardens have exhibited singers of considerable merit. In 1730 Miss Rafter, afterwards the celebrated Mrs Clive, first appeared on the stage at Drury-lane as a singer. The same year introduced Miss Cecilia Young, afterwards the wife of Dr Arne. Her style of singing was infinitely superior to that of any other English woman of her time.\n\nOur favourite musicians at this time were, Dubourg, Favourite Clegg, Clarke, and Felting, on the violin; Kytch on the hautboy; Jack Felting on the German flute; Batton on the common flute; Karba on the bassoon; Valentine Snow on the trumpet; and on the organ, Roseingrave, Green, Robinon, Magnus, Jack James, and the blind Stanley, who seems to have been preferred. The favourite playhouse singer was Salway; and at concerts Mountier of Chichester.\n\nAs composers for our national theatre, Pepusch and Galliard seem to have been unrivalled till 1732; when two competitors appeared, who were long in possession of the public favour: We allude to John Frederick Lampe and Thomas Augustus Arne.\n\nIn 1736 Mrs Gibber, who had captivated every hearer of sensibility by her native sweetness of voice and powers of expression as a singer, made her first attempt as a tragic actress. The same year Beard became a favourite singer at Covent-garden. At this time Miss Young, afterwards Mrs Arne, and her two sisters Isabella and Ethel, were the favourite English female singers.\n\nIn 1738 was instituted the fund for the support of decayed musicians and their families.\n\nIt was in 1745 that Mr Tyers, proprietor of Vauxhall gardens, first added vocal music to the other entertainments of that place. A short time before Ranelagh had become a place of public amusement.\n\nIn 1749 arrived Giardini, whose great taste, hand, and style in playing on the violin, procured him universal admiration. A few years after his arrival he formed a morning academia or concert at his house, composed chiefly of his scholars.\n\nAbout this time San Martini and Charles Avion were eminent composers.\n\nOf near 150 musical pieces brought on our national theatres within 40 years, 38 of them at least were set by Arne. The style of this composer, if analyzed, would perhaps appear to be neither Italian nor English; but an agreeable mixture of both and of Scotch.\n\nThe late earl of Kelly, who died some years ago, deserves particular notice, as possessed of a very eminent degree of musical science, far superior to other dilettanti, and perhaps not inferior to any professor of his time. There was no part of theoretical or practical music in which he was not thoroughly versed: He possessed a strength of hand on the violin, and a genius for composition, with which few professors are gifted.\n\nCharles Frederic Abel was an admirable musician: His performance on the viol da gamba was in every particular complete and perfect. He had a hand which no difficulties could embarrass; a taste the most refined and delicate; a judgement to correct and certain as never to permit a single note to escape him without meaning. His compositions were easy and elegantly simple. In writing and playing an adagio he was superior to all praise; the most pleasing yet learned modulation, the richest harmony, the most elegant and polished melody, were all expressed with the most exquisite feeling, taste, and science. His manner of playing...\nplaying an adagio soon became the model of imitation for all our young performers on bowed instruments. Bartholomew Cervetto, Cramer, and Crofild, were in this respect to be ranked as of his school. All lovers of music must have lamented that Abel in youth had not attached himself to an instrument more worthy of his genius, taste, and learning, than the viol da gamba, that remnant of the old chest of viols which during the 17th century was a necessary appendage of a nobleman's or gentleman's family throughout Europe, previous to the admission of violins, tenors, and basses, in private houses or public concerts. Since the death of the late elector of Bavaria, (who was next to Abel the best performer on the viol da gamba in Europe): the instrument seems quite laid aside. It was used longer in Germany than elsewhere; but the place of gambist seems now as much suppressed in the chapels of German princes as that of lutist. The celebrated performer on the violin, Lolle, came to England in 1785. Such was his caprice, that he was seldom heard; and so eccentric was his style and composition, that by many he was regarded as a madman. He was, however, during his lucid intervals a very great and expressive performer in the serious style.\n\nMrs Billington, after distinguishing herself in childhood as a neat and expressive performer on the pianoforte, appeared all at once in 1756 as a sweet and captivating singer. In emulation of Mara and other great bravura singers, she at first too frequently attempted passages of difficulty; afterward, however, so greatly was she improved, that no song seemed too high or too rapid for her execution. Now, at the distance of 20 years, she retains her high reputation. The natural tone of her voice is so exquisitely sweet, her knowledge of music so considerable, her taste so true, her clothes and embellishments so various, her expressions so grateful, that envy only or apathy could hear her without delight.\n\nThe present composers, and performers of the first class, are so well known to the lovers of the art, that it would be needless and improper to mention them particularly.\n\nThe Catch-club at the Thatched House, instituted in 1762 by the earl of Eglington, the present duke of Queensberry, and others; and the concert of ancient music, suggested by the earl of Sandwich in 1776, have had a beneficial effect in improving the art.\n\nTwo female performers have lately appeared of distinguished eminence.\n\nMadame Graffini had exhibited her vocal powers in Paris with extraordinary applause, and arrived in London in 1805, where she excited uncommon admiration. She appeared in Zaira, where the display of her powers not only pleased, but the astonished, when it was considered that the compass of her voice did not exceed eight or ten notes.\n\nThe year following Madame Catalani divided the public attention with Graffini.\u2014This eminent performer is a native of Sinigaglia in Italy, where her father was a singer of the comic order.\n\nShe was educated in a convent. The virtuous impressions she there received, have continued ever since invariably to influence her conduct.\n\nHer father soon discovered the excellence and the value of her vocal powers, which were first exhibited on the provincial theatres of Italy.\u2014He soon carried her to Spain, where she attained very high celebrity. It was there her husband, M. de Valabregue, first paid his addresses to her; and it was not till after a perseverance of seven months that he at last obtained her consent, to unite her fortunes with his. Her hesitation proceeded from the reluctance of her father, at once to be deprived of his daughter, and of the very great emolument which she brought him. M. de Valabregue had been an officer in the French army under General Moreau.\n\nFrom Spain Madame Catalani (for she has retained her father's name), proceeded to Portugal, where she accepted an engagement to come to London. She travelled through France, and at Paris appeared at an occasional concert, where her fame was so great, that the usual price of admission was trebled. She particularly attracted the attention of the singular man who now holds the imperial sceptre of the continent of Europe. He ordered her a pension (its value is about \u00a330 per annum); and it was with much difficulty, and only through the interference of the British ambassador (the earl of Lauderdale) then at Paris, that she was permitted to leave that capital, and proceed on her journey.\n\nIn the dramatic music of the opera, this singer is far superior to any performer ever heard in this country. Her merit in Semiramis, in particular, presents almost the idea of perfection. Her voice is equal to the most difficult execution, while her countenance is interesting, her gestures graceful, and her person elegant. It has been reported that she does not sing in tune; but it is an undeniable fact, vouched by the first musicians, that she possesses a most accurate ear. Every vocal performer occasionally emits a false sound in consequence of some temporary organic cause.\n\nCatalani's easy and clear articulation are particularly striking. Her tones are full and liquid. Her cadenzas are appropriate and masterly. She has a practice of rapidly descending in half notes, which has excited admiration chiefly by its entire novelty. The clearness and rapidity displayed by her in chromatic passages excite astonishment; and the combines mellowness with distinctness, a high qualification which Mara first taught us to appreciate. In the course of summer 1807, Madame Catalani visited the provincial theatres of England, and appeared likewise in Dublin, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. Her total receipts for that year are said to have exceeded \u00a35,000.\n\nWe have been somewhat particular in our account of musical affairs in our own country during the 18th century, as what would be most interesting to general readers, and of which a well-informed gentleman would not wish to be ignorant. The professor and connoisseur will have recourse to disquisitions much more minute than those of which our limits can be supposed to admit.","sp":89,"ep":106},{"h":"MUSIC","t":"Theory of Harmony.\n\nMinor, of its fifth, and of its octave. In effect, these two kinds of chords are exhibited by nature; but the first more immediately than the second. The first are called perfect chords major, the second perfect chords minor.\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Succession by Fifths, and of the Laws which it observes.\n\nFundamental bas, what.\n\n33. Since the sound C causes the sound G to be heard, and is itself heard in the sound F, which sounds G and F are its two twelfths, we may imagine a modulation composed of that sound C and its two twelfths, or, which is the same thing (art. 22.), of its two fifths, F and G, the one below, the other above; which gives the modulation or series of fifths F, C, G, which we call the fundamental bas of C by fifths.\n\nWe shall find in the sequel (Chap. XVIII.), that there may be some fundamental bases by thirds, deduced from the two seventeenth, of which the one is an attendant of the principal sound, and of which the other includes that sound. But we must advance step by step, and satisfy ourselves at present to consider immediately the fundamental bases by fifths.\n\n34. Thus, from the sound C, one may make a transition indifferently to the sound G, or to the sound F.\n\n35. One may, for the same reason, continue this kind of fifths in ascending, and in descending, from C, in this manner:\n\nE\u266d, B\u266d, F, C, G, D, A, &c.\n\nAnd from this series of fifths one may pass to any sound which immediately precedes or follows it.\n\n36. But it is not allowed in the same manner to pass from one sound to another which is not immediately contiguous to it; for instance, from C to D, or from D to C: for this very simple reason, that the sound D is not contained in the sound C, nor the sound C in that of D; and thus these sounds have not any alliance the one with the other, which may authorize the transition from one to the other.\n\n37. And as these sounds C and D, by the first experiment, naturally bring along with them the perfect chords consisting of greater intervals C, E, G, &c., and D, F\u266f, A, d'; hence may be deduced this rule, That two perfect chords, especially if they are major (T), cannot succeed one another diatonically in a fundamental base; we mean, that in a fundamental base two sounds cannot be diatonically placed in succession, each of which, with its harmonics, forms a perfect chord, especially if this perfect chord be major in both.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of Modes in general.\n\nMode in general, what.\n\n38. A mode, in music, is, the order of sounds prescribed, as well in harmony as melody, by the series of fifths. Thus the three sounds F, C, G, and the harmonies of each of these three sounds, that is to say, their thirds major and their fifths, compose all the major modes which are proper to C.\n\n39. The series of fifths then, or the fundamental bases Modes, F, C, G, of which C holds the middle space, may be represented by regarding as representing the mode of C. One may take the series of fifths, or fundamental bases, fifths, C, G, D, as representing the mode of G; in the same manner B\u266d, F, C, will represent the mode of F.\n\nThus the mode of G, or rather the fundamental base of that mode, has two sounds in common with the fundamental bases of the mode of C. It is the same with the fundamental bases of the mode F.\n\n40. The mode of C (F, C, G) is called the principal mode with respect to the modes of these two fifths, which mode, and are called its two adjuncts.\n\n41. It is then, in some measure, indifferent to see whether a transition be made to the one or to the other of these adjuncts, since each of them has equally modes two sounds in common with the principal mode. Yet the mode of G seems a little more eligible: for G is as their heard among the harmonies of C, and of consequence founds are implied and signified by C; whereas C does not common cause F to be heard, though C is included in the same found F. It is hence that the ear, affected by the mode of C, is a little more predisposed for the mode of G than for that of F. Nothing likewise is more frequent, nor more natural, than to pass from the mode of C to that of G.\n\n42. It is for this reason, as well as to distinguish the two fifths one from the other, that we call G the fifth above the generator the dominant, and the fifth F, below the generator, the subdominant.\n\n43. As in the series of fifths, we may indifferently pass from one sound to that which is contiguous; for, having passed from the mode of C to that of G, one how to be may from thence proceed to the mode of D. And on managed, the other hand, having passed from the mode of C to that of F we may then pass to the mode of B\u266d. But it is necessary, however, to observe, that the ear, which has been immediately affected with the principal mode, feels always a strong propensity to return to it. Thus the further the mode to which we make a transition is removed from the principal mode, the less time we ought to dwell upon it; or rather, to speak in the terms of the art, the less ought the phrase (U) of that mode to be protracted.\n\nCHAP. V. Of the Formation of the Diatonic Scale as used by the Greeks.\n\n44. From this rule, that two sounds which are contiguous may be placed in immediate succession in the series of fifths, F, C, G, it follows, that one may form\n\n(t) We say especially if they are major; for in the major chord D, F\u266f, A, d', besides that the sounds C and D have no common harmonical relation, and are even dissonant between themselves (art. 13.), it will likewise be found, that F\u266f forms a dissonance with C. The minor chord D, F, A, d', would be more tolerable, because the natural F, which occurs in this chord carries along with it its fifth C, or rather the octave of that fifth: It has likewise been sometimes the practice of composers, though rather by a licence indulged them than strictly agreeable to their art, to place a minor in diatonic succession to a major chord.\n\n(u) As the mere English reader, unacquainted with the technical phraseology of music, may be surprised at the\nform this modulation, or this fundamental bals, by fifths,\n\nG, C, G, C, F, C, F.\n\n45. Each of the sounds which forms this modulation brings necessarily along with itself its third major, its fifth, and its octave; inasmuch that he who, for instance, sings the note G, may be reckoned to sing at the same time the notes G, B, 'd', g': in the same manner the sound C in the fundamental bals brings along with it this modulation, C, E, G, C; and, in short, the sound F brings along with it F, A, C, 'f'. This modulation then, or this fundamental bals,\n\nG, C, G, C, F, C, F,\n\ngives the following diatonic series,\n\nB, 'c', d, e, f, g, a';\n\nwhich is precisely the diatonic scale of the Greeks. We are ignorant upon what principles they had formed this scale; but it may be sensibly perceived, that that series arises from the bals G, C, G, C, F, C, F; and that of consequence this bals is justly called fundamental, as being the real primitive modulation, that which conduces the ear, and which it feels to be implied in the diatonic modulation, B, 'c', d, e, f, g, a' (x).\n\n46. We shall be still more convinced of this truth by the following remarks.\n\nthe use of the word phrase when transferred from language to that art, we have though proper to infer the definition of Rousseau.\n\nA phrase, according to him, is in melody a series of modulations, or in harmony a succession of chords, which form without interruption a sense more or less complete, and which terminate in a repose by a cadence more or less perfect.\n\n(x) Nothing is easier than to find in this scale the value or proportions of each sound with relation to the sound C, which we call 1; for the two sounds G and F in the bals are \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\); from whence it follows,\n\n1. That 'c' in the scale is the octave of C in the bals; that is to say, 2.\n2. That 'b' is the third major of G; that is to say \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) (note Q), and of consequence \\(\\frac{9}{8}\\).\n3. That 'd' is the fifth of G; that is to say \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), and of consequence \\(\\frac{15}{8}\\).\n4. That 'e' is the third major of the octave of C, and of consequence the double of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\); that is to say, \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n5. That 'f' is the double octave of F of the bals, and consequently \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n6. That 'g' of the scale is the octave of G of the bals, and consequently 3.\n7. That 'a' in the scale is the third major of 'f' of the scale; that is to say, \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) of \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\), or \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\).\n\nHence then will result the following table, in which each sound has its numerical value above or below it.\n\n| Diatonic Scale | Fundamental Bals |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| B, c, d, e, f, g, a' | G, C, G, C, F, C, F |\n\nAnd if, for the convenience of calculation, we choose to call the sound C of the scale 1; in this case we have only to divide each of the numbers by 2, which represent the diatonic scale, and we shall have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{3}{4} & \\frac{9}{8} & \\frac{15}{8} & \\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{9}{4} \\\\\nB, c, d, e, f, g, a'\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n(y) In order to compare 'd' with 'f', we need only compare \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) with \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\); the relation between these fractions will be, (note c) that of 9 times 3 to 8 times 4; that is to say, of 27 to 32: the third minor, then, from 'd' to 'f', is not true; because the proportion of 27 to 32 is not the same with that of 5 to 6, these two proportions being between themselves as 27 times 6 is to 32 times 5, that is to say, as 162 to 160, or as the halves of these two numbers, that is to say, as 81 to 80.\n\nM. Rameau, when he published, in 1726, his New theoretical and practical System of Music, had not as yet found the true reason of the alteration in the consonance which is between 'd' and 'f', and of the little attention which the ear pays to it. For he pretends, in the work now quoted, that there are two thirds minor, one in the proportion of 5 to 6, the other in the proportion of 27 to 32. But the opinion which he has afterwards adopted, seems much preferable. In reality, the genuine third minor, is that which is produced by nature between 'e' and 'g', in the continued tone of those honourable bodies of which 'e' and 'g' are the two harmonics; and that third minor, which is in the proportion of 5 to 6, is likewise that which takes place in the minor mode, and not that third minor which is false and different, being in the proportion of 27 to 32.\nIn reality, in order that the sound 'b' may succeed immediately in the scale to the found 'a', it is necessary that the note 'g', which is the only one from whence 'b' as a harmonic may be deduced, should immediately succeed to the found 'f', in the fundamental baf, which is the only one from whence 'a' can be harmonically deduced. Now, the diatonic succession from F to G cannot be admitted in the fundamental baf, according to what we have remarked (art. 36.). The founds 'a' and 'b', then, cannot immediately succeed one another in the scale: we shall see in the sequel why this is not the case in the series 'c, d, e, f, g, a, b', c, which begins upon C; whereas the scale in question here begins upon B.\n\n49. The Greeks likewise, to form an entire octave, added below the first B the note A, which they distinguished and separated from the rest of the scale, which for that reason they called proflambanomenes, that is to say, a string or note subadded to the scale, and put before B to form the entire octave.\n\n50. The diatonic scale B, 'c, d, e, f, g, a', is composed of two tetrachords, that is to say, of two diatonic scales, each consisting of four founds, B, 'c, d, e, f', g, a'. These two tetrachords are exactly similar; for from 'c' to 'd' there is the same interval as from B to 'c'; from 'd' to 'g' the same as from 'c' to 'd'; from 'g' to 'a' the same as from 'd' to 'e' (z): this is the reason why the Greeks distinguished these two tetrachords; yet they joined them by the note 'a' which is common to both, and which gave them the name of conjunctive tetrachords.\n\n51. Moreover, the intervals between any two founds, taken in each tetrachord in particular, are precisely true: thus, in the first tetrachord, the intervals of C 'e', and B 'd', are thirds, the one major and the other minor, exactly true, as well as the fourth B 'e' (AA); it is the same thing with the tetrachord 'e, f, g, a', since this tetrachord is exactly like the former.\n\n52. But the case is not the same when we compare two founds taken each from a different tetrachord; for we have already seen, that the note 'd' in the first tetrachord forms with the note 'f' in the second a third minor, which is not true. In like manner it will be found, that the fifth from 'd' to 'a' is not exactly true, which is evident; for the third major from 'f' to 'a' is true, and the third minor from 'd' to 'f' is not so: now, in order to form a true fifth, a third major and a third minor, which are both exactly true, are necessary.\n\n53. From thence it follows, that every consonance another is absolutely perfect in each tetrachord taken by itself; but that there is some alteration in passing from one tetrachord to the other. This is a new re-scale into four, for distinguishing the scale into these two tetra-chords.\n\n54. It may be ascertained by calculation, that in the The source tetrachord B, 'c, d, e', the interval, or the tone from 'c' to 'e', is a little less than the interval or tone from 'c' to 'd' (BB). In the same manner, in the second tetrachord figured, 'e, f, g, a', which is, as we have proved, perfectly similar to the first, the note from 'g' to 'a' is a little less than the note from 'f' to 'g'. It is for this reason that they distinguished two kinds of tones; the greater tone *, as Greater tone. * See from 'c' to 'd', from 'f' to 'g', &c.; and the lesser tone. Lesser tone. \u2020 See Inter- from 'd' to 'e', from 'g' to 'a', &c.\n\nCHAP. VI. The formation of the Diatonic Scale among the Moderns, or the ordinary Gammut.\n\n55. We have just shown in the preceding chapter, how the scale of the Greeks is formed, B, 'c, d, e, g, a', how formed only, F, C, G; but to form the scale 'c, d, e, f, g, a, b', c, which we use at present, we must necessarily add to the fundamental baf the note D, and form, with these four founds F, C, G, D, the following fundamental baf:\n\nC, G, C, F, C, G, D, G, C;\n\nfrom whence we deduce the modulation or scale\n\nSee fig. 5.\n\n'c, d, e, f, g, a, b', c.\n\nIn effect (cc), 'c' in the scale belongs to the harmony. Of C which corresponds with it in the baf; 'd', which is the second note in the gammut, is included in the harmony of G, the second note of the baf; 'e', the third note of the gammut, is a natural harmonic of C, which is the third found in the baf, &c.\n\n56. From\n\n(z) The proportion of B to 'c' is as 14 to 1, that is to say as 15 to 16; that between 'e' and 'f' is as 4 to 5, that is to say (note Q), as 5 times 3 to 4 times 4, or as 15 to 16; these two proportions are equal. In the same manner, the proportion of 'c' to 'd' is as 1 to 8, or as 8 to 9; that between 'f' and 'g' is as 4 to 5; that is to say (note Q), as 8 to 9. The proportion of 'e' to 'c' is as 4 to 5, or as 5 to 4; that between 'f' and 'a' is as 4 to 5, or as 5 to 4; the proportions here then are likewise equal.\n\n(AA) The proportion of 'e' to 'c' is as 4 to 5, or as 5 to 4, which is a true third major; that from 'd' to 'b' is as 5 to 4; that is to say, as 9 times 16 to 15 times 8, or as 9 times 2 to 15; or as 6 to 5. In like manner we shall find, that the proportion of 'c' to 'b' is as 4 to 5; that is to say, as 5 times 16 to 15 times 4, or as 4 to 3, which is a true fourth.\n\n(BB) The proportion of 'd' to 'c' is as 8 to 9, or as 9 to 8; that of 'e' to 'd' is as 4 to 5, that is to say, as 40 to 36, or as 10 to 9; now 9 is less removed from unity than 8; the interval then from 'd' to 'c' is a little less than that from 'c' to 'd'.\n\nIf any one would wish to know the proportion which 9 bear to 8, he will find (note Q) that it is as 8 times 10 to 9 times 9, that is to say, as 80 to 81. Thus the proportion of a lesser to a greater tone is as 80 to 81; this difference between the greater and lesser tone is what the Greeks called a comma.\n\nWe may remark, that this difference of a comma is found between the third minor when true and harmonical, and the same chord when it suffers alteration 'd', 'f', of which we have taken notice in the scale (note X); for we have seen, that this third minor thus altered is in the proportion of 80 to 81 with the true third minor.\n\n(cc) The values or estimates of the notes shall be the same in this as in the former scale, excepting only the tone\n56. Hence it follows, that the diatonic scale of the Greeks is, at least in some respects, more simple than ours; since the scale of the Greeks (chap. v.) may be formed alone from the mode proper to C; whereas ours is originally and primitively formed, not only from the mode of (F, C, G), but likewise from the mode of G, (C, G, D).\n\nIt will likewise appear, that this last scale consists of two parts; of which the one, 'c, d, e, f, g,' is in the mode of C; and the other, 'g, a, b, c,' in that of G.\n\n57. For this reason the note 'g' is twice repeated in the diatonic scale from its harmonic relations to the fundamental basis.\n\nThe modern scale, composed of two disjunctive tetrachords of different modes.\n\nThe mode of G introduced in the fundamental basis productive of conveniences.\n\n58. The scale of the moderns, then, may be considered as consisting of two tetrachords, disjunctive indeed, but perfectly similar one to the other, 'c, d, e, f,' and 'g, a, b, c,' one in the mode of C, the other in that of G. We shall see in the sequel, by what artifice one may cause the scale 'c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c,' to be regarded as belonging to the mode of C alone. For this purpose it is necessary to make some changes in the fundamental basis, which we have already assigned; but this shall be explained at large in chap. xiii.\n\n59. The introduction of the mode proper to G in the fundamental basis has this happy effect, that the notes 'f, g, a, b,' may immediately succeed each other in ascending the scale, which cannot take place (art. 48.) in the diatonic series of the Greeks, because that series is formed from the mode of C alone. Whence it follows:\n\ntone 'a'; for 'd' being represented by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), its fifth will be expressed by \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\); so that the scale will be numerically figured thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n1 & \\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{4}{5} & \\frac{5}{8} & \\frac{6}{5} \\\\\nc, d, e, f, g, a, b, c,\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWhere you may see, that the note 'a' of this scale is different from that in the scale of the Greeks; and that the 'a' in the modern series stands in proportion to that of the Greeks as \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) to \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\), that is to say, as 81 to 80; these two 'a's then likewise differ by a comma.\n\n(DD) In the scale of the Greeks, the note 'a' being a third from 'f', there is an altered fifth between 'a' and 'd'; but in ours, 'a' being a fifth to 'd', produces two altered thirds, 'f'a' and 'a'c'; and likewise a fifth altered, 'a'e', as we shall see in the following chapter. Thus there are in our scale two intervals more than in the scale of the Greeks which suffer alteration.\n\n(EE) But here it may be with some colour objected: The scale of the Greeks, it may be said, has a fundamental basis more simple than ours; and besides, in it there are fewer chords which will not be found exactly true; why then, notwithstanding this, does ours appear more easy to be sung than that of the Greeks? The Grecian scale begins with a semitone, whereas the intonation prompted by nature seems to impel us to rise by a full tone at once. This objection may be thus answered. The scale of the Greeks is indeed better disposed than ours for the simplicity of the basis, but the arrangement of ours is more suitable to natural intonation. Our scale commences by the fundamental sound c, and it is in reality from that sound that we ought to begin; it is from this that all the others naturally arise, and upon this they depend; nay, if we may speak so, in this they are included: on the contrary, neither the scale of the Greeks, nor its fundamental basis, commences with C; but it is from this C that we depart, in order to regulate our intonation, whether in rising or descending; now, in ascending from 'c', the intonation, even of the Greek scale, gives the series 'c, d, e, f, g, a'; and to be sure it is that the fundamental sound C is here the genuine guide of the ear, that if, before we modulate the sound 'c', we should...\nPart I.\n\nTheory of that it must be different according as the note 'a' has Harmony. 'f' or 'd' for its base. See the note (cc).\n\nCHAP. VII. Of Temperament.\n\n64. The alterations which we have observed in the intervals between particular sounds of the diatonic scale, naturally lead us to speak of temperament. To give a clear idea of this, and to render the necessity of it palpable, let us suppose that we have before us an instrument with keys, a harpsichord, for instance, consisting of several octaves or scales, of which each includes its twelve semitones.\n\nLet us choose in that harpsichord one of the strings which will found the note C, and let us tune the string G to a perfect fifth with C in ascending; let us afterwards tune to a perfect fifth with this G the d' which is above it; we shall evidently perceive that this d' will be in the scale above that from which we set out: but it is also evident that this d' must have in the scale a D which corresponds with it, and which must be tuned a true octave below d'; and between d' and G there should be the interval of a fifth; so that the D in the Theory of first scale will be a true fourth below the G of the same scale. We may afterwards tune the note A of the first scale to a just fifth with this last D; then the note e' in the highest scale to a true fifth with this new A, and of consequence the E in the first scale to a true fourth beneath this same A: Having finished this operation, it will be found that the last E, thus tuned, will by no means form a just third major from the found C (ff): that is to say, that it is impossible for E to constitute at the same time the third major of C and the true fifth of A; or, what is the same thing, the true fourth of A in descending.\n\n65. If, after having successively and alternately tuned the strings C, G, d', A, E, in perfect fifths and fourths one from the other, we continue to tune successively by true fifths and fourths the strings E, B, F, C, G, d', e', E, B; we shall find, that though B, being a semitone higher than the natural note, should be equivalent to c' natural, it will by no means form a just octave to the first C in the scale, but be considerably higher (gc); yet this B upon the harpsichord ought not\n\nshould attempt to rise to it by that note in the scale which is most immediately contiguous, we cannot reach it but by the note B, and by the semitone from B to c'. Now to make a transition from B to c', by this semitone, the ear must of necessity be predisposed for that modulation, and consequently preoccupied with the mode of C: if this were not the case, we should naturally rise from B to c', and by this operation pass into another mode.\n\n(ff) The A considered as the fifth of D is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), and the fourth beneath this A will constitute \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\) of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), that is to say, \\( \\frac{8}{5} \\); \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) then shall be the value of E, considered as a true fourth from A in descending: now E, considered as the third major of the found C, is \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), or \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\); these two E's then are between themselves in the proportion of 81 to 80; thus it is impossible that E should be at the same time a perfect third major from C, and a true fourth beneath A.\n\n(gc) In effect, if you thus alternately tune the fifth above, and the fourth below, in the same octave, you may here see what will be the process of your operation.\n\nC, G, a fifth; A a fourth; A a fifth; E a fourth; F a fourth; C a fifth; G a fourth; d' a fifth; A a fourth; e' or f' a fifth; B a fourth: now it will be found, by a very easy computation, that the first C being represented by 1, D \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\), A \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), E \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\), &c. and so of the rest, till you arrive at B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), which will be found \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\). This fraction is evidently greater than the number 2, which expresses the perfect octave c to its correspondent C; and the octave below B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) would be one half of the same fraction, that is to say \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\), which is evidently greater than C represented by unity. This last fraction \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\) is composed of two numbers; the numerator of the fraction is nothing else but the number 3 multiplied 11 times in succession by itself, and the denominator is the number 2 multiplied 18 times in succession by itself. Now it is evident, that this fraction, which expresses the value of B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), is not equal to the unity which expresses the value of the found C, though, upon the harpsichord, B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) and C are identical. This fraction rises above unity by \\( \\frac{12}{11} - 1 = \\frac{1}{11} \\), that is to say, by about \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\); and this difference was called the comma of Pythagoras. It is palpable that this comma is much more considerable than that which we have already mentioned (note bb), and which is only \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nWe have already proved that the series of fifths produces a c' different from B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), the series of thirds major gives another still more different. For, let us suppose this series of thirds, C, E, G\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), we shall have E equal to \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), G\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) to \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), and B to \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), whose octave below is \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\); from whence it appears, that this last B is less than unity (that is to say than C), by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), or by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), or near it: A new comma, much greater than the preceding, and which the Greeks have called apotome major.\n\nIt may be observed, that this B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), deduced from the series of thirds, is to the B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) deduced from the series of fifths, as \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) is to \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\); that is to say, in multiplying by \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\), as 125 multiplied by 4096 is to 331441, or as 51200 to 331441, that is to say, nearly as 26 is to 27: from whence it may be seen, that these two B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) are very considerably different one from the other, and even sufficiently different to make the ear sensible of it; because the difference consists almost of a minor semitone, whose value, as will afterwards be seen (art. 139.), is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nMoreover, if, after having found the G\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) equal to \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), we then tune by fifths and by fourths, G\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), d' \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), A\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), C\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\), as we have done with respect to the first series of fifths, we find that the B\\( \\frac{12}{11} \\) must be \\( \\frac{12}{11} \\times \\frac{12}{11} \\); its difference, then, from unity, or, in other words, from C, is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), that is to say, about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\); a comma still less than any of the preceding, and which the Greeks have called apotome minor;\nnot to be different from the octave above C; for every B\u266d and every c' is the same found, since the octave or the scale only consists of twelve semitones.\n\n66. From thence it necessarily follows, 1. That it is impossible that all the octaves and all the fifths should be just at the same time, particularly in instruments which have keys, where no intervals less than a semitone are admitted. 2. That, of consequence, if the fifths are justly tuned, some alteration must be made in the octaves; now the sympathy or sound which subsists between any note and its octave, does not permit us to make such an alteration: this perfect coalescence of sound is the cause why the octave should serve as limits to the other intervals, and that all the notes which rise above or fall below the ordinary scale, are no more than replications, i.e., repetitions, of all that have gone before them. For this reason, if the octave were altered, there could be no longer any fixed point either in harmony or melody. It is then absolutely necessary to tune the c' or B\u266d in a just octave with the first; from whence it follows, that, in the progression of fifths, or what is the same thing, in the alternate series of fifths and fourths, C, G, D, A, E, B, F\u266f, C\u266f, G\u266f, d\u266f, A\u266f, e\u266f, B\u266f, it is necessary that all the fifths should be altered, or at least some of them. Now, since there is no reason why one should rather be altered than another, it follows, that we ought to alter them all equally. By these means, as the alteration is made to influence all the fifths, it will be in each of them almost imperceptible; and thus the fifth, which, after the octave, is the most perfect of all consonances, and which we are under the necessity of altering, must only be altered in the least degree possible.\n\n67. It is true, that the thirds will be a little harsh; but as the interval of sounds which constitutes the third, produces a less perfect coalescence than that of the fifth, it is necessary, says M. Rameau, to sacrifice the justice of that chord to the perfection of the fifth; for the more perfect a chord is in its own nature, the more displeasing to the ear is any alteration which can be made in it. In the octave the least alteration is insupportable.\n\n68. This change in the intervals of instruments which have, or even which have not, keys, is that which we call temperament.\n\n69. It results then from all that we have now said, that the theory of temperament may be reduced to this question.\u2014The alternate succession of fifths and fourths having been given, (art. 66.), in which B\u266d or C is not the true octave of the first C; it is proposed to alter all the fifths equally, in such a manner that the two C's may be in a perfect octave the one to the other.\n\n70. For a solution of this question, we must begin by tuning the two C's in a perfect octave the one to the other; in consequence of which, we will render all the semitones which compose the octave as equal as possible. By this means (HH) the alteration made in each\n\nIn a word, if, after having found E equal to \u00a7 in the progression of thirds, we then tune by fifths and fourths E, B, F\u266f, C\u266f, &c. we shall arrive at a new B\u266d, which shall be \u00a7, and which will not differ from unity but by about \u00a7, which is the last and smallest of all the commas; but it must be observed, that, in this case, the thirds major from E to G\u266f, from G\u266f to B\u266d or C, &c. are extremely false, and greatly altered.\n\n(HH) All the semitones being equal in the temperament proposed by M. Rameau, it follows, that the twelve semitones C, C\u266f, D, D\u266f, E, E\u266f, &c. form a continued geometrical progression; that is to say, a series in which C shall be to C\u266f in the same proportion as C\u266f to D, as D to D\u266f, &c. and so of the rest.\n\nThese twelve semitones are formed by a series of thirteen sounds, of which C and its octave c' are the first and last. Thus to find by computation the value of each sound in the temperament, which is the present object of our speculations, our scrutiny is limited to the investigation of eleven other numbers between 1 and 2 which may form with the 1 and the 2 a continued geometrical progression.\n\nHowever little any one is practised in calculation, he will easily find each of these numbers, or at least a number approaching to its value. These are the characters by which they may be expressed, which mathematicians will easily understand, and which others may neglect.\n\n| C | C\u266f | D | D\u266f | E | F | F\u266f | G | G\u266f |\n|---|----|---|----|---|---|----|---|----|\n| 1 | \u221a2 | \u221a3 | \u221a4 | \u221a5 | \u221a6 | \u221a7 | \u221a8 | \u221a9 |\n\nIt is obvious, that in this temperament all the fifths are equally altered. One may likewise prove, that the alteration of each in particular is very inconsiderable; for it will be found, for instance, that the fifth from C to G, which should be \u00a7, ought to be diminished by about \u00a7 of \u00a7; that is to say, by \u00a7, a quantity almost inconceivably small.\n\nIt is true, that the thirds major will be a little more altered; for the third major from C to E, for instance, shall be increased in its interval by about \u00a7; but it is better, according to M. Rameau, that the alteration should fall upon the third than upon the fifth, which after the octave is the most perfect chord, and from the perfection of which we ought never to degenerate but as little as possible.\n\nBesides, it has appeared from the series of thirds major C, E, G\u266f, B\u266d, that this last B\u266d is very different from c' (note GG); from whence it follows, that if we would tune this B\u266d in unison with the octave of C, and alter at the same time each of the thirds major by a degree as small as possible, they must all be equally altered. This is what occurred in the temperament which we propose; and if in it the third be more altered than the fifth, it is a consequence of the difference which we find between the degrees of perfection in these intervals; a difference with which, if we may speak so, the temperament proposed conforms itself. Thus this diversity of alteration is rather advantageous than inconvenient.\nTheory of each fifth will be very considerable, but equal in all of them.\n\n71. In this, then, the theory of temperament consists; but as it would be difficult in practice to tune a harpsichord or organ by thus considering all the semitones equal, M. Rameau, in his *Generation Harmonique*, has furnished us with the following method, to alter all the fifths as equally as possible.\n\n72. Take any key of the harpsichord which you please; but let it be towards the middle of the instrument; for instance, C; then tune the note G a fifth above it, at first with as much accuracy as possible; this you may imperceptibly diminish: tune afterwards the fifth to this with equal accuracy, and diminish it in the same manner; and thus proceed from one fifth to another in ascent; and as the ear does not appreciate so exactly sounds that are extremely sharp, it is necessary, when by fifths you have risen to notes extremely high, that you should tune in the most perfect manner the octave below the last fifth which you had immediately formed; then you may continue always in the same manner; till in this process you arrive at the last fifth from E to B, which should of themselves be in tune; that is to say, they ought to be in such a state, that B, the highest note of the two which compose the fifth, may be identical with the found C, with which you began, or at least the octave of that found perfectly just: it will be necessary then to try if this C, or its octave, forms a just fifth with the last found E or F, which has been already tuned. If this be the case, we may be certain that the harpsichord is properly tuned. But if this last fifth be not true, in this case it will be too sharp, and it is an indication that the other fifths have been too much diminished, or at least some of them; or it will be too flat, and consequently discover that they have not been sufficiently diminished. We must then begin and proceed as formerly, till we find the last fifth in tune of itself, and without our immediate intervention (11).\n\n(11) We have only to acknowledge, with M. Rameau, that this temperament is far remote from that which is now in practice: it may here be seen in what this last temperament consists as applied to the organ or harpsichord. They begin with C in the middle of the keys, and they flatten the four first fifths G, D, A, E, till they form a true third major from E to C; afterwards, setting out from this E, they tune the fifths B, F, C, G, but flattening them still less than the former, so that G may almost form a true third major with E. When they have arrived at G, they stop; they resume the first C, and tune to it the fifth F in descending, then the fifth B, &c., and they heighten a little all the fifths till they have arrived at A, which ought to be the same with the G already tuned.\n\nIf, in the temperament commonly practised, some thirds are found to be less altered than in that prescribed by M. Rameau, in return, the fifths in the first temperament are much more false, and many thirds are likewise so; insomuch, that upon a harpsichord tuned according to the temperament in common use, there are five or six modes which the ear cannot endure, and in which it is impossible to execute anything. On the contrary, in the temperament suggested by M. Rameau, all the modes are equally perfect; which is a new argument in its favour, since the temperament is peculiarly necessary in passing from one mode to another, without shocking the ear; for instance, from the mode of C to that of G, from the mode of G to that of D, &c. It is true, that this uniformity of modulation will to the greatest number of musicians appear a defect: for they imagine, that, by tuning the semitones of the scale unequal, they give each of the modes a peculiar character; so that, according to them, the scale of C,\n\nC, D, E, F, G, A, B, C,\n\nis not perfectly similar to the gammut or diatonic scale of the mode of E,\n\nE, F, G, A, B, c, d, e,\n\nwhich, in their judgement, renders the modes of C and E proper for different manners of expression. But after all that we have said in this treatise on the formation of diatonic intervals, every one should be convinced, that, according to the intention of nature, the diatonic scale ought to be perfectly the same in all its modes: The contrary opinion, says M. Rameau, is a mere prejudice of musicians. The character of an air arises chiefly from the intermixture of the modes; from the greater or lesser degrees of vivacity in the movement; from the tones, more or less grave, or more or less acute, which are assigned to the generator of the mode; and from the chords more or less beautiful, as they are more or less deep, more or less flat, more or less sharp, which are found in it.\n\nIn short, the last advantage of this temperament is, that it will be found conformed with, or at least very little different from that which is practised upon instruments without keys; as the bass-viol, the violin, in which true fifths and fourths are preferred to thirds and sixths tuned with equal accuracy; a temperament which appears incompatible with that commonly used in tuning the harpsichord.\n\nYet M. Rameau, in his *New System of Music*, printed in 1726, adopted the ordinary temperament. In that work, (as may be seen chap. xxiv.), he pretends that the alteration of the fifths is much more supportable than that of the thirds major; and that this last interval can hardly suffer a greater alteration than the octave, which, as we know, cannot suffer the slightest alteration. He says, that if three strings are tuned, one by an octave, the other by a fifth, and the next by a third major to a fourth string, and if a sound be produced from the last, the strings tuned by a fifth will vibrate, though a little less true than it ought to have been; but that the octave and the third major, if altered in the least degree, will not vibrate: and he adds, that the temperament which is now practised, is founded upon that principle. M. Rameau goes still farther; and as, in the ordinary temperament,\nBy this method all the twelve sounds which compose one of the scales shall be tuned: nothing is necessary but to tune with the greatest possible exactness their octaves in the other scales, and the harpsichord shall be well tuned.\n\nWe have given this rule for temperament from M. Rameau; and it belongs only to disinterested artists to judge of it. However this question be determined, and whatever kind of temperament may be received, the alteration which it produces in harmony will be but very small, or not perceptible to the ear, whose attention is entirely engrossed in attuning itself with the fundamental bass, and which suffers, without uneasiness, these alterations, or rather takes no notice of them, because it supplies from itself what may be wanting to the truth and perfection of the intervals.\n\nSimple and daily experiments confirm what we now advance. Listen to a voice which is accompanied, in singing, by different instruments; though the temperament of the voice, and the temperament of each of the instruments, are all different one from another, yet you will not be in the least affected with the kind of cacophony which ought to result from these diversities, because the ear supposes these intervals true, of which it does not appreciate differences.\n\nWe may give another experiment. Let the three keys E, G, B be struck upon an organ, and the minor perfect chord only will be heard; though E, by the construction of that instrument, must cause G likewise to be heard; though G should have the same effect upon D, and B upon F; insomuch that the ear is at once affected with all these sounds, D, E, F, G, G, B: how many dissonances perceived at the same time, and what a jarring multitude of discordant sensations, would result from thence to the ear, if the perfect chord with which it is preoccupied had not power entirely to abstract its attention from such sounds as might offend!\n\nIn what is different from what we name cadence in harmony.\nIn the first case, this word only signifies an agreeable and rapid alteration between two contiguous sounds, called likewise a trill or shake; in the second, it signifies a repose or clofe. It is however true, that this shake implies, or at least frequently enough prefaces, a repose, either present or impending, in the fundamental base (ll.).\n\n76. Since there is a repose in passing from one sound to another in the fundamental base, there is also a repose in passing from one note to another in the diatonic scale, which is formed from it, and which this base represents; and as the absolute repose G C is of all others the most perfect in the fundamental base, the repose from B to c', which answers to it in the scale, and which is likewise terminated by the generator, is for that reason the most perfect of all others in the diatonic scale ascending.\n\n77. It is then a law dictated by nature itself that if you would ascend diatonically to the generator of a mode, you can only do this by means of the third major from the fifth of that very generator. This third major, which with the generator forms a semitone, has for that reason been called the sensible note or leading note, as introducing the generator, and preparing us for the most perfect repose.\n\nWe have already proved, that the fundamental base is the principle of melody. We shall besides make it appear in the sequel, that the effect of a repose in melody arises solely from the fundamental base.\n\n**CHAP. IX. Of the Minor Mode and its Diatonic Series.**\n\n78. In the second chapter, we have explained (art. 20., 30., 31., and 32.) by what means, and upon what principle, the minor chord C, Eb, G, 'c', may be formed, which is the characteristic chord of the minor mode. Now what we have there said, taking C for the principal and fundamental sound, we might likewise have said of any other note in the scale, assumed in the same manner as the principal and fundamental sound: but as in the minor chord, C, Eb, G, 'c', there occurs an Eb which is not found in the ordinary diatonic scale, we shall immediately substitute, for greater ease and convenience, another chord, which is likewise minor and exactly similar to the former, of which all the notes are found in the scale.\n\n79. The scale affords us three chords of this kind, viz. D, F, A, 'd'; A, 'c', e, a'; and E, G, B, 'e'. Among these three we shall choose A, 'c', e, a'; because this chord, without including any sharp or flat, has two sounds in common with the major chord C, E, G, 'c'; and besides, one of these two sounds is the very same 'c': so that this chord appears to have the most immediate, and at the same time the most simple, relation with the chord C, E, G, 'c'. Concerning this we need only add, that this preference of the chord A, 'c', e, a', to every other minor chord, is by no means in itself necessary for what we have to say in this chapter upon the diatonic scale of the minor mode. We might in the same manner have chosen any other minor chord; and it is only, as we have said, for greater ease and convenience that we fix upon this.\n\n80. In every mode, whether major or minor, the principal sound which implies the perfect chord, whether major or minor, is called the tonic note or key; thus what C is the key in its proper mode, A in the mode of A, See Principal &c. Having laid down this principle,\n\n81. We have shown how the three sounds, F, C, G, which constitute (art. 58.) the mode of C, of which the first, F, and the last, G, are the two fifths of C, one scale purifying, the other rising, produce the scale, B, 'c', d, f, e, f, g, a', of the major mode, by means of the fundamental base G, C, G, C, F, C, F; let us in the same manner take the three sounds D, A, E, which constitute the mode of A, for the same reason that the sounds F, C, G, constitute the mode of C; and of them let us form this fundamental base, perfectly like the preceding E, A, F, A, D, A, D; let us afterwards place See fig. 7, below each of these sounds one of their harmonics, as we have done (chap. v.), for the first scale of the major mode; with this difference, that we must suppose D and A as implying their thirds minor in the fundamental base to characterize the minor mode; and we shall have the diatonic scale of that mode,\n\nG, A, B, 'c', d, e, f'.\n\n82. The G, which corresponds with E in the fundamental base, forms a third major with that E, though the mode be minor; for the same reason that a third from the fifth of the fundamental sound ought to be major (art. 77.) when that third rises to the fundamental sound A.\n\n83. It is true, that, in causing E to imply its third See Imply minor G, one might also rise to A, by a diatonic progression. But that manner of rising to A would be less perfect than the preceding; for this reason (art. 76.), that the absolute repose or perfect cadence E, A, in the fundamental base, ought to be represented in the most perfect manner in the two notes of the diatonic scale which answer to it, especially when one of these two notes is A, the key itself upon which the repose is made. From whence it follows, that the preceding note G ought rather to be sharp than natural; because G, being included in E (art. 19.), much more perfectly represents the note E in the base, than the natural G could do, which is not included in E.\n\n84. We may remark this first difference between Diversities in the scales of the major and minor mode.\n\nG, A, B, 'c', d, e, f',\nand the scale which corresponds with it in the major mode\n\nB, 'c', d, e, f, g, a',\nthat from 'e' to 'f', which are the two last notes of the former scale, there is only a semitone; whereas from 'g' to 'a', which are the two last sounds of the latter series, there is the interval of a complete tone; but this is not the only discrimination which may be found between the scales of the two modes.\n\n---\n\n(ll) M. Rousseau, in his letter on French music, has called this alternate undulation of different sounds a trill, from the Italian word trillo, which signifies the same thing; and some French musicians already appear to have adopted this expression.\n85. To investigate these differences, and to discover the reason for which they happen, we shall begin by forming a new diatonic scale of the minor mode, similar to the second scale of the major mode,\n\n\\[ c, d, e, f, g, g, a, b', c. \\]\n\nThat last series, as we have seen, was formed by means of the fundamental bas \\( F, C, G, D, G, C \\), disposed in this manner,\n\n\\[ C, G, C, F, C, G, D, G, C. \\]\n\nLet us take in the same manner the fundamental bas \\( D, A, E, B \\), and arrange it in the following order,\n\n\\[ A, E, A, D, A, E, B, E, A, \\]\n\nand it will produce the scale immediately subjoined,\n\n\\[ A, B, c', d, e, f, g, g, a, \\]\n\nin which \\( c' \\) forms a third minor with \\( A \\), which in the fundamental bas corresponds with it, which designates the minor mode; and, on the contrary, \\( g \\) forms a third major with \\( E \\) in the fundamental bas, because \\( g \\) rises towards \\( a \\) (art. 82, 83.)\n\n86. We see besides an \\( f \\), which does not occur in the former,\n\n\\[ G, A, B, c', d, e, f, \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is natural. It is because, in the first scale, \\( f \\) is a third minor from \\( D \\) in the bas; and in the second, \\( f \\) is the fifth from \\( B \\) in the bas (NN).\n\n87. Thus the two scales of the minor mode are still in this respect more different one from the other than the two scales of the major mode; for we do not remark this difference of a semitone between the two scales of the major mode. We have only observed (art. 63.) some difference in the value of \\( A \\) as it stands in each of these scales, but this amounts to much less than a semitone.\n\n88. From thence it may be seen why \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are sharp in the sharp when ascending in the minor mode; besides the minor mode, and why.\n\nThe case different in the fifth of the generator, ought not to imply the third descending, major \\( g \\); but in the case when that \\( E \\) descends to the generator \\( A \\) to form a perfect repose (art. 77. and 83.) and in this case the third major \\( g \\) rises to the generator \\( a \\); but the fundamental bas \\( AE \\) may, in descending, give the scale \\( a, g \\); natural, provided \\( g \\) does not rise again to \\( a \\).\n\n92. It is much more difficult to explain how the \\( f \\) which ought to follow this \\( g \\) in descending, is natural and not sharp; for the fundamental bas\n\n\\[ A, E, B, E, A, D, A, E, A, \\]\n\nproduces in descending,\n\n\\[ a, g, f, e, d, c', B, A. \\]\n\nAnd it is plain that the \\( f \\) cannot be otherwise than\n\n---\n\n(MM) Besides, without appealing to the proof of the fundamental bas, \\( f \\) obviously presents itself as the sixth note of this scale; because the seventh note being necessarily \\( g \\) (art. 77.) if the sixth were not \\( f \\), but \\( f' \\), there would be an interval of three semitones between the sixth and the seventh, consequently the scale would not be diatonic, (art. 8.)\n\n(NN) When \\( g \\) is said to be natural in descending the diatonic scale of the minor mode of \\( A \\), it is only meant that this \\( g \\) is not necessarily sharp in descending as it is in rising; for it may be sharp, as may be proved by numerical examples, of which all musical compositions are full. It is true, that when \\( g \\) is found sharp in descending to the minor mode of \\( A \\), we are not sure that the mode is minor till the \\( f \\) or \\( c' \\) natural is found; both of which imparts a peculiar character on the minor mode, viz. \\( c' \\) natural, in rising and in descending, and the \\( f \\) natural in descending.\n\n---\n\nChap. X. Of Relative Modes.\n\n91. Two modes of such a nature that we can pass from the one to the other, are called relative modes. Modes relative to the major mode of \\( C \\) is relative to the major mode of \\( F \\) and to that of \\( G \\). It has also been seen, what how many intimate connexions there are between the major mode of \\( C \\), and the minor mode of \\( A \\). For,\n\n1. The perfect chords, one major, \\( C, E, G, c' \\), the other minor, \\( A, c', e, a' \\), which characterize each of those two kinds of modulation * or harmony, have two sounds in common, \\( c' \\) and \\( e' \\).\n\n2. The scale of the minor mode of \\( A \\) in descent, absolutely contains the same sounds with the scale of the major mode of \\( C \\).\n\nHence the transition is so natural and easy from the major mode of \\( C \\) to the minor mode of \\( A \\), or from the minor mode of \\( A \\) to the major mode of \\( C \\), as experience proves.\n\n92. In the minor mode of \\( E \\), the minor perfect chord \\( E, G, B, c' \\), which characterizes it, has likewise two sounds, \\( E, G \\), in common with the perfect chord major \\( C, E, G, c' \\), which characterizes the major mode of \\( C \\).\nTheory of Harmony. But the minor mode of E is not so closely related nor allied to the major mode of C as the minor mode of A; because the diatonic scale of the minor mode of E in descent, has not, like the series of the minor mode of A, all their sounds in common with the scale of C. In reality, this scale is e, d, c', B, A, G, F, E, where there occurs an f' (sharp which is not in the scale of C. Though the minor mode of E is thus less relative to the major mode of C than that of A; yet the artist does not hesitate sometimes to pass immediately from the one to the other.\n\nWhen we pass from one mode to another by the interval of a third, whether in descending or rising, as from C to A, or from A to C, from C to E, or from E to C, the major mode becomes minor, or the minor mode becomes major.\n\n93. There is still another minor mode, into which an immediate transition may be made in issuing from the major mode of C. It is the minor mode of C itself in which the perfect minor chord C, Eb, G, c', has two sounds, C and G, in common with the perfect major chord C, E, G, c'. Nor is there anything more common than a transition from the major mode of C to the minor mode, or from the minor to the major (oo).\n\nCHAP. XI. Of Dissonance.\n\n94. We have already observed, that the mode of C (F, C, G,) has two sounds in common with the mode of G (C, G, D); and two sounds in common with the mode of F (Bb, F, C); of consequence, this procedure of the bass C G may belong to the mode of C, or to the mode of G, as the procedure of the bass F C, or C F, may belong to the mode of C or the mode of F. When one therefore passes from C to F or to G in a fundamental bass, he is still ignorant what mode he is in. It would be, however, advantageous to know it, and to be able by some means to distinguish the generator from its fifths.\n\n95. This advantage may be obtained by uniting at the same time the sounds G and F in the same harmony, that is to say, by joining to the harmony G, B, d' of the fifth G, the other fifth F in this manner, G, B, d', f'; this f' which is added, forms a dissonance with G (art. 18.) Hence the chord G, B, d', f' is called a dissonant chord, or a chord of the seventh. It serves to distinguish the fifth G from the generator C, which always implies, without mixture or alteration, the perfect chord C, E, G, c', resulting from nature itself (art. 32.) By this we may see, that when we pass from C to G, one passes at the same time from C to F, because f' is found to be comprehended in the chord of G; and the mode of C by these means plainly appears to be determined, because there is none but that mode to which the sounds F and G at once belong.\n\n96. Let us now see what may be added to the harmony F, A, C, of the fifth F below the generator, to treat distinctly this harmony from that of the generator continued. It seems probable at first, that we should add to it the other fifth G, so that the generator C, in passing to F, may at the same time pass to G, and that by this mode should be determined: but this introduction of G, in the chord F, A, C, would produce two seconds in succession F G, G A, that is to say, two dissonances whose union would prove extremely harsh to the ear; an inconvenience to be avoided. For if, to distinguish the mode, we should alter the harmony of the fifth F in the fundamental bass, it must only be altered in the least degree possible.\n\n97. For this reason, instead of G, we shall take its chord of fifth f', the sound that approaches it nearest; and the great we shall have, instead of the fifth F, the chord F, A, c', d', which is called a chord of the great fifth.\n\nOne may here remark the analogy there is observed between the harmony of the fifth G and that of the fifth F.\n\n98. The fifth G, in rising above the generator, gives a chord entirely consisting of thirds ascending from G, ces continuer C, B, d', f'; now the fifth F being below the generator C in descending, we shall find, as we go lower by thirds from c' towards E, the same sounds c', A, F, D, which form the chord F, A, c', d', given to the fifth F.\n\n99. It appears besides, that the alteration of the harmony in the two fifths consists only in the third minor D, F, which was reciprocally added to the harmony of these two fifths.\n\nCHAP. XII. Of the Double Use or Employment of Dissonance.\n\n100. It is evident by the resemblance of sounds to Account of their octaves, that the chord F, A, c', d', is in effect the double of the same as the chord D, F, A, c', taken inversely f', employment that the inverse of the chord C, A, F, D, has been \u00a7 See In found (art. 8.) in descending by thirds, from the generator C (pp.).\n\n(oo) There are likewise other minor modes, into which we may pass in our progress from the mode major of C; as that of F minor, in which the perfect minor chord F, A, c', includes the sound c', and whole scale in ascent F, G, Ab, Bb, c', d, e, f', only includes the two sounds Ab, Bb, which do not occur in the scale of C. This transition, however, is not frequent.\n\nThe minor mode of D has only in its scale ascending D, E, F; G, A, B, c', d', one c' sharp which is not found in the scale of C. For this reason a transition may likewise be made, without grating the ear, from the mode of C major to the mode of D minor; but this passage is less immediate than the former, because the chords C, E, G, c', and D, F, A, d', not having a single sound in common, one cannot (art. 37.) pass immediately from the one to the other.\n\n(pp) M. Rameau, in several passages of his works (for instance, in p. 110, 111, 112, and 113, of the Generation Harmonique), appears to consider the chord D, F, A, C, as the primary chord and generator of the chord E, A, c', d', which is that chord reversed; in other passages (particularly in p. 116 of the same performance), he seems to consider the first of these chords as nothing else but the reverse of the second. It would seem that this...\n101. The chord D, F, A, 'c', is a chord of the seventh like the chord G, B, 'd', f'; with this only difference, that the latter in the third G, B, is major; whereas in the former, the third D, F, is minor. If the F were sharp, the chord D, F, A, 'c', would be a genuine chord of the dominant, like the chord G, B, D, 'd'; and as the dominant G may descend to C in the fundamental bass, the dominant D implying or carrying with it the third major F might in the same manner descend to G.\n\n102. Now if the F should be changed into F natural, D, the fundamental tone of this chord D, F, A, 'c', might still descend to G; for the change from F to F natural will have no other effect, than to preserve the impression of the mode of C, instead of that of the mode of G, which the F would have here introduced. The note D will, however, preserve its character as a dominant, on account of the mode of C, which forms a seventh. Thus in the chord of which we treat, (D, F, A, 'c'), D may be considered as an imperfect dominant: we call it imperfect, because it carries with it the third minor F, instead of the third major F. It is for this reason that in the sequel we shall call it simply the dominant, to distinguish it from the dominant G, which shall be named the tonic dominant.\n\n103. Thus the sounds F and G, which cannot succeed each other (art. 36.) in a diatonic bass, when they only carry with them the perfect chords F A C, G B d, may succeed one another, if 'd' be added to the harmony of the first, and 'c' to the harmony of the second; and if the first chord be inverted, that is to say, if the two chords take this form, D, F, A, C, G, B, d, a.\n\n104. Besides, the chord F, A, 'c', d', being allowed to succeed the perfect chord C, E, G, 'c', it follows for the same reasons, that the chord C, E, G, C may be succeeded by D, F, A, 'c'; which is not contradictory to what we have above said (art. 37.), that the sounds C and D cannot succeed one another in the fundamental bass: for in the passage quoted, we had supposed that both C and D carried with them a perfect chord major; whereas, in the present case, D carries the third minor E, and likewise the sound 'c', by which the chord D, F, A, 'c' is connected with that which precedes it C, E, G, 'c'; and in which the sound 'c' is found. Besides, this chord, D, F, A, 'c', is properly nothing else but the chord F, A, 'c', d' inverted, and if we may speak so, disguised.\n\n105. This manner of presenting the chord of the subdominant under two different forms, and of employing it under these two different forms, has been called Harmony, by M. Rameau its double office or employment. This Double employment is the source of one of the finest varieties in harmony, and we shall see in the following chapter the advantages what, and why so.\n\nWe may add, that as this double employment is a kind of license, it ought not to be practised without some precaution. We have lately seen that the chords D, F, A, 'c', considered as the inverse of F, A, 'c', may succeed to C, E, G, 'c', but this liberty is not reciprocal: and though the chord F, A, 'c', may be followed by the chord C, E, G, 'c', we have no right to conclude from thence that the chord D, F, A, 'c', considered as the inverse of F, A, 'c', may be followed by the chord C, E, G, 'c'. For this reason shall be given in chap. xvi.\n\nCHAP. XIII. Concerning the Use of this Double Employment, and its Rules.\n\n106. We have shown (chap. xvi.) how the diatonic scale, or ordinary gammut, may be formed from the fundamental bass F, C, G, D, by twice repeating the note G in that series; so that this gammut is primitive-ly composed of two similar tetrachords, one in the mode of C, the other in that of G. Now it is possible, by means of this double employment, to preserve the impression of the mode of C through the whole extent preferred, of the scale, without twice repeating the note C, or even without supposing this repetition. For this effect we form the following fundamental bass,\n\nC, G, C, F, C, D, G, C:\n\nin which C is understood to carry with it the perfect chord C, E, G, 'c'; G, the chord G, B, 'd', f'; F the chord F, A, 'c', d'; and D, the chord D, F, A, 'c'. It is plain from what has been said in the preceding chapter, that in this case C may ascend to D in the fundamental bass, and D descend to G, and that the impression of the mode of C is preserved by the 'd' natural, which forms the third minor 'd', instead of the third major which D ought naturally to imply.\n\n107. This fundamental bass will give, as it is evident, the ordinary diatonic scale,\n\n'tc, d, e, f, g, a, b', c,\n\nwhich of consequence will be in the mode of C alone; and if one should choose to have the second tetrachord in the mode of G, it will be necessary to substitute 'f', instead of 'f', in the harmony of D (QQ.).\n\n108. Thus the generator C may be followed according...\nPart I.\n\nTheory of ing to pleasure in ascending diatonically either by a Harmony, tonic dominant (DF A C), or by a simple dominant (DF A C).\n\n109. In the minor mode of A, the tonic dominant E ought always to imply its third major EG X, when this dominant E descends to the generator A (art. 83.), and the chord of this dominant shall be EG X B d f, entirely similar to G B d f. With respect to the sub-dominant D, it will immediately imply the third minor F, to denominate the minor mode; and we may add B above its chord DF A, in this manner DF A B, a chord similar to that of FA c d; and as we have deduced from the chord FA c d that of DF A c, we may in the same manner deduce from the chord DF A B a new chord of the seventh B d f a', which will exhibit the double employment of diffiances in the minor mode.\n\n110. One may employ this chord B d f a', to preserve the impression of the mode of A in the diatonic scale of the minor mode, and to prevent the necessity of twice repeating the sound E; but in this case, the F must be rendered sharp, and the chord changed to B d f a', the fifth of B being f' X, as we have seen above. This chord is then the inverse of DF X A B, the sub-dominant implying the third major, which ought not to surprise us; for in the minor mode of A, the second tetrachord E F X G X A is exactly the same as it would be in the major mode of A. Now, in the major mode of A the subdominant D ought to imply the third major F X.\n\n111. Hence the minor mode is susceptible of a much greater number of varieties than the major: the major mode is founded in nature alone; whereas the minor is in some measure the product of art. But, in return, the major mode has received from nature, to which it owes its immediate formation, a force and energy which the minor cannot boast.\n\nCHAP. XIV. Of the different Kinds of Chords of the Seventh.\n\n112. The dissonance added to the chord of the dominant and of the subdominant, though in some measure suggested by nature (chap. xi.), is nevertheless a work of art; but as it produces great beauties in harmony by the variety which it introduces into it, let us discover whether, in consequence of this first advance, Theory of art may not still be carried farther.\n\n113. We have already three different kinds of chords of the seventh, viz:\n\n1. The chord G B d f', composed of a third major followed by two thirds minor.\n2. The chord D F A c', or B d f X a', a third major between two minors.\n3. The chord B d f a', two thirds minor followed by a major.\n\n114. There are still two other kinds of chords of the seventh which are employed in harmony; one is composed of a third minor between two thirds major, C E G B, or FA c e'; the other is wholly composed of thirds minor G X B d f'. These two chords, which at first appear as if they ought not to enter into harmony if we rigorously keep to the preceding rules, are nevertheless frequently practised with success in the fundamental bass. The reason is this:\n\n115. According to what has been said above, if we would add a seventh to the chord C E G, to make it admit a dominant of C, one can add nothing but B b; and if, in this case C E G B b would be the chord of the tonic why dominant in the mode of F, as G B d f' is the chord of the tonic dominant in the mode of C; but if we would preserve the impression of the mode of C in the harmony, we change this B b into B natural, and the chord C E G B becomes C E G B. It is the same case with the chord FA c e', which is nothing else but the chord FA c e' b; in which one may substitute for 'e' b, e' natural, to preserve the impression of the mode of C, or of that of F.\n\nBesides, in such chords as C E G B, FA c e', the sounds B and e', though they form a dissonance with C in the first case, and with F in the second, are nevertheless supportable to the ear, because these sounds B and e' (art. 19.) are already contained and underlaid, the first in the note E of the chord C E G B, as likewise in the note G of the same chord; the second in the note A of the chord FA c e', as likewise in the note c' of the same chord. All together they seem to allow the artist to introduce the note B and e' into these two chords (RR).\n\n116. With respect to the chord of the seventh G X B d f', wholly composed of thirds minor, it may be regarded as formed from the union of the two chords of and extended.\nTheory of the Dominant and of the Sub-Dominant in the Minor Mode.\n\nIn effect, in the minor mode of A, for instance, these two chords are E G B d f, and D E A B, whose union produces E G B d f, f a. Now, if we should suffer this chord to remain thus, it would be disagreeable to the ear, by its multiplicity of dissonances, D E, F F, F G B d f, A B, D G B d f (art. 18); so that, to avoid this inconvenience, the generator A is immediately expunged, which, (art. 19) is as it were understood in D, and the fifth or dominant E, whose place the sensible note G B d f is supposed to hold; thus there remains only the chord G B d f, wholly composed of thirds minor, and in which the dominant E is considered as understood; in such a manner that the chord G B d f represents the chord of the tonic dominant E G B d f, to which we have joined the chord of the sub-dominant D E A B, but in which the dominant E is always reckoned the principal note (ss).\n\n117. Since, then, from the chord E G B d f, we may pass to the perfect A C e a, and vice versa, we may in like manner pass from the chord G B d f to the chord A C e a, and from this last to the chord G B d f; this remark will be very useful to us in the sequel.\n\nChap. XV. Of the Preparation of Dissonances.\n\n118. In every chord of the seventh, the highest note, that is to say, the seventh above the fundamental, is called a dissonance or discord; thus d' is the dissonance of the chord G B d f; e' in the chord D F, A c', &c.\n\nManner of preparing dissonances investigated.\n\n119. When the chord G B d f follows the chord C E G c', as often happens, it is obvious that we do not find the dissonance d' in the preceding chord C E G c'. Nor ought it indeed to be found in that chord; for this dissonance is nothing else but the sub-dominant added to the harmony of the dominant to determine the mode: now, the sub-dominant is not found in the harmony of the generator.\n\n120. For the same reason, when the chord of the sub-dominant F A c d follows the chord C E G c', the note d', which forms a dissonance with c', is not found in the preceding chord.\n\nIt is not so when the chord D F A c' follows the chord C E G c'; for c', which forms a dissonance in the second chord, stands as a consonance in the preceding.\n\n121. In general, dissonance being the production of art (chap. xi.), especially in such chords as are not of the tonic dominant nor sub-dominant, the only means to prevent its displeasing the ear by appearing too heterogeneous to the chord, is, that it may be, if we may speak so, announced to the ear by being found in the preceding chord, and by that means connect the two chords. Hence follows this rule:\n\n122. In every chord of the seventh, which is not the chord of the tonic dominant, that is to say, (art. of dissonance 102.) which is not composed of a third major followed by two thirds minor, the dissonance which this chord performed, forms ought to stand as a consonance in the chord which precedes it.\n\nThis is what we call a prepared dissonance.\n\n123. Hence, in order to prepare a dissonance, the fundamental bas must necessarily ascend by the interval of a second, as\n\nC E G c', D F A c';\n\nor descend by a third, as\n\nC E G c', A C E G;\n\nor descend by a fifth, as\n\nC E G c', F A C E;\n\nin every other case the dissonance cannot be prepared. This may be easily ascertained. If, for instance, the fundamental bas rises by a third, as C E G c', E G B d f, the dissonance d' is not found in the chord C E G c'. The same might be said of C E G c', G B d f, and C E G c', B D f a, in which the fundamental bas rises by a fifth or descends by a second.\n\n124. When a tonic, that is to say, a note which carries with it a perfect chord, is followed by a dominant in the interval of a fifth or third, this succession may be regarded as a process from that same tonic to another, which has been rendered a dominant by the addition of the dissonance.\n\nMoreover, we have seen (art. 119. and 120.) that a dissonance does not require preparation in the chords of the tonic dominant and of the sub-dominant: whence it follows, that every tonic carrying with it a perfect chord, may be changed into a tonic dominant (if the perfect chord be major), or into a sub-dominant (whether the chord be major or minor) by adding the dissonance all at once.\n\nChap. XVI. Of the Rules for resolving Dissonances.\n\n125. We have seen (chap. v. and vi.) how the Diatonic scale, so natural to the voice, is formed by the ceaseless harmonies of fundamental sounds; from whence it follows, that the most natural succession of harmonical sounds is to be diatonic. To give a dissonance then, and make in some measure, as much the character of an harmonic as possible, it is necessary that this dissonance, in that part of the modulation where it is found, should descend or rise diatonically upon another note, which may be one of the consonances of the subsequent chord.\n\n126. Now in the chord of the tonic dominant it ought to be the chord of the tonic dominant, to which the dissonance may be joined together after having excluded from them, i. The dominant G, represented by its friend, and third major B, which is presumed to retain its place. 2. The note C which is underlaid in F, which will form why this chord B d f a. The chord B d f a, considered in this point of view, may be understood as belonging to the major mode of C upon certain occasions.\n\n(ss) We have seen (art. 109.) that the chord B d f a, in the minor mode of A, may be regarded as the inversion of the chord D F A B; it would likewise seem, that, in certain cases, this chord B d f a may be considered as should be recomposed of the two chords G B d f, F A c d of the dominant and of the sub-dominant of the major mode of C, than descend, and third major B, which is presumed to retain its place.\nought rather to descend than to rise; for this reason.\n\nLet us take, for instance, the chord G B d f, followed by the chord C E G c; the part which formed the dissonance f ought to descend to e rather than rise to g, though both the sounds E and G are found in the subsequent chord C E G c; because it is more natural and more conformed to the connexion which ought to be found in every part of the music, that G should be found in the same part where G has already been founded, whilst the other part was founding f, as may be here seen (Parts First and Fourth).\n\nFirst part, - f, e\nSecond, - d, c\nThird, - B\nFourth, - G G\nFundamental bass, - G C\n\n127. So, in the chord of the simple dominant D F A c, followed by G B d f, the dissonance e ought rather to descend to B than rise to d.\n\n128. And, for the same reason, in the chord of the sub-dominant F A c d, the dissonance d ought to rise to e of the following chord C E G c, rather than descend to c; whence may be deduced the following rules.\n\n129. 1\u00b0 In every chord of the dominant, whether tonic or simple, the note which constitutes the seventh, that is to say the dissonance, ought diatonically to descend upon one of the notes which form a consonance in the subsequent chord.\n\n2\u00b0 In every chord of the sub-dominant, the dissonance ought to rise diatonically upon the third of the subsequent chord.\n\n130. A dissonance which descends or rises diatonically according to these two rules, is called a dissonance resolved.\n\nFrom these rules it is a necessary result, that the chord of the seventh D F A c, though it should even be considered as the inverse of F A c d, cannot be succeeded by the chord C E G c, since there is not in this last chord the note B, upon which the dissonance e of the chord D F A c can descend.\n\nOne may besides find another reason for this rule, in examining the nature of the double employment of dissonances. In effect, in order to pass from D F A c, to C E G c, it is necessary that D F A c should in this case be understood as the inverse of F A c d. Now the chord D F A c can only be conceived as the inverse of F A c d, when this chord D F A c precedes or immediately follows the C E G c; in every other case the chord D F A c is a primitive chord, formed from the perfect minor chord D F A, to which the dissonance e was added, to take from D the character of a tonic. Thus the chord D F A c could not be followed by the chord C E G c, but after having been preceded by the same chord. Now, in this case, the double employment would be entirely a futile expedient, without producing any agreeable effect: because, instead of this succession of chords, C E G c, D F A c, C E G c, it would be much more easy and natural to substitute this other, which furnishes this natural succession C E G c, F A c d, C E G c. The proper use of the double employment is, that, by means of inverting the chord of the sub-dominant, it may be able to pass from that chord thus inverted to any other chord except that of the tonic, to which it naturally leads.\n\nCHAP. XVII. Of the Broken or Interrupted Cadence.\n\n131. In a fundamental bass which moves by fifths, there is always, as we have formerly observed (chap. viii.), a repose more or less perfect from one found to another; and of consequence there must likewise be a repose more or less perfect from one found to another in the fundamental bass, which results from that bass.\n\nIt may be demonstrated by a very simple experiment, that the cause of a repose in melody is solely in the fundamental bass expressed or understood. Let any person sing these three notes c d g, performing on the id a shake, which is commonly called a cadence; the modulation will appear to him to be finished after the second c, in such a manner that the ear will neither expect nor with anything to follow. The case will be the same if we accompany this modulation with its natural fundamental bass C G C: but if, instead of this bass, we should give it the following, C G A: in this case the modulation c d c would not appear to be finished, and the ear would still expect and desire something more. This experiment may easily be made.\n\n132. This passage G A, when the dominant G diatonically ascends upon the note A instead of descending by a fifth upon the generator C, as it ought naturally to do, is called a broken cadence; because the perfect cadence G C, which the ear expects after the dominant G, is, if we may speak so, broken and suspended by the transition from G to A.\n\n133. Hence it follows, that if the modulation c d c appeared finished when we supposed no bass to it at all, it is because its natural fundamental bass C G C is implied; for the ear desires something to follow this modulation, as soon as it is reduced to the necessity of hearing another bass.\n\n134. The broken cadence may be considered as having its origin in the double employment of dissonances; broken since this cadence, like the double employment, only consists in a diatonic procedure of the bass ascending (chap. xii.) In effect, nothing hinders us to descend from the chord G B d f to the chord C E G A by converting the tonic C into a sub-dominant, that is to say, by passing all at once from the mode of C to the mode of G: now to descend from G B d f to C E G A is the same thing as to rise from the chord G B d f to the chord A c e g, in changing the chord of the sub-dominant C E G A for the imperfect chord of the dominant, according to the laws of the double employment.\n\n135. In this kind of cadence, the dissonance of the first chord is resolved by descending diatonically upon performing the fifth of the subsequent chord. For instance, in this case the broken cadence G B d f, A c e g, the dissonance f is resolved by descending diatonically upon the fifth e.\n\n136. There is another kind of cadence, called an interrupted cadence, where the dominant descends by a cadence, third to another dominant, instead of descending by a what fifth upon the tonic, as in this succession of the bass G B d f.\nMUSI C.\n\nPart I.\n\nTheory of Harmony.\n\nG B d f', E G B d'; in the case of an interrupted cadence, the dissonance of the former chord is resolved by descending diatonically upon the octave of the fundamental note of the subsequent chord, as may be here seen, where d' is resolved upon the octave of E.\n\n137. This kind of interrupted cadence has likewise its origin in the double employment of dissonances. For let us suppose these two chords in succession, G B d f', G B d e', where G is successively a tonic dominant and sub-dominant; that is to say, in which we pass from the mode of C to the mode of D; if we should change the second of these chords into the chord of the dominant, according to the laws of the double employment, we shall have the interrupted cadence G B d f', E G B d'.\n\nCHAP. XVIII. Of the Chromatic Species.\n\n138. The series or fundamental basses by fifths produces the diatonic species in common use (chap. vi.); now the third major being one of the harmonics of a fundamental sound as well as the fifth, it follows, that we may form fundamental basses by thirds major, as we have already formed fundamental basses by fifths.\n\nA chromatic interval or minor semitone, how found. See fig. 10.\n\n139. If then we should form this bass C, E, G, the two first sounds carrying each along with it their thirds major and fifths, it is evident that C will give G, and that E will give G; now the semitone which is between this G and this G is an interval much less than the semitone which is found in the diatonic scale between E and F, or between B and c'. This may be ascertained by calculation (tt): and for this reason the semitone from E to F is called major, and the other minor (uu).\n\n140. If the fundamental bass should proceed by thirds minor in this manner, C, Eb, a succession which is allowed when we have investigated the origin of the minor mode (chap. ix.), we shall find this modulation G, Gb, which would likewise give a minor semitone (xx).\n\n141. The minor semitone is hit by young practitioners in intonation with more difficulty than the semitone major. For which this reason may be assigned: The semitone major which is found in the diatonic scale, as from E to F, results from a fundamental bass by fifths C F, that is to say, by a succession which is most natural, and for this reason the easiest to the ear. On the contrary, the minor semitone arises from a succession by thirds, which is still less natural than the former. Hence, that scholars may truly hit the minor semitone, the following artifice is employed. Let us suppose, for instance, that they intend to rise from G to G; they rise at first from G to A, then descend from A to G by the interval of a semitone major; for this G sharp, which is a semitone major below A, proves a semitone minor above G. [See the notes (tt) and (uu).]\n\n142. Every procedure of the fundamental bass by thirds, whether major or minor, rising or descending, gives the minor semitone. This we have already seen be found from the succession of thirds in ascending. The series of thirds minor in descending, C A, gives, C, C, Ab, gives C, Cb, (zz).\n\n143. The minor semitone constitutes the species called chromatic; and with the species which moves by diatonic intervals, resulting from the succession of fifths (chap. v. and vi.), it comprehends the whole melody.\n\nCHAP. XIX. Of the Enharmonic Species.\n\n144. The two extremes, or highest and lowest notes, C G, of the fundamental bass by thirds major CEG, give this modulation c'B; and these two sounds c'nic intervals differ between themselves by a small interval which is called the dieisis, or enharmonic fourth of a tone (3A), and how formed.\n\n(ttt) In reality, C being supposed 1, as we have always supposed it, E is 4/3, and G is 5/4; now G being 5/4, G then shall be to G as 4/5 to 3/4; that is to say, as 25 times 2 to 3 times 16: the proportion then of G to G is as 25 to 24, an interval much less than that of 16 to 15, which constitutes the semitone from c' to B, or from F to E (note z).\n\n(uuu) A minor joined to a major semitone will form a minor tone; that is to say, if one rises, for instance, from E to F, by the interval of a semitone major, and afterwards from F to F by the interval of a minor semitone, the interval from E to F will be a minor tone. For let us suppose E to be 1, F will be 4/3, and F will be 5/4 of 4/3; that is to say, 25 times 16 divided by 24 times 15, or 16/15; E then is to F as 1 is to 9, the interval which constitutes the minor tone (note BB).\n\nWith respect to the tone major, it cannot be exactly formed by two semitones; for, 1. Two major semitones in immediate succession would produce more than a tone major. In effect, 4/3 multiplied by 4/3 gives 16/9, which is greater than 4/3, the interval which constitutes (note BB) the major tone. 2. A semitone minor and a semitone major would give less than a major tone, since they amount only to a true minor. 3. And, a fortiori, two minor semitones would still give less.\n\n(xx) In effect, Eb being 4/3, Gb will be 5/4 of 4/3; that is to say, (note Q) 4/3: now the proportion of 1 to 4/3 (note Q) is that of 3 times 25 to 2 times 36; that is to say, as 25 to 24.\n\n(yyy) A being 4/3, C is 5/4 of 4/3; that is to say 4/3, and C is 1: the proportion then between C and C is that of 1 to 4/3, or of 24 to 25.\n\n(zzz) Ab being the third major below C, will be 4/3 (note Q): Cb, then, is 5/4 of 4/3; that is to say 4/3. The proportion, then, between C and Cb, is as 25 to 24.\n\n(3A) G being 4/3 and B being 4/3 of 4/3, we shall have B equal (note Q) to 4/3, and its octave below shall be 4/3; an interval less than unity by about 1/3 or 1/4. It is plain then from this fraction, that the B in question must be considerably lower than C.\nwhich is the difference between a semitone major and a semitone minor (3 b). This quarter tone is inappre-\nciable by the ear, and impracticable upon several of our instruments. Yet have means been found to put it in practice in the following manner, or rather to perform what will have the same effect upon the ear.\n\n145. We have explained (art. 116.) in what manner the chord G B d f may be introduced into the introducing minor mode, entirely consisting of thirds minor perfectly true, or at least supposed such. This chord supplying the place of the chord of the dominant (art. 116.) from thence we may pass to that of the tonic or generator A (art. 117.). But we must remark,\n\n1. That this chord G B d f, entirely consisting of thirds minor, may be inverted or modified according to the three following arrangements, B d f g, D F G B, F G B d; and that in all these three different states, it will still remain composed of thirds minor; or at least there will only be wanting the enharmonic fourth of a tone to render the third minor between F and G entirely just; for a true third minor, as that from E to G in the diatonic scale, is composed of a semitone and a tone both major. Now from F to G there is a tone major, and from G to G there is only a minor semitone. There is then wanting (art. 144.) the enharmonic fourth of a tone, to render the third FG exactly true.\n\n2. But as this division of a tone cannot be found in the gradations of any scale practicable upon most of our instruments, nor be appreciated by the ear, the ear takes the different chords.\n\n| B | d | f | g |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| D | F | G | B |\n| F | G | B | d |\n\nwhich are absolutely the same, for chords composed every one of thirds minor exactly just.\n\nNow the chord G B d f, belonging to the minor mode of A, where G is the sensible note; the chord B d f g, or B d f a b, will, for the same reason, belong to the minor mode of C, where B is the sensible note. In like manner, the chord D F G B, or D F A b c b, will belong to the minor mode of Eb, and the chord F G B d, or F A b c b e b, to the minor mode of Gb.\n\nAfter having passed then by the mode of A to the chord G B d f (art. 117.), one may by means of this last chord, and by merely satisfying ourselves to invert it, afterwards pass all at once to the modes of C minor, of Eb minor, or of Gb minor; that is to say, into the modes which have nothing, or almost nothing, in common with the minor mode of A, and which are entirely foreign to it (3 c).\n\n146. It must, however, be acknowledged, that a The alternation transition so abrupt, and so little expected, cannot deceive nor elude the ear; it is struck with a sensation which it is so unlooked-for, without being able to account for the effectuated passage to itself. And this account has its foundation abrupt and in the enharmonic fourth of a tone; which is overlooked.\n\n---\n\nThis interval has been called the fourth of a tone, and this denomination is founded on reason. In effect, we may distinguish in music four kinds of quarter tones.\n\n1. The fourth of a tone major: now, a tone major being \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\), and its difference from unity being \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), the difference of this quarter tone from unity will be almost the fourth of \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\); that is to say, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n2. The fourth of a tone minor; and as a tone minor, which is \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\), differs from unity by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), the fourth of a minor tone will differ from unity about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n3. One half of a semitone major; and as this semitone differs from unity by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), one half of it will differ from unity about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n4. Finally, one half of a semitone minor, which differs from unity by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\): its half then will be \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nThe interval, then, which forms the enharmonic fourth of a tone, as it does not differ from unity but by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), may justly be called the fourth of a tone, since it is less different from unity than the largest interval of a quarter tone, and more than the least.\n\nWe shall add, that since the enharmonic fourth of a tone is the difference between a semitone major and a semitone minor; and since the tone minor is formed (note uu) of two semitones, one major and the other minor; it follows, that two semitones major in succession form an interval larger than that of a tone by the enharmonic fourth of a tone; and that two minor semitones in succession form an interval less than a tone by the same fourth of a tone.\n\n(3 b) That is to say, that if you rise from E to F, for instance, by the interval of a semitone major, and afterwards, returning to E, you should rise by the interval of a semitone minor to another sound which is not in the scale, and which I shall mark thus, F +, the two sounds F + and F will form the enharmonic fourth of a tone: for E being 1, F will be \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\); and \\( \\frac{9}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{10}{8} \\): the proportion then between F + and F is that of \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\) to \\( \\frac{10}{8} \\) (note Q); that is to say, as 25 times 15 to 16 times 24; or otherwise, as 25 times 5 to 16 times 8, or as 125 to 128.\n\nNow this proportion is the same which is found, in the beginning of the preceding note, to express the enharmonic fourth of a tone.\n\n(3 c) As this method for obtaining or supplying enharmonic gradations cannot be practised on every occasion when the composer or practitioner would wish to find them, especially upon instruments where the scale is fixed and invariable, except by a total alteration of their economy, and re-tuning the strings, Dr Smith in his Harmonics has proposed an expedient for redressing or qualifying this defect, by the addition of a greater number of keys or strings, which may divide the tone or semitone into as many appreciable or sensible intervals as may be necessary. For this, as well as for the other advantageous improvements which he proposes in the structure of instruments, we cannot with too much warmth recommend the perusal of his learned and ingenious book to such of our readers as aspire to the character of genuine adepts in the theory of music.\ned as nothing, because it is inappreciable by the ear; but of which, though its value is not ascertained, the whole harmony is sensibly perceived. The infant of surprise, however, immediately vanishes; and that astonishment is turned into admiration, when one feels himself transported as if he were all at once, and almost imperceptibly, from one mode to another, which is by no means relative to it, and to which he never could have immediately passed by the ordinary series of fundamental notes.\n\n**Chap. XX. Of the Diatonic Enharmonic Species.**\n\n147. If we form a fundamental bass, which rises alternately by fifths and thirds, as F, C, E, B, this bass will give the following modulation, 'f', e, e, d'f'; in which the semitones from 'f' to 'e', and from 'e' to 'd'f', are equal and major (3 D).\n\nThis species of modulation or of harmony, in which all the semitones are major, is called the enharmonic diatonic species. The major semitones peculiar to this species give it the name of diatonic, because major semitones belong to the diatonic species; and the tones which are greater than major by the excess of a fourth, resulting from a succession of major semitones, give it the name of enharmonic (note 3 A).\n\n**Chap. XXI. Of the Chromatic Enharmonic Species.**\n\n148. If we pass alternately from a third minor in descending to a third major in rising, as C, C, A, C', C', we shall form this modulation 'c', b, e, e, e c'; in which all the semitones are minor (3 E).\n\nThis species is called the chromatic enharmonic species: the minor semitones peculiar to this kind give it the name of chromatic, because minor semitones belong to the chromatic species; and the semitones which are lesser by the diminution of a fourth resulting from a succession of minor semitones, give it the name of enharmonic (note 3 F).\n\n149. These new species confirm what we have all along said, that the whole effects of harmony and melody reside in the fundamental bass.\n\n150. The diatonic species is the most agreeable, because the fundamental bass which produces it is formed from a succession of fifths alone, which is the most natural of all others.\n\n151. The chromatic being formed from a succession of thirds, is the most natural after the preceding.\n\n152. Finally, the enharmonic is the least agreeable of all, because the fundamental bass which gives it is not immediately indicated by nature. The fourth of a tone which constitutes this species, and which is itself inappreciable to the ear, neither produces nor can produce its effect, but in proportion as imagination suggests the fundamental bass from whence it results; a bass whose procedure is not agreeable to nature, since it is formed of two sounds which are not contiguous one to the other in the series of thirds (art. 144.).\n\n**Chap. XXII. Showing that Melody is the Offspring of Harmony.**\n\n153. All that we have hitherto said, as it seems to me, is more than sufficient to convince us, that melody has its original principle in harmony; and that it is investigated in harmony, expressed or underfed, that we ought to pay attention to the effects of melody.\n\n154. If this should still appear doubtful, nothing more is necessary than to pay due attention to the first experiment (art. 19.), where it may be seen that the principal found is always the lowest, and that the sharper sounds which it generates are with relation to it what the treble of an air is to its bass.\n\n155. Yet more, we have proved, in treating of the broken cadence (chap. xvii.), that the diversification of basses produces effects totally different in a modulation which, in other respects, remains the same.\n\n156. Can it be still necessary to adduce more convincing proofs? We have but to examine the different basses which may be given to this very simple modulation G C. It will be found susceptible of many, and each will give a different character to the modulation G C, though in itself it remains always the same. We may thus change the whole nature and effects of a modulation, without any other alteration than that of its fundamental bass.\n\nM. Rameau has shown, in his *New System of Music*, printed at Paris 1726, p. 44, that this modulation G C, is susceptible of 20 different fundamental basses. Now the same fundamental bass, as may be seen in our second part, will afford several continued or thorough basses. How many means, of consequence, may be practised to vary the expression of the same modulation?\n\n157. From these different observations it may be concluded, 1. That an agreeable melody, naturally implies a bass extremely sweet and adapted for fingering; this principle and that reciprocally, as musicians express it, a bass of this kind generally prognosticates an agreeable melody (3 F).\n\n2. That the character of a just harmony is only to form in some measure one system with the modulation, fo\n\n---\n\n(3 D) It is obvious, that if F in the bass be supposed 1, 'f' of the scale will be 2, C of the bass 3 and 'e' of the scale 4 of 3, that is, 1/8; the proportion of 'f' to 'e' is as 2 to 1/8, or as 1 to 1/4. Now E of the bass being likewise 1/4 of 3, or 1/8; B of the bass is 1/4 of 1/8, and its third major D'f' 1/8 of 1/8, or 1/8 of 1/8; this third major, approximated as much as possible to 'e' in the scale by means of octaves, will be 1/8 of 1/8; 'e' then of the scale will be to D'f' which follows it, as 1/8 is to 1/8 of 1/8, that is to say, as 1 to 1/8. The semitones then from 'f' to 'e', and from 'e' to D'f', are both major.\n\n(3 E) It is evident that 'c' is 1/8 (note Q), and that 'e' is 1/8; these two 'e's, then, are between themselves as 1/8 to 1/8, that is to say, as 6 times 4 to 5 times 5, or as 24 to 25, the interval which constitutes the minor semitone. Moreover, the \u0394 of the bass is 1/8, and C'f' 1/8 of 1/8, or 1/8 of 1/8; 'e' then is 1/8 of 1/8, the 'e' in the scale is likewise to the 'e' which follows it, as 24 to 25. All the semitones therefore in this scale are minor.\n\n(3 F) Many composers begin with determining and writing the bass; a method, however, which appears in general\nPart II.\n\nGeneral Remark.\n\nThe diatonic scale or gammut being composed of twelve semitones, it is clear that each of these semitones taken by itself may be the generator of a mode; and that thus there must be twenty-four modes in all, twelve major and twelve minor. We have assumed the major mode of C, to represent all the major modes in general, and the minor mode of A to represent the modes minor, to avoid the difficulties arising from sharps and flats, of which we must have encountered either a greater or lesser number in the other modes. But the rules we have given for each mode are general, whatever note of the gammut be taken for the generator of a mode.\n\nPart II. Principles and Rules of Composition.\n\n158. COMPOSITION, called also counterpoint, is not only the art of composing an agreeable air, but also that of composing several airs in such a manner that when heard at the same time, they may unite in producing an effect agreeable and delightful to the ear; this is what we call composing music in several parts.\n\nThe highest of these parts is called the treble, the lowest is termed the bass; the other parts, when there are any, are termed middle parts; and each in particular is signified by a different name.\n\nChap. I. Of the Different Names given to the same Interval.\n\n159. In the introduction (art. 9.), we have seen a detail of the most common names given to the different intervals. But particular intervals have obtained different names, according to circumstances; which it is proper to explain.\n\n160. An interval composed of a tone and a semitone, which is commonly called a third minor, is likewise sometimes called a second redundant; such is the interval from C to D in ascending, or that of A to Gb descending.\n\nThis interval is so termed, because one of the sounds which form it is always either sharp or flat, and that, if that sharp or flat be taken away, the interval will be that of a second (3 c).\n\n161. An interval composed of two tones and two semitones, as that from B to f', is called a false fifth. This interval is the same with the tritone (art. 9.), since two tones and two semitones are equivalent to three tones. There are, however, reasons for distinguishing them, as will appear below.\n\n162. As the interval from C to D in ascending fifth has been called a second redundant, we likewise call redundant, or from B to Eb in descending, each of which intervals are composed of four tones (3 h).\n\nThis interval is, in the main, the same with that of Ditton's fifth minor (art. 6.); but in the fifth redundant there is always a sharp or a flat; infomuch, that if this fifth minor were removed, the interval would become a true fifth.\n\n163. For the same reason, an interval composed of three tones and three semitones, as from G to f' in ascending, is called a seventh diminished; because, if we remove the sharp from G, the interval from G to f' will become that of an ordinary seventh. The interval of a seventh diminished is in other respects the same with that of the sixth major (art. 9.) (3 i).\n\n164. The major seventh is likewise sometimes called a seventh redundant (3 k).\n\nChap. II. Comparison of the Different Intervals.\n\n165. If we sing 'c' B in descending by a second, and afterwards C B in ascending by a seventh, these different two B's shall be octaves one to the other; or, as we commonly express it, they will be replications one of the other.\n\n166. On account then of the resemblance between others every\n\ngeneral more proper to produce a learned and harmonious music, than a strain prompted by genius and animated by enthusiasm.\n\n(3 c) For the same reason, this interval is frequently termed by English musicians an extreme sharp second.\n\n(3 h) This interval is usually termed by English theorists a sharp fifth.\n\n(3 i) The material difference between the diminished seventh and the major sixth is, that the former always implies a division of the interval into three minor thirds, whereas a division into a fourth and third major, or into a second and major and minor third, is usually supposed in the latter.\n\n(3 k) The chief use of these different denominations is therefore to distinguish chords; for instance, the chord of the redundant fifth and that of the diminished seventh are different from the chord of the sixth; the chord of the seventh redundant, from that of the seventh major. This will be explained in the following chapters.\n\n167. In like manner, it is evident that the fifth descending is nothing but a replication of the third ascending, nor the fourth descending but a replication of the fifth ascending.\n\n168. The following expressions either are or ought to be regarded as synonymous.\n\nTo rise by a second.\u2014To descend by a seventh.\nTo descend by a second.\u2014To rise by a seventh.\nTo rise by a third.\u2014To descend by a sixth.\nTo descend by a third.\u2014To rise by a sixth.\nTo rise by a fourth.\u2014To descend by a fifth.\nTo descend by a fourth.\u2014To rise by a fifth.\n\n(3 L) Our author has treated this part of his subject with somewhat less perspicuity than usual. He has neither described the staffs or systems of lines on which the clefs are placed, nor explained their relation to each other. We have therefore attempted to supply the deficiency.\n\nMusical sounds, like language, are represented by written characters, by which their gravenefs or acutenefs, their duration, and the other qualities intended to be assigned to them, are accurately distinguished.\n\nThe characters which denote the gravenefs or acutenefs, or, as it is termed, the pitch of sounds, are intended to represent the ordinary limits of the human voice, in the exercise of which, or the employment of instruments of nearly the same compass with it, all practical music consists.\n\nFrom the lowest distinct note, without straining, of the masculine voice, to the highest note generally produced by the female voice, there is an interval of three octaves, or twenty-two diatonic notes.\n\nThese notes are represented by characters described alternately on eleven parallel lines, and the spaces between them, forming what we shall here term the general system.\n\nThe characters representing the notes are differently formed according to their duration, but with this we have at present no concern. We shall employ the simplest, a small circle or ellipse.\n\nThe whole extent of the human voice, then, if described upon the general system, would be represented as at Plate CCCLV, fig 1.\n\nThe masculine voice, rising from the lowest note of the general system, will, generally speaking, reach the note on the central line; and an ordinary female voice will reach the same note, descending from the highest. Male voices more acute, and female voices graver than usual, will consequently execute this note with greater facility.\n\nThis central note then, being producible by every species of voice, has been assumed as a fundamental or key note, by which all the others are regulated (art. 4.). And to it is assigned the name of C, by which, in the theory of harmony, (as we have seen), the fundamental sound of the diatonic scale is distinguished.\n\nThe other notes take their denominations accordingly. The note below it is B, that above it 'd', &c.; and to distinguish this central C from its octaves, it is called the middle or tenor C.\n\nAs no human voice can execute the whole twenty-two notes, the general system is divided into portions of five lines, each portion representing the compass of an ordinary voice; and different portions are made use of, according to the gravenefs or acutenefs of different voices.\n\nThe five lines in this state form what is called a staff. Each staff is subdivided into lines and spaces. On the lines, and in the spaces, the heads of the notes are placed. The lines and spaces are counted upwards, from the lowest to the highest; the lowest line is termed the first line; the space between it and the second line is denominated the first space, and so on. Both lines and spaces have the common name of degrees; the staff thus contains nine degrees, viz. five lines and four spaces.\n\nTo ascertain what part of the general system is formed by a staff, one of the clefs mentioned in the text is placed at the beginning of the staff, on one or other of the lines of it.\n\nThe C or tenor clef always denotes the line on which it is placed to be that which carries the tenor C. The G or treble clef distinguishes the line carrying 'g', the perfect fifth above the tenor C. And the F or bass clef affords the line which represents F the perfect fifth below the tenor C.\n\nThe figures of the clefs, (which are characters gradually corrupted from the Gothic C, G, and F), and their places in the general system, appear on Plate CCCLV, Fig. 2.\n\nBy this disposition of the clefs, we see that the staff, which includes the line bearing the treble clef, is formed by the five highest lines of the general system; and that the staff which comprehends the bass clef consists of the five lowest.\n\nThe central line, which carries the tenor C, belongs neither to the treble nor the bass staves. But as that note frequently occurs in composition written on these staves, a small portion of the tenor line is occasionally introduced below the treble clef and above that of the bass (fig. 3.)\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples: all the notes on the same line with the clef take the name of C.\n\nThe G clef is placed on the second or first line; and all the notes on the line of the clef take the name of G.\n\nNames of the notes to the spaces between the lines, the name of any note may be discovered from the position of the clef. Thus, in the F clef, the note on the lowest line is G; the note on the space between the two first lines A; the note on second line B, &c.\n\nMarks and power of sharps, flats, and naturals.\n\nA note before which there is a sharp (marked thus \u266f) must be raised by a semitone; and if there be a flat (marked \u266d) before it, it must be depressed by a semitone.\n\nAs notes still more remote from the staff in use are sometimes introduced, small portions of the lines to which these lines belong are employed in the same manner. Thus, if in writing in the bass staff we want the note properly placed on the lowest line of the treble staff, we draw two short lines above the bass staff, one representing the tenor line, and the other the lowest line of the treble staff, and on this last short line we place the note in question, (fig. 4.)\n\nOn the other hand, if, in writing on the treble staff, we would employ a note properly belonging to the bass staff, we place it below the treble staff, and insert the requisite short lines, representing the corresponding lines of the general system (fig. 5.)\n\nThe occasional short lines thus employed are termed leger lines.\n\nThe same expedient is used to represent notes beyond the limits of the general system. Thus, we write the F which is one degree lower than the lowest G of the bass staff, on the space below that G; the E immediately lower, or on a leger line below the bass staff, and so on. Notes in this position are termed double; thus, the F just mentioned is double F, or FF; the E, double E, or EE, &c.\n\nAgain, the \u266f above the highest G of the treble staff is placed on a leger line above that staff. The \u266d is placed on the space above the leger line: The next note \u266d is set on a second leger line, and so on. These high notes are, in compositions for some instruments, carried more than an octave above the general system. Those in the first octave are said to be in alt; those beyond it, to be in altissimo.\n\nThe tenor or C clef is employed to form different intermediate staves between the treble and bass, according to the compass of the voice or instrument for which the staff is wanted.\n\nCompositions for the gravest masculine voices and instruments are written on the bass clef, and those for female voices and instruments highest in tone, on the treble staff.\n\nFor masculine voices next in depth to the bass and for the higher octave of the violoncello and bassoon, a staff, called the tenor staff, is formed by adding to the tenor line the three highest lines of the bass staff and the lowest line of the treble (fig. 6. 1.)\n\nFor the highest masculine voices, which are called counter tenor, and for the tenor violin, a staff is formed by the tenor line, the two highest lines of the bass, and the two lowest of the treble staff (fig. 6. 2.)\n\nFor the gravest female voices, which are called mezzo soprano, the tenor line and four lowest lines of the treble form a staff (fig. 6. 3.)\n\nThe relation of all the staves to the general system, and to each other, will appear from fig. 6.\n\nThe bass clef on the third line, the tenor clef on the second, and the treble clef on the first, rarely occur, except in old French music.\n\nThe tenor clef, and the staves distinguished by it, are now less frequently used than the treble and bass clefs. Those who cultivate music only as an amusement find it irksome to learn so many modes of notation. The tenor staves are accordingly banished from compositions for keyed instruments. Secular compositions for voices are likewise now written in the treble and bass staves only; although in this there is some inaccuracy, as the tenor parts now written in the treble staff, must often be sung an octave below that in which they appear. The chief use of the tenor clef is in choral music and compositions for the bassoon and tenor violin; and its principal advantage, the facility of reading ancient music, which is almost exclusively written in this clef, has seldom been deemed an insufficient compensation for the labour of acquiring it.\n\n(3 M) The disposition of sharps or flats at the clef, which is termed the signature, depends upon the mode, or tone assumed in the composition as a fundamental or key note, and will be afterwards explained.\n\nThe sharps or flats of the signature affect not only the notes placed on the same degree with themselves, as mentioned in the text, but also all the notes of the same letter, in every octave throughout the movement.\n\nThe sharps or flats of the signature determine the scale in which the movement is composed, and are therefore said to be essential; those which occur in the course of the piece on an occasional change of the scale, are termed accidental.\n\n* Compositions for French horns are written in the treble staff, although the tone of the instrument be very grave; but this is because the horn is borrowed from and has the same natural intervals with the Trumpet, which is an acute instrument.\nequal times, called measures; and each measure is likewise divided into different times.\n\nThere are properly two kinds of measures or modes of time; the measure of two times, or common time, marked by the figure 2 at the beginning of the time (fig. 10); and the measure of three times, or triple time, marked by the figure 3 placed in the same manner (fig. 11).\n\nThe different measures are distinguished by perpendicular lines (3 n), called bars.\n\nIn a measure, we distinguish between the strong and the weak time: the strong time is that which is beat; the weak, that in which the hand or foot is raised. A measure consisting of four times ought to be considered as compounded of two measures, each consisting of two times; thus there are in this measure two strong and two weak times. In general by the words strong and weak even the parts of the same time are distinguished; thus, the first note of each time is considered as strong and the others as weak.\n\n175. The longest of all notes is a semibreve. A minim is half its value; that is to say, two minims are to be performed in the time occupied by one semibreve duration. A minim in the same manner is equivalent to two crotchets, the crotchet to two quavers (3 o).\n\n176. A note which is divided into two parts by a bar, that is, which begins at the end of a measure, and terminates in the measure following, is called a syncopated note (3 p).\n\n179. A note followed by a point or dot is increased by half its value. Thus a dotted semibreve is equivalent to a semibreve and a minim, a dotted minim, to a minim and a crotchet, &c. (Fig. 17.) (3 q).\n\n(3 n) All the notes, therefore, contained between two bars constitute one measure; although in common language the word bar is improperly used for measure.\n\n(3 o) The notes, in their figure, consist of a head and a stem, except the semibreve, which has a head only.\n\nThe place of the note in the staff is determined by the head, which must be placed on the line, or in the space, assigned to the note. The stem may be turned either up or down.\n\nThe quaver is equivalent to two semiquavers, and the semiquaver to two demi-semiquavers. In modern music the demi-semiquaver is also subdivided.\n\nThe quaver and the notes of shorter duration may be grouped together, by two, three, or four, &c., and joined by as many black lines across the ends of the stem as there are hooks in the single note (fig. 12). This arrangement is convenient in writing, and assists the eye in performance.\n\nWhen quavers, or the shorter notes, are to be repeated in the same degree for a time equal to the duration of a longer note, the iterations are, by a fort of musical shorthand, represented by writing the long note only, and placing over or under it, as many short lines as the short note has hooks (fig. 13). And the repetition of a series of short notes is represented by merely writing for each repetition as many short lines as there are hooks to the short notes of which the series is composed (fig. 14).\n\n(3 p) A note in the middle of a measure is also said to be syncopated when it begins on a strong, and ends on a weak part of the measure, (see fig. 15,) where D, C, and B are each of them syncopated.\n\nA note which of itself occupies one, two, or more measures, is not said to be syncopated, but continued or prolonged. See fig. 16.\n\n(3 q) Notes have sometimes in modern music a double dot after them, which makes them longer by three-fourths. Thus a minim twice dotted is equal to three crotchets and a half, or seven quavers, &c.\n\nOur author, in this chapter, has omitted the explanation of rests, and of the particular modifications of time.\n\nRests are characters indicating the temporary suspension of musical sounds. There are as many different rests as there are notes. Thus the semibreve rest indicates a pause of the duration of a semibreve; the minim rest, of a minim, &c. (fig. 18.)\n\nThe semibreve rest also denotes the silence of one entire measure, in triple as well as common time. The silence of several measures is marked as in fig. 18.; but where the silence exceeds three bars, the number is usually marked over the rests.\n\nCommon time is either of a semibreve, or of a minim to the measure.\n\nCommon time of a semibreve is indicated by the letter C at the clef, fig. 1. of Plate CCCLVI. When it is meant to be somewhat quicker than usual, a perpendicular line is drawn through the C, (fig. 2.)\n\nCommon time of a minim to the measure, which is called half time, is indicated by the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), that is, two-fourths of a semibreve, or two crotchets equal to a minim, (fig. 3.)\n\nIn triple time the measure consists of three minims, three crotchets or three quavers, six crotchets or six quavers, nine quavers or twelve quavers.\n\nTriple time of three minims is marked at the clef \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), that is, three halves of a semibreve, (fig. 4.)\n\nTriple time of three crotchets is indicated by the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), (three-fourths of a semibreve) (fig. 5.) and that of three quavers by \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) (three-eighths of a semibreve,) (fig. 6.)\n\nIn the last three examples the measure is divided into three times, of which the first is strong, and the two others weak.\n\nThe measure of six crotchets is marked \\(\\frac{6}{4}\\), (fig. 7.) and that of six quavers, \\(\\frac{6}{4}\\), (fig. 8.) In both there are two times, of which the first is strong, and the second weak.\n\nThe measure of nine quavers is marked \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\), (fig. 9.) and is divided into one strong and two weak times. That of twelve quavers is marked \\(\\frac{12}{4}\\), (fig. 10.) and is accented as if it were two measures of six quavers.\n\nThe measures of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) rarely occur.\n\nThree notes are often performed in the time of two of the same name, and are then termed triplets, (fig. 11.)\nPart II.\n\nChap. IV. Definition of the principal Chords.\n\n178. (3 r) The chord composed of a third, a fifth, and an octave, as C, E, G, C, is called a perfect chord (art. 32.).\n\nIf the third be major, as in C, E, G, C, the perfect chord is denominated major; if the third be minor, as in A, C, E, A, the perfect chord is minor. The perfect chord major constitutes the major mode; and the perfect chord minor, the minor mode (art. 31.).\n\n179. A chord composed of a third, a fifth, and a seventh, as G, B, D, F, or D, F, A, C, &c., is called a chord of the seventh. Such a chord is wholly composed of thirds in ascending.\n\nAll chords of the seventh are specified in harmony, save that which might carry the third minor and the seventh major, as C Eb G B; and that which might carry a false fifth and a seventh major, B D F A, (chap. xiv. Part I.)\n\n180. As thirds are either major or minor, and as they may be differently arranged, it is clear that there are different kinds of chords of the seventh; there is even one, B D F A, which is composed of a third, a false fifth, and a seventh.\n\n181. A chord composed of a third, a fifth, and a sixth, as F A C D, D F A B, is called a chord of the greater sixth.\n\n182. Every note which carries a perfect chord is called a tonic; and a perfect chord is marked by an 8, by a 3, or by a 5, which is written above the note; but frequently these numbers are suppressed. Thus in the example i. the two C's equally carry a perfect chord.\n\n183. Every note which carries a chord of the seventh is called a dominant (art. 102.); and this chord is marked by a 7 written above the note. Thus in the example ii. D carries the chord D F A C, and G the chord G B D F.\n\nIt is necessary to remark, that among the chords\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\n\nwhere the groups of quavers in the second measure are triplets, and each triplet occupies the time of two quavers only. Triplets also occur in triple time, fig. 12.\n\nCertain other characters will be with propriety explained here.\n\nThe Pause signifies that the regular time is to be delayed, and the note marked with the pause protracted. See fig. 13, where the pause is on the last note of the second measure.\n\nThe Repeat, a character resembling an S, denotes, that the following part of the movement must be repeated. See fig. 14.\n\nThe Direct (fig. 15.) is placed at the end of the staff, to shew upon what degree the first note of the following staff is placed.\n\nWhen the inner sides of two bars are dotted, the measures between them are to be repeated (fig. 16.) The word bis is sometimes placed over such passages.\n\nThe double bar distinguishes the end of a movement or strain, (fig. 17.) If the double bar be dotted on one or both sides, the strain is to be repeated, (fig. 18.) The double bar does not affect the time; so that when the strain terminates before the end of a measure, as is often the case, the double bar only marks the conclusion of the strain, but the time is kept exactly as if it were not inserted. See fig. 19.\n\nThe graces of exertion and expression, such as the appogiature, the shake, the flur, the crescendo, the diminuendo, &c. are not necessary to the consideration of the theory of music or principles of composition, but belong to the performer only. See Shake, &c.\n\n(3 r) In this part of our subject, we shall, in mentioning the harmonics of the chords, make use of the capital letters only, as the general names of the notes, without distinguishing octaves by minuscular or Italic letters. The harmonics may be arranged in different octaves. Their different positions will be most easily seen and best understood from the examples in the plates.\nfundamental note. For example, if we would mark the perfect major chord D F A D, as the third F above D is naturally minor, we place above D a sharp, as in Example iv. In the same manner, the chord of the seventh D F A C, and the chord of the great sixth D F A B, is marked with a \u266f above D, and above the \u266d a 7 or a 6 (see v. and vi.).\n\nOn the contrary, when the third is naturally major, and if we would render it minor, we place above the fundamental note a \u266d. Thus the examples vii. viii. ix. show the chords G B\u266d D G G B\u266d D F, G B\u266d D E (35).\n\n**Chap. V. Of the Fundamental Bass.**\n\n189. Let a modulation be invented at pleasure; and under this modulation let there be set a bass composed of different notes, of which some may carry a perfect chord, others that of the seventh, and others that of the great sixth, in such a manner that each note of the modulation which answers to each of the basses, may be one of those which enters into the chord of that note in the bass; this bass being composed according to the rules which shall be immediately given, will be the fundamental bass of the modulation proposed. See Part I., where the nature and principles of the fundamental bass are explained.\n\nThus (Exam. xvi.) it will be found that this modulation, C D E F G A B C, has or may admit for its fundamental bass, C G C F C D G C.\n\nIn reality, the first note C in the upper part is found in the chord of the first note C in the bass, which chord is G E G C; the second note D in the treble is found in the chord G B D G, which is the chord of the second note in the bass, &c., and the bass is composed only of notes which carry a perfect chord,\n\n(35) We may only add, that there is no occasion for marking these sharps or flats when they are originally placed at the clef. For instance, if the sharp be upon F which indicates the key of G (see Exam. x.) it is sufficient to write D, without a sharp, to mark the perfect chord major of D, D F A D. In the same manner, in the Example xi. where the flat is at the clef upon B, which denotes the key of F, it is sufficient to write G, to mark the perfect chord minor of G B\u266d D G.\n\nBut where there is a sharp or a flat at the clef, if we would render the chord minor which is major, or vice versa, we must place above the fundamental note a \u266d or natural. Thus the Example xii. marks the minor chord D F A D, and Example xiii. the major chord G B D G.\u2014Sometimes, in lieu of a natural, a flat is used to signify the minor chord, and a sharp to signify the major. Thus Example xiv. in the key of G, marks the minor chord D F A D, and Example xv. in F, the major chord G B D G.\n\nWhen in a chord of the great sixth, the dissonance, that is to say, the sixth, ought to be sharp, and when the sharp is not found at the clef, we write before or after the 6 a \u266f; and if this sixth should be flat according to the clef, we write a \u266d.\n\nIn the same manner, if in a chord of the seventh of the tonic dominant, the dissonance, that is to say, the seventh, ought to be flat or natural, we write by the side of the seventh a \u266d or a \u266c. Many musicians, when a seventh from the simple dominant ought to be altered by a sharp or a natural, have likewise written by the side of the seventh a \u266c or a \u266d; but M. Rameau suppresses these characters. The reason shall be given below, when we speak of chords by supposition.\n\nIf there be one sharp at the clef, and if we would mark the chord G B D F\u266f, or the chord A C E F\u266f, we ought to place before the seventh or the sixth a \u266c or a \u266d.\n\nIn the same manner, if there be one flat at the clef, and if we would mark the chord C E G B\u266d, we ought to place before the seventh a \u266c or a \u266d; and so of the rest.\n\nAll these intricate combinations of figuring show the superior convenience of the modern method of writing the notes themselves instead of the figures, which has the farther advantage of exhibiting the proper arrangement of the chord, see Example ii.\n\n**Chap. VI. Rules for the Fundamental Bass.**\n\n190. All the notes of the fundamental bass being only capable of carrying a perfect chord, or the formation of the seventh, or that of the great sixth, are either tonics, or dominants, or sub-dominants; and the dominants may be either simple or tonic.\n\nThe fundamental bass ought always to begin with a tonic, as much as it is practicable. And now follow the rules for all the succeeding chords; rules which are evidently derived from the principles established in the Fifth Part of this treatise. To be convinced of this, we shall find it only necessary to review the articles 34, 91, 122, 124, 126, 127.\n\n**Rule I.**\n\n191. In every chord of the tonic, or of the tonic dominant, it is necessary that at least one of the notes which form that chord should be found in the chord that precedes it.\n\n**Rule II.**\n\n192. In every chord of the simple dominant, it is necessary that the note which constitutes the seventh, or dissonance, should likewise be found in the preceding chord.\n\n**Rule III.**\n\n193. In every chord of the sub-dominant, at least one of its consonances must be found in the preceding chord. Thus, in the chord of the sub-dominant F A C D, it is necessary that F, A, or C, which are the consonances...\nPart II.\n\nPrinciples consonances of the chord, should be found in the chord preceding. The dissonance D may either be found in it or not.","sp":119,"ep":143},{"h":"MUSIC","t":"204. The continued bass, is a fundamental bass whose chords are inverted. We invert a chord when we change the order of the notes which compose it. For example, if, instead of the chord G B D F, we should say B D F G or D F G B, &c., the chord is inverted.\n\nThe ways in which a Perfect Chord may be Inverted.\n\n205. The perfect chord C E G C may be inverted in two different ways.\n\n1. E G C E, which we call a chord of the sixth, composed of a third, a fifth, and an octave; and in this case the bass note E is marked with a 6. (See LVI.)\n\n2. G C E G, which we call a chord of the fifth and fourth, composed of a fourth, a fifth, and an octave; and it is marked with a 6. (See LVII.)\n\nThe perfect minor chord is inverted in the same manner.\n\nThe ways in which the Chord of the Seventh may be Inverted.\n\n206. In the chord of the tonic dominant, as G B D F, the third major B above the fundamental note G is called a sensible note (77); and the inverted chord B D F G composed of a third, a false fifth and sixth, is called the chord of the false fifth, and is marked as in examples LVIII. and LIX.\n\nThe chord D F G B, composed of a third, a fourth, and a sixth, is called the chord of the sensible fifth, and marked as in Example LX. (4 c). In this chord, the third is minor, and the sixth major.\n\nThe chord F G B D, composed of a second, a tritone, and a sixth, is called the chord of the tritone, and is marked as in Example LXI. (4 d).\n\n207. In the chord of the simple dominant D F A C, we find,\n\n1. F A C D, a chord of the great sixth, which is composed of a third, a fifth, and a sixth, and which is figured with a 6. See LXII. (4 E).\n\n2. A C D F, a chord of the lesser sixth, which is figured with a 6. See LXIII. (4 F).\n\n3. C D F A, a chord of the second, composed of a second, a fourth, and a sixth, and which is marked with a 2. See LXIV. (4 G).\n\nThe ways in which the Chord of the sub-dominant may be Inverted.\n\n208. The chord of the sub-dominant, as F A C D, may be inverted in three different manners; but the method of inverting it which is most in practice is the chord of the lesser sixth A C D F (LXIII.), and the chord of the seventh D F A C. See LXV.\n\nRules for the Continued Bass.\n\n209. The continued bass is a fundamental bass, whose chords are only inverted in order to render it more in the taste of fingering, and suitable to the voice. See LXVI. in which the fundamental bass which in itself is monotonic and little fitted for fingering, C G C G C G C, produces, by inverting its chords, this continued bass highly proper to be sung, C B C D E F E, &c.

Every note which carries the chord of the false fifth,\n\n(4 b) When the treble syncopates in descending diatonically, it is common enough to make the second part of the syncopate carry a dissonance, and the first a concord. See Example LV. where the first part of the syncopated note G, is in concord with the notes C E G C, which answers to it in the fundamental bass, and where the second part is a dissonance in the subsequent chord A C E G. In the same manner, the first part of the syncopated note F is in concord with the notes D F A C, which answer to it; and the second part is a dissonance in the subsequent chord G B D F, which answers to it, &c.\n\n(4 c) This chord is called by English musicians, the chord of the third and fourth, and generally figured 4.\n\n(4 d) This chord is in England called the chord of the second and fourth, and is figured 4.\n\n(4 e) We are obliged to mark likewise, in the continued bass, the chord of the sub-dominant with a 6 which in the fundamental bass is figured with a 6 alone; and this to distinguish it from the chords of the fifth and of the lesser sixth. (See examples LVI. and LXIII.) The chord of the great sixth in the fundamental bass carries always the sixth major, whereas in the continued bass it may carry the sixth minor. For instance, the chord of the seventh C E G B, gives the chord of the great sixth E G B C, thus improperly called, since the sixth from E to C is minor.\n\n(4 f) M. Rameau has justly observed, that we ought rather to figure this lesser sixth with a 6, to distinguish it from the sensible sixth which arises from the chord of the tonic dominant, and from the sixth which arises from the perfect chord. In the mean time he figures in his works with a 6 alone, the lesser sixths which do not arise from the tonic dominant; that is to say, he figures them as those which arise from the perfect chord; and we have followed him in that notation, though we thought with him, that it would be better to mark this chord by a particular figure.\n\n(4 g) The chord of the seventh B D F A gives, when inverted, the chord F A B D, composed of a third, a tritone, and a sixth. The chord is commonly marked with a 6, as if the tritone were a just fourth. It is his business who performs the accompaniment, to know whether the fourth above F be a tritone or a fourth redundant.\n\nOne may figure this chord thus, 4.\n\n(4 h) The continued bass is proportionably adapted to fingering, as the sounds which form it more scrupulously observe.\nMusical Principles","sp":145,"ep":146},{"h":"MUTILLA","t":"a genus of insects belonging to the order of hymenoptera.

The word is usually spelt Myagrus; but this must be an error, as this word does not express the fly-destroyer, but the mouse-destroyer; and we have it sufficiently testified by the ancients, that flies were the only creatures against whom this deity was invoked. Pliny calls this deity also Myiodes; and tells us, that the flies which used to pester the Olympic rites went away in whole clouds on the sacrificing a bull to this god. We find in Athenaeus also, that this sacrificing to the god of flies at the Olympic games was a constant custom. Some distinguish these two deities, and tell us that the latter or Myiodes, used to visit the nations in vengeance, with a vast multitude of flies; and that, on paying him the due honours of a sacrifice, they all went away again; and this seems to agree with what Pliny tells us in some places.\n\nAt the time of the Olympic games, Jupiter was worshipped under the name of Apomynos or Myiagrus Deus, to supplicate the destruction of those troublesome creatures. This happened only once in many years, when the sacrifices were performed there; but the Eleans worshipped him continually under this name, to deprecate the vengeance of heaven, which usually sent, as they expressed it, an army of flies and other insects, toward the latter end of the summer, that infested the whole country with sickness and pestilence.","sp":179,"ep":180},{"h":"MYIODES DEUS","t":"in the heathen mythology, a name sometimes given to Hercules, but more frequently to Jupiter, to whom a bull was sacrificed, in order to make him propitious in driving away the flies that infested the Olympic games.\n\nMYL\u00c6, in Ancient Geography, a Greek city situated on an isthmus of a cognominal peninsula, on the north-east side of the island, Mylae, or Myleres, the people.

It was the capital of Hecatomnus king of Caria, and father of Mausolus. Pliny speaks of Menander king of Caria, and says that the Rhodians preferred with the greatest care his portrait painted by Apelles; but it was not in honour of this Menander that a Corinthian pillar was erected at Mylae, which still exists, and on which is to be seen the following inscription: \"The people erected this pillar in honour of Menander, the son of Uliades, and grandson of Euthydemus, the benefactor of his country, and whose ancestors rendered it great services also.\" Euthydemus, the grandfather of this Menander, lived in the time of Julius C\u00e6sar and Augustus. Caria was taken by Mithridates, and afterwards by Labienus, whose father had been one of C\u00e6sar's generals. Hybris, whose eloquence and valour deservedly entitled him to a distinguished rank among his countrymen, in vain encouraged them to make a most obstinate defence while it was besieged by the latter. He himself was obliged to yield to necessity, and to take refuge at Rhodes; but scarcely had the conqueror quitted the city, when Hybris returned, and restored liberty to his country.\u2014Not content with rendering it this service, he also destroyed the power of a dangerous citizen, whose riches and talents rendered him a necessary evil. Euthydemus, often banished, and as often recalled, always too powerful in a state the independence of which he threatened, saw his ambition checked by the zeal and activity of Hybris. The Romans left to Mylae that liberty of which it rendered itself so worthy, by the great efforts it made to preserve it. Pliny calls it Mylofa libera. Strabo informs us, that it was one of the most magnificent cities of antiquity, and one of those, the temples, porticoes, and other public monuments of which were highly admired. A quarry of white marble in the neighbourhood furnished it with abundance of materials for erecting these edifices.\u2014The Mylafians had two temples dedicated to Jupiter, one situated in the city, which was named Ophgo, and another built on a mountain, at the distance of 60 leagues. The latter was dedicated to Jupiter Stratius, Jupiter the Warrior. His statue, which was very ancient, inspired great veneration; people came from all quarters to implore his protection; and for the greater accommodation of his votaries a paved way was constructed, which reached from Mylae to this venerable fabric. This city is now called Melafio, and, according to Dr Chandler, is still a large place.\u2014The housetops are numerous, but chiefly of plaster, and mean, with trees interspersed. The air is accounted bad; and scorpions abound as anciently, entering often at the doors and windows, and lurking in the rooms. The plain is surrounded by lofty mountains, and cultivated. Round the town are ranges of broken columns, the remnants of porticoes, now with rubbish bounding the vineyards. A large portion of the plain is covered with scattered fragments, and with piers of ordinary aqueducts; besides inscriptions, mostly ruined and illegible. Some altars dedicated to Hecatomnus have been discovered. Of all the ancient temples which formerly ornamented this city, one only escaped the power of time, the blind zeal of the early Christians, and the barbarous superstition of the Mahometans. This monument was dedicated to Augustus and the divinity of Rome. When Pocock visited Melafio, it was perfect and entire; but at present no traces of it remain, except a few fragments, which have been employed to construct a Turkish mosque.","sp":180,"ep":180},{"h":"MYLOGLOSSUM","t":"in Anatomy.

The description of this genus having been omitted in its proper place under Botany, we shall here introduce a short account of it.\u2014The male calyx is monophyllous, strong, and parted into three laciniae of an oval shape, and ending in a point; it has no corolla.

They vary in number from three to twelve or thirteen.\u2014The female calyx and corolla as in the male, on a distinct tree. The germen of an oval shape; the style short, with a bird stigma, the laciniae of which are oval and spreading.\u2014The fruit is of that sort called drupa. It is fleshy, roundish, sometimes unicellular, sometimes bivalved, and bursts when ripe at the side. The seed is enveloped with a fleshy and fatty membranous substance which divides into filaments (this, in one of the species, is the mace of the thops). The seed or nutmeg is round or oval shaped, unicellular, and contains a small kernel, variegated on the surface by the fibres running in the form of a crown.\n\nSpecies.\u2014There are five species of this genus according to some authors; but several of these being only varieties, may be reduced to three, viz:\n\n1. Myristica fatua, or wild nutmeg: this grows in Tobago, and rises to the height of an apple-tree; has oblong, lanceolate, downy leaves, and hairy fruit;\u2014the nutmeg of which is aromatic, but when given inwardly is narcotic, and occasions drunkenness, delirium, and madness, for a time.\n\n2. The myristica sebifera, (Virela Sebifera Aublet, page 904, tab. 345.) a tree frequent in Guiana, rising to 40 or even to 60 feet high; on winding the trunk of which, a thick, acrid, red juice runs out. Aublet says nothing of the nutmegs being aromatic; he only observes, that a yellow fat is obtained from them, which Myristica serves many economical and medical purposes, and that the natives make candles of it.\n\n3. The myristica molchata, or nutmeg, rises to the height of 30 feet, producing numerous branches; the bark of the trunk is of a reddish brown, but that of the young branches is of a bright green colour: the leaves are nearly elliptical, pointed, undulated, obliquely nerved, on the upper side of a bright green, on the under whitish, and stand alternately upon footstalks: the flowers are small, and hang upon slender peduncles, proceeding from the axilae of the leaves: they are both male and female upon separate trees.\n\nM. Schwartz, who has carefully examined this as well as the two first species, preserved in spirits, places them among the monadelphia.\n\nThe nutmeg has been supposed to be the comacum of Theophratus, but there seems little foundation for this opinion; nor can it with more probability be thought to be the chrysobalanos of Galen. Our first knowledge of it was evidently derived from the Arabs; by Avicenna it was called jiaufiban, or jayfiband, which signifies nut of Banda. Rumphius both figured and described this tree; but the figure given by him is so imperfect, and the description so confused, that Linnaeus, who gave it the generic name myristica, was unable to assign its proper characters. M. Lamarck informs us, that he received several branches of the myristica, both in flower and fruit, from the Isle of France, where a nutmeg-tree, which was introduced by Monsieur Poivre in 1770, is now very large, and continually producing flowers and fruit. From these branches, which were sent from Mons. Cere, director of the king's garden in that island, Lamarck has been enabled to describe and figure this and other species of the myristica.

Distilled with water, they yield a large quantity of essential oil, resembling in flavour the spice itself; after the distillation an insipid febraceous matter is found swimming on the water; the decoction insipidated, gives an extract of an unctuous, very lightly bitterish taste, and with little or no attraction. Rectified spirit extracts the whole virtue of nutmegs by infusion, and elevates very little of it in distillation; hence the spirituous extract palliates the flavour of the spice in an eminent degree.\n\nNutmegs, when heated, yield to the press a considerable quantity of limpid yellow oil, which on cooling concretes into a sebaceous consistence. In the shops we meet with three sorts of unctuous substances, called oil of mace, though really expressed from the nutmeg. The best is brought from the East Indies in stone jars; this is of a thick consistence, of the colour of mace,\nMyr\n\nMylia, mace, and has an agreeable fragrant smell; the second sort, which is paler coloured, and much inferior in quality, comes from Holland in solid masses, generally flat, and of a square figure: the third, which is the worst of all, and usually called common oil of mace, is an artificial composition of sevum, palm oil, and the like, flavoured with a little genuine oil of nutmeg.\n\nMethod of gathering and preparing Nutmeg.\u2014When the fruit is ripe the natives ascend the trees, and gather it by pulling the branches to them with long hooks. Some are employed in opening them immediately, and in taking off the green shell or first rind, which is laid together in a heap in the woods, where in time putrefies. As soon as the putrefaction has taken place, there springing up a kind of mushrooms called boleti mycetyni, of a blackish colour, and much valued by the natives, who consider them as delicate eating. When the nuts are stripped of their first rind, they are carried home, and the mace is carefully taken off with a small knife. The mace, which is of a beautiful red, but afterwards assumes a darkish or reddish colour, is laid to dry in the sun for the space of a day, and is then removed to a place less exposed to the rays, where it remains for eight days, that it may soften a little. They afterwards moisten it with sea water, to prevent it from drying too much, or from losing its oil. They are careful, however, not to employ too much water, lest it should become putrid, and be devoured by the worms. It is last of all put into small bags, and squeezed very close.\n\nThe nuts which are still covered with their ligneous shell, are for three days exposed to the sun, and afterwards dried before a fire till they emit a sound when they are shaken; they then beat them with small sticks in order to remove their shell, which flies off in pieces. These nuts are distributed into three parcels; the first of which contains the largest and most beautiful, which are destined to be brought to Europe; the second contains such as are reserved for the use of the inhabitants; and the third contains the smallest, which are irregular or unripe. These are burnt; and part of the rest is employed for procuring oil by pressure. A pound of them commonly gives three ounces of oil, which has the consistence of tallow, and has entirely the taste of nutmeg. Both the nut and mace, when distilled, afford an essential, transparent, and volatile oil, of an excellent flavour.\n\nThe nutmegs which have been thus selected would soon corrupt if they were not watered, or rather pickled, with lime-water made from calcined shell fish, which they dilute with salt water till it attains the consistence of fluid pap. Into this mixture they plunge the nutmegs, contained in small baskets, two or three times, till they are completely covered over with the liquor. They are afterwards laid in a heap, where they heat, and lose their superfluous moisture by evaporation. When they have sweated sufficiently, they are then properly prepared, and fit for a sea voyage.\n\nIn the island of Banda, the fruit of the nutmeg tree is preserved entire in the following manner: When it is almost ripe, but previous to its opening, it is boiled in water and pierced with a needle. They next lay it in water to soak for ten days, till it has lost its four and sharp taste. They then boil it gently in a syrup of sugar, to which, if they wish it to be hard, a little lime is added. This operation is repeated for eight days, and each time the syrup is renewed. The fruit when thus preserved is put for the last time into a pretty thick syrup, and is kept in earthen pots closely shut.\n\nThese nuts are likewise pickled with brine or with vinegar; and when they intend to eat them, they first steep them in fresh water, and afterwards boil them in syrup of sugar, &c.\n\nUses.\u2014Nutmegs preserved entire are presented as dainties, and the inhabitants of India sometimes eat them when they drink tea. Some of them use nothing but the pulp; others likewise chew the mace; but they generally throw away the kernel, which is really the nutmeg. Many who perform sea voyages to the north chew this fruit every morning.\n\nThe medicinal qualities of nutmeg are supposed to be aromatic, anodyne, stomachic, and refrigerant; and with a view to the last mentioned effects, it has been much used in diarrhoeas and dysenteries.\n\nRemarks on the Trade of Nutmegs.\u2014Nutmeg trees grow in several islands in the eastern ocean. The wood pigeon of the Moluccas is unintentionally a great planter of these trees, and disseminates them in places where a nation, powerful by its commerce, thinks it for its interest that they should be rooted out and destroyed. The Dutch, whose unwearied patience can surmount the greatest obstacles, formerly appropriated to themselves the crop of nutmegs, as well as that of cloves and cinnamon, growing in the islands of Ternate, Ceylon, &c., either by right of conquest or by paying subsidies to the islanders, who find these much more profitable than the former produce of their trees. It is nevertheless true, that they have prevailed upon or compelled the inhabitants of the Moluccas to cut down and root out all the clove trees, which they have preserved only in the islands of Amboyna and Ternate, which are in a great measure subject to them. We know for certain, that the Dutch pay 18,000 rixdollars yearly to the king of Ternate, by way of tribute or gift, in order to recompense him for the loss of his clove trees in the other Molucca islands; and that they are moreover bound by treaty to take at 3\u00bdd. a pound, all the cloves brought by the natives of Amboyna to their magazines.\n\nThe Dutch had formerly immense and very rich magazines of these precious aromatics, both in India and Europe. It is said, that they had actually by them the produce of 16 years, and never supplied their neighbours with the last, but always with the oldest crop: in 1760 they sold what was laid up in 1744; and when they had too great a quantity of cloves, nutmeg, &c., in their magazines, they threw them into the sea, or destroyed them by burning. On the 10th of June 1760, M. Bomare saw at Amsterdam, near the Admiralty, a fire, the fuel of which was valued at 8,000,000 of livres; and as much was to be burned on the day following. The feet of the spectators were bathed in the essential oil of these substances; but no person was allowed to gather any of it, much less to take any of the spices which were in the fire.

They received their name from Myrmidon, a son of Jupiter and Eurymedusa, who married one of the daughters of \u00c6olus, son of Helen. His son Actor married \u00c6gina the daughter of \u00c6olous. He gave his name to his subjects, who dwelt near the river Peneus in Thessaly. According to some, the Myrmidons received their name from their having arisen from ants or pinfires, upon a prayer put up for that purpose by King \u00c6acus to Jupiter, after his kingdom had been depopulated by a severe pestilence. According to Strabo, they received it from their industry, because they imitated the diligence of the ants, and like them were indefatigable, and were continually employed in cultivating the earth.\n\nMyrmillones were gladiators of a certain kind at Rome, who fought against the Retiarii. Their arms were a sword, head-piece, and shield. On the top of the head-piece they wore a fimb embossed, called Maguages, whence their name is by some supposed to be derived. The Retiarii, in their engagements, made use of a net, in which they endeavoured to entangle their adversaries; and sung during the fight, \"Non te peto, piceem peto; guid me fugis, Galle?\" \"I aim not at thee, but I aim at thy fish; why dost thou flout me, O Gaul?\" The Myrmillones were called Galli, because they wore Gallic armour. They were also named Scutores. This kind of gladiators was suppressed by Caligula. See Gladiators, Retiarii, &c.\n\nMyrobalan, a kind of medicinal fruit brought from the Indies, of which there are five kinds. 1. The citrine, of a yellowish red colour, hard, oblong, and the size of an olive. 2. The black or Indian myrobalan, of the bigness of an acorn, wrinkled, and without a stone. 3. Chebulic myrobalan, which are of the size of a date, pointed at the end, and of a yellowish brown. 4. Emblic, which are round, rough, the size of gall, and of a dark brown. 5. Balleric, which are hard, round, of the size of an ordinary prune, less angular than the rest, and yellow. They are all slightly purgative and astringent. The word comes from the Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \"ointment,\" and \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2, \"acorn,\" as being in the form of acorns, and used in medicine.\n\nMyron, an excellent Grecian statuary, flourished 442 B.C.

They aromatized their most delicious wines with it; and it was presented as a very valuable perfume to our Lord while he lay in the manger.\n\nIt was this gum also which was mingled with the wine given him to drink at his passion, to deaden his pains, and produce a stupor. (See Mark xv. 23.) The gall mentioned on the same occasion by St Matthew is probably the same with myrrh; for any thing bitter was usually distinguished by the name of gall. The Hebrews were accustomed to give those that were executed some stupefying draught. The difficulty which arises from the seeming difference betwixt the two evangelists, by some is solved by saying, that St Matthew, writing in Syriac, made use of the word marra, which signifies \"myrrh, bitternes, or gall;\" but the Greek translator has taken it for gall, and St Mark for myrrh. Others think that our Saviour's drink was mingled with myrrh as a stupefying drug; but suppose that the soldiers out of wanton cruelty and inhumanity, infused gall; which was the reason, say they, why, when he had tasted, he refused to drink.\n\nMyrrhine, or Murrine.

It was intended for the instruction and edification of all ranks of men; and of consequence its doctrines were on a level with vulgar capacities. The Jewish dispensation was openly practised; nothing was performed in secret; every article was plain, open, and accessible. The divine Author of the Christian economy commanded his disciples to preach his doctrine in the most public manner: \"What ye have heard in secret (says he) preach openly; and what I have taught you in private teach ye publicly, and proclaim it on the house tops.\" Such are the charms of truth, and such the character of that religion which came down from heaven, that they, as it were, \"delight, and lift up their voice in the streets, and cry in the chief places of concourse.\"\n\nBut such is the depravity of the nature of man, that the noblest institutions degenerate in his hands. Religion itself, originally pure, simple, and amiable, under his management has often been transformed into pollution, perplexity, and deformity. The ministers of religion, whose province it was to guard the sacred deposit, and to secure it from foreign and spurious intermixtures, have generally been the first innovators, and the first and most industrious agents in corrupting its integrity and tarnishing its beauty. Avarice and ambition prompted that class of men to deviate from the original pliancy and simplicity of religious institutions, and to introduce articles, rites, and usages, which might furnish them with opportunities of gratifying these unhallowed and insatiable passions. Hence distinctions unknown to pure and undefiled religion were fabricated; and that heavenly institution, heretofore one, simple, indivisible, was divided into two partitions: the one popular and public; the other dark, secret, and mysterious. The latter of these we intend as the subject of this article.\n\nThe English word mystery is derived from the Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd; and in its modern acceptation imports something above human intelligence, something awfully obscure and enigmatical; anything artfully made difficult; the secret of any business or profession. The word is often used by the founder of the Christian religion, and more frequently by his apostles, especially St Paul. In these cases, it generally signifies those doctrines of Christianity which the Jews, prior to the advent of the Messiah, either did not or could not understand. The Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity; the incarnation of the Son of God; the union of two natures in one and the same person, &c. We generally call mysteries, because they are infinitely above human comprehension. All these significations are out of the question at present. Our intention in this article is Object of to lay before our readers the fullest and fairest account this article, we have been able to collect, of those \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1, or secret rites, of the Pagan superstition, which were carefully concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar, and which are universally known under the denomination of mysteries.\n\nThe word \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd is evidently deduced from \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd; but the origin of this last term is not altogether so obvious. The etymologies of it exhibited by the learned are various; some of them absurd and inconceivable, others foolish and futile. Instead of fatiguing our readers with a detail of these, which would be equally unentertaining and uninteresting, we shall only produce one, which to us appears to come nearest the truth. The mysteries under consideration at present were certainly imported into Greece from the east. In those regions, then, we ought of course to look for the etymology of the word. \u05de\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05e8, or misfur, in Hebrew, signifies \"any place or thing hidden or concealed.\" As this word implies a kind of definition of the nature of the thing intended, and as it is one of the excellencies of original languages to apply vocables with this propriety, we find ourselves strongly inclined to assign the word misfur as the root of the term \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, mystery.\n\nWe have already observed, that the avarice and ambition of the Pagan priesthood probably gave birth to the introduction of the mysteries. To this observation we may now add, that the ministers of that superstition might possibly imagine, that some articles of their ritual were too profound to be comprehended by the vulgar; others, too sacred to be communicated to a description of men, whom the institutions of civil society had placed in a situation not only subordinate but even contemptible. It was imagined, that things sacred and venerable would have contracted a taint and pollution by an intercourse with fond and untutored souls. These appear to us the most probable motives for making that odious and pernicious distinction between the popular religion and that contained in the sacred and mysterious ritual.\n\nThe learned Bishop Warburton is positive, that the mysteries of the Pagan religion were the invention of legislators* and other great personages, whom fortune or their own merit had placed at the head of those civil societies which were formed in the earliest ages in different parts of the world. It is with reluctance, and indeed\nindeed with diffidence, that we presume to differ in our sentiments from such respectable authority. Whatever hypothesis this prelate had once adopted, so extensive was his reading, and so exuberant his intellectual resources, that he found little difficulty in defending it by an appearance of plausibility, if not of rational argumentation. The large quotations he has adduced from Plato and Cicero, do indeed prove that the sages and legislators of antiquity sometimes availed themselves of the influence derived from the doctrines of the mysteries, and from the authority they acquired by the opinion of their having been initiated in them; but that those men were the inventors and fabricators of them is a position for which his quotations do not furnish the most slender presumption. At the same time, we think it not altogether certain, that the doctrine of a divine Providence, and a future state of rewards and punishments, were revealed in the mysteries with all the clearness and cogency which is pretended by his Lordship.\n\nBut granting that the fabric was raised by the hands of sages and legislators, we imagine it would be rather difficult to discover what emolument that description of men could propose to derive from the enterprise.\u2014The institution was evidently, and indeed confessedly, devised to conceal from the million those very doctrines and maxims, which had been known and embraced them, would have contributed most effectually to dispose them to submit to those wise regulations which their governors and legislators wished most ardently to establish. Experience has taught, that nothing has a more commanding influence on the minds of the vulgar, than those very dogmas, which, according to the Bishop, were communicated to the initiated. A conviction of the unity of the Deity, of his wisdom, power, goodness, omnipresence, &c., the steady belief of the immortality of the human soul, and of a future state of rewards and punishments, have in all ages, and in all countries, proved the firmest supports of legal authority. The very same doctrines, in the dawn of Christianity, contributed, of all other methods, the most effectually to tame and civilize the savage (A) inhabitants of the northern regions of Europe. Supposing those principles to have been inculcated by the mysteries, the most prudent plan legislators could have adopted, would have been to publish them to all mankind. They ought to have sent forth apostles to preach them to the savages whom they had undertaken to civilize. According to the learned prelate, they pursued the opposite course, and deprived themselves of those very arms by which they might have encountered and overthrown all the armies of vagrism.\n\nOf all the legislators of antiquity, the Cretan alone was prudent enough to see and adopt this rational plan. Diodorus the Sicilian informs us*, that the mysteries of Eleusis, Samothracea, &c., which were elsewhere buried in profound darkness, were among the Cretans taught publicly, and communicated to all the world. Minos, however, was a successful legislator; and his intercourse with Jupiter Ideus extended his influence and established his authority. He was not under the necessity of calling in the mysteries to his assistance: on the contrary, it is highly probable that the universal knowledge of the doctrines of the mysteries among his countrymen, contributed in a considerable degree to facilitate his labour, and ensure his success.\n\nThe divine Author of the Christian economy, viewed in the light of a human legislator, saw the propriety of this procedure. Nothing was concealed in his institutions; nothing was veiled with mystery, or buried in darkness. The success was answerable to the wisdom of the plan. The million flocked to the evangelical standard: the gospel was preached to the poor, to the illiterate and the vulgar; and the meanest of mankind eagerly embraced its maxims. Wherever it prevailed, it produced civilization, morality, sobriety, loyalty, and every other private and social virtue.\u2014Upon the supposition that the mysteries had contained and inculcated the principles and practices which the prelate supposes they did, the civilizers of mankind, legislators, magistrates, and princes, ought to have combined to make them public for the sake of their own tranquillity, and the more effectual support of their authority and influence.\n\nUpon the whole, we are inclined to believe that the mysteries were the offspring of Egyptian priesthood. They were instituted with a view to aggrandize the Egyptian order of men, to extend their influence, and enlarge priesthood; their revenues. To accomplish those selfish projects, but they applied every engine towards befogging the multitude with superstition and enthusiasm. They taught them to believe, that themselves were the distinguished favourites of heaven; and that celestial doctrines had been revealed to them, too holy to be communicated to the profane rabble, and too sublime to be comprehended by vulgar capacities. It is, we confess, exceedingly probable, that after the mysteries were instituted, and had acquired an exalted reputation in the world, legislators, magistrates, judges, and potentates, joined in the imposture, with the same views and from the same principles. Princes and legislators, who found their advantage in overpowering and humbling the multitude, readily adopted a plan which they found to be artfully fabricated to answer these very purposes. They had interest enough with the sacerdotal (B) mystagogues, to induce them to allow them to participate in those venerable rites which had already established the authority of that description of men in whose hands they were deposited. The views of both parties were exactly congenial. The respect, the admiration, and dependance on the million, were the ultimate objects of their ambition respectively.\u2014Priests and princes were actuated by the very same spirit. The combination was advantageous, and of consequence harmonious. For these reasons we have taken the liberty of differing from his Lordship of Gloucester with respect\n\n(A) The Germans, Russians, and Scandinavians, who were never thoroughly civilized till the gospel was preached among them.\n\n(B) The mystagogues were the ministers who acted the chief part in celebrating the mysteries.\nto the persons who first instituted the secret mysteries of the Pagan religion.\n\nAnother writer, of considerable reputation in the republic of letters, is of opinion, that the mysteries were entirely commemorative; that they were instituted with a view to preserve the remembrance of heroes and great men, who had been deified in consideration of their martial exploits, useful inventions, public virtues, and especially in consequence of the benefits by them conferred on their contemporaries.\u2014According to him, the (c) mysteries of Mithras were established for this very purpose. It would be no difficult matter to prove that the Persian deity of that name was the sun, and that his name and insignia jointly ascertain the truth of this assertion. The same writer extends this observation to the mysteries of the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Greeks, Hetrucans; and in a word, to all the institutions of that species throughout the world. In opposition to this singular opinion, it may be argued, we think with some show of reason, that the method of preserving the memory of great and illustrious men generally adopted, was the establishing festivals, celebrating games, offering sacrifices, singing hymns, dances, &c. We can recollect no secret mysteries instituted for that purpose at least in their original intention. If any usage of the commemorative kind was admitted, it was superinduced at some period posterior to the primary institution. At the same time, upon the supposition that the orgia of Bacchus were the same with those of the Egyptian Osiris, and that the mysteries of Ceres exhibited at Eleusis were copied from those of the Egyptian Isis, and allowing that the former was the sun, and the latter the moon; it will be difficult to find out the human persons whose exploits, adventures, inventions, &c. were intended to be immortalized by those institutions. Upon the whole, the mysteries were performed in secret; they were intended to be communicated only to a few; of course, had they been instituted with a view to immortalize the memory of heroes and great men, the authors would have acted the most foolish and inconsistent part imaginable.\u2014Instead of transmitting the fame of their heroes with eclat to posterity, they would by this procedure have consigned it to eternal oblivion.\n\nWe must then recur to our first position. The mysteries were the offspring of bigotry and priesthood; they originated in Egypt, the native land of idolatry. In that country the priesthood ruled predominant. The kings were engrafted into their body before they could ascend the throne. They were possessed of a third part* of all the land of Egypt. The sacerdotal function was confined to one tribe, and was transmitted unalienably from father to son. All the orientals, but more especially the Egyptians, delighted in mysterious and allegorical doctrines. Every maxim of morality, every tenet of theology, every dogma of philosophy, was wrapped up in a veil of allegory and mysticism. This propensity, no doubt, conspired with avarice and ambition to dispose them to a dark and mysterious system of religion. Besides, the Egyptians were a gloomy\u2020 race of men; they delight in darkness and solitude. Their sacred rites were generally celebrated with melancholy airs, weeping, and lamentation. This gloomy and unioial bias of mind must have stimulated them to a congenial mode of worship. In Egypt then we are to search for the origin of the mysteries. Both the nature of the institution and the genius of the people confirm this position; and historians, both ancient and modern, are agreed in admitting the certainty of the fact.\n\nThe Osiris of Egypt, everybody knows, was the original Bacchus; as the Isis of the same country was the Ceres of the Greeks. The rites of Osiris were performed with loud shrieks and lamentations when and Ceres he was put into the coffin; and with the most extravagant mirth, when he was in a manner raised from the dead, or supposed to be found again. Their hymns were upon the whole always composed in melancholy affecting strains; and consisted of lamentations for the loss of Osiris, the mystic flight of Bacchus, the wanderings of Isis, and the sufferings\u2020 of the gods. The Canaanites, who were a kindred tribe of the Mizraim et Qfr. or Egyptians, imitated them in their sacred rites. At Byblus, Berytus, Sidon, and afterwards at Tyre, they used particularly mournful dirges for the death of Adonis or Tammuz \u00a7, who was the same with the Egyptian Dionysius, i.e. the sun.\n\nThe Egyptians, then, naturally inclined to gloom of death and secrecy, instituted a mode of worship congenial with their natural disposition of mind. The recesses of Isis' fun towards the southern hemisphere, was the death* of Osiris; the wanderings of Isis in search of her husband and brother, allegorically imported the longing of the earth\u2020 for the return of the fructifying\u2021 influences of the solar heat.\n\nWhen that luminary returned towards the summer solstice, and grain, trees, fruits, herbs, and flowers adorned the face of nature, another festival was celebrated of a very different complexion from that of the former. In this season all Egypt was dissolved in the most extravagant mirth and jollity. During the celebration of those festivals, the priests performed allegorical representations of the sun and the earth (p). They personified the one and the other, and allegorized their motions, aspects, relations, sympathies, accesses, recesses, &c. into real adventures, peregrinations, sufferings, contests, battles, victories, defeats, and so forth. These, in process of time, were held up to the vulgar as real occurrences; and these in a few ages became the most essential articles of the popular creed. From this source were derived the conquests of Dionysus or Bacchus, so beautifully exhibited by Nonnus in his Dionysiaca;\n\n---\n\n(c) Principio hoc ego quidem controveria vacare, arbitror, mysteria quae vocantur, ritus suisse idcirco institutos ne memoria veterum beneficiorum, inventorum, fatorum rerum gellarum quibus primi populorum conditores, aut aliis praclaris homines, decus nomen, et famam, inter suos sibi comparaverant.

Jablonski has taken much pains to prove the negative. Diodorus affirms us, that they paid their monarchs a kind of divine adoration, even in their lifetime. Plutarch tells us plainly, that some were of opinion that Isis, Osiris, Horus, Anubis, Typhon, were once mortal persons, who were exalted into demons after their death. The Sicilian, in his history of Isis and Osiris, Pan, Hermes, &c., plainly represents them as human personages; and informs us, that the Egyptians imagined, that after their decease they transmigrated into particular stars. From these authorities, we are inclined to believe that the Egyptians, as well as the other Pagans, did actually deify persons who had distinguished themselves in their days of nature by prowess, wisdom, useful arts, and inventions. This was a constant practice among the Greeks, who probably learned it from the people in question.\n\nThe exploits of these heroes had been disguised by allegorical traditions and hieroglyphical representations. They had been magnified beyond all dimensions, in order to astonish and intimidate the vulgar. They had been interlarded with the most extravagant fables, in order to gratify their propensity towards the marvelous. All these secrets were developed in the mysteries. The catechumens (E) were informed of every particular relating to the birth, the life, the exploits, the adventures, the misfortunes, and decease of those heroic personages, and when, and by what means, they had attained to the high rank of divinities. At the same time we think it highly probable, that those demi-gods were represented in their state of exaltation and heavenly splendour. The magicians of Egypt were abundantly qualified for exhibiting angels in machines. The souls of virtuous men, who had not been eminent enough to merit the honour of deification, were shown in all the perfection of Elysian felicity; and perhaps the souls of tyrants, and of the children of Typhon, were shown in Tartarus, suffering all the extremes of infernal punishment. From these exhibitions the mystagogues might naturally enough take occasion to read their pupils suitable lectures on the happy tendency of a virtuous conduct, and the dishonour and misery consequent upon a contrary course. They might set before them immortal renown, deification, and Elysium, on the one hand, and eternal infamy and misery on the other. This will probably be deemed the chief advantage accruing from this institution.\n\nBesides the communications above mentioned, the catechumens were taught many secrets of physiology, or the nature of the phenomena of the world. This Pharmutus everywhere affirms, especially in his last book towards the end. Plutarch too informs us, that many of the Greek philosophers were of opinion, that most of the Egyptian fables were allegorical details of physical operations. Eusebius acquaints us, that the physiology, not only of the Greeks, but likewise of the barbarians, was nothing else but a kind of science of nature, a concealed and dark theology, involved in fable and fiction, whose hidden mysteries were veiled over with enigmas and allegories, that the ignorant million were as little capable of comprehending what was said as what was suppressed in silence. This, says he, is apparent from the poems of Orpheus and the fables of the Phrygians and Egyptians. Dionysius of Halicarnassus likewise observes, that the fables of the Greeks detail the operations of nature by allegories. Proclus makes the same observation concerning the people in question. The Egyptians, says he, taught the latent operations of nature by fables.\n\nThese physiological secrets were no doubt expounded to the initiated; and that the Egyptian priests were deeply skilled in physiological science, can scarce be questioned, if we believe that James and Jambres stories of valued Moses with their enchantments. The preceding Egyptian detail comprehends all that was revealed to the Egyptian in the original Egyptian mysteries. What articles might have been introduced afterwards we cannot pretend to determine.\n\nBe that as it may, one thing is certain, namely, that the vulgar were excluded from all those choice secrets, which were carefully reserved for the nobility and sacerdotal tribes. To them it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of darkness; but to those who were without, all was mystery and parable. While the laity fed on husks, the clergy and the quality feasted on royal dainties. The priests who had devised these allegories understood their original import, and bequeathed it as an inestimable legacy to their children. Here then we have the primary object of the mysteries, namely, to convey to the initiated the original and rational import of those allegorical and mystical doctrines which were tendered to the uninitiated, wrapped up in impenetrable allegory and obscurity. To the former, these were communicated and explained: The latter were obliged to stand at an awful distance, and retire as the Procul, O procul eft profani, thundered in their ears.\n\nThese allegorical traditions originated in Egypt. (See Mythology.) It was the general bias of the oriental genius. The Egyptians, however, according to the most authentic accounts (G), were the greatest proficient in that science. The original subject of these institutions were, we imagine, the articles we have specified above: but in process of time, according to the natural course of things, numerous improvements were made, and many new rites, ceremonies, usages, and even doctrines, were superinduced, which were utterly unknown to the original hierophants (H). Simplicity is, for\n\n(E) Catechumens were pupils who were learning the elements of any science.\n(F) Typhon was the evil genius, or devil, of the Egyptians.\n(G) As early as the age of Joseph, the Egyptians were skilled in the interpretations of dreams, divinations, &c., and in the age of Moses they were become wise men, magicians, &c.\n(H) Hierophant imports a priest employed in explaining the doctrines, rites, &c., communicated to the initiated.\nfor the most part, one of the distinguishing characters of a new intuition; but succeeding architects generally imagine that something is still wanting to complete the beauty, the regularity, the uniformity, the magnificence, and perhaps the conveniency of the structure. Hence, at length, it comes to be so overloaded with adventitious drapery, that its primary elegance and symmetry are altogether defaced. This was the case with the earliest Egyptian mysteries. Their subject was at first simple and easy to be comprehended; in time it became complex, intricate, and unintelligible.\n\nIn order to celebrate these mysteries with the greater secrecy, their temples were so constructed as to favour the artifice of the priests. The fanes, in which they used to execute their sacred functions, and to perform the rites and ceremonies of their religion, were subterranean apartments, constructed with such wonderful skill and dexterity, that every thing that appeared in them breathed an air of solemn secrecy. Their walls were covered with hieroglyphic paintings and sculpture, and the altar was situated in the centre of the apartment. Modern travellers have of late years discovered some vestiges of them, and bear witness to the above description of those dark abodes (1). In those subterranean mansions, which the priests of that ingenious nation had planned with the most consummate skill, the kings, princes, and great men of the state, encountered the dangers and hardships contrived to prove their prudence, fortitude, patience, abstinence, &c. These were appointed to try their merit; and by these the hierophants were enabled to decide whether or not they were duly qualified for receiving that benefit. Upon these occasions, we may believe, abundance of those magical tricks were exhibited, for which the magicians of Egypt were so much celebrated among the ancients. The strange and astonishing sights, the alternate successions of light and darkness, the hideous spectres exposed to view, the frightful howlings echoed by these internal domes, the scenes of Tartarus and Elysium, exhibited alternately and in quick succession, must have made a deep and lasting impression on the mind of the affrighted votary (K). These scenes we shall describe more fully in the sequel.\n\nFrom the scenes exhibited in celebrating the Egyptian mysteries, especially those of Isis and Osiris, the Greeks seem to have copied their ideas of the infernal regions, and the subterranean mansions of departed souls. Many colonies of Egyptians settled in Greece. From these the muses (L), or most early bards of Greece, learned them imperfectly. Of course, we find Homer's account of the infernal regions, and of the state of departed souls, lame and incoherent. Succeeding bards obtained more full and more distinct information. Euripides and Aristophanes seem to have paved the way for the prince of Roman poets, Plato, and some of the other philosophers have shown by their descriptions or allusions, that the whole apparatus of Tartarus and Elysium had become a hackneyed topic some centuries before Virgil was born. This incomparable poet borrowed his ideas from Homer, Ariosto, Euripides, Plato, &c. These, under his platonic hand, in the sixth Aeneid, grew into a system beautiful, regular, uniform, and confluent. The materials he has employed were created to his hand; he had only to collect, polish, arrange, and connect them.\u2014The sentiments collected from the Platonic philosophy, and the inimitable episode copied from the annals of Rome, by the masterly skill which he has displayed in the application of them, form the chief excellencies of the piece. For the rest, he could well dispense with going to Eleusis (M); every old woman in Athens and Rome could repeat them.\n\nEgypt was then the native land of mysteries as well as of idolatry. Every god and goddess respectively brought had their mysteries; but as those of Isis and Osiris were the most celebrated, they of course became principal objects of pursuit as well as of imitation to the neighbouring nations. These, as is generally believed, were carried into Persia by Zoroastres, or Zerdusht, by whom they were consecrated to Mithras. On these we shall make some observations in the sequel.\u2014Orpheus imported them into Thrace; Cadmus brought them into Boeotia, where they were sacred to Bacchus. Inachus established them at Argos in honour of Juno, the same with Isis (N); Cyniras in Cyprus, where they were dedicated to Venus. In Phrygia they were sacred to Cybele, the mother of the gods.\n\nOur learned readers, who will probably reflect that the Egyptians were in ancient times inhospitable to strangers, will perhaps be surprized that this factious and jealous people were so ready to communicate the arcana of their religion to foreigners.\u2014But they will please recollect, that a great part of Greece was planted with colonies from Egypt, Phoenicia, Palestine, &c. This we could easily prove, did the bounds prescribed us admit such a digression. Orpheus, if not an Egyptian, was at least of oriental extraction. Inachus, Cadmus, and Melampus, are universally allowed to have been Egyptians. Erechtheus, in whose reign the Eleusinian mysteries were established, was an Egyptian by birth, or at least sprung from Egyptian ancestors. The Egyptians, then, in those early ages, did not view the Greeks in the light of aliens, but as a people nearly related either to themselves or the Phoenicians, who were their brethren. Upon this connexion we imagine it was, that in later times most of the sages of Greece,\n\n---\n\n(1) See an excellent description of these subterraneous abodes, and of the process of probation carried on there, in a French romance, entitled The Life of Sethos.\n\n(K) Persons who had descended into Trophonius's vault were said to have been so terrified with shocking sights, that they never laughed during the remainder of their lives.\n\n(L) These were itinerant poets like our minstrels, who frequented the houses of the great men of Greece, and entertained the company upon public occasions with singing and tales of other times.\n\n(M) Bishop Warburton has, with much ingenuity, and a vast profusion of reading, endeavoured to prove that Virgil borrowed the whole scenery of the sixth Aeneid from the sources mentioned in the text.\n\n(N) Isis was the moon, and the original Juno was the same planet.\nGreece, especially of Athens, found so hospitable a reception among that people. They probably viewed them in the light of propagandists; apostles able and willing to disseminate their idolatrous rites. This observation, which might be supported by numberless authorities, did the nature of the present inquiry permit, will, we think, go a great way towards obviating the objection.\n\nAlthough, as has been observed, every particular deity had his own peculiar mysterious sacred rites, yet of all others those of Mithras, Bacchus (o), and Ceres, were deemed the most august, and were most universally and most religiously celebrated. To these, therefore, we shall in a good measure confine ourselves upon this occasion. If our readers shall become intimately acquainted with these, they may readily dispense with the knowledge of the rest, which are, indeed, no more than streams and emanations from these sources. We shall then, in the first place, present to our readers a brief sketch of the mysteries of Mithras.\n\nMithras, or, according to the Persian, Mihr, was one of the great gods of the Avestics. His worship was for many ages confined to Persia. Afterwards, however, it was propagated far and wide, that some have imagined they had discovered vestiges of it even in Gaul. Mihr, according to Dr Hyde, signifies love, and likewise the sun. If we might presume to differ from so respectable an authority, we should conjecture that it is a cognate of the Hebrew word mithir, \"excellence, praetantia.\" That there was an analogy between the Hebrew and old Persian, is generally admitted by the learned. Be that as it may, Mithras was the fun (p) among the Persians; and in honour of that luminary this institution was established. Mithras, according to Plutarch (q), was the middle god between Oramaz and Ariaman, the two supreme divinities of Persia. But the fact is, the solar planet was the visible emblem of Oramaz, the good genius of the Persian tribes, and the same with the Osiris of the Egyptians. From these people, some have imagined that Zoroastres (r), or Zerdusht, borrowed his mysteries of Mithras. To this opinion we cannot give our assent, because the probationary trials to be undergone by the candidates among the former were much more savage and sanguinary than among the latter. Both, however, were instituted in honour of the same deity; and probably the scenes exhibited, and the information communicated in both, were analogous; a circumstance which perhaps gave birth to the opinion above mentioned.\n\nThe grand festival of Mithras was celebrated six days, in the middle of the month Mehr (s). Upon these days, it was lawful for the kings of Persia to get drunk and dance. On this festival, we imagine, the candidates for initiation, having duly proved their vocation, were solemnly admitted to the participation of the mysteries.\n\nZoroastres (t) worshipped Mithras, or the Sun, in a certain natural cave, which he formed into a temple, and filled up in a manner exactly mathematical. There Mithras was represented as presiding over the lower world with all the pomp of royal magnificence. In it too were seen the symbols of Mithras and of the world, philosophically and mathematically exhibited, to be contemplated and worshipped. This deity was sometimes represented as mounted on a bull, which he is breaking, and which he kills with a sword. On some bas reliefs still existing, he appears as a young man with his tiara turned upward, after the manner of the Persian kings. He is clothed with a short tunic and breeches, after the Persian fashion. Sometimes he wears a small cloak. By his sides are seen other human figures, with tiaras of the same fashion on their heads, but without cloaks. One of these figures commonly holds in his one hand a torch lifted up; in the other, one turned downward. Sometimes over the cave are seen the chariots of the sun and moon, and divers constellations, such as cancer, scorpio, &c.\n\nIn one of these caves the ceremonies of initiation Probation were performed; but before the candidate could be any admitted, he was forced to undergo a course of probatory exercises, so numerous and so rigorous, that very few had courage and fortitude enough to go through them. He was obliged to live a life of virtue and abstinence for the space of seven years previous to the period of his initiation. Some months before it, he was obliged to submit to a long and austere fast, which continued fifty days. He was to retire several days to a deep and dark dungeon, where he was successively exposed to all the extremes of heat and cold. Meanwhile he frequently underwent the bastinado, which the priests applied without mercy. Some say this flogging continued two whole days, and was repeated no less than fifteen times. In the course of these probationary exercises, the candidate was generally reduced to a skeleton; and we are told, that there have been several instances of persons who have perished in the attempt.\n\nUpon the eve of the initiation, the aspirant was obliged to brace on his armour, in order to encounter the enemy.\n\n(o) Bacchus was the Osiris of the Egyptians, and Ceres was the Isis of the same people.\n(p) Mosheim, in his notes on Cudworth's Intellectual System, page 330, has taken much pains to prove that Mithras was a deified mortal; but we cannot agree with that learned man in this point.\n(q) Isis and Osiris, page 369. l. 20. from the bottom. This philosopher makes Zoroaster, according to some, 5000 years prior to the Trojan war. This date is certainly extravagant. We cannot, however, agree, with some moderns, who make him contemporary with Darius Hystaspes, the immediate successor of Cambyses, because it contradicts all antiquity.\n(r) M. Silohwette, Dider. v. page 17, asserts that Zoroaster was initiated among the Egyptians.\n(s) The month Mehr began September 30, and ended October 30.\n(t) See Dr Hyde de Rel. vet. Per. pages 16, 17. Mr Bryant's Anal. vol i. page 232. Porphyri. de Antro Nymph. page 254. This philosopher often mentions the cave of Mithras, and always attributes the institution of his rites to Zoroaster.\nMysteries.\n\nter giants and savage monsters. In those spacious subterraneous mansions a mock hunting was exhibited. The priests and all the subordinate officers of the temple, transformed into lions, tygers, leopards, boars, wolves, and other savage creatures, afflained him with loud howlings, roaring, and yelling, and every instance of ferine fury. In those mock combats, the hero was often in danger of being really worried, and always came off with bruises and wounds. Lampridius informs us, that when the emperor Commodus was initiated, he actually carried the joke too far, and butchered one of the priests who attacked him in the figure of a wild beast. The Persians worshipped Mithras or the Sun by a perpetual fire; hence the votary was obliged to undergo a fiery trial; that is, to pass seven times through the sacred fire, and each time to plunge himself into cold water. Some have made these probationary penances amount to so; others have thought that they were in all only 8. As we find no good authority for either of these numbers, we think ourselves at liberty to hazard the following conjecture: The number seven was deemed sacred over all the east. The Mithraic penances we imagine were either seven, or if they exceeded it, were regulated by seven repetitions of that number. The candidate having undergone all these torturing trials with becoming patience and fortitude, was declared a proper subject for initiation. But before his admission he was obliged to bind himself by the most solemn oath, with horrible imprecations annexed, never to divulge any single article of all that should be communicated to him in the course of his initiation.\n\nWhat \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 or ineffable secrets were imparted to the initiated, it is impossible at this distance of time to discover with any tolerable degree of certainty. We may, however, rest assured, that the most authentic tradition concerning the origin of the universe; the nature, attributes, perfections, and operations, of Ormazd; the baleful influences of Ariman; and the benign effects of the government of Mithras, were unfolded and inculcated. The secret phenomena of nature, as far as they had been discovered by the Magi, were likewise exhibited; and the application of their effects, to astonish and delude the vulgar, were taught both in theory and practice. The exercise of public and private virtues was warmly recommended; and vice represented in the most odious and frightful colours. Both these injunctions were, we may suppose, enforced by a display of the pleasures of Elysium and the pains of Tartarus, as has been observed above in describing the mysteries of the Egyptians.\n\nThose initiations are mentioned by Lampridius in the life of Commodus, and likewise by Justin \u2020 and Tertullian \u2021, who both flourished in the second century.\n\n\u2020 Dial. cum Tryphonie. \u2021 De praescript. adver. Hierar.\n\nThe last of these two speaks of a kind of baptism, which washed from the souls of the initiated all the stains which they had contracted during the course of their lives prior to their initiation. He at the same time mentions a particular mark which was imprinted upon them (v), of an offering of bread, and an emblem of the resurrection; which particulars, however, he does not describe in detail. In that offering, which was accompanied with a certain form of prayer, a vessel of water was offered up with the bread. The same father elsewhere informs us, that there was presented to the initiated a crown suspended on the point of a sword; but that they were taught to say, Mithras is my crown. By this answer was intimated, that they looked upon the service of that deity as their chief honour and ornament.\n\nAfter that the Teletee (x) were finished, the pupil was brought out of the cave or temple, and with great solemnity proclaimed a lion of Mithras (y); a title which imported strength and intrepid courage in the service of the deity. They were now consecrated to the god, and were supposed to be under his immediate protection; an idea which of course animated them to the most daring and dangerous enterprises.\n\nThe worship of Mithras was introduced into the Roman empire towards the end of the republic, where it made very rapid progress. When Christianity began to make a figure in the empire, the champions of paganism thought of proposing to men the worship of this power of benevolence, in order to counterbalance or annihilate that worship, which the Christians paid to Jesus Christ the true Sun of righteousness. But this mode was soon abolished, together with the other rites of paganism. The Persian grandees often affected names compounded with Mithras; hence Mithridates, Mithrobarzanes, &c. Hence, too, the precious stone called Mithridat \u2020, which by the reflection of the sun \u2020 Selenus, sparkled with a variety of colours. There is likewise cap. 10, a certain pearl of many different colours, which they call Mithras. It is found among the mountains near the Red sea; and when exposed to the sun, it sparkles with a variety of dyes. We find likewise a king of Egypt of that name, who reigned at Heliopolis; who being commanded in a dream to erect an obelisk to the solar deity, reared a most prodigious one in the neighbourhood of that city.\n\nThe votaries of Mithras pretended that he was sprung from a rock, and that therefore the place where the sprung from a mysterious ceremonies were communicated to the initiated was always a cave. Many different reasons have been assigned for the origin of this rock-born deity, most of which appear to us unsatisfactory. If our readers will be obliging enough to accept of a simple and obvious conjecture, they may take the following:\n\n(u) In allusion to this practice of imprinting a sacred mark, probably on the forehead of the initiated, we find the injunction to the angel, Ezek. chap. ix. ver. 4. and the Revelation palium.\n\n(x) The mysteries were called Teletee, which imports, \"the rites which confer perfection.\"\n\n(y) Tertull. adv. Marc. p. 55. The priests of Mithras were called the lions of Mithras, and his priestesses lionesses; some say hyenas. The other inferior ministers were called eagles, hawks, ravens, &c., and on their festivals they wore masks corresponding to their titles, after the Egyptian manner, where the priests appeared at the ceremonies with masks resembling the heads of lions, apes, dogs, &c., a circumstance which furnishes a presumption that the mysteries of Mithras were of Egyptian original.\nA rock is the symbol of strength and stability (z); the dominion of Mithras, in the opinion of his votaries, was firm as a rock, and stable as the everlasting hills. If our readers should not admit the probability of this conjecture, we would beg leave to remit them to the learned Mr Bryant's Analysis of Mythology, where they will find this point discussed with deep research and wonderful ingenuity. Whatever may have been the origin of this opinion with relation to the birth of Mithras, it is certain that some reverence to rocks and caves was kept up a long time even after the establishment of Christianity. Hence the prohibition given to some of the profane to that religion, that they should no more presume to offer up their prayers ad petrae, at the rocks (A).\n\nWe shall conclude our account of the mysteries of Mithras, with a passage from M. Anquetil, to whom we are so much indebted for what knowledge we have of the Persian theology, and in which the functions of that deity are briefly and comprehensively delineated.\n\n\"The peculiar functions of Mithras are to fight continually against Ahriman and the impure army of evil genii, whose constant employment is to scatter terror and desolation over the universe; to protect the frame of nature from the demons and their productions. For this purpose he is furnished with a thousand ears and a thousand eyes, and traverses the space between heaven and earth; his hands armed with a club or mace. Mithras gives to the earth light and life; he traces a course for the waters; he gives to men corn, pastures, and children; to the world virtuous kings and warriors; maintains harmony upon earth, watches over the law,\" &c. As the history of Mithras, and the nature of his mysteries, are not generally known, we imagined it would be agreeable to many of our readers to have the most important articles relating to that subject laid before them as it were in detail.\n\nWe now proceed to the orgia or mysteries of Bacchus, which we shall introduce with a brief history of that deity. The original Dionysus or Bacchus was the Osiris of the Egyptians, which last was the Sun (n). Whether there was an Egyptian monarch of that name, as Diodorus Siculus affirms \u00a7, has no manner of connexion with the present disquisition. The Greek name of that deity is plainly oriental, being compounded of \u1f04\u03b9\u03c2, \"bright,\" and \u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1 or \u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1, in the \u00c6olic dialect \u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1, \"a prince.\" This name was imported from the east by Orpheus, Cadmus, or by whoever else communicated the worship of Osiris to the Greeks. That the Dionysus of the Greeks was the same with the Osiris of the Egyptians, is universally allowed. Herodotus tells us expressly *, that Osiris is Dionysus in the Greek language: Martianus Capellus, quoted above, expresses the very same idea \u2020. The original Osiris was then the sun; but the Dionysus or Bacchus of the Greeks was the same with the Osiris of the Egyptians; therefore the Bacchus or Dionysus of the Greeks was likewise the same luminary.\n\nThe name Osiris has much embarrassed critics and etymologists. The learned Jablonowski \u2021, instead of delineating the character, attributes, operations, adventures, exploits, and peculiar department assigned this deity by his votaries, has spent much of his pains on trying to investigate the etymology of his name. If it be granted, which is highly probable, that the Hebrew and Egyptian tongues are cognate dialects, we should imagine that it is actually the Chophor or Offerer of the former language, which imports, \"to make rich, to become rich.\" Indeed the words Osiris and Iser were not the vulgar names of the sun and moon among the Egyptians, but only epithets importing their qualities. The name of the sun among that people was Phri or Phry, and that of moon Ioh, whence the Greek Io. The term Osiris was applied both to the sun and to the river Nile; both which by their influence contributed respectively to enrich and fertilize the land of Egypt.\n\nIt was a general custom among the orientals to denominate their princes and great men from their gods, demigods, heroes, &c. When the former were advanced to divine honours, they were in process of time confounded with their archetypes. The original divinities were forgotten, and these uptart deities usurped their place and prerogatives. In the earliest periods of the Egyptian monarchy, there appeared two illustrious personages, Osiris and Isis. These were the children of Cronus; and being brother and sister, they were joined in matrimony, according to the custom of the Egyptians. As the brother and husband had assumed the name of the Sun, so the sister and consort took that of Isis, that is, \"the woman \u00a7,\" a name which Horapollo, the Egyptians applied both to the moon and to the earth, in consequence of the similarity of their nature, their mutual sympathy, and congenial fecundity. Osiris having left his consort Isis regent of the kingdom, with Hermes as her prime minister, and Hercules as general of her armies, quitted Egypt with a numerous body of troops, attended by companies of fauns (c), satyrs, singing women, musicians, &c., and traversed all Asia to the eastern ocean. He then returned homeward through the Upper Asia, Thrace, Pontus, Asia Minor, Syria, and Palestine. Wherever he marched he conferred numberless benefits on the savage inhabitants. He taught the art of cultivating the ground, preferring the fruits of the earth, and distinguishing the wholesome and nutritive from the unwholesome and poisonous. He instructed them in the culture of the vine; and where vines could not be produced, he communicated to them the method of producing a fermented liquor from barley, very little inferior to wine itself. He built many cities in different parts.\n\n(z) Our Saviour probably alludes to this emblem, when he talks of building his church on a rock; and adds, that the gates of hell should not prevail against it.\n\n(A) The Caledonian druids seem to have regarded certain stones with a superstitious veneration, in which the Catholics imitated them. There are in several places of Scotland large stones, which the vulgar call lecre stones, i.e. we imagine, lecture.\n\n(B) See Macrob. lib. i. cap. 21. p. 247. bottom. Diogenes Laert. in prooemio, par. 10. Martian. Capel. lib. ii. Jablonowski, vol. i. lib. ii. 415. par. 3. Plut. Isis et Osir. paflim.\n\n(c) Men and women dressed in the habits of those rural deities.\nparts of the globe, planted numerous colonies (D), and wherever he directed his course instituted just and wholesome laws, and established the rites and ceremonies of religion, and left priests and catechists of his train to teach and inculcate the observance of them. In short, he left everywhere lasting monuments of his progress, and at the same time of his generosity and benevolence. Where he found the people docile and submissive, he treated them with kindness and humanity; if any showed themselves obstinate, he compelled them to submit to his institutions by force of arms.\n\nAt the end of three years, he returned to Egypt, where his brother Typhon, a wicked unnatural monster, had been forming a conspiracy against his life. This traitorous design he soon after accomplished in the following manner: He invited Osiris, with some other persons whom he had gained over, to an entertainment. When the repast was finished, he produced a beautiful coffin, highly finished, and adorned with studs of gold; promising to bestow it on the person whom it should fit best. Osiris was tempted to make the experiment. The conspirators nailed down the cover upon him, and threw the coffin into the river. This coffin, which was now become the coffin of Osiris, was, they tell us, wafted by the winds and waves to the neighbourhood of Byblus, a city of Phoenicia, where it was cast on shore, and left by the waves at the foot of a tamarind tree.\n\nIsis in the mean time, disconsolate and forlorn, attended by Anubis, was rambling every quarter in search of her beloved Osiris. At length being informed by her faithful attendant and guardian, that his body was lodged somewhere in the neighbourhood of Byblus, she repaired to that city. There, they say, she was introduced to the queen, and after (E) a variety of adventures she recovered the corpse of her husband, which, of course, she carried back with her to Egypt; but the mischievous Typhon, ever on the watch, found her on the banks of the Nile; and having robbed her of her charge, cut the body into 14 parts, and scattered them up and down. Now, once more, according to the fable, Isis set out in quest of those parts, all of which, only one excepted, she found, and interred in the place where she found them; and hence the many tombs of Osiris in that country. These tombs were denominated tapetins by the natives. Many other fabulous adventures were ascribed to those two personages, which it is not our province to enumerate at present. If our readers should wish to be more minutely informed on this subject, they may have recourse to the authors mentioned in the last quoted author, or to the learned Mr Bryant's Analysis of Ancient Mythology, and M. Cour de Gebelin, where they will find matter enough to gratify their curiosity.\n\nTo commemorate those adventures, the mysteries of Isis and Osiris were instituted; and from them both rites of Isis and Osiris were derived. Of the Egyptian solemnity, we have an exact epitome in one of the fathers of the church to the following purpose: \"Here follows (says he) an epitome of the mysteries of Isis and Osiris. They deplore annually, with deep lamentations and shaved heads, the catastrophe of Osiris over a buried statue of that monarch. They beat their breasts, mangle their arms, tear open the scars of their former wounds; that by annual lamentations the catastrophe of his miserable and fatal death may be revived in their minds. When they have practised these things a certain number of days, then they pretend that they have found the remains of his mangled body; and having found them, their sorrows are lulled asleep, and they break out into immoderate joy.\" What maxims of morality, secrets of physiology, or phenomena of astronomy, were couched under this allegorical process, is not our business to investigate in this place. We shall only observe, that, in all probability, Osiris and Isis were sovereigns of Egypt at a very early period; that they had conferred many signal benefits on their subjects, who, influenced by a sense of gratitude, paid them divine honours after their decease; that in process of time they were confounded with the sun and the moon; and that their adventures were at length magnified beyond all credibility, interlarded with fables and allegories, and employed in the mysteries as channels to convey a variety of instructions to the initiated.\n\nBe that as it may, it is certain that the very name of worship, was established by Byblus, and in after ages transferred to Tyre. The Mizraim and Chaldeans and Phoenicians were nearly connected by blood, and their religious ceremonies were derived from the very same source. By what medium the worship of Osiris at Abydos and Tyre was connected, we shall leave others to explain; we shall only observe, that among the Phoenicians this deity obtained the names Adonis and Bacchus. The former is rather an (F) epithet than a name: the latter is evidently an allusion to the weeping and lamentation (G) with which the rites were performed. We find another name of that divinity mentioned in Scripture (H); but that term is plainly of Egyptian original: we shall now proceed to the mysteries of Osiris as they were celebrated among the Greeks and Thracians, under the name of the Oritia of Dionysus or Bacchus.\n\nOrpheus, the celebrated Thracian philosopher, had travelled into Egypt in quest of knowledge; and from de Idol.\n\n---\n\n(D) Many have thought this expedition fabulous; but the numberless monuments of Egyptian architecture, sculpture, and statuary, lately discovered in the east, confirm it.\n\n(E) For the conquests and adventures of Osiris and Isis, we must send our learned readers to Diod. Sic. Bibl. i. i. and Plut. Isis et Osiris, p. 256. et seq., which we have been obliged to abridge, in consequence of the narrow limits prescribed us.\n\n(F) Adonis is evidently the Hebrew Adoni, \"my lord,\" and imports the sovereignty of the deity.\n\n(G) Bacchus is derived from the Phoenician word bahah, \"to weep.\" This was the name embraced by the Romans.\n\n(H) Ezek. chap. viii. ver. 14. Tammuz is the name of one of the months of the Egyptian year.\nthat country, according to the most authentic accounts, he imported the Bacchanalian rites and institutions. Some have affirmed that this same Orpheus being intimately acquainted with the family of Cadmus, communicated these rites to them, and endeavoured to transfer them to the grandson of that hero, which grandson became afterwards the Grecian Bacchus. It is, however, we think much more probable, that those rites were imported from Egypt or Phoenicia, by (1) Cadmus himself, who was a native of the former country, and is thought to have spent some time in the latter, before he emigrated in quest of a settlement in Boeotia. It is said that Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, and the mother of the Grecian Bacchus, was struck with lightning at the very instant of his birth. The child was, in all probability, denominated Bacchus (\u03ba), from the sorrow and lamentation this melancholy accident had occasioned in the family. Cadmus, in order to conceal the dishonour of his daughter, might, we imagine, convey away his infant grandson to some of his relations in Phoenicia or Egypt. There he was educated and instructed in all the mysteries of Isis and Osiris, and at the same time initiated in all the magical or juggling tricks of the Egyptian priests and hierophants. Thus accomplished, when he arrived at manhood, he returned to Thebes with the traditional retinue of the original deity of the same name; and claimed divine honours accordingly. This claim, however, was not admitted without much opposition; Pentheus, another grandson of Cadmus, was torn to pieces by the frantic Bacchanalians upon Mount Citheron, because he attempted to interrupt them in celebrating the orgia. Some have thought that Cadmus lost his kingdom for the same reason; but this we think is by no means probable: we should rather imagine that the old prince was privy to the whole proceedings, and that it was originally planned by him, with a view to attract the veneration of his new subjects, by making them believe that there was a divinity in his family.\n\nBe that as it may, the vain-glorious Greeks attributed all the actions of the Egyptian hero to their new Bacchus; and according to their laudable practice, engaged him in numberless adventures in which his prototype had no share. Most of those are futile and unentertaining (L). The Greeks commonly adopted some oriental personage as the hero of their mythological rhapsodies. Him they naturalized and adopted into some Grecian family, and so he became their own. To him they ascribed all the adventures and exploits of the oriental archetype from whom he was copied. Consequently in the orgia (M), every thing was collected that had been imported from the east relating to Osiris; and to that farrago was joined all that the Grecian rhapsodists had thought fit to invent, in order to amuse the credulous multitude. This, however, was not the whole of the misfortune: The adventures of Osiris were described by the Egyptian hierophants, veiled with allegorical and hieroglyphical mysteries. These the persons who imported them into Greece did not thoroughly comprehend, or if they did, they were not inclined to communicate them found and unsophisticated. Besides, many oriental terms were retained, the import of which was in process of time lost or distorted. Hence the religious ceremonies of the Greeks became a medley of inconsistencies. The mysteries of Bacchus, in particular, were deeply tinged with this meretricious colouring; the adventures of the Theban pretender were grafted upon those of the Egyptian archetype, and out of this combination was formed a tissue of adventures disgraceful to human nature, absurd, and inconsistent. Indeed the younger or Theban Bacchus seems to have been a monster of debauchery; whereas the Egyptian is represented as a person of an opposite character. Of course the mysteries of the former were attended with the most shocking abominations.\n\nThese mysteries, as has been observed above, were first celebrated at Thebes the capital of Boeotia, underof Bacchus the auspices of the family of Cadmus. From this spread into country they gradually found their way into Greece, Greece, &c., and all the neighbouring parts of Europe. They were celebrated once every three years (N), because at the end of three years Osiris returned from his Indian expedition. As the Greeks had impudently transferred the actions of the Egyptian hero to their upstart divinity, the same period of time was observed for the celebration of those rites in Greece that had been ordained for the same purpose in Egypt.\n\nWhen the day appointed for the celebration of the orgia (O) approached, the priests issued a proclamation, enjoining all the initiated to equip themselves according to the ritual, and attend the procession on\n\n---\n\n(1) Cadmus and Melampus, who were both Egyptians, introduced the Bacchanalia into Greece. The Egyptian or oriental name of Bacchus was Dinytis, that is, \"the prince of light.\" Cadmus had learned the name Bacchus from the Phoenicians.\n\n(\u03ba) We have omitted the immense farrago of fable relating to the connexion between Jupiter and Semele as of little importance to our readers.\n\n(L) Nonnus, an Egyptian of Pentapolis, has collected all the fabulous adventures of Bacchus, and exhibited them in a beautiful but irregular poem: To this we must refer our learned readers. Of the Dionysiacs we have a most judicious sketch, Gebelin, Calend. p. 553, et seq.\n\n(M) The orgia belonged to all the Mydones, but to those of Bacchus in a peculiar manner.\n\n(N) Hence these orgia were called Triteria.\n\n(O) According to Clem. Alexand. Cohort. page 12. Pott. the word orgia is derived from orge, which signifies \"anger,\" and originated from the resentment of Ceres against Jupiter, in consequence of a most outrageous insult he had offered her with success. We should rather imagine it derived from the Hebrew word argoz, signifying a \"chest or coffin,\" alluding to the casket which contained the sacred symbols of the god.\u2014The Egyptians or Phoenicians might write and pronounce, argoz, argoz, or in some manner nearly resembling orgia.","sp":184,"ep":193},{"h":"MYSTERIES","t":"The votaries were to dress themselves in coats of deer-skins, to loose the fillets of their hair, to cover their legs with the same stuff with their coats, and to arm themselves with thyrsi, which were a kind of spears wholly of wood entwined with leaves and twigs of the vine or ivy. It is said that the Bacchanalians, especially the Thracians, used often to quarrel and commit murder in their drunken revels; and that in order to prevent those unlucky accidents, a law was enacted, that the votaries, instead of real spears, should arm themselves with those sham weapons which were comparatively inoffensive. The statue of the deity, which was always covered with vine or ivy leaves, was now taken down from its pedestal, and elevated on the shoulders of the priests. The cavalcade then proceeded nearly in the following manner:\n\nFirst of all, hymns were chanted in honour of Bacchus, who was called the Power of dances, smiles, and jests; while at the same time he was deemed equally qualified for the exploits of war and heroism. Horace, in some of his dithyrambic odes, has concisely pointed out the subjects of those Bacchanalian songs. In the collection of hymns fabulously attributed to Orpheus, we find several addressed to this deity (p), each under a different title, derived from the different appellations of the god. All these names are of oriental origin, and might easily be explained, did the bounds preclude us admit of etymological disquisitions.\n\nThe hymn being finished, the first division of the votaries proceeded, carrying a pitcher of wine, with a bunch of the vine. Then followed the he-goat; an animal odious to Bacchus, because he ravages the vines. The chanting the hymns, the sacrificing the he-goat, and the revels, games, and diversions, with which the celebration of those rites was attended, gave birth to the dramatic poetry of the Greeks; as the persons habited in the dress of Fauns, Sylvans, and Satyrs (q), furnished the name of another species of poetry of a coarser and more forbidding aspect.\n\nThen appeared the mysterious coffin or basket, containing the secret symbols of the deity. These were the phallus (r), some grains of sesame, heads of poppies, pomegranates, dry items, cakes baked of the meal of different kinds of corn, salt, carded wool, rolls of honey, and cheese; a child, a serpent (s), and a van (t). Such was the furniture of the sacred coffin carried in the solemn Bacchanalian procession. The inventory given by some of the fathers of the church is somewhat different. They mention the dye, the ball, the top, Alexander, the wheel, the apples, the looking-glass, and the fleece.\n\nThe articles first mentioned seem to have been of Egyptian original; the last were certainly superinduced by the Greeks, in allusion to his being murdered and torn in pieces when he was a child by the machinations of Jumo, who prevailed within the Titans to commit the horrid deed. These last seem to have been memorials of his boyish playthings; for, says Matermus, \"the Cretans, in celebrating the rites of the child Bacchus, acted every thing that the dying boy either said, or did, or suffered.\" They likewise (says he) tore a live bull in pieces with their teeth, in order to commemorate the dismembering of the boy.\" For our part, we think, that if such a beastly rite was practised, it was done in commemoration of the savage manner of life which had prevailed among men prior to the more humane diet invented and introduced by Isis and Osiris. Be that as it may, we learn from Porphyry *, that in the island of Chios they used to sacrifice a man to Bacchus, and that they used to mangle and tear him limb from limb. This was no doubt practised in commemoration of the catastrophe mentioned above.\n\nThe orgia of this Pagan god were originally simple enough; but this unsophisticated mode was of no long continuance, for riches soon introduced luxury, which quickly infected even the ceremonies of religion. On the day set apart for this solemnity, men and women crowned with ivy, their hair dishevelled, and their bodies almost naked, ran about the streets, roaring aloud Evoke (u) Bacche. In this rout were to be seen people intoxicated at once with wine and enthusiasm, dressed like Satyrs, Fauns, and Sileni, in such scandalous postures and attitudes, with so little regard to modesty and even common decency, that we are perplexed to describe them. Next followed a company mounted upon asses, attended by Fauns, Bacchanals, Thyades, Maimonides, Naiads, Tityri, &c., who made the adjacent places echo to their frantic shrieks and howlings. After this tumultuous herd were carried the statues of Victory.\n\n(p) These stand between the 41 and 52; one to Lenaeus, or the plowman; one to Libnites, or the winnower; one to Bessares, or the vintager; one to Sabazius the god of reft; to Myles, or the Mediator, &c.\n\n(q) Dacier, Casaubon, and other French critics, have puzzled and perplexed themselves to little purpose about the origin of this word, without considering that it was coeval to dramatic poetry.\n\n(r) The phallus was highly respected by the Egyptians, and was used as the emblem of the fecundity of the human race.\n\n(s) That reptile was in high veneration among the Egyptians. See Euseb. Pr\u00e6p. Evang. lib. i. pag. 26. Steph. where we have a minute detail of the symbolical properties of that creature, according to Taautos the great legislator of that people.\n\n(t) Servius in Georg. I. Virg. ver. 166. Mystica vannus Iacchi. The van, says he, is an emblem of that purifying influence of the mysteries, by which the initiated were cleansed from all their former pollutions, and qualified for commencing a holy course of life.\n\n(u) Clem. Alexand. Cohort. pag. 11. Pott. derives this word from Cleveh, the mother of mankind, who, first opened the gate to that and every other error; but we are rather inclined to believe that it comes from the oriental word Hev, which signifies a \"serpent;\" which among the Egyptians was sacred to the sun, and was likewise the emblem of life and immortality. It then imported a prayer to Bacchus for life, vigour, health, and every other blessing.\nVictory and altars in form of vine-sets, crowned with ivy, smoking with incense and other aromatics. Then appeared several chariots loaded with thyrif, arms, garlands, casks, pitchers, and other vases, tripods, and vans. The chariots were followed by young virgins of quality, who carried the baskets and little boxes, which in general contained the mysterious articles above enumerated. These, from their office, were called cyphaphores. The phallophori (x) followed them, with a chorus of itophallophori habitied like Fauns, counterfeiting drunk persons, singing in honour of Bacchus songs and catches suited to the occasion. The procession was closed by a troop of Bacchanalians crowned with ivy, interwoven with branches of yew and with serpents \u00a7. Upon some occasions, at those scandalous festivals, naked women whipped themselves, and tore their skin in a most barbarous manner. The procession terminated on Mount Citheron, when it set out from Thebes; and in other places, in some distant unfrequented desert, where the votaries practised every species of debauchery with secrecy and impunity. Orpheus saw the degeneracy of those ceremonies; and in endeavouring to reform them he probably lost his life. Pentheus suffered in the like attempt, being torn in pieces by the Bacchanalians on Mount Citheron, among whom were his own mother and his aunts. The Greeks, who were an airy jovial people, seem to have paid little regard to the plaintive part of the orgia; or rather, we believe, they acted with howling and frantic exclamations, often enhanced by a combination of drunkenness, ecstacy, and enthusiastic fury.\n\nWhat secrets, religious, moral, political, or physical, were communicated to the votaries, it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty.\u2014One thing we may admit, namely, that the doctrines discovered and inculcated in the orgia, were originally the very same which the apostles of the feet had imbibed in Egypt and Phoenicia; and of which we have given a brief account near the beginning of this article. It is, however, probable, that the spurious or Theban Bacchus had superadded a great deal of his own invention, which, we may believe, was not altogether so found and fabulous as the original doctrine. However that may be, the initiated were made to believe that they were to derive wonderful advantages from the participation of those rites, both in this life and that which is to come. Of this, however, we shall talk more at length by and bye, in our account of the Eleusinian mysteries.\n\nTo detail the etymology of the names of this Pagan deity, the fables relating to his birth, his education, his transformations, his wars, peregrinations, adventures, the various and multiform rites with which he was worshipped, would swell this article to a most immoderate size. If any of our readers should wish to be more minutely and more accurately acquainted with this subject, we must beg leave to remit them to Diod. Sic. Apollod. Bibl. Euripid. Bacche, Ariostophanis Ranae, Nonn. Dionys.; and among the moderns, to Ban. Mythol. Voss. de Orig. Idol. Monf. Fourmont, R\u00e9flexions sur l'origine des anciens peuples, Mr Bryant's Analyse; and especially to Monf. Cour de Gebelin, Calendrier ou Almanach. That prince of etymologists, in his account of the festival of Bacchus, has given a most acute and ingenious explication of the names and epithets of that deity. For our part, we have endeavoured to collect and exhibit such as we judged most important, most entertaining, and most instructive, to the less enlightened classes of our readers.\n\nWe now proceed to the Eleusinian mysteries, which, among the ancient Greeks and Romans, were treated mysteries with a superior degree of awe and veneration. These mysteries were instituted in honour of Ceres, the goddess of corn; who, according to the most authentic accounts, was the Isis of the Egyptians. The mysteries of Osiris and Isis have been hinted at in the preceding part of this article. They were originally instituted in honour of the sun and moon, and afterwards consecrated to an Egyptian prince and princess; who, in consequence of their merits, had been deified by that people. We know of no more exact and brilliant description of the ceremonies of that goddess, in the most polished ages of the Egyptian superstition, than what we meet within the witty and florid Apuleius \u00a7, to which we must take the liberty to refer our more curious readers. Our bullefs at present shall be to try to investigate by what means, and upon what occasion, those mysteries were introduced into Attica, and established at Eleusis. A passage from Diodorus Siculus \u00a7, which we shall here transcribe, will, we think, throw no inconsiderable light on that abstruse part of the subject.\n\n\"In like manner with him (Cecrops), says that judicious historian, they tell us, that Eretheus, a prince of Egyptian extraction, once reigned at Athens. Of this fact they produce the following evidence: A scorching drought, during the reign of this prince, prevailed over almost all the habitable world, except Egypt; into Attica, which, in consequence of the humidity of its soil, was not affected by that calamity. The fruits of the earth were burnt up; and at the same time multitudes of people perished by famine. Eretheus, upon this occasion, as he was connected with Egypt, imported a vast quantity of grain from that country to Athens. The people, who had been relieved by his munificence, unanimously elected him king. Being invested with the government, he taught his subjects the mysteries of Ceres at Eleusis, and the mode of celebrating the sacred ceremonies, having transferred from Egypt the ritual for that purpose. In those times the goddess is said to have made her appearance at Athens three several times; because, according to tradition, the fruits of the earth which bear her name were then imported into Attica. On this account the seeds and fruits of the earth were said to be the invention of that deity. Now the Athenians themselves acknowledge, that, in the reign of Eretheus, the fruits of the earth having perished for want of rain, the arrival of Ceres in their country did actually happen, and that along with her the blessing of corn.\"\n\n(x) The phallus was the symbol of the fructifying power of Nature. The itophallus was the type of that power in act.\nMysteries.\n\ncorn was restored to the earth. They tell us at the same time, that the teletae and the mysteries of that goddess were then received and instituted at Eleusis.\"\n\nHere then we have the whole mystery of the arrival of Ceres in Attica, and the institution of her mysteries at Eleusis, unveiled. The whole is evidently an oriental allegory. The fruits of the earth had been destroyed by a long course of drought; Egypt, by its peculiar situation, had been preserved from that dreadful calamity. Erechtheus, in consequence of his relation to the Egyptians, imported from their country a quantity of grain, not only sufficient for the consumption of his own subjects, but also a great overplus to export to other parts of Greece, Sicily, Italy, Spain, &c. Triptolemus, another Egyptian, was appointed by Erechtheus to export this superfluous store. That hero, according to Pherecydes, was the son of Oceanus and Tellus, that is, of the sea and the earth; because his parents were not known, and because he came to Eleusis by sea. The ship in which he failed, when he distributed his corn to the western parts of the world, was decorated with the figure of a winged dragon: therefore, in the allegorical style of his country, he was said to be wafted through the air in a chariot drawn by dragons. Those creatures, everybody knows, were held sacred by the Egyptians.\n\nWherever Triptolemus disposed of his corn, thither were extended the wanderings of Ceres. In order to elucidate this point, we must observe, that along with the grain imported from Egypt, Erechtheus, or Triptolemus, or both, transported into Attica a cargo of priests and priestesses from the temples of Bufris, a city which lay in the centre of the Delta, where the goddess Isis had a number of chapels erected for her worship. The presidents of these ceremonies, like all other bigots, gladly laid hold on this opportunity of propagating their religious rites, and disseminating the worship of the deities of their country. That the Egyptian priests were zealous in propagating the dogmas of their superstition, is abundantly evident from the extensive spreading of their rites and ceremonies over almost all Asia and a considerable part of Europe. The Greek and Roman idolatry is known to have originated from them; and numberless monuments of their impious worship are still extant in Persia, India, Japan, Tartary, &c. Our inference then is, that the worship of Isis was introduced into every country where Triptolemus sold or disposed of his commodities.\u2014Hence the wanderings of Ceres in search of her daughter Proserpine who is generally called Core. The famine occasioned by the drought destroying the fruits of the ground, imports the loss of Proserpine. The restoration of the corn in various parts of the earth, by fresh supplies from Egypt from time to time, imports the wanderings of Ceres in quest of Proserpine. The whole process is an oriental allegory. The disappearance of the fruits of the earth, of which Proserpine, or Persephone, is the emblem, is the allegorical rape of that goddess. She was seized by Pluto, and carried off by Pluto, sovereign of the infernal regions. The seed committed to the earth in that dry season appeared no more, and was, consequently, said to dwell underground with Pluto. It was then that Ceres, that is, corn imported from Egypt, set out in quest of her daughter. Again, When the earth recovered her primitive fertility, the Core, or maid, was found by her mother Ceres, that is, the earth; for Isis, among the Egyptians, frequently signified the earth. The wanderings of Isis in search of Osiris furnished the model for the peregrinations of Ceres.\n\nCeres, the Roman name of the goddess of corn, was different unknown to the modern Greeks. They always denominated her Damater (z), which is rather an epithet than a proper name. The Greeks, who always affected to pass for originals, we think, suppressed the Egyptian name on purpose, to conceal the country of that deity. As a proof of the probability of this conjecture, it may be observed, that they metamorphosed the wanderings of Isis in search of Osiris into the peregrinations of Ceres in quest of Proserpine. The Romans who were less ambitious of the character of originality, retained one of her oriental names (aa.) Ceres, says Diodorus, appeared thrice in Attica during the reign of Erechtheus; which seems to import, that fleets loaded with corn had thrice arrived in that country from Egypt during that period.\n\nCecrops, the first king of Attica, had established the worship of the Saitic Athena or Minerva in that region, and consecrated his capital to that deity. Erechtheus, in his turn, introduced the worship of Isis, or Damater, who in all appearance was the tutelar deity of Bufris his native city. The subjects of Cecrops were a colony of Saites, and readily embraced the worship of Minerva at Athens; but the aborigines of that district being accustomed to a maritime, perhaps to a piratical, course of life, were more inclined to consecrate their city to Neptune, the god of the sea, and to constitute him their immediate guardian and protector. Cecrops by a stratagem caused the preference to Minerva his favourite divinity fixing the patronage of Eleusis, in order to give equal importance to his mysteries.\n\n(v) This word seems to be formed of two Hebrew terms, pheri \"fruit,\" and taphon, or taphon, \"abscindit, recondidit.\"\n\n(z) Damater is compounded of the Chaldaic particle da \"the,\" and mater \"mother.\" As Isis often signified the earth, the Greeks naturally adopted that title; because, according to them, that element is the mother of all living. In the very same manner they discarded the word juno, an original title of the moon, and substituted Hera, which intimates \"mistress or lady.\"\n\n(aa) According to some of the Latin etymologists, Ceres, or rather Geres, is derived from gero \"to bear, to carry,\" because the earth bears all things; or because that element is the general fruit-bearer. But as this term came to Italy immediately from the east, and not by the medium of Greece, we would rather incline to adopt an oriental etymology. The Hebrew word cheres signifies arare \"to plow;\" a name naturally applicable to the goddess of husbandry.\npatroness, had the address to institute the Eleusinian mysteries; and to accomplish his design laid hold on the opportunity above mentioned.\n\nThis appears to us the most probable account of the origin and institution of the Eleusinian mysteries; for which the Sicilian historian has indeed furnished the clue. We shall now proceed to detail some other circumstances which attended the original institution of these far-famed ceremonies.\n\nThe archpriestels who personated the newly imported deity was entertained by one Celes, who was either viceroy of that petty district of which Eleusis was the capital, or some considerable personage in that city or its neighbourhood. Upon her immediate arrival, according to the fabulous relations of the Greeks, a farce was acted not altogether suitable to the character of a goddess whose mysteries were one day to be deemed so sacred and austere. These coarse receptions, and other indecencies attending the first appearance of the goddess, that is, the Egyptian dame who assumed her character, were copied from the like unhallowed modes of behaviour practised on occasion of the solemn processions of her native country. These scommata, or coarse jokes, had an allegorical signification in Egypt; and among the most ancient Greeks the very same spirit was universally diffused by the oriental colonists who from time to time arrived and settled among them. In process of time they abandoned the figurative and allegorical style, in consequence of their acquaintance with philosophy and abstract reasoning. In the ceremonies of religion, however, the same allegorical and typical representations which had been imported from the east were retained; but the Grecian hierophants in a short time lost every idea of their latent import, and religious, moral, or physical interpretation. Accordingly, this shameful rencontre between Ceres and Banbo (BB), or Jambe, was retained in the mysteries, though we think it was copied from Egypt, as was said above, where even that obscene action was probably an allegorical representation of something very different from what appeared to the Greeks.\n\nAt the same time that Ceres arrived in Attica, Bacchus likewise made his appearance in that country. He was entertained by one Icarus; whom, as a reward for his hospitality, he instructed in the art of cultivating the vine, and the method of manufacturing wine. Thus it appears that both agriculture and the art of managing the vintage were introduced into Athens much about the same time. Ceres was no other than a priestess of Isis; Bacchus was no doubt a priest of Osiris. The arrival of those two personages from Egypt, with a number of inferior priests in their train, produced a memorable revolution in Athens, both with respect to life, manners, and religion. The sacred rites of Isis, afterwards so famous under the name of the Eleusinian mysteries, date their institution from this period.\n\nWhen this company of propagandi arrived at Eleusis, they were entertained by some of the most respectable persons who then inhabited that district. Their names, according to Clem. Alexand., were Banbo, Dysaulis, Triptolemus, Eumolpus, and Eubulus. From Eumolpus were descended a race of priests called Eumolpidae, who figured at Athens many ages after. Triptolemus was an ox herd, Eumolpus a shepherd, and Eubulus a swine herd. These were the first apostles of the Eleusinian mysteries. They were instructed by the Egyptian missioners; and they, in their turn instructed their successors. Erechtheus, or, as some say, Pandion, countenanced the seminary, and built a small temple for its accommodation in Eleusis, a city of Attica, a few miles west of Athens, and originally one of the twelve districts into which that territory was divided. Here then we have arrived at the scene of those renowned mysteries, which for the space of near 2000 years were the pride of Athens and the wonder of the world.\n\nThe mysteries were divided into the greater and lesser Eleusinian mysteries. The former were celebrated at Agri\u00e6, a small town mysteries on the river Ilyssus: the former were celebrated in the month which the Athenians called Boedromion (CC); the latter in the month Anthesterion (DD). The lesser mysteries, according to the fabulous legends of the Greeks, were instituted in favour of the celebrated Hercules. That hero being commanded by Eurytheus to bring up Cerberus from the infernal regions, was desirous of being initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries before he engaged in that perilous undertaking. He addressed himself to Eumolpus the hierophant for that purpose. There was a law among the Eleusinians prohibiting the initiation of foreigners. The priest not daring to refuse the benefit to Hercules, who was both a friend and benefactor to the Athenians, advised the hero to get himself adopted by a native of the place, and so to elude the force of the law. He was accordingly adopted by one Pylius, and so was initiated in the lesser mysteries, which were instituted for the first time upon that occasion. This account has all the air of a fable. The lesser mysteries were instituted by way of preparation for the greater.\n\nThe person who was to be initiated in the lesser mysteries, as well as in the greater, was obliged to practise the virtue of chastity a considerable time before his admission. Besides, he was to bind himself by the most solemn vows not to divulge any part of the mysteries. At the same time, he was, according to the original institution, to be a person of unblemished moral character. These were preliminaries indispensably necessary in order to his admission. A bull was sacrificed to Jupiter, and the hide of that animal, called by a peculiar name (\u0394\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c2) was carefully preserved and carried to Eleusis, where it was spread under the feet of the initiated. The candidate was then purified by bathing in the river Ilyssus, by affusions with salt water or salt, with laurel, barley, and passing through\n\n(BB) Apollod. Bib. ubi supra, Clem. Alexand. Cohort. page 17, where the story is told with very little reserve.\n\n(CC) The third month of the Athenian year, answering to our September.\n\n-DD) The eighth month, answering to our February; but Meursius makes it November.\nthrough the fire: all which rites were attended with incantations and other usages equally insignificant and ridiculous. Last of all, a young fow was sacrificed to Ceres; and this animal, according to the ritual, behoved to be with pigs; and before it was killed it was to be washed in Cantharus, one of the three harbours which formed the Piraeus.\n\nAll these ceremonies duly performed, the candidate was carried into the hall appointed for the purpose of initiation. There he was taught the first elements of those arcana which were afterwards to be more fully and more clearly revealed in the more august mysteries of Eleusis. The pupils at Agrae were called Myia, which may intimate probationers; whereas those of Eleusis were denominated Epopia, importing that they saw as they were seen.\n\nThe lesser mysteries were divided into several stages, and candidates were admitted to them according to their quality and capacity respectively. Those who were initiated in the lowest were obliged to wait five years before they were admitted to the greater. Those who had partaken of the second kind underwent a novitiate of three years; those who had been admitted to the third, one of two years; and those who had gone through the fourth were admitted to the greater at the end of one year; which was the shortest period of probation a candidate for that honour could legally undergo. Such was the process generally observed in administering the lesser mysteries.\n\nWith respect to the greater mysteries, it is probable that originally none but the natives of Attica were admitted to partake of them. In process of time, however, the pale was extended so far and wide as to comprehend all who spoke the Greek language. All foreigners were debarred from those sacred rites. They tell us, however, that Hercules, Bacchus, Castor and Pollux, Aesculapius, and Hippocrates, were initiated in an extraordinary manner, from a regard to their high character and heroic exploits. All barbarians, too, were excluded; yet Anacharsis the Scythian was indulged that privilege, in consequence of his reputation for science and philosophy. All persons guilty of manslaughter, though even accidentally or involuntarily, all magicians, enchanters; in a word, all impious and profane persons, were expressly prohibited the benefit of this Pagan sacrament. At last, however, the gate became wider, and crowds of people, of all nations, kindreds, and languages, provided their character was fair and irreproachable, rushed in by it.\n\nIn process of time the Athenians initiated even their infants; but this, we imagine, must have been a kind of lustration or purification, from which it was supposed that they derived a kind of moral ablation from vice, and were thought to be under the peculiar protection of the goddess.\n\nThe celebration of the mysteries began on the 15th day of the month Boedromion; and, according to most ancient authors, lasted nine days. Meurinus has enumerated the transactions of each day, which are much too numerous to fall within the compass of this article; we must therefore refer our curious reader to the author just mentioned. Some days before the commencement of the festival, the precones, or public criers, invited all the initiated, and all the pretenders to that honour, to attend the festival, with clean hands and a pure heart, and the knowledge of the Greek language.\n\nOn the evening of the 15th day of the month called Boedromion the initiations commenced. Our readers will observe, that all the most sacred and solemnly during the night: they were indeed generally works of darkness. On this day there was a solemn cavalcade of Athenian matrons from Athens to Eleusis, in carriages drawn by oxen. In this procession the ladies used to rally one another in pretty loose terms, in imitation, we suppose, of the Iliac procession described by Herodotus, which has been mentioned above. The most remarkable object in this procession was the Mindusus Cereris, contained in a small coffin or basket. This was carried by a select company of Athenian matrons, who, from their office, were styled Camphorae. In this coffin were lodged the comb of Ceres, her mirror, a serpentine figure, some wheat and barley, the pudenda of the two sexes, and perhaps some other articles which we have not been able to discover. The procession ended at the temple, where this sacred charge was deposited with the greatest solemnity.\n\nWe have no description of the temple of Eleusis upon record. Paulanias intended to have described it; but says he was diverted from his design by a dream. Strabo informs us that the mystic sanctua-\u2020 Lib. ix. ry was as large as a theatre, and that it was built by Ictinus. In the porch, or outer part of this temple,\u2020 See Eleusis the candidates were crowned with garlands of flowers, &c., which they called himera, or \"the desirable.\" They were at the same time dressed in new garments, which the candidates continued to wear till they were quite worn out. They then washed their hands in a laver filled with holy water; a ceremony which intimated the purity of their hearts and hands. Before the doors were locked, care was taken by one of the officers of the temple proclaimed with a loud voice a stern mandate, enjoining all the uninited to keep at a distance from the temple, and declaring the most terrible menaces if any should dare to disturb or pry into the holy mysteries. Nor were these menaces without effect: for if any person was found to have crowded into the sanctuary even through ignorance, he was put to death without mercy. Every precaution having been taken to secure secrecy, the initiatory ceremonies now began. But before we describe these, we must lay before our readers a brief account of the ministers and retainers of these secrets of paganism.\n\nThe chief minister of these far-famed mysteries was the hierophant. He was styled King, and enjoyed the dignity during life, and was always by birth an Athenian. He presided in the solemnity, as is evident from his title. This personage, as we learn from Eusebius, represented the Demiurgus, or Creator of the world. \"Now in the mysteries of Eleusis (says that father), the hierophant is dressed out in the figure of the demiurgus.\" What this demiurgus was, we learn from the same writer. As this whole institution was copied from the Egyptians, we may rest assured that the figure of the Eleusinian Demiurgus was borrowed from the same quarter. \"As for the symbols of the Egyptians (says he, quoting from Porphyry), they are of the following complexion. The Prop. Demiurgus, whom the Egyptians call O neph, is figured...\"\nas a man of an azure colour, shaded with black, holding in his right hand a sceptre and in his left a girdle, and having on his head a royal ring or feather wreathed round.\" Such, we imagine, was the equipment of the Eleusinian hierophant. This person was likewise styled Prophet. He was to be of the family of the Eumolpidae; was obliged to make a vow of perpetual chastity; and even his voice, hair, and attitude, were adjusted to the ritual.\n\nThe next minister was the daduchus, or torch-bearer; who, according to the father above quoted, was attired like the sun. This minister resembled the sun, because that luminary was deemed the visible type of the supreme Demiurgus, and his vicegerent in governing and arranging the affairs of this lower world.\n\nThe third was the person who officiated at the altar. He was habited like the moon. His office was to implore the favour of the gods for all the initiated. We should rather imagine, that the person at the altar, as he resembled the moon, was intended to represent the goddes herself; for the Egyptian Isis, who was the archetype of Ceres, was sometimes the moon and sometimes the earth.\n\nThe herald. The sacred herald was another principal actor in this solemn exhibition. His province was to recite every thing that, according to the ritual, was to be communicated to the novices; and he probably represented Thoth or Thoth, that is Hermes or Mercury, the interpreter of the gods.\n\nBesides these, there were five epimeletes or curators, of whom the king was one, who jointly directed the whole ceremonial. Lastly, there were ten priests to offer the sacrifices. There were no doubt many officers of inferior note employed upon these occasions; but these were only insignificant appendages, whose departments have not been transmitted to posterity.\n\nAfter this detail of the ministers of this solemn service, we return to the mystae, or candidates for initiation. Some of the fathers of the church mention a hymn composed by the celebrated Orpheus, which was sung by the mylagogue or king upon that occasion. This hymn appears to us one of those spurious compositions which abounded in the first ages of Christianity, and which the pious apologists often adopted without sufficient examination. That same sacred hymn was chanted upon that occasion, we think highly probable; but that the one in question was either composed by Orpheus, or used at the opening of these ceremonies, to us appears somewhat problematical.\n\nBefore the ceremony opened, a book was produced, which contained every thing relating to the telet\u00e6. This was read over in the ears of the mystae; who were ordered to write out a copy of it for themselves. This book was kept at Eleusis in a sacred repository, formed by two stones exactly fitted to each other, and of a very large size. This repository was called petroma.\n\nAt the annual celebration of the greater mysteries, these stones were taken asunder, and the book taken out; which, after being read to the mystae, was replaced in the same casketment.\n\nThe initiations began with a representation of the wanderings of Ceres, and her bitter and loud lamentations for the loss of her beloved daughter. Upon this occasion, no doubt, a figure of that deity was displayed to the mystae, while loud lamentations echoed from every corner of the sanctuary. One of the company having kindled a firebrand at the altar, and sprung to a certain place in the temple, waving the torch with the utmost fury, a second snatched it from him, roaring and waving it in the same frantic manner; then a third, fourth, &c., in the most rapid succession. This was done to imitate Ceres, who was said to have perforated the globe of the earth with a flaming pine in her hand, which she had lighted at Mount Etna.\n\nWhen the pageant of the goddes was supposed to arrive at Eleusis, a solemn pause ensued, and a few trifling questions were put to the mystae: What these questions were, is evident from the answers. \"I have put to the fatted; I have drunk the liquor; I have taken the contents out of the coffin; and having performed the ceremony, have put them into the hamper: I have taken them out of the hamper, and put them again in the coffin.\" The meaning of these answers, we conjecture, was this: \"I have fatted, as Ceres fatted while in search of her daughter; I have drunk off the worst she drank when given her by Banbo; I have performed what Ceres taught her first disciples to perform, when she committed to them the sacred hamper and coffin.\" After these interrogatories, and the suitable responses, the mundus Cereris was displayed before the eyes of the mystae, and the mylagogue or hierophant, or perhaps the sacred herald by his command, read a lecture on the allegorical import of those sacred symbols. This was heard with the most profound attention; and a solemn silence prevailed throughout the fane. Such was the first act of this religious farce, which perhaps consisted originally of nothing more.\n\nAfter the exposition of the mundus Cereris, and the Traditions import of her wanderings, many traditions were communicated to the mystae concerning the origin of the universe and the nature of things. The doctrines delivered in the greater mysteries, says Clem. Alex., \"relate to the nature of the universe. Here all instruction ends. Things are seen as they are; and nature, and the things of nature, are given to be comprehended.\"\n\nTo the same purpose Cicero: \"Which points being explained and reduced to the standard of reason, the nature of things, rather than that of the gods, is discovered.\" The Father of the universe, or the supreme demiurgus, was represented as forming the chaotic mass into the four elements, and producing animals, vegetables, and all kinds of organized beings, out of those materials. They say that they were informed of the secrets of the anomalies of the moon, and the eclipses of the sun and moon; and, according to Virgil,\n\nUnde hominum genus, et pecudes, unde imber et ignes.\n\nWhat system of cosmogony those hierophants adopted, is evident from the passage above quoted from Eusebius; and, from the account immediately preceding, it was that of the most ancient Egyptians, and of the orientals in general. This cosmogony is beautifully and energetically exhibited in Plato's Timaeus, and in the genuine spirit of poetry by Ovid in the beginning of his Metamorphoses.\n\nThe next scene exhibited upon the stage, on this Exploits of solemn occasion, consisted of the exploits and adventures of the gods, demigods, and heroes, who had from time and","sp":193,"ep":199},{"h":"MYSTERIES","t":"to time, been advanced to divine honours. These were displayed as passing before the mystae in pageants fabricated for that important purpose. This was the original mode among the Egyptians, and was no doubt followed by their Eleusinian pupils. These adventures were probably demonstrated to have been allegorical, symbolical, hieroglyphical, &c., at least they were exhibited in such a favourable point of view as to dispel those absurdities and inconsistencies with which they were sophificated by the poets and the vulgar.\n\nWith respect to the origin of those fictitious deities, it was discovered that they had been originally men who had been exalted to the rank of divinity, in consequence of their heroic exploits, their useful inventions, their beneficent actions, &c. This is so clear from the two passages quoted from Cicero, by Bishop Warburton \u2020, that the fact cannot be contradicted. But that prelate has not informed us so precisely, whether the mystagogues represented them as nothing more than dead men, in their present state, or as beings who were actually existing in a deified state, and executing the functions assigned them in the rubric of Paganism. Another query naturally occurs; that is, to what purpose did the mystagogues apply this communication? That the hierophants did actually represent those deified mortals in the latter predicament, is obvious from another passage quoted from Cicero by the same prelate, which we shall transcribe as translated by him: \"What think you of those who assert that valiant, or famous, or powerful men, have obtained divine honours after death; and that these are the very gods now become the objects of our worship, our prayers, and adoration? Euhemerus tells us, when these gods died, and where they lie buried. I forbear to speak of the sacred and august rites of Eleusis. I pass by Samothrace and the mysteries of Lemnos, whose hidden rites are celebrated in darkness, and amidst the thick shades of groves and forests.\" If, then, those deified mortals were become the objects of worship and prayers, there can be no doubt of the belief of their deified existence. The allusion to the Eleusinian and other Pagan mysteries towards the close of the quotation, places the question beyond the reach of controversy. But though, according to this account, \"there were gods many and lords many;\" yet it is evident from the passage quoted from Eusebius in the preceding part of this article, that the unity of the Supreme Being was maintained, exhibited, and inculcated. This was the original doctrine of the supreme hierophants of Egypt; it was maintained by Thales and all the retainers of the Ionian school. It was the doctrine of Pythagoras, who probably gleaned it up in the country just mentioned, in connexion with many other dogmas which he had the assurance to claim as his own.\n\nBut however the unity, and perhaps some of the most obvious attributes, of the Supreme Author of nature, might be illustrated and inculcated, the tribute of homage and veneration due to the subordinate divinities was by no means neglected. The initiated were taught to look to the dii majorum gentium with a superior degree of awe and veneration, as beings endowed with an ineffable measure of power, wisdom, purity, goodness, &c. These were, if we may use the expression, the prime favourites of the Monarch of the universe, who were admitted into his immediate presence, and who received his beheds from his own mouth, and communicated them to his subordinate officers, prefects, lieutenants, &c. These they were exhorted to adore; to them they were to offer sacrifices, prayers, and every other act of devotion, both on account of the excellency of their nature and the high rank they bore at the court of heaven. They were instructed to look up to hero gods and demigods, as being exalted to the high rank of governors of different parts of nature, as the immediate guardians and protectors of the human race; in short, as gods near at hand, as prompters to a virtuous course, and assistants in it; as ready upon all occasions to confer blessings upon the virtuous and deserving. Such were the doctrines taught in the telet\u00e6 with respect to the nature of the Pagan divinities, and the worship and devotion enjoined to be offered them by the mysteries.\n\nAs the two principal ends proposed by these initiations were the exercise of heroic virtues in men, for ages, and the practice of sincere and uniform piety by the candidates for immortal happiness, the hierophants had adopted a plan of operations excellently accommodated to both these purposes. The virtuous conduct and heroic exploits of the great men and demi-gods of early antiquity, were magnified by the most pompous eulogiums, enforced with suitable exhortations to animate the votaries to imitate so noble and alluring an example. But this was not all; the heroes and demigods themselves were displayed in pageants, or vehicles of celestial light. Their honours, offices, habitations, attendants, and other appendages, in the capacity of demons, were exhibited with all the pomp and splendour that the sacerdotal college were able to devise. The sudden glare of mimic light, the melting music stealing upon the ear, the artificial thunders reverberated from the roof and walls of the temple, the appearance of fire and ethereal radiance, the vehicles of flame, the effigies of heroes and demons adorned with crowns of laurel emitting rays from every sprig, the fragrant odours and aromatic gales which breathed from every quarter, all dexterously counterfeited by sacerdotal mechanism, must have filled the imagination of the astonished votaries with pictures at once tremendous and transporting: Add to this, that every thing was transfixed in the dead of night amidst a dismal gloom; whence the most bright effulgence instantaneously burst upon the sight. By this arrangement the aspirants to initiation were wonderfully animated to the practice of virtue while they lived, and inspired with the hope of a blest immortality when they died. At the same time, their awe and veneration for the gods of their country were wonderfully enhanced by reflecting on the appearances above described. Accordingly Strabo very judiciously observes, \"that the mythical secrecy of the sacred rites preserves the majesty of the Deity, imitating its nature, which eludes our apprehension.\" For these reasons, in celebrating the telet\u00e6, the demons were introduced in their deified or glorified state.\n\nBut as all the candidates for initiation might not aspire to the rank of heroes and demigods, a more easy and a more attainable mode of conduct, in order to arrive at the palace of happiness, behoved to be opened. Private virtues were inculcated, and these too...\nMysteries.\n\nPrivate virtues inculcated in the mysteries, by the doctrine of a future state, too were to meet a coudign reward. But alas! this present life is too often a chequered scene, where virtue is deprefed and trodden under foot, and vice lifts up its head and rides triumphant. It is a dictate of common fense, that virtue should sooner or later emerge, and vice sink into contempt and misery. Here then the conductors of the mysteries, properly and naturally, adopted the doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments. The dogma of the immortality of the human soul was elucidated, and carefully and pathetically inculcated. This doctrine was likewise imported from Egypt; for Herodotus informs us, \"that the Egyptians were the first people who maintained the immortality of the human soul.\" The Egyptian immortality, however, according to him, was only the metempsychosis or transmigration of souls. This was not the system of the ancient Egyptians, nor indeed of the teletae. In these, a metempsychosis was admitted; but that was carried forward to a very distant period, to wit, to the grand Egyptian period of 36,000 years.\n\nAs the mystagogues well knew that the human mind is more powerfully affected by objects presented to the eyes than by the most engaging instructions conveyed by the ear, they made the emblems of Elysium and Tartarus pass in review before the eyes of their novices. There the Elysian scenes, so nobly described by the Roman poet, appeared in mimic splendour; and, on the other hand, the gloom of Tartarus, Charon's boat, the dog of hell, the Furies with tresses of snakes, the tribunal of Minos and Rhadamanthus, &c. were displayed in all their terrific state. Tantalus, Ixion, Sisyphus, the daughters of Danaus, &c. were represented in pageants before their eyes. These exhibitions were accompanied with most horrible cries and howlings, thunders, lightnings, and other objects of terror which we shall mention in their proper place.\n\nNo contrivance could be better accommodated to animate the pupils to the practice of virtue on the one hand, or to deter them from indulging vicious passions on the other. It resembled opening heaven and hell to a hardened sinner. The practices inculcated in celebrating the mysteries are too numerous to be detailed in this imperfect sketch. The worship of the gods was strictly enjoined, as has been shown above. The three laws generally ascribed to Triptolemus were inculcated, 1. To honour their parents; 2. To honour the gods with the first fruits of the earth; 3. Not to treat brute animals with cruelty. These laws were imported from Egypt, and were communicated to the Eleusinians by the original miffionaries. Cicero makes the civilization of mankind one of the most beneficial effects of the Eleusinian institutions: \"Nullum mihi, cum multo eximia divinaque videntur Athenae tuae pericisse; tum nihil melius illis mysteriis, quibus ex agresti immanique vita, exculti ad humanitatem, et mitigati fumus; initiaque, ut appellantur, ita revera principia vitae cognovimus; neque folum cum lecititia vivendi rationem accepimus, sed etiam cum spe meliore moriendi.\" Hence it is evident that the precepts of humanity and morality were warmly recommended in these institutions. The virtue of humanity was extended, one may say, even to the brute creation, as appears from the last of Triptolemus's laws above quoted. Some articles were enjoined in the telete which may appear to us of less importance, which, however, in the symbolical style of the Egyptians, were abundantly significant. The initiated were commanded to abstain from the flesh of certain birds and fishes; from beans, from pomegranates and apples, which were deemed equally polluting. It was taught, that to touch the plant of asparagus was as dangerous as the most deadly poison. Now, says Porphyry, whoever is versed in the history of the sybils, knows for what reason they were commanded to abstain from the flesh of birds.\"\n\nThe initiated then bound themselves by dreadful oaths to observe most conscientiously and to practise every tender precept tendered to them in the course of the telete; and at the same time never to divulge one article of observe all that had been heard or seen by them upon that occasion. In this they were so exceedingly jealous, that the myth\u00e6us, \u00c6schylus the tragedian was in danger of capital punishment, for having only alluded to one of the Eleusinian arcana in a tragedy of his; and one of the articles of indictment against Diagoras the Melian was, his having spoken disrespectfully of the mysteries, and diffused people from partaking of them. It must then be allowed, that the institution of the mysteries was of infinite advantage to the Pagan world. They were indeed a kind of sacraments, by which the initiated bound themselves by a solemn vow to practise piety towards the gods, justice and humanity towards their fellow men, and gentleness and tenderness towards the inoffensive part of the brute creation. The Pagans themselves were so thoroughly convinced of this fact, that in their disputes with the apologists for Christianity, they often appealed to the telete, and contrasted their maxims with the most sublime doctrines of that heavenly initiation.\n\nIn order to impress these maxims the more deeply upon the minds of the novices, and to fix their attention more steadfastly upon the lectures which were delivered them by the mystagogue or the sacred herald, a mechanical operation was played off at proper intervals during the course of the celebration. \"Towards the end of the celebration (says Stob\u00e6us), the whole scene is terrible; all is trembling, shuddering, sweat, and astonishment. Many horrible spectres are seen, horrible and strange cries and howlings uttered. Light succeeds darkness; and again the blackest darkness the most glaring light. Now appear open plains, flowery meadows, and waving groves; where are seen dances and choruses; and various holy fantasies enchant the sight. Melodious notes are heard from far, with all the sublime symphony of the sacred hymns. The pupil now is completely perfect, is initiated, becomes free, released, and walks about with a crown on his head, and is admitted to bear a part in the sacred rites.\" Arriades de Myst. Eleus. calls Eleusis \"a kind of temple of the whole earth, and of all that man beholds done in the most dreadful and the most exhilarating manner. In what other place have the records of fable sung of things more marvellous? or in what region upon earth have the objects presented to the eye borne a more exact resemblance to the sounds which strike the ear? What object of sight have the numberless generations of men and women beheld comparable to these exhibited in the ineffable mysteries?\" To the same purpose, Pletho, in the oracles of Zoroaster, informs us,\nMysteries.\n\n\"that frightful and shocking apparitions, in a variety of forms, used to be displayed by the mystae in the course of their initiation.\" And a little after, he adds, \"that thunder and lightning and fire, and every thing terrible which might be held symbolical of the divine presence, were introduced.\" Claudian, in his poem De Raptu Proserpinae, gives an elegant, though brief, description of this phenomenon, which throws some light on the passages above quoted.\n\nJam mihi cernuntur trepidis delubra moveri\nSedibus et clarum dia persgere culmina lucem,\nAdventum teftata Dei, jam magnus ab imis\nAuditur fremitus terris, templumque renugit\nCecropidum.\n\nThe sight of those appearances was called the Antoplia, or \"the real presence;\" hence those rites were sometimes called Epoptica. The Epoptae were actually initiated, and were admitted into the Sanctum Sanctorum, and bore a part in the ceremonial; whereas the mystae, who had only been initiated in the lesser mysteries at Agrae, were obliged to take their station in the porch of the temple. The candidates for initiation bathed themselves in holy water, and put on new clothes, all of linen, which they continued to wear till they were quite torn, and then they were consecrated to Ceres and Proserpine. From the ceremony of bathing they were denominated Hydrami; and this again was a kind of baptismal ablution. Whether the phrases of washing away sin, putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, putting off the old man with his deeds, putting on a robe of righteousness, being buried in baptism, the words mystery, perfect, perfection, which occur so frequently in the New Testament, especially in the writings of the apostle St Paul, are borrowed from the Pagan mysteries, or from usages current among the Jews, we leave to our more learned readers to determine.\n\nThe Epoptae having sustained all those fiery trials, heard and seen every thing requisite, taken upon them the vows and engagements above narrated, and, in a word, having thrown themselves good soldiers of Ceres and Proserpine, were now declared perfect men. They might, like Cebes's virtuous man, travel wherever they chose; those wild beasts (the human passions) which tyrannize over the rest of mankind, and often destroy them, had no longer dominion over them. They were now not only perfect but regenerated men. They were now crowned with laurel, as was said above, and dismissed with two barbarous words \u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6, \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2, \u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2, of which perhaps the hierophants themselves did not comprehend the import. They had been introduced by the first Egyptian missionaries, and retained in the sacra after their signification was lost. This was a common practice among the Greeks. In the administration of their religious ceremonies, they retained many names of persons, places, things, customs, &c., which had been introduced by the Phoenicians and Egyptians, from whom they borrowed their system of idolatry. These terms constituted the language of the gods, so often mentioned by the prince of poets. To us the words in question appear to be Syriac, and to signify, Be vigilant, be innocent.\n\nNumerous and important were the advantages supposed to redound to the initiated, from their being admitted to partake of the mysteries, both in this life and that which is to come. First, They were highly honoured, and even revered, by their contemporaries. Indeed, they were looked up to as a kind of sacred persons: they were, in reality, consecrated to Ceres and Proserpine. Secondly, They were obliged by their oath to practise every virtue, religious, moral, political, public, and private. Thirdly, They imagined, that sound advice and happy measures of conduct were suggested to the initiated by the Eleusinian godesses. Accordingly, says Pericles the celebrated Athenian statesman, \"I am convinced, that the deities of Eleusis inspired me with this sentiment, and that this stratagem was suggested by the principle of the mystic rites.\" There is a beautiful passage in Arifophanes's comedy of the Ranae to the very same purpose, of which we shall subjoin the following periphrasis. It is sung by the chorus of the initiated.\n\nLet us to flowr'y meads repair,\nWith deathless roses blooming,\nWhole balmy sweets impregn the air,\nBoth hills and dales perfuming,\nSince fate benign our choir has join'd,\nWe'll trip in mystic measure;\nIn sweetest harmony combin'd\nWe'll quaff full draughts of pleasure.\nFor us alone the pow'r of day\nA milder light dispenses;\nAnd sheds benign a mellow'd ray\nTo cheer our ravish'd senses:\nFor we beheld the mystic show,\nAnd brav'd Eleusis' dangers.\nWe do and know the deeds we owe\nTo neighbours, friends, and strangers.\n\nEuripides, in his Bacchae (E), introduces the chorus extolling the happiness of those who had been acquainted with God, by participating in the holy mysteries, and whose minds had been enlightened by the mystical rites. They boast, \"that they had led a holy and unblemished life, from the time that they had been initiated in the sacred rites of Jupiter Idaeus, and from the time that they had inquired celebrating the nocturnal rites of Bacchus, and the banquets of raw flesh torn off living animals.\" To this sanctity of life they had no doubt engaged themselves, when they were initiated in the mysteries of that god. The Eleusinian Epoptae derived the same advantages from their sacramental engagements. Fourthly, The initiated were imagined to be the peculiar wards of the Eleusinian godesses. These deities were supposed to watch over them, and often to avert impending danger, and to rescue them when beset with troubles.\u2014Our readers will not imagine that the initiated reaped much benefit from the protection of his Eleusinian tutelary deities; but it was sufficient that they believed\n\n(f) At I. near the beginning, and in many other places.\ned the fact, and actually depended upon their interposition. Fifthly, The happy influences of the telet\u00e6 were supposed to administer consolation to the Epopoe in the hour of dissolution; for, says Hippocrates, \"Ceres bestowed upon the Athenians two gifts of the greatest importance; the fruits of the earth, which were the cause of our no longer leading a savage course of life; and the telet\u00e6, for they who partake of these entertain more pleasant hopes both at the end of life, and eternity afterwards.\" Another author tells us, \"that the initiated were not only often released from many hardships in their lifetime, but at death entertained hopes that they should be raised to a more happy condition.\" Sixthly, After death, in the Elysian fields, they were to enjoy superior degrees of felicity, and were to bask in eternal sunshine, to quaff nectar, and feast upon ambrosia, &c.\n\nThe priests were not altogether disinterested in this salutary process. They made their disciples believe, that the souls of the uninited, when they arrived in the infernal regions, should roll in mire and dirt, and with very great difficulty arrive at their destined mansion. Hence Plato introduces Socrates observing, \"that the fates who introduced the telet\u00e6 had positively affirmed, that whatever soul should arrive in the infernal mansions unhonored and unannounced, should lie there immersed in mire and filth.\" And as to a future state (says Ariftides), \"the initiated shall not roll in mire and grope in darkness; a fate which awaits the unholy and uninited.\" It is not hard to conceive with what a commanding influence such doctrines as these must have operated on the generality of mankind.\n\nWhen the Athenians advised Diogenes to get himself initiated, and enforced their arguments with the above considerations, \"It will be pretty enough (replied the philosopher) to see Agelaius and Epaminondas wallowing in the mire, while the most contemptible rascals who have been initiated are strutting in the islands of bliss.\"\n\nWhen Antisthenes was to be initiated in the Orphic mysteries, and the priest was boasting of the many astonishing benefits which the initiated should enjoy in a future state, \"Why, forsooth, (says Antisthenes), 'tis wonder your reverence don't hang yourself in order to come at them sooner.\"\n\nWhen such benefits were expected to be derived from the mysteries, no wonder if all the world crowded to the Eleusinian standard. After the Macedonian conquests, the hierophants abated much of their original strictness. By the age of Cicero, Eleusis was a temple whither all nations resorted to partake of the benefits of that institution. We find that almost all the great men of Rome were initiated. The hierophants, however, would not admit Nero on account of the profligacy of his character. Few others were refused that honour; even the children of the Athenians were admitted. But this, we think, was rather a lustration or consecration, than an initiation. Perhaps it paved the way for the more august ceremony, as the Christian baptism does among us for the other sacrament.\n\nThat this institution gradually degenerated, can hardly be questioned; but how much, and in what points, we have not been able to investigate. The fathers of the church, from whom that charge is chiefly to be collected, are not always to be trusted, especially when they set themselves to arraign the institutions of Paganism. There were indeed several ancient authors, such as Melanthius, Menander, Sotades, &c., who wrote purposely on the subject in question; but their works are long since irrecoverably lost. For this reason, modern writers, who have professedly handled it, have not always been successful in their researches. The two who have laboured most indefatigably, and perhaps most successfully, in this field, are Meurinus and Warburton. The former, in his Liber Singularis, has collected every thing that can be gleaned from antiquity relating to the ceremonial of these institutions, without, however, pointing out their original, or elucidating the end and import of their establishment. The latter has drawn them into the vortex of a system which has in many instances led him to ascribe to them a higher degree of merit than we think they deserve. These instances we would willingly have noticed in our progress, had the limits prescribed us admitted such a digression.\n\nIf we may believe Diodorus the Sicilian, these mysteries, which were celebrated with such wonderful secrecy at Eleusis, were communicated to all mankind among the Cretans. This, however, we think, is rather problematical. We imagine that excellent historian has confounded the mysteries of Cybele with those of the Eleusinian Ceres. These two deities were undoubtedly one and the same, that is, the moon or the earth. Hence it is probable, that there was a striking resemblance between the sacred mysteries of the Cretans and Eleusinians.\n\nThis institution continued in high reputation to the age of St Jerome, as appears from the following passage: \"Hierophant\u00e6 quoque Atheniensium legant usque hodie ciuitate forbitione castrari.\" The emperor Valentinianus intended to have suppressed them; but Zozimus informs us, that he was diverted from his design by the powerful of Greece. At length Jovia Theodosius the elder, by an imperial edict, prohibited the celebration of these as well as of all the other far by the emperors of Paganism. These mysteries, instituted in the period just mentioned, that is, near 2000 years; during which space, the celebration of them never had been interrupted but once. When Alexander the Great massacred the Thebans and razed their city, the Athenians were so much affected with this melancholy event, that they neglected the celebration of that festival.\n\nThere were almost numberless other mysterious institutions among the ancient Pagans, of which these mysteries sketched above were the most celebrated. The Samothracian mysteries, instituted in honour of the Cabiri, were likewise of considerable celebrity, and were supposed to confer much the same blessings with the Eleusinian, but were not of equal celebrity. The Cabiri were Phoenician and likewise Egyptian deities. The learned Bochart has explained their origin and name, number, names, and some part of their worship. The Orphic mysteries were likewise famous among the Thracians. Orpheus learned them in Egypt, and they were nearly the same with the sacra Bacchanalia of the Greeks. There were likewise the mysteries of...\nof Jupiter Id\u00e6us in great request among the Cretans, those of the Magna Mater or Cybele, celebrated in Phrygia. To enumerate and detail all these would require a complete volume. We hope our readers will be fully satisfied with the specimen exhibited above. We are convinced many things have been omitted which might have been inserted, but we have collected the most curious and the most important.\u2014Every one of the positions might have been authenticated by quotations from authors of the most undoubted credibility, but that process would have swelled the article beyond all proportion.","sp":199,"ep":204},{"h":"MYSTICAL","t":"something mysterious or allegorical. Some of the commentators on the sacred writings, besides a literal find also a mystical meaning. The sense of Scripture, say they, is either that immediately signified by the words and expressions in the common use of language; or it is mediate, sublime, typical, and mystical. The literal sense they again divide into proper literal, which is contained in the words taken simply and properly; and metaphorical literal, where the words are to be taken in a figurative and metaphorical sense. The mystical sense of Scripture they divide into three kinds: the first corresponding to faith, and called allegorical; the second to hope, called anagogical; and the third to charity, called the tropological sense. And sometimes they take the same word in Scripture in all the four senses: thus the word Jerusalem literally signifies the capital of Judea: allegorically, the church militant; tropologically, a believer; and anagogically, heaven. So, that passage in Genesis, let there be light, and there was light, literally signifies corporeal light; by an allegory, the Messiah; in the tropological sense, grace; and anagogically, beatitude, or the light of glory.","sp":204,"ep":204},{"h":"MYSTICS","t":"mystics, a kind of religious sect, distinguished by their professing pure, sublime, and perfect devotion, with an entire disinterested love of God, free from all selfish considerations.\n\nThe mystics, to excuse their fanatic ecstasies and amorous extravagancies, allege that passage of St Paul, The Spirit prays in us by sighs and groans that are unutterable. Now, if the Spirit, say they, pray in us, we must resign ourselves to its motion, and be swayed and guided by its impulse, by remaining in a state of mere inaction.\n\nPassive contemplation is that state of perfection to which the mystics all aspire.\n\nThe authors of this mystic science, which sprung up towards the close of the third century, are not known; but the principles from which it was formed are manifest. Its first promoters proceeded from the known doctrine of the Platonic school, which was also adopted by Origen and his disciples, that the divine nature was diffused through all human souls, or that the faculty of reason, from which proceed the health and vigour of the mind, was an emanation from God into the human soul, and comprehended in it the principles and elements of all truth, human and divine. They denied that men could by labour or study excite this celestial flame in their breasts; and therefore they disapproved highly of the attempts of those, who by definitions, abstract theorems, and profound speculations, endeavoured to form distinct notions of truth, and to discover its hidden nature. On the contrary, they maintained that silence, tranquillity, repose, and solitude, accompanied with such acts as might tend to extenuate and exhaust the body, were the means by which the hidden and internal word was excited to produce its latent virtues, and to instruct men in the knowledge of divine things. For thus they reasoned; those who behold with a noble contempt all human affairs, who turn away their eyes from terrestrial vanities, and shut all the avenues of the outward senses against the contagious influences of a material world, must necessarily return to God, when the spirit is thus disengaged from the impediments that prevented that happy union. And in this blest frame they not only enjoy inexplicable raptures from their communion with the Supreme Being, but also are invested with the ineliminable privilege of contemplating truth undefiled and uncorrupted in its native purity, while others behold it in a vitiated and delusive form.\n\nThe number of the mystics increased in the fourth century, under the influence of the Grecian fanatic, who gave himself out for Dionysius the Areopagite, disciple of St Paul, and probably lived about this period; and by pretending to higher degrees of perfection than other Christians, and practising greater austerity, their cause gained ground, especially in the eastern provinces, in the fifth century. A copy of the pretended works of Dionysius was sent by Balbus to Lewis the Meek, in the year 824, which kindled the holy flame of mysticism in the western provinces, and filled the Latins with the most enthusiastic admiration of this new religion.\n\nIn the twelfth century, these mystics took the lead in their method of expounding Scripture; and by searching for mysteries and hidden meaning in the plainest expressions, forced the word of God into a conformity with their visionary doctrines, their enthusiastic feelings, and the system of discipline which they had drawn from the excursions of their irregular fancies. In the thirteenth century, they were the most formidable antagonists of the schoolmen; and towards the close of the fourteenth, many of them resided and propagated their tenets almost in every part of Europe.

Is a term compounded of two Greek words, and in its original import it signifies any kind of fabulous doctrine; in its more appropriated sense, it means those fabulous details concerning the objects of worship which were invented and propagated by men who lived in the early ages of the world, and by them transmitted to succeeding generations, either by written records or by oral tradition.\n\nAs the theology and mythology of the ancients are almost inseparably connected, it will be impossible for us to develop the latter, without often introducing some observations relating to the former. We must therefore entreat the indulgence of our readers, if upon many occasions we would hazard a few structures on the names, characters, adventures, and functions of such Pagan divinities as may have furnished materials for those fabulous narrations which the nature of the subject may lead us to discuss.\n\nWith respect to fable, it may be observed in general, that it is a creature of the human imagination, and derives its birth from that love of the marvellous which is in a manner congenial to the soul of man. The appearances of nature which every day occur, objects, actions, and events, which succeed each other, by a kind of routine, are too familiar, too obvious, and uninteresting, either to gratify curiosity or to excite admiration. On the other hand, when the most common phenomena in nature or life are new modelled by the plastic power of a warm imagination; when they are diversified, compounded, embellished, or even arranged and moulded into forms which seldom or perhaps never occur in the ordinary course of things\u2014novelty generates admiration, a passion always attended with delightful sensations. Here then we imagine we have discovered the very source of fiction and fable. They originated from that powerful propensity in our nature towards the new and surprising, animated by the delight with which the contemplation of them is generally attended.\n\nMany circumstances contributed to extend and establish the empire of fable. The legislator laid hold on this bias of human nature, and of course employed fable and fiction as the most effectual means to civilize a rude, unpolished world. The philosopher, the theologian, the poet, the musician, each in his turn, made use of this vehicle to convey his maxims and instructions to the savage tribes. They knew that truth, simple and unadorned, is not possessed of charms powerful enough to captivate the heart of man in his present corrupt and degenerate state. This consideration, which did indeed result from the character of their audience, naturally led them to employ fiction and allegory. From this was derived the allegorical state of the ancients, and especially of the primary sages of the east.\n\nThough almost every nation on the face of the globe, however remote from the centre of population, however savage and averse from cultivation, has fabricated the oriental and adopted its own system of mythology; the Orientals, however, have distinguished themselves in a peculiar manner, by the boldness, the inconsistency, and the extravagance of their mythology. The genial warmth of those happy climes, the fertility of the soil, which afforded every necessity, every convenience, and often every luxury of life, without depleting their spirits by laborious exertions; the face of nature perpetually blooming around them, the skies smiling with uninterrupted fertility; all contributed to inspire the Orientals with a glow of fancy and a vigour of imagination rarely to be met with in less happy regions. Hence every object was swelled beyond its natural dimensions. Nothing was great or little in moderation, but every sentiment was heightened with incredible hyperbole. The magnificent, the sublime, the vast, the enormous, the marvellous, first sprung up, and were brought to maturity, in those native regions of fable and fairy land. As nature, in the ordinary course of her operations, exhibited neither objects nor effects adequate to the extent of their romantic imaginations, they naturally deviated into the fields of fiction and fable. Of consequence, the custom of detailing fabulous adventures originated in the east, and was from thence transplanted into the western countries.\n\nAs the allegorical taste of the eastern nations had sprung from their propensity to fable, and as that propensity had in its turn originated from the love of the marvellous; so did allegory in process of time contribute its influence towards multiplying fables and fiction almost in infinitum. The latent import of the allegorical doctrines being in a few ages lost and obliterated, what was originally a moral or theological tenet, assumed the air and habit of a personal adventure.\n\nThe propensity towards personification, almost universal among the Orientals, was another fruitful source to personify of fable and allegory. That the people of the east were strongly inclined to personify inanimate objects and abstract ideas, we imagine will be readily granted, when it is considered, that in the formation of language they have generally annexed the affixion of sex to those objects. Hence the distinction of grammatical genders, which is known to have originated in the eastern parts of the world. The practice of personifying virtues, vices, religious and moral affections, was necessary to support that allegorical style which universally prevailed in those countries. This mode of writing was in high reputation even in Europe some centuries ago; and to it we are indebted for some of the most noble poetical compositions now extant in our own language. Those productions, however, are but faint imitations of the original mode of writing still current among the eastern nations. The Europeans derived this species of composition from the Moorish inhabitants of Spain, who imported it from Arabia, their original country.\n\nThe general use of hieroglyphics in the east, must have contributed largely towards extending the empire of mythology. As the import of the figures employed in this method of delineating the signs of thought, ideas was in a great measure arbitrary, mistakes must have\nhave been frequently committed in ascertaining the notions which they were at the first intended to represent. When the development of these arbitrary signs happened to be attended with uncommon difficulty, the expounders were obliged to have recourse to conjecture. These conjectural expositions were for the most part tinctured with that bias towards the marvellous which universally prevailed among the primitive men. This we find is the case even at this day, when moderns attempt to develop the purport of emblematical figures, preferred on ancient medals, entaglions, &c.\n\nThe wise men of the east delighted in obscure enigmatical sentences. They seem to have disdained every sentiment obvious to vulgar apprehension. The words of the wise, and their dark sayings, often occur in the most ancient records both sacred and profane. The sages of antiquity used to vie with each other for the prize of superior wisdom, by propounding riddles, and dark and mysterious questions, as subjects of investigation. The contest between Solomon and Hiram, and that between Amasis king of Egypt and Polycrates tyrant of Samos, are universally known\u2014As the import of those enigmatical propositions was often absolutely lost, in ages when the art of writing was little known, and still less practised, nothing remained but fancy and conjecture, which always verged towards the regions of fable. This then, we think, was another source of mythology.\n\nThe Pagan priests, especially in Egypt, were probably the first who reduced mythology to a kind of system. The sacerdotal tribe, among that people, were the grand depositories of learning as well as of religion. That order of men monopolized all the arts and sciences. They seem to have formed a conspiracy among themselves, to preclude the laity from all the avenues of intellectual improvement. This plan was adopted with a view to keep the laity in subjection, and to enhance their own importance. To accomplish this end, they contrived to perform all the ministrations of their religion in an unknown tongue, and to cover them with a thick veil of fable and allegory. The language of Ethiopia became their sacred dialect, and hieroglyphics their sacred character.\u2014Egypt, of course, became a kind of fairy land, where all was jugglery, magic, and enchantment. The initiated alone were admitted to the knowledge of the occult mystical exhibitions, which, in their hands, constituted the essence of their religion. From these the vulgar and profane were prohibited by the most rigorous penalties (see Mysteries). The Egyptians, and indeed all the ancients without exception, deemed the mysteries of religion too sacred and solemn to be communicated to the herd of mankind, naked and unrevealed; a mode by which they imagined those sacred and sublime oracles would have been defiled and degraded. \"Procul, & procul est profani\u2014Odi profanum vulgus et arceo.\" Egypt was the land of graven images; allegory and mythology were the veil which concealed religion from the eyes of the vulgar; fable was the groundwork of that impenetrable covering.\n\nIn the earliest and most unpolished stage of society we cannot suppose fable to have existed among men. Fables are always tales of other times, but at this period other times did not reach far enough backward to afford those fruits of the imagination sufficient time to arrive at maturity. Fable requires a considerable space of time to acquire credibility, and to rise into reputation. Accordingly, we find that both the Chinese and Egyptians, the two most ancient nations whose annals have reached our times, were altogether unacquainted with fabulous details in the most early and least improved periods of their respective monarchies. It has been shown almost to a demonstration, by a variety of learned men, that both the one and the other people, during some centuries after the general deluge, retained and practised the primitive Noahic religion, in which fable and fancy could find no place; all was genuine unpolished truth.\n\nAs soon as the authentic tradition concerning the origin of the universe was either in a good measure lost, or at least adulterated by the inventions of men, fable and fiction began to prevail. The Egyptian Thoth or Thothy, or Mercury Trismegistus, and Mo\u00eb Fabulous the Phoenician, undertook to account for the formation and arrangement of the universe, upon principles purely mechanical. Here fable began to usurp logical doctrine, the place of genuine historical truth. Accordingly, tails, we find that all the historians of antiquity, who have undertaken to give a general detail of the affairs of the world, have ultered in their narrations with a fabulous cosmogony. Here imagination ranged unconfined over the boundless extent of the primary chaos. To be convinced of the truth of this assertion, we need only look into Sanchoniathon's Cosmogony, Euseb. Prep. Evang. l. i. sub init. and Diodorus Sic. l. i. From this we suppose it will follow, that the first race of fables owed their birth to the erroneous opinions of the formation of the universe.\n\nHaving now endeavoured to point out the origin of mythology, or fabulous traditions, we shall proceed to lay before our readers a brief detail of the mythology of the most respectable nations of antiquity, following the natural order of their situation.\n\nThe Chinese, if any credit be due to their own annals, or to the missionaries of the church of Rome, who mythology pretend to have copied from them, were the first of the nations. Their fabulous records reach upwards many myriads of years before the Mosaic era of the creation. The events during that period of time, if any had been recorded, must have been fabulous as the period itself. These, however, are buried in eternal oblivion. The missionaries, who are the only sources of our information with relation to the earliest periods of the Chinese history, represent those people as having retained the religion of Noah many centuries after the foundation of their empire. Upon this supposition, their cosmogony must have been found and genuine, without the least tincture of those fabulous ingredients which have both disguised and disgraced the cosmogonies of most other nations.\n\nAccording to the most authentic accounts, Fo-hi laid the foundation of that empire about four thousand years ago. This emperor, according to the Chinese, was conceived in a miraculous manner. His mother, say they, one day as she was walking in a desert place, was surrounded by a rainbow; and, being impregnated by this meteor, was in due time delivered of that celebrated legislator. This personage, like the Athenian Cecrops, was half a man and half a serpent.\nHis intellectual powers were truly hyperbolic. In one day he discovered 50 different species of poisonous herbs. He taught his countrymen the whole art of agriculture in the space of a very few years. He instructed them how to sow five different sorts of grain. He invented boats, and nets for fishing, the art of fabricating porcelain, the management of silk worms, the manufacturing of silk, &c. In a word, that wonderful personage was inspired by Heaven with knowledge, which qualified him for composing that incomparable body of laws which are even at this day the wonder of the world. Our readers will admit, that this whole detail is fabulous and chimerical. The most learned part of them will readily observe, that the Chinese, in ascribing the invention of all the useful arts to their Foht, are perfectly agreed with almost all the other nations of antiquity. The Indians ascribe every invention to Budha, or Vishnu, or Foe; the Persians to Zerdusht or Zarathustra; the Chaldeans to their man of the sea, whom they call Gannes; the Egyptians to Thoth or Thothot; the Phoenicians to Melicerta; the Greeks to the family of the Titans; and the Scandinavians to Odin, &c.\n\nAbout 551 years before the Christian era, appeared the famous Chinese philosopher Confucius or Confucius. Concerning the birth of this prince of philosophers, the Chinese have propagated the following legendary tale. His mother, walking in a solitary place, was impregnated by the vivifying influence of the heavens. The babe, thus produced, spoke and reasoned as soon as it was born. Confucius, however, wrought no miracles, performed no romantic exploits, but lived an austere ascetic life, taught and inculcated the doctrines of pure morality, and died, remarkable only for superior wisdom, religious, moral, and political.\n\nAbout the year of Christ 601, flourished the sectary Lao-tseun. His mother carried him 30 years in her womb, and was at last delivered of him under a plum-tree. This philosopher was the Epicurus of the Chinese. His disciples, who were denominated Fao-ffe, i.e. heavenly doctors, were the first who corrupted the religion of the Chinese. They were addicted to magic, and introduced the worship of good and bad demons. Their doctrine was embraced by a long succession of emperors. One of these princes, called Yiu-ti, had been deprived by death of a favourite mistress, whom he loved with the most extravagant passion. The emperor, by the magical skill of one of these doctors, obtained an interview with his deceased mistress, a circumstance which riveted the whole order in the affections and esteem of the deluded prince. Here our readers will observe the exact counterpart of the fable of Eurydice, so famous in the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. That such a system of religious principles must have abounded with mythological adventures is highly probable; but as the missionaries, to whom we are chiefly indebted for our information relation to the religion of the Chinese, have not taken the pains to record them, we find it impossible to gratify the curiosity of our readers on that head.\n\nThe worship of the idol Fo, or Foe, was transplanted from India into China about the 56th year of the Christian era, upon the following occasion. One of the doctors of the Fao-ffe had promised a prince of the family of Tchou, and brother of the emperor Ming-ti, to make him enter into communion with the spirits. At this solicitation an ambassador was despatched into India, in order to inquire where the true religion was to be found. There had been a tradition, lay the missionaries, ever since the age of Confucius, that the true religion was to be found in the west. The ambassador kept short in India; and finding that the god Foe was in high reputation in that country, he collected several images of that deity painted on chintz, and with it 42 chapters of the canonical books of the Hindoos, which, together with the images, he laid on a white elephant, and transported into his native country. At the same time he imported from the same quarter the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, which is firmly believed in China to this day. The doctrine and worship of Foe, thus introduced, made a most rapid progress all over China, Japan, Siam, &c. The priests of Foe are called among the Siamese, Talopogos; by the Tartars, Lamas; by the Chinese, Ha-chong; and by the people of Japan, Bonzos. By this last appellation they are generally known in Europe.\n\nAn infinitude of fables was invented and propagated by the disciples of Foe, concerning the life and adventures of their master. If the earlier ages of the Chinese history are barren of mythological incidents, the later periods, after the introduction of the worship of Foe, furnish an inexhaustible store of miracles, monsters, fables, intrigues, exploits, and adventures, of the most villainous complexion. Indeed, most of them are so absurd, so ridiculous, and at the same time so impious and profane, that we are convinced our readers will easily dispense with a detail from which they could reap neither entertainment nor instruction. Such as may find themselves disposed to rake into this abominable puddle, we must refer to the reverend fathers Du Halde, Complet, Amiot, Kircher, and other members of the propaganda, in whose writings they will find wherewithal to satisfy, and even to satiate, their appetite.\n\nThe Hindoos, like the other nations of the east, for a long time retained the worship of the true God. At length, however, idolatry broke in, and, like an insatiable torrent, overwhelmed the country. First of all, the genuine history of the origin of the universe was either utterly lost, or disguised under a variety of fictions and allegories. We are told that Brimha, the supreme divinity of the Hindoos, after three several efforts, at last succeeded in creating four persons, whom he appointed to rule over all the inferior creatures. Afterwards Brimha joined his efficient power with Bithon and Rulder; and by their united exertions they produced ten men, whose general appellation is Munies, that is, the inspired. The same being, according to another mythology, produced four other persons, as imaginary as the former; one from his breast, one from his back, one from his lip, and one from his heart. These children were denominated Bangs; the import of which word we cannot pretend to determine. According to another tradition, Brimha produced the Bramins from his mouth, to pray, to read, to instruct; the Chiltern from his arms, to draw the bow, to fight, to govern; the Bice from his belly or thighs, to nourish, to provide the necessaries of life by agriculture and commerce; the Soder from his feet, for subjection,\nsubjection, to serve, to labour, to travel. The reader will see at once, in these allegorical persons, the four calls or fests into which the Hindoo nations have, time immemorial, been divided. These are some of their most celebrated mythological traditions with relation to the origin of the universe.\n\nThe Hindoos have likewise some mythological opinions which seem to relate to the general deluge. They tell us, that defining the preservation of herds and of brahmans, of genii and of virtuous men, of vedas of law, and of precious things, the Lord of the universe assumes many bodily shapes; but though he pervades, like the air, a variety of beings, yet he is himself unvaried, since he has no quality in him subject to change. At the close of the last kalpa, there was a general destruction, occasioned by the sleep of Brahma, whence his creatures in different worlds were drowned in a vast ocean. Brahma being inclined to slumber after a lapse of so many ages, the strong demon Hyagriva came near him, and stole the vedas which had flowed from his lips. When Hirni, the preserver of the universe, discovered this deed of the prince of Dainavas, he took the shape of a minute fish called Sap-hari. After various transformations, and an enormous increase of size in each of them, the Lord of the universe loving the righteous man (A), who had still adhered to him under all these various shapes, and intending to preserve him from the sea of destruction caused by the depravity of the age, thus told him how he was to act: \"In seven days from the present time, O thou tamer of enemies! the three worlds will be plunged in an ocean of death; but in the midst of the destroying waves a large vessel sent by me for thy use shall stand before thee.\" The remaining part of the mythology so nearly resembles the Mosaic history of Noah and the general deluge, that the former may be a strong confirmation of the truth of the latter. To dry up the waters of the deluge, the power of the Deity descends in the form of a boar, the symbol of strength, to draw up and support on his tusks the whole earth, which had been sunk beneath the ocean. Again, the same power is represented as a tortoise sustaining the globe, which had been convulsed by the violent assaults of demons, while the gods charmed the sea with the mountain Mandar, and forced it to disgorge the sacred things and animals, together with the water of life which it had swallowed. All these stories, we think, relate to the same event, shadowed by a moral, a metaphysical, and an astronomical allegory; and all three seem connected with the hieroglyphical sculptures of the old Egyptians.\n\nThe Hindoos divide the duration of the world into four yugas or jugs, or jogs, each consisting of a prodigious number of years. In each of those periods, the age and stature of the human race have been gradually diminished; and in each of them mankind has gradually declined in virtue and piety, as well as in age and stature. The present period they call the Colla, i.e., the corrupt jug, which they say is to last 400,000 years, of which near 5000 years are already past. In the last part of the preceding jug, which they call the dura paar, the age of man was contracted into 1000 years, as in the present it is confined to 300. From this proportional diminution of the length of the human life, our readers will probably infer, that the two last jogs bear a pretty near resemblance to the Mosaic history of the age of the antediluvian and postdiluvian patriarchs; and that the two first are imaginary periods prior to the creation of the world, like those of the Chinese, Chaldeans, and Egyptians.\n\nAccording to the mythology of the Hindoos, the world system of the world is subject to various dilutions, arising from revolutions. At the conclusion of the Colla jogs, say they, a grand revolution will take place, and when the solar system will be consumed by fire, and all the elements reduced to their original constituent atoms. Upon the back of these revolutions, Brimha, the supreme deity of the Hindoos, is sometimes represented as a new born infant, with his toe in his mouth, floating on a camala or water flower, sometimes only on a leaf of that plant, on the surface of the vast abyss. At other times he is figured as coming forth of a winding shell; and again as blowing up the mundane foam with a pipe at his mouth. Some of these emblematical figures and attitudes, our learned readers will probably observe, nearly resemble those of the ancient Egyptians.\n\nBut the vulgar religion of the ancient Hindoos was of a very different complexion, and opens a large field of mythological adventures. We have observed above, that the Fo or Foe of the Chinese was imported from India; and now we shall give a brief detail of the mythological origin of that divinity. We have no certain Birth, &c., account of the birth-place of this imaginary deity\u2014of the god Fo. His followers relate, that he was born in one of the kingdoms of India near the line, and that his father was one of that country. His mother brought him into the world by the left side, and expired soon after her delivery. At the time of her conception, she dreamed that she had swallowed a white elephant; a circumstance which is supposed to have given birth to the veneration which the kings of India have always shown for a white animal of that species. As soon as he was born, he had strength enough to stand erect without assistance. He walked abroad at seven, and, pointing with one hand to the heavens, and with the other to the earth, he cried out, \"In the heavens, and on the earth, there is no one but me who deserves to be honoured.\" At the age of 30, he felt himself all on a sudden filled with the divinity; and now he was metamorphosed into Fo or Pagod, according to the expression of the Hindoos. He had no sooner declared himself a divinity, than he thought of propagating his doctrine, and proving his divine mission by miracles. The number of his disciples was immense; and they soon spread his dogmas over all India, and even to the higher extremities of Asia.\n\nOne of the principal doctrines which Fo and his disciples propagated, was the metempsychosis or transmigration of souls. This doctrine, some imagine, has been given\n\n(A) He was Sovereign of the world. His name was Manu, or Satgavrata; his patronymic name was Vaijvata, or Child of the Sun.\ngiven rise to the multitude of idols reverenced in every country where the worship of Fo is established. Quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and the vilest animals, had temples erected for them; because, say they, the soul of the god, in his numerous transmigrations, may have at one time or other inhabited their bodies.\n\nBoth the doctrine of transmigration and of the worship of animals seems, however, to have been imported from Egypt into India. If the intercourse between these two countries was begun at so early a period as some very late writers have endeavoured to prove, such a supposition is by no means improbable. The doctrine of the transmigration of souls was early established among the Egyptians. It was, indeed, the only idea they formed of the soul's immortality. The worship of animals among them seems to have been still more ancient. If such an intercourse did actually exist, we may naturally suppose that colonies of Egyptian priests found their way into India, as they did afterwards into Asia Minor, Italy, and Greece. That colonies of Egyptians did actually penetrate into that country, and settle there, many centuries before the Nativity, is a fact that cannot be called in question, for reasons which the bounds prescribed us in this article will not allow us to enumerate. We shall only observe, that from the hieroglyphical representations of the Egyptian deities seem to have originated those monstrous idols which from time immemorial have been worshipped in India, China, Japan, Siam, and even in the remotest parts of Asiatic Tartary.\n\nFo is often called Budha, or Buddha, and sometimes Viflhou; perhaps, indeed, he may be distinguished by many other names, according to the variety of dialects of the different nations among which his worship was established. An infinite number of fables was propagated by his disciples concerning him after his death. They pretended that his matter was still alive; that he had been already born 8000 times, and that he had successively appeared under the figure of an ape, a lion, a dragon, an elephant, a boar, &c. These were called the incarnations of Viflhou. At length he was confounded with the supreme God; and all the titles, attributes, operations, perfections, and enigms of the Most High were ascribed to him. Sometimes he is called Amida, and represented with the head of a dog, and worshipped as the guardian of mankind. He sometimes appears as a princely personage, issuing from the mouth of a fish. At other times, he wears a lunette on his head, in which are seen cities, mountains, towers, trees, in short, all that the world contains. These transformations are evidently the children of allegorical or hieroglyphical emblems, and form an exact counterpart to the symbolical worship of the Egyptians.\n\nThe enormous mass of mythological traditions which have in a manner deluged the vast continent of India, would fill many volumes: We have selected the preceding articles as a specimen only, by which our readers may be qualified to judge of the rest. If they find themselves disposed to indulge their curiosity at greater length, we must remit them to Th\u00e9venot's and Hamilton's Travels, to Mons. Anquetil in his Zond Avesta, Hall\u00e9's Introduction to his Translation of the Code of Gentoo Laws, Col. Dow's History of Hindostan, Grose's Voyage to the East Indies, Asiatic Researches, vol. i. and ii.\n\nThe mythology of the Persians is, if possible, still more extravagant than that of the Hindoos. It supposes the world to have been repeatedly destroyed, and repeopled by creatures of different formation, who were successively annihilated or banished for their disobedience to the supreme Being. The monstrous griffin Sinergh tells the hero Calherman that he had already lived to see the earth seven times filled with creatures and seven times a perfect void: that before the creation of Adam, this globe was inhabited by a race of beings called Peri and Dives, whose characters formed a perfect contrast. The Peri are described as beautiful and benevolent; the Dives as deformed, malevolent, and mischievous, differing from infernal demons only in this, that they are not as yet confined to the pit of hell. They are for ever ranging over the world, to scatter discord and misery among the sons of men. The Peri nearly resemble the fairies of Europe; and perhaps the Dives gave birth to the giants and magicians of the middle ages. The Peri and Dives wage incessant wars; and when the Dives make any of the Peri prisoners, they shut them up in iron cages, and hang them on the highest trees, to expose them to public view, and to the fury of every chilling blast.\n\nWhen the Peri are in danger of being overpowered by their foes, they solicit the assistance of some mortal hero; which produces a series of mythological adventures, highly ornamental to the strains of the Persian bards, and which, at the same time, furnishes an inexhaustible fund of the most diversified machinery.\n\nOne of the most celebrated adventurers in the mythology of Persia is Tahmuras, one of their most ancient monarchs. This prince performs a variety of exploits, while he endeavours to recover the fairy Merjan. He attacks the Dive Demnuth in his own cave; where, having vanquished the giant or demon, he finds vast piles of hoarded wealth: there he carries off with the fair captive. The battles, labours, and adventures of Rostan, another Persian worthy, who lived many ages after the former, are celebrated by the Persian bards with the same extravagance of hyperbole with which the labours of Hercules have been sung by the poets of Greece and Rome.\n\nThe adventures of the Persian heroes breathe all the wildness of achievement recorded of the knights' birthplace of Gothic romance. The doctrine of enchantments, chivalry, transformations, &c., exhibited in both, is a characteristic symptom of one common original. Persia is the genuine clastic ground of eastern mythology, and the source of the ideas of chivalry and romance; from which they were propagated to the regions of Scandinavia, and indeed to the remotest corners of Europe towards the west.\n\nPerhaps our readers may be of our opinion, when we offer it as a conjecture, that the tales of the war of the Peri and Dives originated from a vague tradition concerning good and bad angels; nor is it, in our opinion, improbable, that the fable of the wars between the gods and giants, so famous in the mythology of Greece and Italy, was imported into the former of these countries from the same quarter. For a more particular account of the Persian mythology, our readers may consult Dr. Hyde.\nThe mythology of the Chaldeans, like that of the other nations of the east, commences at a period myriads of years prior to the era of the Mosaic creation. Their cosmogony, exhibited by Berosus, who was a priest of Belus, and deeply versed in the antiquities of his country, is a piece of mythology of the most extravagant nature. It has been copied by Eusebius (Chron. lib. i. p. 5); it is likewise to be found in Syncellus, copied from Alexander Polyhistor. According to this historian, there were at Babylon written records preserved with the greatest care, comprehending a period of fifteen myriads of years. Those writings likewise contained a history of the heavens and the sea, of the earth, and of the origin of mankind. \"In the beginning (says Berosus, copying from Oannes, of whom we shall give a brief account below) there was nothing but darkness and an abyss of water, wherein reposed most hideous beings produced from a twofold principle. Men appeared with two wings; some with two and some with four faces. They had one body, but two heads; the one of a man, the other of a woman. Other human figures were to be seen, furnished with the legs and horns of goats. Some had the feet of horses behind, but before were fashioned like men, resembling hippocentaurs.\" The remaining part of this mythology is much of the same complexion; indeed so extravagant, that we imagine our readers will readily enough dispense with our translating the sequel. \"Of all these (says the author) were preferred delineations in the temple of Belus at Babylon. The person who was supposed to preside over them was called Omorea. This word, in the Chaldean language, is Thalath, which the Greeks call \u0398\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, but it more properly imports the moon. Matters being in this situation, their god (says Eusebius), the god (says Syncellus) came and cut the woman asunder; and out of one half of her he formed the earth, and out of the other he made the heavens; and, at the same time, he destroyed the monsters of the abyss.\" This whole mythology is an allegorical history copied from hieroglyphical representations, the real purport of which could not be deciphered by the author. Such, in general, were the consequences of the hieroglyphical style of writing.\n\nOannes, the great civilizer and legislator of the Chaldeans, according to Apollodorus, who copied from Berosus, was an amphibious animal of a heterogeneous appearance. He was endowed with reason and a very uncommon acuteness of parts. His whole body resembled a fish. Under the head of a fish he had also another head, and feet below similar to those of a man, which were subjoined to the tail of the fish. His voice and language were articulate and perfectly intelligible, and there was a figure of him still extant in the days of Berosus. He made his appearance in the Erythrean or Red Sea, where it borders upon Babylonia. This monstrous being conversed with men by day; but at night he plunged into the sea, and remained concealed in the water till next morning. He taught the Babylonians the use of letters, and the knowledge of all the arts and sciences. He instructed them in the method of building houses, constructing temples, and all other edifices. He taught them to compile laws and religious ceremonies, and explained to them the principles of mathematics, geometry, and astronomy. In a word he communicated to them every thing necessary, useful, and ornamental; and so universal were his instructions, that not one single article had ever been added to them since the time they were first communicated. Helladius is of opinion that this strange personage, whoever he was, came to be represented under the figure of a fish, not because he was actually believed to be such, but because he was clothed with the skin of a seal. By this account our readers will see that the Babylonian Oannes is the exact counterpart of the Fohi of the Chinese, and the Thoth or the Mercury Trismegistas of the Egyptians. It is likewise apparent, that the idea of the monster compounded of the man and the fish has originated from some hieroglyphic of that form grafted upon the appearance of man. Some modern mythologists have been of opinion, that Oannes was actually Noah the great preacher of righteousness; who, as some think, settled in Shinar or Chaldea after the deluge, and who, in consequence of his connexion with that event, might be properly represented under the emblem of the Man of the Sea.\n\nThe nativity of Venus, the goddess of beauty and The nativ- love, is another piece of mythology famous among the Babylonians and Assyrians. An egg, say they, of beauty and a prodigious size, drops from heaven into the river Euphrates. Some doves settled upon this egg, after that the fishes had rolled it to the bank. In a short time this egg produced Venus, who was afterwards called Dea Syria, the Syrian goddess. In consequence of this tradition (says Hyginus), pigeons and fishes became sacred to this goddess among the Syrians, who always abstained from eating the one or the other. Of this imaginary being we have a very exact and entertaining history in the treatise De Dea Syria, generally ascribed to Lucian.\n\nIn this mythological tradition our readers will probably discover an allusion to the celebrated Mundane egg; and at the same time the story of the fishes will lead them to anticipate the connexion between the sea and the moon. This same deity was the Atargatis of Acalon, described by Diodorus the Sicilian; the one half of her body a woman and the other a fish. This was no doubt a hieroglyphic figure of the moon, importing the influence of that planet upon the sea and the sex. The oriental name of this deity evidently points to the moon; for it is compounded of two Hebrew words (\u05d0), which import \"the queen of the half of heaven.\"\n\nThe fable of Semiramis is nearly connected with the preceding one. Diodorus Siculus has preserved this mythological history of this deity, which he and all the writers of antiquity have confounded with the Babylonian princess of the same name. That historian informs us, that the word Semiramis, in the Syrian dialect, signifies \"a wild pigeon;\" but we apprehend that this term was a name or epithet of the moon.\n\n(B) Adar or Haidar, \"magnificus;\" and God, \"exercitum turmi.\"\nmoon, as it is compounded of two words (c) of an import naturally applicable to the lunar planet. It was a general practice among the Orientals to denominate their sacred animals from that deity to which they were consecrated. Hence the moon being called Semi-rumitis, and the pigeon being sacred to her divinity, the latter was called by the name of the former.\n\nAs the bounds prescribed this article render it impossible for us to do justice to this interesting piece of mythology, we must beg leave to refer our readers for further information to Diod. Sic. lib. ii. Hyginus Poet. Alfron. Fab. 197. Pharmutus de Nat. Deor. Ovid. Metam. lib. iv. Athen. in Apol. Izettes, Chili. ix. cap. 275. Seld. de Dis Syr. Syr. ii. p. 183.\n\nWe should now proceed to the mythology of the Arabians, the far greatest part of which is however, buried in the abyss of ages; though, when we reflect on the genius and character of that people, we must be convinced that they too, as well as the other nations of the east, abounded in fabulous relations and romantic compositions. The natives of that country have always been enthusiastically addicted to poetry, of which fable is the essence. Wherever the Muses have erected their throne, fables and miracles have always appeared in their train.\n\nIn the Koran we meet with frequent allusions to well-known traditional fables. These had been transmitted from generation to generation by the bards and rhapto\u00efdits for the entertainment of the vulgar. In Arabia, from the earliest ages, it has always been one of the favourite entertainments of the common people, to assemble in the serene evenings around their tents, or on the platforms with which their houses are generally covered, or in large halls erected for the purpose, in order to amuse themselves with traditional narrations of the most distinguished actions of their most remote ancestors. Oriental imagery always embellished their romantic details. The flow of fancy, the love of the marvellous, the propensity towards the hyperbolic and the vast, which constitute the essence of oriental description, must ever have drawn the relation aside into the devious regions of fiction and fairy land.\n\nThe religion of Mahomet beat down the original fabric of idolatry and mythology together. The Arabian fables current in modern times are borrowed or imitated from Persian compositions; Persia being still the grand nursery of romance in the east.\n\nIn Egypt we find idolatry, theology, and mythology, almost inseparably blended together. The inhabitants of this region, too, as well as of others in the vicinity of the centre of population, adhered for several centuries to the worship of the true God. At last, however, conscious of their own ignorance, impurity, imperfection, and total unfitness to approach an infinitely perfect Being, distant, as they imagined, and invisible, they began to call about for some beings more exalted, and more perfect than themselves, by whose mediation they might prefer their prayers to the supreme Majesty of heaven. The luminaries of heaven, which they imagined were animated bodies, naturally presented themselves. These were splendid and glorious beings. They were thought to partake of the divine nature: they were revered as the satrapes, prefects, and representatives of the supreme Lord of the universe. They were visible, they were beneficent; they dwelt nearer to the gods, they were near at hand and always accessible. These were, of course, employed as mediators and intercessors between the supreme Divinity and his humble subjects of this lower world. Thus employed, they might claim a subordinate share of worship, which was accordingly assigned them. In process of time, however, that worship, which was originally addressed to the supreme Creator by the mediation of the heavenly bodies, was in a great measure forgotten, and the adoration of mankind ultimately terminated on those illustrious creatures. To this circumstance, we think, we may ascribe Origin of the origin of that species of idolatry called Zabibim, Zabibim, or the worship of the host of heaven, which overspread the world early and almost universally. In Egypt this mode of worship was adopted in all its most absurd and most enthusiastic forms; and at the same time the most heterogeneous mythology appeared in its train. The mythology of the ancient Egyptians was so various and multiform, so complicated and so mysterious, that it would require many volumes even to give a superficial account of its origin and progress, not only in its mother country, but even in many other parts of the eastern and western world. Besides, the idolatry and mythology of that wonderful country are so closely connected and so inseparably blended together, that it is impossible to describe the latter without at the same time developing the former. We hope, therefore, our readers will not be disappointed, if, in a work of this nature, we touch only upon some of the leading or most interesting articles of this complicated subject.\n\nThe Egyptians confounded the revolutions of the Reign of heavenly bodies with the reigns of their most early gods and monarchs. Hence the incredible number of years included in the reign of their eight superior gods, who, according to them, filled the Egyptian throne successively in the most early periods of time. To these, according to their system, succeeded twelve demigods, who likewise reigned an amazing number of years. These imaginary reigns were no other than the periodical revolutions of the heavenly bodies preserved in their almanacks, which might be carried back, and actually were carried back, at pleasure. Hence the fabulous antiquity of that kingdom. The imaginary exploits and adventures of these gods and demigods furnished an inexhaustible fund of mythological romances. To the demigods succeeded the kings of the cynic cycle, personages equally chimerical with the former. The import of this epithet has greatly perplexed critics and etymologists. We apprehend it is an oriental word importing royal dignity, elevation of rank. This appellation intimated, that the monarchs of that cycle, admitting that they actually existed, were more powerful and more highly revered than their successors. After the princes of the cynic cycle comes another race, denominated Nekyes, a title likewise implying royal, splendid, glorious. These cycles\n\n(c) Shem or Sem, \"a sign,\" and ramah, \"high.\"\ncycles figure high in the mythological annals of the Egyptians, and have furnished materials for a variety of learned and ingenious disquisitions. The wars and adventures of Osiris, Oris, Typhon, and other allegorical personages who figure in the Egyptian rubric; the wanderings of Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris; the transformation of the gods into divers kinds of animals; their birth, education, peregrinations, and exploits;\u2014compose a body of mythological fictions so various, so complicated, so ridiculous, and often so apparently absurd, that all attempts to develop and explain them have hitherto proved unsuccessful. All, or the greatest part, of those extravagant fables, are the offspring of hieroglyphical or allegorical emblems devised by the priests and sages of that nation, with a view to conceal the mysteries of their religion from that class of men whom they stigmatized with the name of the uninitiated rabble.\n\nThe worship of brute animals and of certain vegetables, universal among the Egyptians, was another exuberant source of mythological adventures. The Egyptian priests, many of whom were likewise profound philosophers, observed, or pretended to observe, a kind of analogy between the qualities of certain animals and vegetables, and those of some of their subordinate deities. Such animals and vegetables they adopted, and consecrated to the deities to whom they were supposed to bear this analogical resemblance; and in process of time they considered them as the visible emblems of those deities to which they were consecrated. By these the vulgar addressed their archetypes: in the same manner, as in other countries, pictures and statues were employed for the very same purpose. The mob, in process of time, forgetting the emblematical character of those brutes and vegetables, addressed their devotion immediately to them; and of course these became the ultimate objects of vulgar adoration.\n\nAfter that these objects, animate or inanimate, were consecrated as the visible symbols of the deities, it soon became fashionable to make use of their figures to represent those deities to which they were consecrated. This practice was the natural consequence of the hieroglyphical style which universally prevailed among the ancient Egyptians. Hence Jupiter Ammon was represented under the figure of a ram, Apis under that of a cow, Osiris of a bull, Pan of a goat, Thoth or Mercury of an ibis, Bubalis or Diana of a cat, &c. It was likewise a common practice among those deluded people to dignify these objects, by giving them the names of those deities which they represented. By this mode of dignifying these sacred emblems, the veneration of the rabble was considerably enhanced, and the ardour of their devotion inflamed in proportion. From these two sources, we think, are derived the fabulous transformations of the gods, so generally celebrated in the Egyptian mythology, and from it imported into Greece and Italy. In consequence of this practice, their mythological system was rendered at once enormous and unintelligible.\n\nTheir Thoth, or Mercury Trismegistus, was, in our opinion, the inventor of this unhappy system. This personage, according to the Egyptians, was the original author of letters, geometry, astronomy, music, architecture; in a word, of all the elegant and useful arts, and of all the branches of science and philosophy.\n\nHe it was who first discovered the analogy between the divine affections, influences, appearances, operations, and the corresponding properties, qualities, and instincts of certain animals, and the propriety of dedicating particular kinds of vegetables to the service of particular deities.\n\nThe priests, whose province it was to expound the mysteries of that allegorical hieroglyphical religion, (see Mysteries), gradually lost all knowledge of the primary import of the symbolical characters. To supply this defect, and at the same time to veil their own ignorance, the sacerdotal instructors had recourse to fable and fiction. They heaped fable upon fable, till their religion became an accumulated chaos of mythological absurdities.\n\nTwo of the most learned and most acute of the ancient philosophers have attempted a rational explication of the latent import of the Egyptian mythology; but both have failed in the attempt; nor have the moderns, who have laboured in the same department, performed their part with much better success. Instead, therefore, of prosecuting this inexplicable subject, which would swell this article beyond all proportion, we must beg leave to refer those who are desirous of further information to the following authors, where they will find enough to gratify their curiosity, if not to inform their judgment: Herodotus, lib. ii. Diodorus Siculus, lib. i. Plut. Isis et Ophir; Jamblichus de Myth. Egypt. Horapollo Hieroglyp. Egypt. Macrobi. Sat. cap. 23. among the ancients; and among the moderns, Kircher's Oedip. Voss. de Orig. et Prog. Idol. Mr Bryant's Analysis of Anc. Mythol. Monf. Gebelin Monde Prim.; and above all, to the learned Jabloniski's Panth. Egyptianorum.\n\nThe elements of Phoenician mythology have been preserved by Eusebius, Prep. Evang. sub. init. In mythology, the large extracts which that learned father hath copied from Philo Biblius's translation of Sanchoniathon's History of Phenicia, we are furnished with several articles of mythology. Some of these throw considerable light on several passages of the sacred history; and all of them are strictly connected with the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. There we have preserved a brief but entertaining detail of the fabulous adventures of Uranus, Cronus, Dagon, Tytho or Mercury, probably the same with the Egyptian hero of that name. Here we find Muth or Pluto, \u00c6phcectus or Vulcan, \u00c6Culapius, Nereus, Poseidon or Neptune, &c. Astarte, or Venus Urania, makes a conspicuous figure in the catalogue of Phoenician worthies; Pallas or Minerva is planted on the territory of Attica; in a word, all the branches of the family of the Titans, who in after ages figured in the rubric of the Greeks, are brought upon the stage, and their exploits and adventures briefly detailed.\n\nBy comparing this fragment with the mythology of Grecian the Atlantide and that of the Cretans preserved by Diodorus the Sicilian, lib. v. we think there is good reason to conclude, that the family of the Titans, the several branches of which seem to have been both the authors and objects of a great part of the Grecian idolatry, originally emigrated from Phenicia. This conjecture will receive additional strength, when it is considered, that almost all their names recorded in the fabulous records of Greece, may be easily traced up to a Phoenician\nPhoenician original. We agree with Herodotus, that a considerable part of the idolatry of Greece may have been borrowed from the Egyptians; at the same time, we imagine it highly probable, that the idolatry of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was, in its original constitution, nearly the same. Both systems were Sabism, or the worship of the host of heaven. The Pelagia, according to Herodotus, learned the names of the gods from the Egyptians; but in this conjecture he is certainly warped by his partiality for that people. Had those names been imported from Egypt, they would no doubt have bewrayed their Egyptian original; whereas, every etymologist will be convinced that every one is of Phoenician extraction.\n\nThe adventures of Jupiter, Juno, Mercury, Apollo, Diana, Mars, Minerva or Pallas, Venus, Bacchus, Ceres, Proserpine, Pluto, Neptune, and the other deities and coadjutors of the ambitious family of the Titans, furnish by far the greatest part of the mythology of Greece. They left Phoenicia, we think, about the age of Moses; they settled in Crete, a large and fertile island; from this region they made their way into Greece, which, according to the most authentic accounts, was at that time inhabited by a race of savages. The arts and inventions which they communicated to the natives; the mysteries of religion which they inculcated; the laws, customs, policy, and good order, which they established; in short, the blessings of humanity and civilization, which they everywhere diffused, in process of time inspired the unpolished inhabitants with a kind of divine admiration. Those ambitious mortals improved this admiration into divine homage and adoration. The greater part of that worship, which had been formerly addressed to the luminaries of heaven, was now transferred to those illustrious personages. They claimed and obtained divine honours from the deluded rabble of enthusiastic Greeks. Hence sprung an inexhaustible fund of the most inconsistent and irreconcilable fictions.\n\nThe foibles and frailties of the deified mortals were transmitted to posterity, incorporated as it were with the pompous attributes of supreme divinity. Hence the heterogeneous mixture of the mighty and the mean which chequers the characters of the heroes of the Iliad and Odyssey. The Greeks adopted the oriental fables; the import of which they did not understand. These they accommodated to heroes and illustrious personages, who had figured in their own country in the earliest periods. The labours of Hercules originated in Egypt, and evidently relate to the annual progress of the sun in the zodiac, though the vain-glorious Greeks accommodated them to a hero of their own, the reputed son of Jupiter and Alcmene. The expedition of Osiris they borrowed from the Egyptians, and transferred to their Bacchus, the son of Jupiter and Semele the daughter of Cadmus. The transformation and wanderings of Io are evidently transcribed from the Egyptian romance of the travels of Isis in quest of the body of Osiris, or of the Phoenician Atharte, drawn from Sanchoniathon. Io or Iola is in reality the Egyptian name of the moon, and Atharte was the name of the same planet among the Phoenicians. Both these fables are allegorical representations of the anomalies of the lunar planet, or perhaps of the progress of the worship of that planet in different parts of the world. The fable of the conflagration occasioned by Phaeton is clearly of oriental extraction, and alludes to an excessive drought which in the early periods of time scorched Ethiopia and the adjacent countries. The fabulous adventures of Perseus are said to have happened in the same regions, and are allegorical representations of the influence of the solar luminary; for the original Perseus was the sun. The rape of Proserpine and the wanderings of Ceres: the Eleusinian mysteries; the orgia or sacred rites of Bacchus; the rites and worship of the Cabiri\u2014were imported from Egypt and Phoenicia; but strangely garbled and disguised by the hierophants of Greece. The gynantomachia, or war between the gods and the giants, and all the fabulous events and varieties of that war, form an exact counterpart to the battles of the Peri and Dives, celebrated in the romantic annals of Persia.\n\nA considerable part of the mythology of the Greeks sprang from their ignorance of the oriental languages, ignorant of oriental languages spoken by people whom, in the pride of their heart, they stigmatized with the epithet of barbarian. This aversion to every foreign dialect was highly detrimental to their progress in the sciences. The same neglect or aversion has, we imagine, proved an irreparable injury to the republic of letters in all succeeding ages. The poets or trolling bards laid hold on those oriental legends, which they sophistically with their own additions and improvements, in order to accommodate them to the popular taste. These wonderful tales figured in their rhapsodical compositions, and were greedily swallowed down by the credulous vulgar. Those fictions, as they rolled down, were constantly augmented with fresh materials, till in process of time their original import was either forgotten or buried in impenetrable darkness. A multitude of these Hesiod has collected in his Theogonia, or Generation of the Gods, which unhappily became the religious creed of the illiterate part of the Greeks. Indeed, fable was so closely interwoven with the religion of that airy volatile people, that it seems to have contaminated not only their religious and moral, but even their political tenets.\n\nThe far-famed oracle of Dodona was copied from that of Ammon at Thebes in Egypt: the oracle of Apollo at Delphi was an emanation from the same source: the celebrated Apollo Pythius of the Greeks was no other than Ob or Aub of the Egyptians, who denominated the basilisk or royal snake On Cai, because it was held sacred to the sun. Ob or Aub is still retained in the Coptic dialect, and is one of the many names or epithets of that luminary. In short, the groundwork of the Grecian mythology is to be traced in the east. Only a small part of it was fabricated in the country; and what was imported pure and genuine was miserably sophificated by the hands through which it passed, in order to give it a Grecian air, and to accommodate its style to the Grecian taste. To enlarge upon this topic would be altogether superfluous, as our learned readers must be well acquainted with it already, and the unlearned may without much trouble Roman or experience furnish themselves with books upon that subject.\n\nThe Roman mythology was borrowed from the Greek-Greeks.\nGreeks. That people had addicted themselves for many centuries to the arts of war and civil polity. Science and philosophy were either neglected or unknown. At last they conquered Greece, the native land of science, and then \"Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit arte et intulit agresti Latio.\" This being the case, their mythology was, upon the whole, a transcript from that of Greece. They had indeed gleaned a few fables from the Pelasgi and Hetrucans, which, however, are of so little consequence, that they are scarce worth the trouble of transcribing.\n\nThe mythology of the Celtic nations is in a good measure lost. There may possibly still remain some vestiges of the Druidical superstition in the remotest parts of the Highlands and islands of Scotland; and perhaps in the uncivilized places of Ireland. These we presume, would afford our readers but little entertainment, and still less instruction. Instead therefore of giving a detail of those uninteresting articles, we shall beg leave to refer our readers to Ossian's Poems, and Col. Valency's Collections of Irish Antiquities, for satisfaction on that subject.\n\nThe mythology of the northern nations, i.e. of the Norwegians, Danes, Swedes, Icelanders, &c., are uncommonly curious and entertaining. The Edda and Voluspa contain a complete collection of fables which have not the smallest affinity with those of the Greeks and Romans. They are wholly of an oriental complexion, and seem almost congenial with the tales of the Persians above described. The Edda was compiled in Iceland in the 13th century. It is a kind of system of the Scandinavian mythology: and has been reckoned, and we believe justly, a commentary on the Voluspa, which was the Bible of the northern nations. Odin or Othin, or Woden or Wadon, was the supreme divinity of those people. His exploits and adventures furnish the far greatest part of their mythological creed. That hero is supposed to have emigrated from the east; but from what country or at what period is not certainly known. His achievements are magnified beyond all credibility. He is represented as the god of battles, and as slaying thousands at a blow. His palace is called Valhalla: it is situated in the city of Midgard, where, according to the fable, the souls of heroes who had bravely fallen in battle enjoy supreme felicity. They spend the day in mimic hunting matches, or imaginary combats. At night they assemble in the palace of Valhalla, where they feast on the most delicious viands, dished and served up by the Valkyries, virgins adorned with celestial charms, and flushed with the bloom of everlasting youth. They solace themselves with drinking mead out of the skulls of enemies whom they killed in their days of nature. Mead, it seems, was the nectar of the Scandinavian heroes.\n\nSleipner, the horse of Odin, is celebrated along with his master. Hela, the hell of the Scandinavians, affords a variety of fables equally shocking and heterogeneous. Loke, the evil genius or devil of the northern people, nearly resembles the Typhon of the Egyptians. Signa or Sinna is the comfort of Loke; from this name the English word sin is derived. The giants Weymar, Ferhanter, Belupher, and Hellunda, perform a variety of exploits, and are exhibited in the most frightful attitudes. One would be tempted to imagine, that they perform the exact counterpart of the giants of the Greek and Roman mythologies. Instead of glancing at these ridiculous and uninteresting fables, which is all that the limits prescribed us would permit, we shall take the liberty to lay before our readers a brief account of the contents of the Voluspa, which is indeed the text of the Scandinavian mythology.\n\n\"The world Voluspa imports, 'the prophecy of Vola' or Fola.\" This was perhaps a general name for the prophetic ladies of the north, as Sibyl was appropriated to women endowed with the like faculty in the south. Certain it is, that the ancients generally connected madness with the prophetic faculty. Of this we have two celebrated examples: the one in Lycophron's Alexandra, and the other in the Sibyl of the Roman poet. The word vola signifies \"mad or foolish;\" whence the English words fool, foolish, folly. Spa, the latter part of the composition, signifies \"to prophecy,\" and is still current among the common people in Scotland, in the word Spae, which has nearly the same signification.\n\nThe Voluspa consists of between 200 and 300 lines. The prophetess having implored silence on all intelligent beings, declares that she is about to reveal the works of the Father of nature, the actions and operations of the gods, which no mortal ever knew before herself. She then begins with a description of the chaos; and then proceeds to the formation of the world, the creation of the different species of its inhabitants, giants, men, and dwarfs. She then explains the employments of the fairies or deities, whom the northern people call norries; the functions of the deities, their most memorable adventures, their disputes with Loke, and the vengeance that ensued. She at last concludes with a long and indeed animated description of the final state of the universe, and its dissolution by a general conflagration.\n\nIn this catastrophe, Odin and all the rabble of the Pagan divinities, are to be confounded in the general ruin, no more to appear on the stage of the universe. Out of the ruins of the former world, according to the Voluspa, a new one shall spring up, arrayed in all the bloom of celestial beauty.\n\nSuch is the doctrine exhibited in the fabulous Voluspa. So congenial are some of the details therein delivered, especially those relating to the final dissolution of the present system, and the succession of a new heaven and a new earth, that we find ourselves strongly inclined to suspect, that the original fabricator of the work was a semi-pagan writer, much of the same complexion with the authors of the Sibylline oracles, and of some other apocryphal pieces which appeared in the world during the first ages of Christianity.\n\nIn America, the only mythological countries must be Mexico and Peru. The other parts of that large continent were originally inhabited by savages, most of them as remote from religion as from civilization. The two vast empires of Mexico and Peru had existed about 400 years only before the Spanish invasion. In neither of them was the use of letters understood; and of course the ancient opinions of the natives relating to the origin of the universe, the changes which succeeded, and every other monument of antiquity, were obliterated and lost. Clavigero has indeed enumerated a vast canaille of fanguary gods worshipped by the Mexicans;\nMexicans; but produces nothing either entertaining or interesting with respect to their mythology. The information to be derived from any other quarter is little to be depended upon. It passes through the hands of bigotted millionaries or other ecclesiastics, who were so deeply tinctured with fanaticism, that they viewed every action, every sentiment, every custom, every religious opinion and ceremony of those half-civilized people, through a false medium. They often imagined they discovered resemblances and analogies between the rites of those savages and the dogmas of Christianity, which nowhere existed but in their own heated imagination.\n\nThe only remarkable piece of mythology in the annals of the Peruvians, is the pretended extraction of Manco Capac the first Inca of Peru, and of Mama Ocalla his consort. These two illustrious personages appeared first on the banks of the lake Titicaca. They were persons of a majestic stature, and clothed in decent garments. They declared themselves to be the children of the Sun, sent by their beneficent parent, who beheld with pity the miseries of the human race, to instruct and to reclaim them. Thus we find these two legislators availed themselves of a pretence which had often been employed in more civilized regions to the very same purpose. The idolatry of Peru was gentle and benevolent, that of Mexico gloomy and fanatical. Hence we may see, that every mode of superstition, where a divine revelation is not concerned, borrows its complexion from the characters of its professors.\n\nIn the course of this article, our readers will observe, that we have not much enlarged upon the mythology of the Greeks and Romans; that subject we imagine to be so universally known by the learned, and so little valued by the vulgar, that a minute discussion of it would be altogether superfluous. Besides, we hope it will be remembered, that the narrowness of the limits prescribed us would scarce admit of a more copious detail. We would flatter ourselves, that in the course of our disquisition, we have thrown out a few reflections and observations, which may perhaps prove more acceptable to both descriptions of readers.","sp":204,"ep":215},{"h":"MYTTOTON","t":"'a coarse kind of food, used by the labouring people among the Greeks, and sometimes among the Romans.

It is bounded on the north by the Murray frith, on the west and south by Inverness, and on the east by Elgin. The length is about 18 miles, and the breadth about 14. The air is temperate and salubrious, and the winters are remarkably mild. The face of the country is rough and mountainous; yet there are some fruitful valleys, which produce good crops of oats and barley; but in general the country is much better adapted for pasture. Here are also large woods of fir, and other trees, that afford shelter to the game, of which there is great plenty. The most remarkable straths or valleys in this county are Strathnairn, on the river of that name, in the north-west part of theshire; and on the south-east side, Strathnairn, on both sides of Findhorn river. Nairn is well watered with streams, rivulets, and lakes abounding with fish. In the southern part there is a small lake, called Moy. The greater part of theshire is peopled by the Frasers, a warlike Highland clan, whose chief, the lord Lovat, lost his life on the scaffold for having been concerned in the rebellion of 1745. Here are a great number of villages; but no towns of note except Nairn, supposed to be the Tucris of Ptolemy, situated at the mouth of the river which bears the same name; a royal borough, which gave the title of lord to an ancient family, forfeited in the rebellion of 1715.

See Word.\n\nThis the grammarians usually call a noun, nomen, though their noun is not of quite so much extent as our name. See Noun.\n\nSeneca, lib. ii. de Beneficiis, observes, that there are a great number of things which have no name; and which, therefore, we are forced to call by other borrowed names. Ingens est (says he) rerum copia sine nomine, quas cum propriis appellativibus signare non possumus, alieuis accommodatis utimur: which may show why, in the course of this dictionary, we frequently give divers senses to the same word.\n\nNames are distinguished into proper and appellative.\n\nProper Names, are those which represent some individual thing or person, so as to distinguish it from all other things of the same species; as, Socrates, which represents a certain philosopher.\n\nAppellative or General Names, are those which signify common ideas; or which are common to several individuals of the same species; as, horse, animal, man, oak, &c.\n\nProper names are either called Christian, as being given at baptism; or surnames: The first imposed for distinction of persons, answering to the Roman praenomen; the second, for the distinction of families, answering to the nomen of the Romans, and the patronymicum of the Greeks.\n\nOriginally every person had but one name; as among the Jews, Adam, &c.; among the Egyptians, Buhris; among the Chaldees, Ninus; the Medes, Astyages; the Greeks, Diomedes; the Romans, Romulus; the Gauls, Divitiacus; the Germans, Ariovitus; the Britons, Caffilelan; the English, Hengil, &c. And thus of other nations, except the savages of Mount Atlas, whom Pliny and Marcellinus represent as anonymi, \"nameless.\"\n\nThe Jews gave the name at the circumcision, viz. eight days after the birth: the Romans, to females the same day, to males the ninth; at which time they held a feast, called nomina.\n\nSince Christianity has obtained, most nations have followed the Jews, baptizing and giving the name on the eighth day after the birth; except our English ancestors, who, till of late, baptized and gave the name names on the birth day.\n\nThe first imposition of names was founded on different views, among different people; the most common was to mark the good wishes of the parents, or to entitle the children to the good fortune a happy name seemed to promise. Hence, Victor, C\u00e6sar, Faustus, Statius, Probus, &c.\n\nAccordingly, we find such names, by Cicero called bona nomina, and by Tacitus suafa nomina, were first enrolled and ranged in the Roman mutters; first called to serve at the sacrifices, in the foundation of colonies, &c.\u2014And, on the contrary, Livy calls Atrius Unber, abominandi omnis nomen; and Plautus, on occasion of a person named Lyco, i.e. \"greedy wolf,\" says:\n\nVosmet nunc facite conjecturam ceterum\nQuid id sit hominis, cui Lyco nomen fiet.\n\nHence, Plato recommends it to men to be careful in giving happy names; and the Pythagoreans taught expressly, that the minds, actions, and successes of men, were according to their names, genius, and fate. Thus Panormitan, ex bono nomine critur bona praesumpio; and the common proverb, Bonum nomen bonum omen; and hence the foundation of the onomantia. See ONOMANTIA.\n\nIt is an observation deserving attention, says the abbe Barthelemy, that the greater part of names found in Homer are marks of distinction. They were given in honour of the qualities most esteemed in the heroic ages. From the word polemos, which signifies war, have been formed Tlepolemus and Archepolemus, the names of two heroes mentioned in the Iliad. The former name signifies able to support, and the latter, able to direct, the labours of war. By adding to the word mache, or battle, certain prepositions and different parts of speech, which modify the sense in a manner always honourable, are composed the names Amphimachus, Antimachus, Promachus, Telemachus. Proceeding in the same way, with the word honora, \"strength or intrepidity,\" they formed the names Agapenor, \"he who esteems valour;\" Agenor, \"he who directs it.\" From these, \"swift,\" are derived, Alcaethes, Pantheus, Perithoas, &c. From nous, \"mind or intelligence,\" come Alynoes, Arfinoes, Autenoes, &c. From medes, \"counsel,\" Agamedes, Eumedes, Lycomedes, Thrasymedes; and from elios, \"glory,\" Amphicles, Agacles, Iphicles, Patroclus, Cloebulus; with many others.\n\nHence Camden takes it for granted, that the names, in all nations and languages, are significative, and not simple sounds for mere distinction's sake. This holds not only among the Jews, Greeks, Latins, &c., but even the Turks; among whom, Abdala signifies God's servant, Soliman, peaceable; Mahomet, glorified, &c. And the savages of Hispaniola, and throughout America, who, in their languages, name their children, Glittering Light, Sun, Bright, Fine Gold, &c.; and they of Congo, by the names of precious stones, flowers, &c.\n\nTo suppose names given without any meaning, however by the alteration of languages their signification may be lost, that learned author thinks is to reproach our ancestors; and that contrary to the sense of\nof all ancient writers. Porphyry notes, that the barbarous names, as he calls them, were very emphatical, and very concise; and accordingly it was esteemed a duty to be \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, or sui nominis honores; as Severus, Probus, and Aurelius, are called sui nominis imperatores.\n\nIt was the usual way of giving names, to wish the children might discharge their names. Thus when Gunthram king of France named Clotharius at the font, he said, Crescat puer, et hujus sit nominis executor.\n\nThe ancient Britons, Camden says, generally took their names from colours, because they painted themselves; which names are now lost, or remain hid among the Welsh. When they were subdued by the Romans, they took Roman names, some of which still remain corrupted; though the greatest part became extinct upon the admission of the English Saxons, who introduced the German names, as Crida, Penda, Oswald, Edward, &c.\u2014The Danes, too, brought with them their names; as Sweyn, Harold, Knute, &c. The Normans, at the Conquest, brought in other German names, as originally using the German tongue; such as Robert, William, Richard, Henry, Hugh, &c. after the same manner as the Greek names Apollonius, Boethius, Symmachus, &c. were introduced into Italy upon the division of the empire. After the Conquest, our nation, which had ever been averse to foreign names, as deeming them unlucky, began to take Hebrew names; as Matthew, David, Sampson, &c. The various names anciently or at present obtaining among us, from what language or people forever borrowed, are explained by Camden in his Remains. As to the period when names began to be multiplied, and surnames introduced, &c. see Surname.\n\nOf late years it has obtained among us to give surnames for Christian names; which some dislike, on account of the confusion it may introduce. Camden relates it as an opinion, that the practice first began in the reign of Edward VI. by such as would be godfathers, when they were more than half fathers. Upon which some were persuaded to change their names at confirmation; which, it seems, is usual in other countries.\u2014Thus, two sons of Henry II. of France, christened Alexander and Hercules, changed them at confirmation into Henry and Francis. In monasteries, the religious assume new names at their admittance, to show they are about to lead a new life, and have renounced the world, their family, and even their name: v. g. fuller Mary of the Incarnation, brother Henry of the Holy Sacrament, &c. The popes also changed their names at their exaltation to the pontificate; a custom first introduced by Pope Sergius, whose name till then, as Platin informs us, was Swine's-shoot. But Onuphrius refers it to John XII. or XIII. and at the same time adds a different reason for it from that of Platin, viz. that it was done in imitation of St Peter and St Paul, who were first called Simon and Saul.\n\nAmong the ancients, those deified by the Heathen confections had new names given them; as Romulus was called Quirinus; Melicertes, Portunus or Portumnus, &c.\n\nNew names were also given in adoptions, and sometimes by testament: thus L. Aemilius, adopted by Scipio, took the name of Scipio Africanus; and thus Augustus, who was at first called C. Octavius Thurinus, being adopted by the testament of Julius Caesar into his name and family, took the name of Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus.\n\nNames were also changed at enfranchisements into new cities. Thus Lucumo, at his first being made free of Rome, took the name Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, &c.; and slaves when made free, usually assumed their masters names. Those called to the equestrian order, if they had base names, were always new named, nomine ingenuorum veterumque Romanorum. And among the primitive Christians, it was the practice to change the names of the catechumens: Thus the renegade Lucianus, till his baptism, was called Lucius.\n\nToward the middle of the 15th century, it was the fancy of the wits and learned men of the age, particularly in Italy, to change their baptismal names for classical ones. As Sannazzarius, for instance, who altered his own plain name Jacopo to Actius Synecus. Numbers did the same, and among the rest Platina the historian at Rome, who, not without a solemn ceremonial, took the name of Gallinachus instead of Philip. Pope Paul II. who reigned about that time, unluckily chanced to be culpacious, illiterate, and heavy of comprehension. He had no idea that persons could wish to alter their names unless they had some bad design, and actually scrupled not to employ imprisonment and other violent methods to discover the fancied mystery. Platina was most cruelly tortured on this frivolous account: he had nothing to confess: so the pope, after endeavouring in vain to convict him of heresy, sedition, &c. released him after a long imprisonment.","sp":219,"ep":220},{"h":"NAMPTWICH","t":"or NANTWICH, a town of Cheshire in England, situated on the river Weaver, 14 miles S.

When the Chinese speak of its extent, they say, if two horsemen should go out by the same gate, and ride round it on full speed, taking different directions, they would not meet before night. This account is evidently exaggerated; but it is certain, that Nan-king surpasses in extent all the other cities of China. We are assured that its walls are five leagues and a half in circumference.\n\nThis city is situated at the distance of a league from the river Yang-tse-kiang: it is of an irregular figure; the mountains which are within its circumference having prevented its being built on a regular plan. It was formerly the imperial city; for this reason it was called Nan-King, which signifies, \"the Southern Court;\" but since the six grand tribunals have been transferred from hence to Peking, it is called Kiang-ning in all the public acts.\n\nNan-king has lost much of its ancient splendour: it had formerly a magnificent palace, no vestige of which is now to be seen; an observatory at present neglected, temples, tombs of the emperors, and other superb monuments, of which nothing remains but the remembrance. A third of the city is deserted, but the rest is well inhabited. Some quarters of it are extremely populous and full of business; particularly the manufacture of a species of cotton cloth, of which great quantities are imported into Europe under the name of Nankin. The streets are not so broad as those of Peking; they are, however, very beautiful, well paved, and bordered with rich shops.\n\nIn this city resides one of those great mandarins called Tjong-gou, who takes cognizance of all important affairs, not only of both the governments of the province, but also of those of the province of Kiang-fu. The Tartars have a numerous garrison here, commanded by a general of their own nation; and they occupy a quarter of the city, separated from the rest by a plain wall.\n\nThe palaces of the mandarins, whether Chinese or Tartars, are in this city neither larger nor better built than those in the capital cities of other provinces. Here are no public edifices corresponding to the reputation of so celebrated a city, excepting its gates, which are very beautiful, and some temples, among which is the famous porcelain tower. It is 200 feet high, and divided into nine stories by plain boards within, and without by cornices and small projections covered with green varnished tiles. There is an ascent of 40 steps to the first story; between each of the others there are 21.\n\nThe breadth and depth of the river Yang-tse-kiang formerly rendered the port of Nan-king very commodious; but at present large barks, or rather Chinese junks, never enter it; whether it be that it is flut up by sand banks, or that the entrance of it has been forbidden, in order that navigators may insensibly lose all knowledge of it.\n\nIn the months of April and May a great number of excellent fish are caught in this river near the city, which are sent to court; they are covered with ice, and transported in that manner by barks kept entirely on purpose. Although this city is more than 200 leagues from Peking, these boats make such expedition, that they arrive there in eight or nine days. This city,\nthough the capital of the province, has under its particular jurisdiction only eight cities of the third class. The number of its inhabitants is said to be 1,000,000, without comprehending the garrison of 40,000 men.\n\nE. Long. 119. 25. N.

Having given early discoveries of great natural parts, his father was careful to have them cultivated by a liberal education. After going through the ordinary courses of philosophy at the university of Napier, St Andrew's, he made the tour of France, Italy, and Germany. Upon his return to his native country, his literature and other fine accomplishments soon rendered him conspicuous, and might have raised him to the highest offices in the state; but declining all civil employments, and the duties of the court, he retired from the world to pursue literary researches, in which he made an uncommon progress, so as to have favoured mankind with sundry useful discoveries. He applied himself chiefly to the study of mathematics; but at the same time did not neglect that of the Holy Scriptures. In both these he hath discovered the most extensive knowledge and profound penetration. His essay upon the book of the Apocalypse, indicates the most acute investigation, and an uncommon strength of judgement; though time hath discovered, that his calculations concerning particular events hath proceeded upon fallacious data. This work has been printed abroad in several languages; particularly in French at Rochelle in the year 1593, 8vo, announced in the title as revised by himself. Nothing, says Lord Buchan, could be more agreeable to the Rochellers or to the Huguenots of France at this time, than the author's annunciation of the pope as antichrist, which in this book he has endeavoured to set forth with much zeal and erudition.\u2014But what has principally rendered his name famous, was his great and fortunate discovery of logarithms in trigonometry, by which the ease and expedition in calculation have so wonderfully assisted the science of astronomy and the arts of practical geometry and navigation. That he had begun about the year 1593 the train of inquiry which led him to that great achievement in arithmetic, appears from a letter to Crugerus from Kepler in the year 1624; wherein, mentioning the Canon Mirificus, he writeth thus: \"Nihil autem supra Neperianum rationem eft puto: etfi Scotus quidem literis ad Tycholem, anno 1564, scriptis jam fepem fecit Canonis illius mirifici;\" which allusion agrees with the idle story mentioned by Wood in his Athenae Oxoni, and explains it in a way perfectly consonant to the rights of Napier as the inventor.\n\nWhen Napier had communicated to Mr Henry Briggs, mathematical professor in Gresham college, his wonderful canon for the logarithms, that learned professor set himself to apply the rules in his Imitatio Neperiana; and in a letter to Archbishop Usher in the year 1615, he writes thus: \"Napier, baron of Merchiston, hath set my head and hands at work with his new and admirable logarithms. I hope to see him this summer, if it please God; for I never saw a book which pleased me better, and made me more wonder.\" The following passage from the life of Lilly the astrologer is quoted by Lord Buchan, as giving a picturesque view of the meeting betwixt Briggs and the inventor of the logarithms at Merchiston near Edinburgh. \"I will acquaint you (says Lilly) with one memorable story related unto me by John Marr, an excellent mathematician and geometrician, whom I conceive you remember. He was servant to King James I. and Charles I. When Merchiston first published his logarithms, Mr Briggs, then reader of the astronomy lectures at Gresham college in London, was so much surprised with admiration of them, that he could have no quietness in himself until he had seen that noble person...\"\nNapier whose only invention they were: he acquaints John Marr therewith, who went into Scotland before Mr Briggs, purposely to be there when these two so learned persons should meet. Mr Briggs appoints a certain day when to meet at Edinburgh; but failing thereof, Merchiston was fearful he would not come. It happened one day as John Marr and the baron Napier were speaking of Mr Briggs; 'Ah, John (said Merchiston), Mr Briggs will not come.' At the very instant one knocks at the gate; John Marr halts down, and it proved to be Mr Briggs to his great contentment. He brings Mr Briggs up to the baron's chamber, where almost one quarter of an hour was spent, each beholding the other with admiration before one word was spoken. At last Mr Briggs began; 'Sir, I have undertaken this long journey purposely to see your person, and to know by what engine of wit or ingenuity you came first to think of this most excellent help into astronomy, viz. the logarithms; but, Sir, being by you found out, I wonder nobody else found it out before, when now being known it appears so easy.' He was nobly entertained by Baron Napier; and every summer after that, during the laird's being alive, this venerable man, Mr Briggs, went purposely to Scotland to visit him.\n\nThere is a passage in the life of Tycho Brahe by Gassendi, which may mislead an attentive reader to suppose that Napier's method had been explored by the Writings of Napier of Merchiston. It is in Gassendi's Observations on a Letter from Tycho to Herwart of the last day of August 1599, \"Dixit Herwartus nihil morari se enim multiplicationem, ac divisionem vice additiones solum, subtractiones 93 ulipare (quod ut fieri posset, docuit postmodum suae logarithmorum Canone Nipperus).\" But Herwart here alludes to this work afterwards published in the year 1610, which solves triangles by prosthapheresis; a mode totally different from that of the logarithms.\n\nKepler dedicated his Ephemerides, to Napier, which were published in the year 1617; and it appears from many passages in his letter about this time, that he held Napier to be the greatest man of his age in the particular department to which he applied his abilities. \"And indeed (says our noble biographer), if we consider that Napier's discovery was not like those of Kepler or of Newton, connected with any analogies or coincidences which might have led him to it, but the fruit of unassisted reason and science, we shall be vindicating in placing him in one of the highest niches in the temple of Fame. Kepler had made many unsuccessful attempts to discover his canon for the periodic motions of the planets, and hit upon it at last, as he himself candidly owns, on the 15th of May 1618; and Newton applied the palpable tendency of heavy bodies to the earth to the system of the universe in general; but Napier fought out his admirable rules by a slow scientific progress, arising from the gradual evolution of truth.\"\n\nThe last literary exertion of this eminent person was the publication of his Rhabdology and Promptuary in the year 1617, which he dedicated to the Chancellor Seton; and soon after died at Merchiston on the 3d of April O.S. of the same year, in the 68th year of his age and 23d of his happy invention.\u2014The particular titles of his works published are: 1. A plain discovery of the Revelation of St John. 2. Mirifici ipsius canonis constructione et logarithmorum, ad naturales ipsorum numeros habitudines. 3. Appendix de alia atque praestantia logarithmorum specie constituenda, in qua faciliter unitas logarithmus est. 4. Rhabdologiae seu numerationis per virgulas libri duo. 5.

His Letter to Anthony Bacon (the original of which is in the archbishop's library at Lambeth), entitled, \"Secret inventions, profitable and necessary in these days for the defence of this island, and withstanding strangers enemies to God's truth and religion?\" which the earl of Buchan has caused to be printed in the Appendix to his Account of Napier's Writings. This letter is dated June 2, 1596, about which time it appears the author had set himself to explore his logarithmic canon.\n\nThis eminent person was twice married. By his first wife, who was a daughter of Sir James Stirling of Keir, he had only one son named Archibald, who succeeded to the estate. By his second wife, a daughter of Sir James Chilholm of Cromlix, he had a numerous issue.\u2014Archibald Napier, the only son of the first marriage, was a person of fine parts and learning. Having more a turn to public business than his father had, he was raised to be a privy counsellor by James VI. under whose reign he also held the offices of treasurer-depute, justice-clerk, and senator of the college of justice. By Charles I. he was raised to the peerage by the title of Lord Napier.\n\nNapier's Rods, or Bones, an instrument invented by Baron Napier, whereby the multiplication and division of large numbers is much facilitated.\n\nAs to the Construction of Napier's Rods: Suppose the common table of multiplication to be made upon a plate of metal, ivory, or pasteboard, and then conceive the several columns (ranging downwards from the digits on the head) to be cut asunder; and these are what we call Napier's rods of multiplication. But then there must be a good number of each; for as many times as any figure is in the multiplicand, so many rods of that species (i.e., with that figure on the top of it) must we have; though six rods of each species will be sufficient for any example in common affairs: there must be also as many rods of o's.\n\nBut before we explain the way of using these rods, there is another thing to be known, viz. that the figures on every rod are written in an order different from that in the table. Thus the little square space or division in which the several products of every column are written, is divided into two parts by a line across from the upper angle on the right to the lower on the left; and if the product is a digit, it is set in the lower division; if it has two places, the first is set in the lower, and the second in the upper division; but the spaces on the top are not divided; also there is a rod of digits, not divided, which is called the index rod, and of this we need but one single rod. See the figure of all the different rods, and the index, separate from one another, in Plate CCCXLIX. fig. 1.\n\nMultiplication by Napier's Rods. First lay down the index rod; then on the right of it set a rod, whose\nNapier. top is the figure in the highest place of the multiplicand; next to this again, let the rod whose top is the next figure of the multiplicand; and so on in order to the first figure. Then is your multiplicand tabulated for all the nine digits; for in the same line of squares standing against every figure of the index rod, you have the product of that figure; and therefore you have no more to do but to transfer the products and sum them.\n\nBut in taking out these products from the rods, the order in which the figures stand obliges you to a very easy and final addition; thus, begin to take out the figure in the lower part, or units place, of the square of the first rod on the right; add the figure in the upper part of this rod to that in the lower part of the next, and so on; which may be done as fast as you can look on them. To make this practice as clear as possible, take the following example.\n\nExample: To multiply 4768 by 385. Having set the rods together for the number 4768 (fig. 2) against 5 in the index, I find this number, by adding according to the rule,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n- \\\\\n- \\\\\n- \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nAgainst 8, this number\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n- \\\\\n- \\\\\n- \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nAgainst 3, this number\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n- \\\\\n- \\\\\n- \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTotal product\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n1835680 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTo make the use of the rods yet more regular and easy, they are kept in a flat square box, whose breadth is that of ten rods, and the length that of one rod, as thick as to hold six (or as many as you please) the capacity of the box being divided into ten cells, for the different species of rods. When the rods are put up in the box (each species in its own cell distinguished by the first figure of the rod set before it on the face of the box near the top), as much of every rod stands without the box as shows the first figure of that rod: also upon one of the flat sides without and near the edge, upon the left hand, the index rod is fixed; and along the foot there is a small ledge; so that the rods when applied are laid upon this side, and supported by the ledge, which makes the practice very easy; but in case the multiplicand should have more than nine places, that upper face of the box may be made broader. Some make the rods with four different faces, and figures on each for different purposes.\n\nDivision by Napier's Rods. First tabulate your divisor; then you have it multiplied by all the digits, out of which you may choose such convenient divisors as will be next less to the figures in the dividend, and write the index answering to the quotient, and so continually till the work is done. Thus 2179788, divided by 6123, gives in the quotient 356.\n\nHaving tabulated the divisor 6123, you see that 6123, cannot be had in 2179; therefore take five places, and on the rods find a number that is equal or next less to 21797, which is 18369; that is, 3 times the divisor; wherefore set 3 in the quotient, and subtract 18369 from the figures above, and there will remain 3428; to which add 8, the next figure of the dividend, and seek again on the rods for it, or the next less, which you will find to be five times; therefore set 5 in the quotient, and subtract 32615 from 34288, and there will remain 3673; to which add 8, the last figure in the dividend, and finding it to be just six times the divisor, set six in the quotient.","sp":222,"ep":224},{"h":"NAPLES","t":"a kingdom of Italy, comprehending the ancient countries of Samnium, Campania, Apulia, and Magna Graecia. It is bounded on all sides by the Mediterranean and Adriatic, except on the north-east, where it terminates on the Ecclesiastical state. Its greatest length from south-east to north-west is about 280 English miles; and its breadth from north-east to south-west, from 96 to 120.\n\nThe ancient history of this country falls under the articles ROME and ITALY; the present state of it, as well as of the rest of Italy, is owing to the conquests of Charlemagne. When that monarch put an end to the kingdom of the Lombards, he obliged the dukes of Friuli, Spoleto, and Benevento, to acknowledge him as king of Italy; but allowed them to exercise the same power and authority which they had enjoyed before his conquest. Of these three dukedoms Benevento was by far the most powerful and extensive, Extent of it comprehended almost all the present kingdom of the Duchy Naples; that part of farther Calabria beyond the river of Benevento's Savuto and Peto, a few maritime cities in Hither Calabria, with the city of Acripoli, and the promontory in its neighbourhood called Capo di Licio; and lastly, the dukedoms of Gaeta, Naples, and Amalfi, which were very inconsiderable, and extended along the shore only about 100 miles, and were interrupted by the Gaffaldate or county of Capua.\n\nThis flourishing and extensive dukedom was at this time governed by Arechis, who had married one of duke of Benevento's daughters, the last king of the Lombards, and had submitted, and taken the oath of allegiance to the emperor Charles. However, a few years after, Charles renounced his allegiance to the Franks, declared himself an independent sovereign, and was acknowledged as such by all the inhabitants of his dukedom. To strengthen himself against Pepin king of Italy, who resided at Ravenna, he enlarged and fortified the city of Benevento, and likewise built Salerno on the sea coast, surrounding it with a very strong and high wall. He engaged in several wars with the Greeks, whom he sometimes obliged to give him hostages; but having invaded the territories of the pope, whom Pepin could not afflit, Charlemagne was prevailed on to return to Italy. Arechis, unable to oppose such a formidable enemy, sent his eldest son, Romuald, to Rome, with an offer of submission: but, at the instigation of the pope, Charles refused the offer, and detained his son prisoner; after which he ravaged the country, and made himself master of Capua. Other deputies, however, proved more successful; and, in the year 787, a peace was concluded on these conditions: That Arechis and the Beneventans should renew their allegiance to the Franks; that he should pay a yearly tribute to Pepin; deliver up all his treasure; and give\nCharles had no sooner left Italy, than Arechis forgot all his engagements, and began to negotiate with Irene, empress of Constantinople, and her son Constantine, for expelling the Franks out of Italy. For himself, he desired the honour of patriciate, and the dukedom of Naples with all its dependencies; and, in return, promised to acknowledge the Greek emperor as his sovereign, and to live after the manner of the Greeks. He required, however, to be supported by a Greek army; and that his brother-in-law Adalgisus, son-to Desiderius the last king of the Lombards, should be sent over into Italy, to raise a party among his countrymen. These conditions were readily accepted, on condition that Prince Romuald should be sent as an hostage; ambassadors were sent to Naples with the ensigns of the Patrician order, namely the mantle of cloth of gold, the sword, the comb, and the sandals; but before the ceremony could be performed, Prince Romuald died, and soon after him his father; whose death was supposed to have been hastened by that of his son.\n\nAfter the death of Arechis, the Beneventans sent a most submissive embassy to Charlemagne, entreating him to send them Grimoald, the late king's son, and only lawful heir to his crown; threatening at the same time to revolt if their prince was denied them. Charles readily granted their request, and allowed Grimoald to depart, after he had agreed to the following conditions, viz. That he should oblige the Lombards to shave their beards; that, in writings, and on money, the name of the king should be put before that of the prince; and that he should cause the walls of Salerno, Acerenza, and Confa, to be entirely demolished.\u2014The new king was received by his subjects with the utmost joy; and for some time continued faithful to his engagements, excepting only the last article, which he either neglected or eluded. So far, however, was he from afflicting the Greeks, that he gave notice of their machinations to Pepin king of Italy; raised an army to oppose his uncle Adalgisus; and being joined by Hildebrand duke of Spoleto, and Vinigisle the general of Pepin, he attacked the Greeks' in Calabria soon after they had landed, entirely defeated and took his uncle prisoner, and, as is said, put him to a cruel death. Yet in a short time Grimoald contracted an alliance with the Greek emperor by marrying his niece Wanzia; and in the fifth year of his reign a war broke out between him and Pepin, which continued for twelve years; at the end of which time a truce was concluded. Grimoald survived this pacification only three years, and was succeeded by his treasurer Grimoald II. who submitted to Charlemagne after the death of Pepin; and from this time the Beneventans were looked upon as tributaries of the western emperors. As yet, however, the city of Naples did not own allegiance to the dukes of Benevento, but was held by the eastern emperors; and frequent wars took place between the Beneventans and Neapolitans. This happened to be the case when Grimoald II. ascended the throne. He concluded a peace with them; which however, was of no long continuance; for Theodore, governor of Naples, having granted protections to\n\nDauferius a noble Beneventan, who had been concerned in a conspiracy against his prince, Grimoald marched against the city of Naples, and invested it by sea and land. Theodore still refused to deliver up the traitor, and a general engagement both by land and sea was the consequence; in which the Neapolitans were defeated with so great slaughter, that the sea was stained with their blood for more than seven days. Theodore then consented to deliver up Dauferius, with 8000 crowns for the expenses of the war; and Grimoald not only pardoned Dauferius, but received him into favour: The traitor, however, reflecting on the heinousness of his crime, was seized with remorse; and went a pilgrimage to the holy land, carrying a large stone in his mouth, by way of penance, which he never took out but at his meals.\n\nIn the year 821, Grimoald was murdered by Radelchis count of Confa, and Sico Gaifald of Acerenza, and the latter of whom succeeded to the dukedom of Benevento. Radelchis being soon after seized with remorse, became a monk; while Sico associated his son Sicardo with him in the government; and both, being of an ambitious and restless disposition, fought a pretence for attacking the Neapolitans. This was Naples soon found, and the city was invested by sea and land, sieged by The walls were furiously battered; and part of them being beat down, Sico prepared for a general assault. Stephen, at that time duke of Naples, pretended to submit; but, that he might prevent the city from being pillaged, entreated Sico to put off his entry till the morning, and in the mean time sent out his mother and his two children as hostages. Sico consented to his request; but next morning found the breach built up, and the Neapolitans prepared for their defence. Exasperated at their perfidy, he renewed his attacks with vigour, but without any success; the besieged defending themselves with the utmost obstinacy. At last, perceiving that they should not be able to hold out much longer, they consented to a peace on the following conditions, viz. That the Neapolitans should pay an annual tribute to the princes of Benevento, and consent to the transporting of the body of St Januarius from his church without the walls of Naples to Benevento. These conditions being ratified, Sico returned with great honour to Benevento; but soon after renewed the war, under pretence that the Neapolitans had neglected to pay the stipulated sum; and hostilities continued till his death, which happened in 833.\n\nSico was succeeded in the government of Benevento by his son Sicardo, who had married the daughter of Grimoald II.; and being influenced by the evil counsels of Roffrid's wife's brother, oppressed his subjects to such a degree that they conspired against his life. He besieged Naples with a powerful army, and took possession of Acerenza and Atella, both of which he fortified. But Bonus, the Neapolitan duke, defended himself so vigorously, that the Beneventans were obliged to retire, and even to abandon Acerenza and Atella, the fortifications of which were immediately demolished. At last Sicardo agreed to a peace for five years, on the intercession of Lothaire, emperor and king of Italy; but his chief motive was thought to have been the fear of the Saracens, whom the duke of Naples had called over from Africa to his assistance; for no sooner were\nthey sent back than Sicardo attempted to delay the conclusion of the treaty; but the emperor interfering his authority, a peace was concluded in the year 836, after the war had continued, with very little intermission, for 16 years.\n\nSoon after the conclusion of this peace, the Saracens landed at Brindisi; and having made themselves masters of the place, ravaged all the neighbouring country. Sicardo marched against them with a numerous army; but the Saracens having dug a great number of ditches which they slightly covered over, found means to draw the Beneventans among them, whereby they were repulsed with great loss. However, Sicardo, having reinforced his army, marched again to attack them; but the Saracens, despairing of success, pillaged and burnt Brindisi, and then retired with their booty, and a great many captives, to Sicily. Sicardo, then, without any apparent provocation, attacked the city of Amalfi, levelled its walls with the ground, carried off all its wealth, and the body of its tutelar saint Triphomen. A great many of the inhabitants were transported to Salerno; and by promoting alliances between the inhabitants of both places, he endeavoured to unite Amalfi to his own principality as firmly as possible.\n\nDuring all these transactions, Sicardo had tyrannized over his subjects in such a manner, that at last he became intolerable. Among other acts of injustice, he imprisoned his own brother Siconolphus; compelled him to turn priest; and afterwards sent him bound to Tarento, where he caused him to be shut up in an old tower that had been built for a cistern. By such acts of tyranny his nobles were provoked to conspire against him; and in the year 839 he was murdered in his tent.\n\nOn the death of Sicardo, Radelchis, his secretary or treasurer, was unanimously elected prince of Benevento; but Siconolphus, the last king's brother, having regained his liberty, formed a great party against the new prince. Radelchis did not fail to oppose him with a formidable army; and a most ruinous civil war ensued. Both parties by turns called in the Saracens; and these treacherous allies acted sometimes against one, and sometimes against the other; or turned their arms against both, as seemed most suitable to their own interest. Thus the war continued with the utmost animosity for 12 years, during which time the principality was almost entirely ruined; till at last the emperor Lewis interfered, and obliged the competitors to agree to a partition of the principality.\n\nBy this treaty, Radelchis promised to acknowledge Siconolphus and his successors as lawful princes of the principality of Salerno, which was declared to contain Tarento, Latiano, Caffano, Coffenzo, Laino, Lucadia, Conisa, Montella, Rota, Salerno, Sarno, Ciraterium, Fureulo, Capua, Feano, Sora, and the half of the Gaffaldate of Acerenza, where it joins Latiano and Conisa. The boundary betwixt Benevento and Capua was fixed at St Angelo ad Cerros; Alli Peregini was made the boundary betwixt Benevento and Salerno, and Staffilo betwixt Benevento and Conisa. The monasteries of Monte Cassino and St Vincent were declared to be immediately under the protection of the emperor: both princes stipulated that no hostilities should be committed by either against the subjects of each other; and promised to join their forces in order to drive out the Saracens. Soon after this pacification, however, both Radelchis and Siconolphus died; the former appointing his son Radelarius, or Radelcar, to succeed him; and the latter leaving an infant son, Sico, to the care of his godfather, Peter.\n\nThe war with the Saracens proved very unsuccessful: neither the united efforts of the princes, nor the assistance of the emperor Lewis himself, being able to expel the infidels; and in 854, Adelgise the second son of Radelchis, who had now succeeded, on the death of his brother Radelcar, to the principality of Benevento, was obliged to pay them an annual subsidy. Two years after, Lando, count of Capua, revolted from the prince of Salerno, and could not be reduced. In the mean time, Sico, the lawful prince of Salerno, had been poisoned by Count Lando, and the principality usurped by Ademarius, the son of Peter above mentioned; but in 861, Ademarius himself was seized and imprisoned by Gaufurius, the son of Dauferius formerly mentioned. This was occasioned by his cruelty and rapacity, which entirely alienated the hearts of his subjects from him, and encouraged Gaufurius to become the head of the conspirators.\n\nThe Saracens in the mean time committed terrible ravages throughout the Beneventan territories; which at last obliged Adelgise to enter into an alliance with Gaufurius, and both together sent a most humble embassy to the emperor Lewis, requesting him to take them under his protection. About the same time an embassy arrived from Constantinople, proposing a junction of the forces of the eastern and western empires against the infidels; upon which Lewis gave orders for assembling a formidable army. But in the mean time Adelgise fell off from his alliance, and made peace with the Saracens; nay, according to some, he encouraged them in their incursions, and it was at his desire that they invaded the duchy of Capua, and afterwards that of Naples, which they ravaged in a most barbarous manner. The Neapolitans, in conjunction with the duke of Spoletto and the count of Marfi, endeavoured to oppose them; but being defeated, the Saracens continued their ravages with redoubled fury, and retired to Bari, which was their capital city, with an immense booty.\n\nIn 866, Lewis arrived at Sora with his army; and having marched to Capua, was there joined by Landolph, the bishop and count, with a body of Capuans: but Landolph soon after persuading his countrymen to desert, Lewis marched against that city, which he took after a siege of three months, and almost totally destroyed. In the end of the year he was joined by Gaufurius with his quota of troops, having ordered the eyes of Ardemarius to be put out in his absence. Lewis confirmed him in the principality, and marched with his army to Benevento, where Adelgise received him with great respect. Having reduced some inconsiderable places belonging to the Saracens, Lewis soon after invested Bari; but as the Saracens received continual supplies from their countrymen settled in Sicily, and besides were protected by the Neapolitans, he could not reduce the place till the year 871, though he had received considerable assistance from his brother Lotharius, and the Greek emperor had sent him a fleet of\nThe expulsion of the Saracens was completed the same year by the taking of Taranto; after which the emperor returned with great glory to Benevento, resolving next to carry his arms into Sicily, and expel the infidels from thence also. But his future schemes of conquest were frustrated by a quarrel between him and Adelgide. The latter, pretending to have been insulted by the empress, and oppressed by the French, seized the emperor himself, and kept him prisoner for 40 days. His imprisonment would probably have been of much longer continuance, had not a body of Saracens arrived from Africa, who, being joined by such of their countrymen as had concealed themselves in Italy, laid siege to Salerno with an army of 30,000 men, ravaging the neighbouring country at the same time with the utmost barbarity. By this new invasion Adelgide was so much alarmed, that he set the emperor at liberty, but first obliged him to swear that he would not revenge the insult that had been offered him, and that he would never return to Benevento. Lewis having then joined his forces to those of the prince of Salerno, soon obliged the Saracens to raise the siege of Salerno; but though they were prevented from taking that city, they entirely destroyed the inhabitants of Calabria, leaving it, according to the expression of one of the historians of that time, \"as desolate as it was at the flood.\"\n\nIn the year 873, Lewis being absolved from his oath by the pope, went to Benevento, and was reconciled to Adelgide; but soon after this reconciliation he died, and the Saracens continued their ravages to such a degree that the inhabitants of Bari were constrained to deliver up their city to the Greeks. At the same time the Salernitans, Neapolitans, Cetajans, and Amalfitans, having made peace with the Saracens, were compelled to agree to their proposal of invading the territories of the Roman pontiff. His holiness exerted himself to the utmost, both with spiritual and temporal weapons, in order to defend his right; but was at last reduced to the necessity of becoming a tributary to the infidels, and promising to pay them a large sum annually.\n\nIn the mean time, all Italy was thrown into the greatest confusion by the death of Charles the Bald, who died of poison at Pavia, as he was coming to the pope's assistance. Sergius duke of Naples continued a firm friend to the infidels; nor could he be detached from their interests even by the thunder of a papal excommunication; but unluckily happening to fall into the hands of his brother Athanasius bishop of Naples, the zeal of that prelate prompted him to put out his eyes, and send him a close prisoner to Rome; for which the highest encomiums were bestowed on him by the holy father.\n\nIn 876, Adelgide was murdered by two of his nephews; one of whom, by name Gaideris, seized the principality. About the same time Landulph bishop of Capua dying, a civil war ensued among his children, though their father's dominions had been divided among them according to his will. The princes of Salerno and Benevento, the duke of Spoleto, and Gregory the Greek governor of Bari and Otranto, took different sides in the quarrel, as they thought most proper; and to complete the confusion, the new bishop was expelled, and his brother, though a laymen, chosen to that office, and even consecrated by the pope, who wrote to Gaufurius; forbidding him to attack Capua under pain of excommunication. But though Gaufurius was, in general, obedient to the pope's commands, he proved refractory in this particular, and laid siege to Capua for two years successively.\n\nThus the Capuan territories were reduced to the most miserable situation; being obliged to maintain at the same time the armies of the prince of Benevento and the duke of Spoleto. The Saracens, in the meantime, took the opportunity of strengthening themselves in Italy; and Athanasius, notwithstanding the great commendations he had received from the pope for putting out his brother's eyes, consented to enter into an alliance with them, in conjunction with whom he ravaged the territories of the pope, as well as those of Benevento and Spoleto, plundering all the churches, monasteries, towns, and villages, through which they passed. At the same time the prince of Salerno was obliged to grant them a settlement in the neighbourhood of his capital; the duke of Geeta invited them to his assistance, being oppressed by the count of Capua; and even the pope himself was obliged to make peace with them, and to grant them a settlement on the north side of the Carigliano, where they fortified themselves, and continued for more than 40 years.\n\nTo put a stop to the confusion which reigned in Italy, the pope now thought proper to re\u00eblect the bishop of Capua, who had been expelled, but allowed his brother to reside in the city, and govern one half of the diocese; but notwithstanding this partition, the civil dissensions continued with the utmost violence, the nearest relations murdering or banishing each other, according as the fortune of the one or the other prevailed. Athanasius, notwithstanding all the pope's remonstrances, continued his alliance with the Saracens; in conjunction with whom he ravaged the territory of Benevento, and fomented the divisions in Capua, in hopes of being able to make a conquest of it. At last his holiness thought proper to inflict a sentence of excommunication against him; but this attached him to the Saracens more than ever; infomuch that he sent to Suchaim, king of the Saracens in Sicily, desiring him to come over and command a great body of his countrymen who had settled at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. Suchaim accepted the invitation, and immediately turned his arms against Athanasius; allowing his troops to live at discretion in the territory of Naples, where they ravished the women, and plundered the inhabitants. These calamities were, by the perfidious Neapolitans, imagined to be a consequence of the sentence of excommunication; and therefore they used their utmost endeavours to persuade the prelate to conclude a league with some Christian prince, and renounce all connexion with the infidels. In this they at last proved successful, and Athanasius concluded an alliance with Guaimarius prince of Salerno; in consequence of which the Saracens were obliged to quit the Neapolitan territories, and retire to Agropoli. Athanasius then directed his force against Capua, of which he made himself master in the year 882. The Saracens, however, still continued their incursions, and ravaged several provinces in such a manner, that they became entirely desolate.\n\nThese confusions continued for a long time; during which\nwhich the Greeks found an opportunity of making themselves masters of Benevento, and well nigh became masters also of Salerno; but in this they failed through the treachery of the bishop, and in the year 896 they were totally expelled by the bishop, four years after they had become masters of it. In 915 the Saracens received such an overthrow at Carigliano, that scarce one of them remained. However, a new body soon arrived from Africa, and infested the sea coasts for some time longer. A war also ensued between Landulph and the Greeks; which concluded disadvantageously for the former, who was obliged to submit to the emperor of Constantinople in 943.\n\nIn 961, Otho the Great, king of Germany, invaded Italy with a powerful army against Berengarius III., and, marching to Rome, received the imperial crown from the hands of the Pope. In 964, he created Capua into a principality, received homage from the other princes of Lombardy, and formed a design of recovering Puglia and Calabria from the Greeks. But in this last scheme he failed; and after various hostilities a treaty was concluded, and the young princess Theophania married to Otho's son, afterwards emperor.\n\nAll this time the Saracens continued their incursions; and the Greeks had gained ground so much, that they were now in possession of two thirds of the present kingdom of Naples; but in the year 1022 or 1023, the Normans first began to be remarkable in Italy. They had, about a century before, embraced Christianity, and become very zealous in all the superstitions which were then prevalent. They were particularly zealous in visiting sacred places, especially Rome, and the holy sepulchre at Jerusalem; and being naturally of a very martial disposition, they forced through great bodies of Greeks and Saracens who opposed their passage. About this time, or, as others write, 100, of these Normans, returning from Jerusalem by sea, landed at Salerno in the habit of pilgrims, where they were honourably received by Guaimarius. During their residence at Salerno, a great body of Saracens landed, and invested the city. Guaimarius, not being in a condition to oppose the invaders by force, was preparing to pay them a large sum of money, which they demanded, when the Normans proposed to attack them; and, having got arms and horses from the prince, they engaged the infidels with such fury and bravery, that they entirely defeated them, and obliged them to fly to their ships. By this complete victory Guaimarius was filled with such admiration of the valour of these strangers, that he entreated them to remain in his country; offering them lands, and the most honourable employments; but not being able to prevail with them to stay in Italy, or even accept of his presents; at their departure he sent some ambassadors with them to Normandy, in vessels loaded with exquisite fruits, rich furniture for horses, &c. in order to allure the valiant Normans to leave their own country. This kind invitation encouraged a Norman chief, named Olmonde Drengot, to settle in Italy about the year 1015; having killed another lord in a duel, which obliged him to leave his own country, in order to avoid the resentment of his sovereign, Robert duke of Normandy. In the mean time, the city of Bari had revolted from the Greeks, and chosen one Mello for their leader, whose wife and children happened soon after to fall into the hands of their enemies, and were sent prisoners to Constantinople. No sooner, therefore, did Mello hear of the arrival of these adventurers, than he engaged them to assist him; and having drawn together a considerable army, defeated the Greeks, with great slaughter, and obliged them to abandon their camp. In this engagement the Normans distinguished themselves by their bravery; and the news of their success soon brought from Normandy an innumerable multitude of their countrymen, with their wives and children. By this reinforcement, Mello gained two other victories, took a great many towns, and obliged the Greeks to abandon a large territory; but, in 1019, they were utterly defeated, and every thing recovered by the Greeks. The Greek general, Bajinno, continued to go on with such surprising success, that he almost entirely re-established the affairs of his countrymen in Italy, and made a distant province of the western part of Puglia, which he called Capitanata, and which to this day retains the name of Capitanata. His great progress at last alarmed the emperors of Germany; and, in 1027, Pandulfus prince of Capua made himself master of Naples; but was obliged, three years afterwards, to leave it, by the Normans, who built the city of Averla, which was now erected into a county. In consequence of this piece of good fortune, great numbers of Norman adventurers migrated into Italy; among whom were William, Drogo, and Umbert, three of the sons of Tancred duke of Hautville; from whose posterity these princes were descended, who first conquered the island of Sicily from the Saracens, and formed the present kingdom of Naples.\n\nIn 1040, the Greek emperor Michael Paleologus, in order to secure the affection of his sickly subjects, undertook the conquest of Italy from the Saracens, and for that purpose sent a general named Michael Maniacus into Sicily. This commander, hearing of the great reputation of the Normans, sent to Guaimarius, prince of Salerno, entreating him to grant him some of those warriors. His request was most willingly heardened to by the prince of Salerno, who, to encourage the Normans to engage in the expedition, promised them some additional rewards besides the emperor's pay. William, Drogo, and Umbert, accordingly marched from Salerno with 300 of their countrymen; and passing over into Sicily, distinguished themselves most remarkably in the conquest of that island. Maniacus acknowledged, that the recovery of Melina was chiefly owing to their valour; and William with his Normans gained a complete victory over the Saracens before Syracuse, where he killed the governor of the city in single combat. Maniacus made himself master of Syracuse, and almost entirely reduced the whole island; but being accused of treason, was next year carried prisoner to Constantinople. His successor Doceanus, being a man of no abilities, quickly lost the whole island except Melina, and treated his Norman auxiliaries with the utmost contempt. He would not allow them any share of the booty; and even caused one Ardoin, a noble Lombard, and associate and interpreter of the Normans, to be whipped round the camp, because he refused to part with the horse of a Saracen whom he had slain in single combat. The consequences of this tyrannical behaviour were very fatal to the Greeks.\nGreeks. Ardoin soon after obtained leave to return to Italy under a pretence of a vow, and all the Normans embarked at night along with him; but instead of going to Rome, Ardoin went immediately to Aversa, where he persuaded Count Rainulphus, sovereign of that province, to join with him in the design he had formed of attacking the Greek provinces in Italy, which he showed him, would be an easy conquest, as the inhabitants submitted with great reluctance to the Greeks, and the provinces were at that time almost entirely defenceless. Rainulphus approved of the scheme, and raised 300 soldiers, whom he sent under 12 officers to join the other Normans under the sons of Tancred; and made an agreement with Ardoin, that the conquests should be equally divided among the chief leaders. Their first enterprise was the reduction of Melphis, one of the strongest cities in Puglia, which presently surrendered; and they increased its fortifications so much, that it thenceforth became impregnable. Soon after this they made themselves masters of Venosa, Ascoli, and Lavello, with very little opposition.\n\nDoceanus, alarmed with the rapidity of their conquests, immediately left Sicily, and marched with his army into Puglia, where he attacked the invaders near the river Oliviento; but after a fierce engagement, he was obliged to retire with considerable loss. The Greeks were soon after defeated a second time at Cannae; and in a third engagement, which happened near the river Ofanto, the army of Doceanus was entirely routed, and he himself obliged to fly to Bari. On this bad success Doceanus was ordered to return to his command in Sicily, and another general was sent with an army into Puglia. This new commander, however, had no better success than his predecessor; for his army was entirely defeated in an engagement with the Normans, and he himself taken prisoner. Attenulphus, brother to one of the princes of Benevento on whom the Normans had conferred the chief command, set at liberty the captive general without consulting them, on receiving from him a considerable sum of money. With this the Normans were so much displeased that they deprived Attenulphus of his command, and bestowed it on Argyrus son to the late Mello, who had escaped from Constantinople, and now assumed the title of duke and prince of Italy. Before this time also Maniacus, whom we have formerly mentioned, had returned to Italy; and to strike the greater terror into the revolted cities, had executed a number of people of all ages and sexes with great inhumanity. Soon after this Maniacus openly rebelled against the Greek emperor Constantius, and prevailed upon his own army to proclaim him emperor, beginning hostilities immediately against the Greek cities. Argyrus at the same time took Giovenazzo and besieged Trani, and soon after besieged Maniacus himself in Taranto; but he, being afraid of falling into the hands of the Normans, fled to Otranto, and from thence to Bulgaria, where, being entirely defeated by one of the emperor's generals, he was taken prisoner, and had his head struck off.\n\nThe Normans having now conquered the greatest part of Puglia, proceeded to make a division of their conquest, in which, after each commander had got his proper share, the city of Mellis was left common to all, and appropriated as a place for assembling to consult about the most important affairs of the nation. Argyrus alone was neglected in this division; but he, having gained the favour of the emperor by expelling the rebel Maniacus from Italy, was by him created duke of Bari, on purpose to check the power of the Normans, with the title of prince and duke of Puglia. The Normans, however, were too powerful to be much awed by Argyrus, and behaved with great insolence to the neighbouring princes; but as they could not be expelled by force, and were confirmed in their conquests by Henry II., emperor of Germany in 1047, the Greek emperor attempted to get rid of them, by sending Argyrus with large sums of money to bribe them to enter into his service against the Persians. But they, perceiving the snare, replied that they were resolved not to leave Italy unless they were expelled by force; upon which Argyrus made use of the same money in bribing the Puglians to afflantinate these invaders. This brought on a massacre, in which greater numbers of the Normans perished than had fallen in all the late wars. Argyrus attempted to take advantage of the confusion produced by this massacre, but was defeated; after which he had recourse to Pope Leo, beseeching him to deliver Italy from these cruel tyrants; but this scheme proved still more unsuccessful than the others had been; for the pope himself was defeated and taken prisoner; and, in consequence of the respect shown by him by the Normans, granted them, as a fief of the holy see, all the conquests they had made or should make in Calabria and Sicily.\n\nSoon after this, the Norman power became extremely formidable; the famous Robert Guifcard ascended the throne in 1056. He made great progress in the conquest of Calabria, and reduced most of the cities which held out for the Greeks in these parts. About the same time the counts of Capua were expelled from their territory; and the abbot Desiderius mentions his having seen the children of Landulphus V., the last count, going about as vagabonds, and begging for their support. The pope alarmed by these conquests, excommunicated the Normans in wholesale, pretending that they had seized some of the territories belonging to the church; but, by the pretended submission of Robert, he not only was persuaded to take off the sentence of excommunication, but to invest him with the provinces of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. After this, he continued the war against the Greeks with great success. In 1071, in conjunction with his brother Roger, he conquered the island of Sicily, and gave by the investiture of the whole island to him with the title of count, referring to himself only the half of Palermo, Messina, and the valley of Demona. The like success attended his arms against Salerno in 1074; but after this, having unadvisedly taken some places from the pope, he again fell under the sentence of excommunication; yet he was reconciled to him in 1080, and received a second time the investiture of all his dominions. The next year he undertook an expedition against the Greeks; and though the emperor was assisted by a Venetian fleet, Robert made himself master of the island of Corfu, reduced Durazzo, and great part of Romania; infomuch that by the success of his arms, and his near approach to Constantinople, he struck an universal terror among the Greeks. But while Robert was thus extending his conquests, he was alarmed...\nNaples alarmed by the news of a formidable rebellion in Italy, and that the emperor Henry had taken the city of Rome, and closely shut up the pope in the castle of St. Angelo. Robert, therefore, leaving the command of the army to his son Boemund, returned to Italy, where he immediately dispersed the rebels, and released the pope, while his son gained a considerable victory over the Greeks. After this Robert made great preparations for another expedition into Greece, in order to second his son Boemund. Alexius Comnenus, who was about this time declared emperor by the Greek army, being assisted by the Venetian fleet, endeavoured to oppose his passage; but was entirely defeated, with the loss of a great many galleys. But a final stop was now put to his enterprises by his death, which happened in the island of Corfu in 1085.\n\nThough the power of the Normans was thus thoroughly established in Italy and Sicily, and though the prince of Benevento was in 1130 invested by the pope with the title of king of Sicily; yet by reason of the civil dissensions which took place among themselves, and the general confusion which reigned in Italy in those ages, they were obliged, notwithstanding all their valour, to submit to the emperor in 1195. By him the Sicilians were treated with so great cruelty, that the empress Constanza was induced to conspire against him in 1197, took him prisoner, and released him only on condition of his sending off his army immediately for the Holy Land. This was complied with; but the emperor did not long revive the reconciliation, being poisoned, as was supposed, by order of the empress.\n\nIn 1254 the pope claimed the kingdom as a fief devolved on the church in consequence of a sentence of deposition pronounced against King Frederick at the council of Lyons; and, in 1263, the kingdom was, in consequence of this right, conferred on Charles count of Anjou. After much contention and bloodshed, the French thus became masters of Sicily and Naples. Their government was unhappily tyrannical; and at the same time the haughtiness of their king so provoked the pope, that he resolved to humble him.\u2014Charles had resolved on an expedition against Constantinople; and for this purpose had fitted out a fleet of 100 galleys, 30 large ships, 200 transports, besides many other smaller vessels, on board of which he intended to embark 10,000 horse, and a numerous army of foot. This formidable armament greatly alarmed the emperor Michael Paleologus; for which reason he entered into a negotiation with John di Procida, a noble Salernitan, lord of the isle of Procida in the bay of Naples, who had formed a scheme for a general revolt in the island of Sicily. John, though a nobleman, was also a physician, and had been counsellor to two former princes, and even to King Charles himself; but being stripped of his estate by the king under pretence of treason, and his wife being debauched by the French, he retired to Constanza's queen of Arragon, where he was created a baron of the kingdom of Valencia, by her husband King Peter, and lord of Luxen, Benicassam, and Palma. As he was greatly exasperated against the French, he employed many spies both in Puglia and Sicily; and being informed that the Sicilians were totally disaffected to the French, he came to the island in disguise, and concerted a plan with the most powerful of the malecontents for a revolution in favour of Constanza, though she derived her right only as being the daughter of a former usurper named Manfred. Procida then set out for Constantinople, where, in some private conferences with the emperor, he persuaded him, that the most probable means of defeating Charles's scheme was by afflicting the Spaniards and Sicilian malecontents. Paleologus accordingly granted him a large sum of money, and on his departure sent one of his secretaries along with him, who, landing in Sicily, had a conference with the chief conspirators. John, having received letters from them, disguised himself in the habit of a Franciscan, and went to Suriano in the neighbourhood of Rome. As he well knew the enmity which subsisted between the pope and King Charles, he disclosed his design to his holiness; who readily entered into his measures, wrote to Peter to hasten his armament, promising him the investiture of the island as soon as he had taken possession of it; and, by refusing the alliance he had promised to Charles, obliged him for the present to delay his expedition. In the beginning of the year 1285, Procida returned to Arragon, and by showing the letters from the pope and Sicilian barons, prevailed on Peter to embark in his design, by assuring him of the assistance of Paleologus. This king of Arragon accordingly prepared a formidable fleet under pretence of invading Africa, and is even said to have received 20,000 ducats from Charles, in order to afflit him in his preparations.\n\nBut while John went on thus successfully with his scheme, all his measures were in danger of being broken by the death of Pope Nicholas. The new pope, Martin IV., was entirely in the interest of Charles, on whom, in 1281, he conferred the senatorial dignity of Rome. Procida, however, still refused to prosecute his scheme; and, leaving Italy, had another conference with the conspirators in Sicily; after which, he again went to Constantinople, and obtained from Paleologus 30,000 ounces of gold, with which he immediately returned to Arragon. The death of Nicholas had damped the ardour of Peter; but, being urged with great earnestness by John, he again renewed his preparations; which alarmed the pope and the king of France. In consequence of this they sent a message to him, desiring to know against what Saracens he designed to employ his armament. In this particular Peter refused to satisfy them; upon which they earnestly counselled Charles to guard against an invasion; but he neglected their advice, being wholly intent on his eastern expedition, and encouraged by a revolt which had happened in Greece; and to facilitate his expedition, he prevailed on the pope to excommunicate the Greeks, on pretence that they had broken some of the articles of union concluded at the council of Lyons a few years before. Peter in the mean time continued his preparations with great diligence, intending to put to sea the following summer. Procida had returned to Palermo, to wait for a favourable opportunity of putting his design in execution, which was soon afforded him by the French. On Easter Monday, March 30, 1282, the chief conspirators had assembled at Palermo; and, after dinner, both the Palermitans and French went in a grand procession to the church of Monreale, about three miles without the city. While they were sporting\nNaples, sporting in the fields, a bride happened to pass by with her train, who being observed by one Drochetus, a Frenchman, he ran to her, and began to use her in a rude manner, under pretence of searching for concealed arms. A young Sicilian, exasperated at this affront, stabbed him with his own sword; and a tumult ensuing, 200 French were immediately murdered. The enraged populace then ran to the city, crying out, \"Let the French die, let the French die!\" and, without distinction of age or sex, slaughtered all of that nation they could find, even such as had fled to the churches.\n\nThe conspirators then left Palermo, and excited the inhabitants to murder the French all over the island, excepting in Messina, which city at first refused to be concerned in the revolt. But, being invited by the Palermians to throw off the French yoke, a few weeks after, the citizens in a tumultuous manner destroyed some of the French; and pulling down the arms of King Charles, and erecting those of the city, chose one Baldwin for their governor, who saved the remaining French from the fury of the populace, and allowed them to transport themselves, with their wives and children to Italy. Eight thousand persons are said to have been murdered on this occasion.\n\nImmediately after this massacre, the Sicilians offered their allegiance to the king of Arragon; who accepted of the invitation, and landed with his forces at Trapani. From thence he went to Palermo, where he was crowned king of Sicily with great solemnity, and Charles left the island with precipitation. The day after he landed his army in Italy, the Arragonian fleet arrived, took 29 of his galleys, and the next day burnt 80 transports in presence of his army. Soon after this Charles sent an embassy to Peter, accusing him of perfidy, in invading his dominions in time of peace; and, according to some, challenged him at the same time to decide the matter by single combat. Others say that the challenge was given by Peter. Certain it is, however, that a challenge was given, and to appearance accepted; but Peter determined to employ much more effectual means in support of his pretensions than trifling to a duel; and therefore pushed on his operations most vigourously, while his adversary trifled away his time; and thus he at last became master of the contested kingdom; which, however, he did not long enjoy, dying about the end of the year 1285.\n\nBy his will, Peter left the kingdom of Arragon to his eldest son Alphonso, and Sicily to Don James his other son, who was also to succeed to the kingdom of Arragon in case Alphonso should die without male issue. Accordingly, Don James was solemnly crowned at Palermo the 2d of February 1286. In 1293, however, he deserted them, and tamely resigned up his right to Charles, son to him above mentioned, in a manner perhaps unparalleled. On his resignation the Sicilians conferred the crown upon his brother Don Frederic; after which the war continued with great violence till the year 1303, when a peace was concluded, and the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily formally disjoined; Frederic being allowed to keep the latter, under the name of Trinacria; and Charles being confirmed in the possession of the former, which he quietly enjoyed till his death in 1329.\n\nNaples continued to be governed by its own kings till the beginning of the 16th century, when the kings of France and Spain contended for the sovereignty of this country. Frederic, at that time king of Naples, resigned the sovereignty to Louis XII., on being created duke of Anjou, and receiving an annual pension of 30,000 ducats. But, in 1504, the French were entirely defeated by the Spaniards, and obliged to evacuate the kingdom; and the following year Louis renounced all pretensions to the crown, which from that time hath remained almost constantly in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nThe government of the Spaniards proved no less oppressive to the Neapolitans than that of others had been. The kings of Spain set no bounds to their exactions, and of consequence the people were loaded with all manner of taxes; even the most indispensable necessaries of life not being exempted. In 1647, a new tax was laid on fruit; which the people looked upon as the most grievous oppression, the chief part of their subsistence, during the summer months, being fruit, which in the kingdom of Naples is very plentiful and delicious. The edict for collecting the new duty was no sooner published, than the people began to murmur abroad, they surrounded his coach, bawling out to have their grievances redressed. They were encouraged in their sedition, by the news that the citizens of Palermo had actually revolted on account of the imposition of new duties. The viceroy, therefore, apprehensive of greater disorders, began to think of taking off the tax; but those who farmed the tax having bribed some of his favourites, he was by their means persuaded not to abolish it. The indignation of the people, who had suspected his intention, was now greatly increased, especially as they were privately excited by several malecontents. The farmers of the revenue, and all those concerned in raising the taxes, had incurred the hatred and detestation of the people, particularly of Tommaso Maffiello, commonly called Maffiello, an Amalfi fisherman, whose wife, having been discovered smuggling a small quantity of meal, was imprisoned, and condemned to pay a fine of 100 ducats.\n\nMaffiello, a few years before, had come to Naples from Amalfi, where his father had been a fisherman. At this time he was about 24 years of age, and the father of four children. He was of a middle stature, and an agreeable aspect; was distinguished for his boldness, activity, and integrity; and had a great influence with his companions, by whom he was beloved and esteemed. As he was obliged even to sell his furniture to pay the heavy fine, he had conceived an implacable hatred against the farmers of the taxes, and was also moved with compassion for the miserable state of the city and kingdom. He therefore formed a design, with some of his companions, to raise a tumult in the market place on the festival-day of the Carmelites, usually celebrated about the middle of July, when between 500 and 600 youths entertain the people by a mock fight; one half of them, in the character of Turks, defending a wooden castle, which is attacked and stormed by the other half in the character of Christians. Maffiello being appointed captain of one of these parties, and one Piore, who was privy to his design, commanding the other, for several weeks before...\nbefore the festival they were very diligent in reviewing and training their followers, who were armed with sticks and reeds; but, a small and unforeseen accident tempted them to begin their enterprise without waiting for the festival.\n\nOn the 7th of July a dispute happening in the market-place betwixt the tax-gatherers and some gardeners of Pozzuolo who had brought some figs into the city, whether the buyer or seller should pay the duty; after the tumult had continued several hours, Maffianello, who was present with his company, excited the mob to pillage the office built in the market for receiving the duty, and to drive away the officers with stones. The elect of the people, who, by deciding against the gardeners, had increased the tumult, ran to the palace, and informed the viceroy, who most imprudently neglected all means of putting a stop to the commotion. Maffianello, in the mean time, being joined by great numbers of people, ordered his young troop to set fire to all the offices for the taxes through the city; which command being executed with dispatch, he then conducted them directly to the palace, where the viceroy, instead of ordering his Spanish and German guards to disperse them, encouraged their insolence by timidly granting their demands. As they rushed into the palace in a furious manner, he escaped by a private door, and endeavoured to save himself in Ca' del Ovo; but being overtaken by the rioters in the streets, he was trampled upon by them, and pulled by the hair and whiskers. However, by throwing some handfuls of gold among them, he again escaped, and took sanctuary in a convent of Minims, where, being joined by the archbishop of Naples, Cardinal Filomarini, and several nobles, by their advice he signed a billet, by which he abolished all taxes upon provisions. As a means to quell the tumult, he likewise desired the cardinal to offer Maffianello a pension of 2400 crowns, who generously rejected the bribe; and declared, that if the viceroy would keep his word, he would find them obedient subjects.\n\nIt was now expected that the tumult would cease; but Maffianello, upon his return to the market-place, being joined by several malecontents, among whom were Genuino and one Peronne, who had formerly been a captain of the Sbirri, he was advised by them to order the houses of those concerned in raising the tax to be burned; which were accordingly in a few days reduced to ashes, with all their rich furniture. Maffianello being now absolute master of the whole city, and being joined by great numbers of people of desperate fortunes, he required the viceroy, who had retired to the Ca' del Nuovo, to abolish all the taxes, and to deliver up the writ of exemption granted by Charles V. This new demand greatly embarrassed the viceroy; but to appease the people, he drew up a false deed in letters of gold, and sent it to them by their favourite the duke of Matalone, who had before been in confinement. The fraud, however, being discovered, the duke was pulled from his horse and maltreated by the mob, and at length committed as a prisoner to Peronne. This accident, to the great joy of the viceroy, enraged the people against the nobility, several of whom they killed, burnt the houses of others, and threatened to extirpate them all. Maffianello, in the mean time, tattered and half naked, commanded his followers, who were now well armed, and reckoned about 100,000 men, with a most absolute sway. He ate and slept little, gave his orders with great precision and judgment, appeared full of moderation, without ambition and interested views. But the duke of Matalone having procured his liberty by bribing Peronne, the viceroy imitated his example, and secretly corrupted Genuino to betray his chief. A conspiracy was accordingly formed against Maffianello by Matalone and Peronne; the duke, who was equally exasperated against the viceroy, proposing, that after his death his brother D. Joseph should head the rebels.\n\nMaffianello in the mean time, by means of the cardinal archbishop was negotiating a general peace and accommodation; but while both parties were assembling in the convent of the Carmelites, the banditti hired by Matalone made an unsuccessful attempt upon Maffianello's life. His followers immediately killed 150 of them. Peronne and D. Joseph being discovered to be concerned in the conspiracy, were likewise put to death, and the duke with great difficulty escaped. Maffianello by this conspiracy was rendered more suspicious and severe. He began to abuse his power by putting several persons to death upon slight pretences; and, to force the viceroy to an accommodation, he cut off all communication with the castles, which were unprovided with provision and ammunition.\u2014The viceroy likewise being afraid lest the French should take advantage of the commotion, earnestly desired to agree to a treaty; which was accordingly concluded on the fifth day of the insurrection, by the mediation of the archbishop. By the treaty it was stipulated, that all duties imposed since the time of Charles V. should be abolished; that the writ of exemption granted by that emperor should be delivered to the people; that for the future no new taxes should be imposed; that the vote of the elect of the people should be equal to the votes of the nobility; that an act of oblivion should be granted for all that was past; and that the people should continue in arms under Maffianello till the ratification of the treaty by the king.\n\nBy this treaty, no less than 10,000 persons who fattened upon the blood of the public were ruined.\u2014The people when it was solemnly published, manifested an extreme joy, believing they had now recovered all their ancient rights and privileges. Maffianello, at the desire of the viceroy, went to the palace to visit him, accompanied by the archbishop, who was obliged to threaten him with excommunication, before he would consent to lay aside his rags and assume a magnificent dress. He was received by the duke with the greatest demonstrations of respect and friendship, while the duchess entertained his wife, and presented her with a robe of cloth of silver, and some jewels.\u2014The viceroy, to preserve some shadow of authority, appointed him captain-general; and at his departure Maffianello made him a present of a golden chain of great value, which with great difficulty he was prevailed upon to accept; but yielded at length to the entreaties of the cardinal. Next day, in consequence of the commission granted him by the viceroy, he began to exercise all the functions of sovereign authority; and having caused a scaffold to be erected in one of the streets, and fe-\nNaples.veral gibbets, he judged all crimes, whether civil or military, in the last resort; and ordered the guilty to be immediately put to death, which was the punishment he assigned to all offences. Though he neglected all forms of law, and even frequently judged by physiognomy, yet he is said not to have overlooked any criminal, or punished any innocent person.\n\nHis grandeur and prosperity were of very short continuance; for his mind becoming distracted and delirious for two or three days, he committed a great many mad and extravagant actions; and on the 18th of July he was affliliated with the consent of the viceroy.\n\nThe tumult did not end with the death of Massaniello: on the contrary, the people now expelled the Spaniards from most of the cities throughout the kingdom; and this general insurrection being the subject of discourse at Rome, the duke of Guise, who happened then to be at the pope's court, took the opportunity, at the instigation of his holiness, to offer his service to the Neapolitans against the Spaniards. The duke was prompted by his ambition to engage in this enterprise, especially as he himself had some distant pretensions to the crown. The Spaniards in the meantime made a vigorous attack on the city; but were repulsed by the people, who now formally renounced their allegiance to them. In a short time, however, their city being surprised by the new viceroy, the count d'Oniste, and the duke of Guise himself taken prisoner, the people returned to their allegiance; and thus all the attempts of the French on Naples were frustrated. From that time the Spaniards continued in peaceable possession of the kingdom till the year 1707, when it was taken from them by Prince Eugene. It was formally ceded to the emperor by the treaty of Rastadt in 1713; but was recovered by the Spaniards in 1734, and the king of Spain's eldest son is now king of Naples and Sicily. For a particular account of these revolutions, see the articles SPAIN and SICILY.\n\nThe climate of Naples is extremely hot, especially in July, August, and September. In winter there is seldom any ice or snow, except on the mountains.\u2014On account of its fertility, it is justly termed an earthly paradise; for it abounds with all sorts of grain, the finest fruit and garden productions of every kind, with rice, flax, oil, and wine, in the greatest plenty and perfection. It affords also saffron, manna, alum, vitriol, sulphur, rock crystal, marble, and several sorts of minerals, together with fine wool, and silk. The horses of this country are famous, and the flocks and herds very numerous. Besides these products, of which a considerable part is exported, there are manufactures of snuff, soap, and glassware. Waistcoats, caps, stockings, and gloves, are also made of the hair or filaments of a shell fish, which are warmer than those of wool, and of a beautiful glossy green. In this kingdom likewise is found that called the Phrygian stone, or pietra fungifera, which, being laid in a damp shady place, will yield mushrooms, sometimes of a very large size, especially if the stone is sprinkled with hot water. See AGARICUS.\n\nAs to the mountains of this country, the principal are the Apennines, which traverse it from south to north; and Mount Vesuvius, which, as is well known, is a noted volcano, five Italian miles from Naples. The side of this mountain next the sea yields wine, particularly the two famed wines called Vino Greco and Lacryma Christi. One of the greatest inconveniences to which this kingdom is exposed is earthquakes, which the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius contribute, in some measure, to prevent. Another inconvenience, which, however, is common to it with other hot countries, is the great number of reptiles and insects, of which some are very poisonous.\n\nWith respect to religion, it is on a very bad footing here. The number of convents and monasteries is astonishing. It is said, the clergy and convents possess two thirds of the whole kingdom: nay, some maintain, that were the kingdom divided into five parts, four would be found in the hands of the church. Notwithstanding this power and influence of the clergy, they have not been able hitherto to get the inquisition established here. In the year 1721, measures were taken for lessening the number of convents; and lately the order of Jesuits hath been suppressed. The papal bulls cannot be made public without the king's permission; nor are Protestants compelled to kneel in the churches, or at meeting the host; and in Lent they can very easily procure flesh meat. In the year 1740, the Jews were allowed to settle in the kingdom during the term of 50 years, and several privileges were granted them during that period; at the expiration of which, the grant was promised to be renewed, unless they were expressly ordered to quit the country.\n\nThe revenue of the kingdom is generally computed at 3,000,000 of crowns: but, as Mr Addison observes, there is no country in Europe which pays greater taxes, and where, at the same time, the public is less the better for them, most of them going to the enriching of the private persons to whom they are mortgaged.\n\nThe military force of this kingdom is said to consist of about 30,000 men, of which the Swiss regiments are the best. As to the marine, it consists only of a few galleys. The only order here is that of St Januarius, which was instituted by Don Carlos in the year 1738.\n\nThe king of Naples, or of the two Sicilies, is an hereditary monarch. The high colleges are, the council of state, the privy council, the treasury, the Sicily council, the council of war, &c. This kingdom is a papal fief; and the king, in acknowledgement of the pope's feudal right, sends him every year a white palfrey, and a purse of 6000 ducats. The title of the king's eldest son is prince of Calabria. The number both of the high and low nobility in the kingdom of Naples is very great. \"I am assured (says Dr Moore) that the king of Naples counts among his subjects 1000 persons with the title of prince, and a still greater in Italy, with that of duke. Six or seven of these have estates which produce from 10 to 12 or 13,000l. a-year; a considerable number have fortunes of about half that value; and the annual revenue of many is not above 1000l. or 2000l. The inferior orders of the nobility are much poorer. Many counts and marquises have not above 300l. or 400l. a-year of paternal estate; many have still less; and not a few enjoy the title without any estate whatever. These nobles, however, are excessively fond of splendour and show, which appears in the brilliancy of their equipages, the number of their attendants, the richness of their dress, and the grandeur...\ngrandeur of their titles. The finest carriages are painted, gilt, varnished, and lined, in a richer and more beautiful manner than has yet become fashionable either in England or in France. They are often drawn by six and sometimes by eight horses. Before the carriage, it is the mode to have two running footmen, and behind three or four servants in the richest liveries. The ladies and gentlemen within the coaches glitter in all the brilliancy of lace, embroidery, and jewels.\u2014This finery is not confined to the persons within and without the coaches; it is extended to the horses, whose heads, manes, and tails, are ornamented with the rarest plumage, and set off with ribbons and artificial flowers.\u201d\n\nWe shall mention a circumstance from which an idea may be formed of the grandeur of a Neapolitan palace, and the number of domestics which some of the nobility retain. \u201cI dined (continues our author) at the prince Iacc\u00ec\u2019s, where we passed through 12 or 13 large rooms before we arrived at the dining-room. There were 36 persons at table served by the prince\u2019s domestics, and each guest had a footman behind his chair, while other domestics belonging to the prince remained in the adjacent rooms and in the hall. No estate in England could support such a number of servants, paid and fed as English servants are; but in Naples the wages are very moderate indeed, and the greater number of men servants, belonging to the first families, give their attendance through the day only, and find beds and provisions for themselves. It must be remembered also, that few of the nobles give any entertainments; and those who do not are said to live very sparingly; so that the whole of their revenue, whatever it may be, is expended on articles of show.\u201d\n\nIn the kingdom of Naples, the hereditary jurisdiction of the nobles over their vassals subsists in the full rigour of the feudal government. The peasants therefore are poor; and it depends entirely on the personal character of the master, whether their poverty be not the least of their grievances. As this power is too often abused, the importance of the nobility depends in a great measure on the favour of the king, who, under pretence of any offence, can confine them to their estates, or imprison them at pleasure. Unless this prince were so very politic as to disgust all the nobility at once, and so unite the whole body against him, he has little to fear from their resentment. Even in case of such an union, as the nobles have lost the affection of their vassals, what could they do in opposition to a standing army of 30,000 men, entirely devoted to the crown? The government of Naples, therefore, is in fact a despotic monarchy, though something like the form of a feudal constitution in its ancient purity is still kept up by the biennial summons of the general assembly. This convention, which consists of the nobility and commons, is called together every two years, to deliberate on the customary free gift to the crown.\n\nThe inhabitants of this country have at all times borne but an indifferent character among other nations. \u201cFrom the few hints dropped by the classic authors, we collect that the ancient Neapolitans were a race of epicures, of a soft indolent turn, averse from martial exercises, passionately fond of theatrical amusements and music, expert in all the refined arts that administer to the caprices of luxury, extravagant in their expressions and gestures, and dupes to various sorts of superstition. If we make allowance for a quantity of northern blood which has joined the original Grecian stream, and imparted a roughness not yet worn off by the mildness of the climate, we shall find the modern Neapolitans very like the ancient.\u2014Provisions being here plentiful and cheap, the lower class of people work but little. Their delight is to bask in the sun, and do nothing. Persons of a middle rank frequent places of public resort; and very few of any rank attend to their proper business with the zeal and activity we are wont to meet with in the professional men of colder countries. Gluttony is a predominant vice, while instances of sobriety are comparatively rare. In the female sex, the passion for finery is almost superior to every other; and, though chastity is not the characteristic virtue of the country, Mr Swinburne doubts whether a Neapolitan woman would not nine times out of ten prefer a present to a lover. That furious jealousy for which the nation was once so remarkable, is now greatly abated. The breach of the conjugal vow sometimes occasions quarrels and affinities among people of an inferior station; and in the metropolis, affinities are often perpetrated from much less cogent motives. Of these vices, many are doubtless owing to that slavery and oppression under which they groan, and to a radical defect in the administration of justice, though the kingdom is divided into 12 provinces or jurisdictions.\n\nSuch was the former state of Naples. But being seized by the emperor of France, he affirmed, \u201cthe Neapolitan dynasty has ceased to reign; its existence is incompatible with the repose of Europe, and the honour of our crown.\u201d By virtue of a decree which passed in the month of March 1806, the emperor Napoleon conferred the kingdom of Naples on his highness Prince Joseph, and his legitimate heirs male, referring to that prince the rights assured to him by the constitutions of the empire, in providing always that the crown of France and that of Naples shall never be united upon the same head. No political changes of any importance have since taken place in that country.\n\nNaples, anciently Parthenope, afterwards Neapolis, the capital of the kingdom of that name in Italy, lies in the province called Terra di Lavoro, which is the richest and best inhabited of the whole kingdom, and comprehends a part of the ancient Campania Felix or the Happy. This city is fabled to owe its foundation to a Syren, and to have received its ancient name from its supernatural founders. Whatever be its origin, it is the first for neatness, and the second for extent, of all the cities in Italy. It was formerly a place of strength; but its walls at present being of no real defence, its safety depends of course upon the force of its armies. It is most advantageously situated, having a delicious country on one side, and a noble bay of the Mediterranean on the other, with an excellent harbour. The circumference, including the suburbs, is said not to be less than 18 Italian miles, and the number of the inhabitants therein little less than 400,000. The houses are of stone, flat roofed, and generally lofty and uniform; but many of them have balconies, with lattice windows. The streets are well paved; but they are not lighted at night, and in the daytime are disfigured, in many places, by stalls, on which provisions are exposed to sale. Here are a great number of fine churches,\nNAP\n\nchurches, convents, fountains, and palaces of the nobility, many of whom constantly reside here. It is usual to walk on the tops of the houses in the evenings, to breathe the sweet cool air, after a hot sultry day. The climate here is so mild and warm, even in the winter, that plenty of green peas, artichokes, asparagus, and other vegetables, may be had so early as the beginning of the new year, and even all the winter. This city swarms with monks and nuns of all sorts, to such a degree, that there are no less than 19 convents of the Dominicans alone, 18 of the Franciscans, 8 of the Augustines, and an equal proportion of the rest. The magnificence of many of the churches exceeds imagination. In a cloister of the Carthusian monastery is a crucifix, said to be done by Michael Angelo, of inimitable workmanship.\n\nTo repel hostile attempts by sea, which, from its situation, maritime powers might be tempted to make, Naples has, to the west, the Castel del Ovo, a confused pile of ancient buildings, and some modern batteries. The rock upon which this fortress stands was originally called Megara, then Lucullanum; and was considered as a place of strength so early as the year 475. Along the line of the shore towards the east are some batteries on the points of land, the bastions of the arsenal, and above it the lofty wall of the Castel Nuovo. This last fortress has been the usual refuge of the sovereigns and viceroys in all civil wars and tumults; for which reason they have long fixed their residence near its walls. A blockhouse and batteries defend the mouth of the harbour, and at the eastern extremity of the town is the Torrione de Carmine, better known by the figure it made in Massaniello's rebellion than by its extent or military strength. The castle of Saint Elmo commands Naples in every direction, and is in reality calculated rather to annoy and awe the citizens than to defend them from foreign invaders. The city is indeed far from being secure against a bombardment; for the sea is so deep, that a large vessel may come up to the very mole in defiance of the blockhouse and batteries, &c. Pictures, statues, and antiquities, are not so common in Naples as might be expected in so great and ancient a city, many of the most valuable pieces having been sent to Spain by the viceroys. The bay is one of the finest in the world, being almost of a round figure, about 30 miles in diameter, and three parts of it sheltered with a noble circuit of woods and mountains. The city stands in the bow of this bay, in a pleasant situation, perhaps, as is in the world. Mr Keyfley says, they reckon about 18,000 donne libere, or courtezans, in the city; and Dr Moore computes the number of lazzaroni or blackguards at above 30,000. The greater part of these wretches have no dwelling houses, but sleep every night under porticos, piazzas, or any kind of shelter they can find. Those of them who have wives and children, live in the suburbs of Naples near Pausilippe, in huts, or in caverns or chambers dug out of that mountain. They are generally represented as a lazy, licentious, and turbulent set of people, as indeed by far the greater part of the rabble are, who prefer begging or robbing, or running errands, to any fixed and permanent employment. Yet there are in Naples some flourishing manufactures, particularly of silk flockings, soap, snuff-boxes of tortoise shells and the lava of Mount Vesuvius, tables, and ornamental furniture of marble. The city is supplied with a vast quantity of water, by means of a very costly aqueduct, from the foot of Mount Vesuvius. Mr Addison says, it is incredible how great a multitude of retainers to the law there are in Naples, who find continual employment from the fiery temper of the inhabitants. There are five piazzas or squares in the city, appropriated to the nobility, viz. those called Capuana, Nido, Montagna, Porto, and Porta Nova. Of all the palaces, that of the king is not only the most magnificent, but also in the best style of architecture. The cathedral, though Gothic, is a very grand splendid edifice. It is here that the head and blood of St Janarius, the tutelary saint of Naples, are kept, the latter in two glass or crystal vials. The pretended liquefaction of the dried blood, as soon as brought near the head of the saint, is a thing well known; Mr Addison says, it is one of the most bungling tricks he ever saw. The harbour is spacious, and kept in good repair. It is fortified with a mole, which runs about a quarter of a mile into the sea, and at the extremity has a high lanthorn to direct ships safely into the harbour. Luxury here is restrained by severe sumptuary laws, and the women are more closely confined than in any other city of Italy. Here is an university and two academies of arts, the one called Gli Ardenti, and the other Gli Ottici. The nunnery for ladies of quality is said to be the largest in the whole world, containing no less than 350 nuns, besides servants. The Mount of Piety, or the office for advancing money to the poor, on pledges, at a low interest, or without any, has an income of upwards of 50,000 ducats. The arsenal is said to contain arms for 50,000 men. The walls of the city consist of hard black quarry stones, called piperno. Instead of ice vast quantities of snow are used for cooling their liquors, not so much as water being drank without it; so that, it is said, a scarcity of it would as soon occasion a mutiny as a dearth of corn or provisions. Certain persons, who farm the monopoly of it from the government, supply the city all the year round from a mountain about 18 miles off, at so much the pound. In the beginning of 1799, it was taken by a body of French troops under General Championet. The streets of this city were lighted for the first time on the 16th December, 1826. Naples stands 110 miles south-east from Rome, 164 north-east from Palermo in Sicily, 217 south-east from Florence, and 300 from Venice. E. Long. 14. 20. N.

Claudius Aquaviva, a famous general of the Jesuits, who died in 1615, was of this family.","sp":236,"ep":236},{"h":"NARDUS","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the tritandra clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, Gramina. See Botany Index.\n\nThis plant was highly valued by the ancients, both as an article of luxury and medicine. The unguentum nardinum, was used at baths and feasts as a favourite perfume. Its value is evident from that passage of Scripture, where our Saviour's head was anointed with a box of it, with which Judas found fault. From a passage in Horace it appears that this ointment was so valuable among the Romans, that as much as could be contained in a small box of precious stone was considered as a fort of equivalent for a large vessel of wine, and a proper quota for a guest to contribute at an entertainment, according to the ancient custom:\n\nNardo vina mererebe,\nNardi parvus onyx eliciet cadum.","sp":236,"ep":236},{"h":"NAREA","t":"the most southerly province of the empire of Abyssinia; a kingdom still governed by its own princes, who have the title of Beneros. Its territory was formerly more extensive than at present, the Galla having almost quite surrounded it, especially on the south-east and north. The country to the west is the most unknown part of Africa; the kingdom itself stands like a fortified place in the middle of a plain, being a high and mountainous country. A great many rivers, rising in the fourth and fifth degrees of north latitude, spread themselves over the level part of the country, and fill it with marshes all the way from south by east to north or north-west. These marshes are bounded by mountains, of which those nearest the marshes are overgrown with coffee trees, the largest, if not the only ones, which grow in this country. The kingdom of Narea Proper is interspersed with small, wholesome, but very fertile valleys. The mountainous country of Caffa adjoins immediately to Narea, and is said to be governed by a separate prince; but the Galla having settled themselves in all the flat ground to the very edge of the marshes, have in a great measure cut off the communication with Abyssinia for a long time past. The Nareans who inhabit the mountainous country have the lightest complexion of any people in Abyssinia; but those who inhabit the borders of the marshes are perfectly black, and have the features and woolly heads of negroes; but the mountaineers of Narea, and much more those of Caffa, are fair complexioned, more so than even the Neapolitans or Sicilians. It is said that snow has been seen to lie on some of the mountains of Caffa; but Mr Bruce imagines this to be a mistake, and thinks that it must have been hail.\n\nNarea abounds with cattle, grain, and all kinds of provisions, both in the high and low country. The medium of commerce is gold, which they sell by weight; but the principal articles of trade are coarse cotton cloths, antimony, beads, and incense, which are carried from this country to the kingdom of Angola, and the parts of the African continent towards the Atlantic. The people are exceedingly brave; and though they have been driven out of the low country by multitudes of Galla, they now bid them defiance, and drive them from their frontiers whenever they come too near. The Narean prisoners taken in these skirmishes are sold to the Mahometan merchants at Gondar; and at Constantinople, Cairo, or in India, the women are more esteemed than those of any other part of the world. Both sexes have a cheerful kind disposition, and attach themselves inviolably to their masters, if properly treated. The people of Narea and Caffa speak a language peculiar to themselves.","sp":236,"ep":236},{"h":"NARRATION","t":"NARRATION, in oratory, poetry, and history, a recital or rehearsal of a fact as it happened, or as it is supposed to have happened. See ORATORY, No. 26.\n\nConcerning NARRATION and DESCRIPTION we have the following rules and observations in the Elements of Criticism.\n\n1. The first rule is, That in history the reflections ought to be chaste and solid; for while the mind is intent upon truth, it is little disposed to the operation of the imagination. STRADA's Belgic History is full of poetical images, which being discordant with the subject, are unpleasant; and they have a still worse effect by giving an air of fiction to a genuine history. Such flowers ought to be scattered with a sparing hand, even in epic poetry; and at no rate are they proper till the reader be warmed, and by an enlivened imagination be prepared to relish them; in that state of mind, they are agreeable; but while we are sedate and attentive to an historical chain of facts, we reject with disdain every fiction.\n\n2. VIDA, following Horace, recommends a modest commencement of an epic poem; giving for a reason that the writer ought to husband his fire. Besides bold thoughts and figures are never relished till the mind be heated and thoroughly engaged, which is not the reader's case at the commencement. Homer introduces not a single simile in the first book of the Iliad, nor in the first book of the Odyssey. On the other hand, Shakespeare begins one of his plays with a sentiment too bold for the most heated imagination:\n\nBedford. Hung be the heav'ns with black, yield day to night!\nComets, importing change of times and states,\nBrandish your crystal tresses in the sky;\nAnd with them scourge the bad revolving stars,\nThat have consented unto Henry's death!\nHenry the Fifth, too famous to live long!\nEngland ne'er lost a king of so much worth.\n\nFirst part Henry VI.\n\nThe passage with which Strada begins his history, is too poetical for a subject of that kind; and at any rate too high for the beginning of a grave performance.\n\n3. A third rule or observation is, That where the subject is intended for entertainment solely, not for instruction, a thing ought to be described as it appears, not as it is in reality. In running; for example, the impulse upon the ground is proportioned in some degree to the celerity of motion; though in appearance it is otherwise, for a person in swift motion seems to skim the ground, and scarcely to touch it. VIRGIL, with great taste, describes quick running according to appearance; and raises an image far more lively than by adhering scrupulously to truth:\n\nHos super adventit Volsc\u00e6a de gente Camilla,\nAgmen agens equitum, et florentes \u00e6re catervas,\nBellatrix: non illa colo calathiv\u00e6 Minerv\u00e6\nFemin\u00e6\u00e6 affluit\u00e6 manus; fed pr\u00e6lia virgo\nDura pati cursuque pedum, pr\u00e6vertere ventos.\nIlla vel intact\u00e6 legetis per summa volaret\nGramina, nec teneras curfu leefifet arilias:\nVel mare per medium, fluctu suspensa tumenti,\nFerret iter, celestes nec tingeret \u00e6quore plantas.\n\u00c6neid, vii. 803.\n\nIn narration as well as in description, objects ought to be painted so accurately as to form in the mind of the reader distinct and lively images. Every useless circumstance ought indeed to be suppressed, because every such circumstance loads the narration; but if a circumstance be necessary, however slight, it cannot be described too minutely. The force of language consists in raising complete images, which have the effect to transport the reader as by magic into the very place of the important action, and to convert him as it were into a spectator, beholding every thing that passes. The narrative in an epic poem ought to rival a picture in the liveliness and accuracy of its representations: no circumstance must be omitted that tends to make a complete image; because an imperfect image, as well as any other imperfect conception, is cold and uninteresting. We shall illustrate this rule by several examples, giving the first place to a beautiful passage from Virgil:\n\nQualis populea merens Philomela sub umbra;\nAm\u00ecs\u00ecs queritur f\u0153tus, quos durus arator\nObservans nido implantes detraxit.\nGeorg., lib. iv. 511.\n\nThe poplar, ploughman, and unsledged young, though not essential in the description, tend to make a complete image, and upon that account are an embellishment.\n\nAgain:\n\nHic viridem \u00c6neas frondenti ex ilice metam\nConstituit, signum nautis.\n\u00c6neid. v. 129.\n\nHorace addressing to Fortune:\n\nTe pauper ambit follicita prece\nRuris colonus: te dominam sequoris,\nQuicumque Bithyn\u00e6 lacessit\nCarpathium pelagus carin\u00e6.\nCarm. lib. i. ode 35.\n\n\u2014 Illum ex moenibus hosticis\nMatrona bellantis tyranni\nProspiciens, et adula virgo,\nSubspiret: Eheu, ne rudi agminum\nSponfus lacessat regius aperum\nTactu leonem, quem cruenta\nPer medias rapit ira caedes.\nCarm. lib. iii. ode 2.\n\nShakespeare says, \"You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice by fanning in his face with a peacock's feather.\" The peacock's feather, not to mention the beauty of the object, completes the image: an accurate image cannot be formed of that fanciful operation, without conceiving a particular feather; and one is at a loss when this is neglected in the description. Again, \"The rogues flighted me into the river with as little remorse, as they would have drown'd a bitch's blind puppies, fifteen i' th' litter.\"\n\nOld Lady. You would not be a queen?\nAnne. No, not for all the riches under heaven.\nOld Lady. 'Tis strange: a threepence bow'd would hire me, old as I am, to queen it.\n\nHenry VIII. act. ii. sc. 5.\n\nIn the following passage, the action, with all its materi-\nNarration al circumstances, is represented so much to the life, that it would scarce appear more distinct to a real spectator; and it is the manner of description that contributes greatly to the sublimity of the passage\u2014\n\nHe spoke; and, to confirm his words, out flew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumining hell: highly they rag'd Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms, Clash'd on their founding shields the din of war, Hurling defiance toward the vault of heav'n.\n\nMilton, book i.\n\nThe following passage from Shakespeare falls not much short of that now mentioned in particularity of description:\n\n'O you hard hearts! you cruel men of Rome!\nKnew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements, To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops, Your infants in your arms; and there have sat The live-long day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome; And when you saw his chariot but appear, Have you not made an universal shout, That Tyber trembled underneath his banks, To hear the replication of your sounds, Made in his concave shore?\n\nJulius C\u00e6sar, act i. sc. i.\n\nThe following passage is scarcely inferior to either of those mentioned:\n\n\"Far before the rest, the son of Offian comes: bright in the smiles of youth, fair as the first beams of the sun. His long hair waves on his back: his dark brow is half beneath his helmet. The sword hangs loose on the hero's side; and his spear glitters as he moves. I fled from his terrible eye, king of high Temora.\"\n\nFingal.\n\nThe Henriade of Voltaire errs greatly against the foregoing rule: every incident is touched in a summary way, without ever descending to circumstances. This manner is good in a general history, the purpose of which is to record important transactions: but in a fable it is cold and uninteresting; because it is impracticable to form distinct images of persons or things represented in a manner so superficial.\n\nIt is observed above, that every useless circumstance ought to be suppressed. The crowding such circumstances is, on the one hand, not less to be avoided, than the conceitens for which Voltaire is blamed, on the other. In the \u00c6neid, Barce, the nurse of Sich\u00e6us, whom we never hear of before nor after, is introduced for a purpose not more important than to call Anna to her sister Dido: and that it might not be thought unjust in Dido, even in this trivial circumstance, to prefer her husband's nurse before her own, the poet takes care to inform his reader, that Dido's nurse was dead. To this may be opposed a beautiful passage in the same book, where, after Dido's last speech, the poet, without detaining his readers by describing the manner of her death, hastens to the lamentation of her attendants:\n\nDixerat: atque illam media inter talia ferro Collapsam alpiciunt comites, enfemque cruroe Spurnantem, sparviasque manus. It clamor ad alta Atria; concussam baccatur sana per urbem; Lamentis gemituque, et femineo ululatu Tecta fremunt, relonat magnis plangoribus aether.\n\nLib. iv. 663.\n\nAs an appendix to the foregoing rule, may be added the following observation, That to make a sudden and strong impression, some single circumstance, happily selected, has more power than the most laboured description. Macbeth, mentioning to his lady some voices he heard while he was murdering the King, says,\n\nThere's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cry'd Murder!\n\nThey wak'd each other; and I stood and heard them:\nBut they did say their prayers, and address them\nAgain to sleep.\n\nLady. There are two lodg'd together.\n\nMacbeth. One cry'd, God blest us! and, Amen!\nthe other;\nAs they had seen me with these hangman's hands,\nListening their fear. I could not say, Amen,\nWhen they did say, God blest us.\n\nLady. Consider it not so deeply.\n\nMacbeth. But wherefore could not I pronounce\nAmen!\n\nI had most need of blessing, and Amen\nStuck in my throat.\n\nLady. These deeds must not be thought\nAfter these ways; so, it will make us mad.\n\nMacbeth. Methought, I heard a voice cry,\nSleep no more!\n\nMacbeth doth murder sleep, &c.\n\nAct ii. sc. 2.\n\nDescribing Prince Henry:\n\nI saw young Harry, with his beaver on,\nHis cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd,\nRise from the ground like feather'd Mercury;\nAnd vaulted with such ease into his seat,\nAs if an angel dropt down from the clouds,\nTo turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,\nAnd witch the world with noble horsemanship.\n\nFirst part Henry IV. act iii. sc. 3.\n\nKing Henry. Lord Cardinal, if thou think'st on Heaven's bliss,\nHold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.\nHe dies, and makes no sign!\n\nSecond part Henry VI. act iii. sc. 3.\n\nThe same author, speaking ludicrously of an army debilitated with diseases, says,\n\n\"Half of them dare not shake the snow from off their caftocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.\"\n\n\"I have seen the walls of Bactriana, but they were defoliate. The flames had resounded in the halls: and the voice of the people is heard no more. The stream of Clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls. The thistle shook there its lonely head: the moths whirled to the wind. The fox looked out from the windows: and the rank grass of the wall waved round...\"\nround his head. Defolate is the dwelling of Morna: silence is in the houle of her fathers.\"\n\nTo draw a character is the master stroke of description. In this Tacitus excels: his portraits are natural and lively, not a feature wanting or misplaced. Shakespeare, however, exceeds Tacitus in liveliness; some characteristic circumstance being generally invented or laid hold of, which paints more to the life than many words. The following instances will explain our meaning, and at the same time prove our observation to be just.\n\n\"Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,\nSit like his grandfathers cut in alabaster?\nSleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice,\nBy being peevish? I tell thee what, Anthonio,\n(I love thee, and it is my love that speaks),\nThere are a fort of men, whose villages\nDo cream and mantle like a standing pond;\nAnd do a wilful stillness entertain,\nWith purpose to be dreary in an opinion\nOf wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;\nAs who should say, I am Sir Oracle,\nAnd when I ope my lips, let no dog bark!\nO my Anthonio! I do know of those,\nThat therefore only are reputed wise,\nFor saying nothing.\"\n\nMerchant of Venice, act i. sc. 1.\n\nAgain:\n\n\"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more\nthan any man in all Venice: his reasons are two grains\nof wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all\nday ere you find them; and when you have them, they\nare not worth the search.\"\n\nIbid.\n\nIn the following passage a character is completed by a single stroke:\n\nShallow. O the mad days that I have spent; and to\nsee how many of mine old acquaintance are dead.\n\nSilence. We shall all follow, cousin.\n\nShallow. Certain, 'tis certain, very sure, very sure;\nDeath (as the Psalmist saith) is certain to all: all shall\ndie. How good a yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?\n\nSlender. Truly cousin, I was not there.\n\nShallow. Death is certain. Is old Double of your\ntown living yet?\n\nSilence. Dead, Sir.\n\nShallow. Dead! fee, fee: he drew a good bow: and\ndead. He shot a fine shot. How a score of ewes now?\n\nSilence. Thereafter as they be. A score of good\newes may be worth ten pounds.\n\nShallow. And is old Double dead?\n\nSecond part Henry IV. act iii. sc. 2.\n\nDescribing a jealous husband:\n\n\"Neither press, coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but\nhe hath an abstract for the remembrance of such places,\nand goes to them by his note. There is no hiding you\nin the house.\"\n\nMerry Wives of Windsor, act iv. sc. 3.\n\nCongreve has an inimitable stroke of this kind in his\ncomedy of Love for Love:\n\nBen Legend. Well, father, and how do all at home?\nhow does brother Dick, and brother Val.\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\nNARRATION\n\nInterea magno misceri murmure pontum,\nEmifamque hyemem fenit Neptunus, et imis\nStagna refusa vadis; graviter commotus, et alto\nProspiciens, summa placidum caput extulit unda.\n\n*Eneid*, i. 128.\n\nAgain:\n\nWhen first young Maro, in his boundless mind,\nA work t'outlast immortal Rome deg'n'd.\n*Essay on Criticism*, 30.\n\nThe following examples are of absurdities.\n\n\"Alii pulvis \u00e8 torrente catenis disceptri sectique,\ndimidiato corpore pugnabant sibi superflites, ac peremptae partes ulteriores.\"\n*Strada, Dec.* ii. 2.\n\nIl pover huomo, che non fen' era accorto,\nAndava combattendo, ed era morto.\n*Berni.*\n\nHe fled, but flying, left his life behind.\n*Iliad*, xi. 443.\n\nFull through his neck the weighty falchion sped:\nAlong the pavement roll'd the muttering head.\n*Odyssey*, xxii. 365.\n\nThe last article is of raving like one mad. Cleopatra speaking to the asp,\n\nWelcome, thou kind deceiver;\nThou best of thieves; who, with an easy key,\nDost open life, and unperceived by us\nEv'n steal us from ourselves; discharging so\nDeath's dreadful office, better than himself;\nTouching our limbs so gently into slumber,\nThat Death stands by, deceiv'd by his own image,\nAnd thinks himself but sleep.\n\n*Dryden, All for Love*, act v.\n\nHaving discussed what observations occurred upon the thoughts or things expressed, we proceed to what more peculiarly concerns the language or verbal drefs. As words are intimately connected with the ideas they represent, the emotions raised by the sound and by the sense ought to be concordant. An elevated subject requires an elevated style; what is familiar, ought to be familiarly expressed; a subject that is serious and important, ought to be clothed in plain nervous language; a description, on the other hand, addressed to the imagination, is susceptible of the highest ornaments thatounding words, and figurative expression can bestow upon it.\n\nWe shall give a few examples of the foregoing rules. A poet of any genius is not apt to dress a high subject in low words; and yet blemishes of that kind are found even in classical works. Horace, observing that men are satisfied with themselves, but seldom with their condition, introduces Jupiter indulging to each his own choice:\n\nJam faciam quod vultis; eris tu, qui modo miles,\nMercator; tu, consultus modo, rufticus: hinc vos,\nVos hinc, mutatis difcedite partibus. eia,\nQuid? statis? nolint, atqui licet effe beatis.\nQuid caufa eff, merito quin illis Jupiter ambas\nTratus buccas inflet, neque fe fore poft hac\nTam facilem dicat, votis ut pribeat aurem?\n\n*Sat.*, i. 16.\n\nJupiter in wrath puffing up both cheeks, is a low and even ludicrous expression, far from suitable to the gravity and importance of the subject; every one must feel the discordance. The following couplet, sinking far below the subject, is no less ludicrous:\n\nNot one looks backward, onward still he goes,\nYet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose.\n*Essay on Man*, ep. iv. 223.\n\nOn the other hand, to raise the expression above the tone of the subject, is a fault than which none is more common. Take the following instances:\n\nOrcan le plus fid\u00e8le \u00e0 servir ses desseins,\nNe sous le ciel br\u00fblant des plus noirs Africains.\n*Bajazet*, act iii. sc. 8.\n\nLes ombres par trois fois ont obscurci les cieux\nDepuis que le sommeil n'eft entr\u00e9 dans vos yeux;\nEt le jour a trois fois chaff\u00e9 la nuit obscure\nDepuis que votre corps languit fans nourriture.\n*Phaedra*, act i. sc. 3.\n\nAffueris. Ce mortel, qui montra tant de z\u00e8le pour moi, Vit-il encore?\n*Aph.* \u2014\u2014 Il voit l'autre qui vous \u00e9claire.\n*Esther*, act ii. sc. 3.\n\nOui, c'eft Agamemnon, c'eft ton roi qui teveille;\nViens, reconnais la voix qui frappe ton oreille.\n*Iphigenie.*\n\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,\nBut the great cannon to the clouds hath tell;\nAnd the king's rowfe the heav'n shall bruit again,\nRepealing earthly thunder.\n*Hamlet*, act i. sc. 2.\n\nIn the inner room\nI spy a winking lamp, that weakly strikes\nThe ambient air, scarce kindling into light.\n*Southerne, Fate of Capua*, act iii.\n\nIn the Funeral Orations of the bishop of Meaux, the following passages are raised far above the tone of the subject;\n\n\"L'Ocean etonn\u00e9 de fe voir travers\u00e9 tant de fois, en des appareils fi divers, et pour des caufes fi diff\u00e9rentes, &c.\"\n\nPag. 6.\n\n\"Grande reine, je satisfais \u00e0 vos plus tendres desirs, quand je c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ce monarque; et fon c\u0153ur qui n'a jamais v\u00e9cu que pour lui, s'\u00e9veille, tout poudre qu'il est, et devient tendre, m\u00eame sous ce drap mortuaire, au nom d'un \u00e9poux fi cher\"\n\nPag. 32.\n\nThe following passage, intended, one would imagine, as a receipt to boil water, is altogether burlesque by the laboured elevation of the diction:\n\nA maffy cauldron of stupendous frame\nThey brought, and plac'd it o'er the rising flame:\nThen heap the lighted wood; the flame divides\nBeneath the vale, and climbs around the sides:\nIn its wide womb they pox the rushing stream:\nThe boiling water bubbles to the brim.\n\n*Iliad*, xviii. 405.\n\nIn a passage at the beginning of the 4th book of Telemachus, one feels a sudden bound upward without preparation, which accords not with the subject:\n\n\"Calypso,\"\nMy waking thought admits no balmy rest,\nNor the sweet bliss of soft oblivion share:\nBut watchful woe distracts my aching breast,\nMy heart the subject of corroding care:\nFrom haunts of men with wandering steps and flow\nI solitary steal, and soothe my pensive woe.\n\nHere every substantive is faithfully attended by some tumid epithet.\n\nWe proceed to a second remark, not less important than the former. No person of reflection but must be sensible, that an incident makes a stronger impression on an eye witness, than when heard at second hand. Writers of genius, sensible that the eye is the best avenue to the heart, represent every thing as passing in our sight; and, from readers or hearers, transform us as it were into spectators: a skilful writer conceals himself, and presents his personages: in a word, every thing becomes dramatic as much as possible. Plutarch, de gloria Atheniensium, observes, that Thucydides makes his reader a spectator, and inspires him with the same passions as if he were an eye witness.\n\nIn the fine arts, it is a rule to put the capital objects in the strongest point of view; and even to present them oftener than once, where it can be done. In history painting, the principal figure is placed in the front, and in the best light: an equestrian statue is placed in a centre of streets, that it may be seen from many places at once. In no composition is there greater opportunity for this rule than in writing:\n\n---\n\nSequitur pulcherrimus Astur,\nAstur equo fidens et verficoloribus armis.\n\nEneid, x. 180\n\n---\n\nFull many a lady\nI've ey'd with beld regard, and many a time\nTh' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\nBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtues\nHave I lik'd several women: never any\nWith so full soul, but some defect in her\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd,\nAnd put it to the foil. But you, O you,\nSo perfect, and so peerless, are created\nOf every creature's best.\n\nTempest, act iii. sc. i.\n\n---\n\nOrlando.\u2014Whate'er you are\nThat, in the desert inaccessible,\nUnder the shade of melancholy boughs,\nLoafe and neglect the creeping hours of time;\nIf ever you have look'd on better days;\nIf ever been where bells have knoll'd to church;\nIf ever sat at any good man's feast:\nIf ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,\nAnd known what 'tis to pity, and be pity'd;\nLet gentleness my strong enforcement be,\nIn the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.\n\nDuke sen. True is it that we have seen better days;\nAnd have with holy bell been knoll'd to church;\nAnd sat at good men's feasts; and wip'd our eyes\nOf drops that sacred pity had engender'd:\nAnd therefore sit you down in gentleness,\nAnd take upon command what help we have,\nThat to your wanting may be minist'red.\n\nAs you like it.\n\nWith thee conversing I forget all time;\nAll seasons and their change, all pleasure alike.\n\n---\n\nThe language of Homer is suited to his subject, not less accurately than the actions and sentiments of his heroes are to their characters. Virgil, in that particular, falls short of perfection: his language is stately throughout; and though he descends at times to the simplest branches of cookery, roasting and boiling for example, yet he never relaxes a moment from the high tone.\u2014In adjusting his language to his subject, no writer equals Swift. We can recollect but one exception, which at the same time is far from being gross: The Journal of a modern Lady is composed in a style blending sprightliness with familiarity, perfectly suited to the subject: in one passage, however, the poet, deviating from that style, takes a tone above his subject. The passage we have in view begins l. 116. But let me now a while survey, &c. and ends at l. 135.\n\nIt is proper to be observed upon this head, that writers of inferior rank are continually upon the stretch to enliven and enforce their subject by exaggeration and superlatives. This unluckily has an effect contrary to what is intended; the reader, disgusted with language that dwells above the subject, is led by contrast to think more meanly of the subject than it may possibly deserve. A man of prudence, beside, will be no less careful to husband his strength in writing than in walking; a writer, too liberal of superlatives, exhausts his whole stock upon ordinary incidents, and reserves no share to express, with greater energy, matters of importance.\n\nMany writers of that kind abound so in epithets, as if poetry consisted entirely in high sounding words. Take the following instance:\n\nWhen black brow'd night her dusky mantle spread,\nAnd wrapt in solemn gloom the fable sky;\nWhen soothing sleep her opiate dews had shed,\nAnd seal'd in silken slumber every eye;\n\n---\n\nCalypso, qui avoit \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce moment immobile et transport\u00e9e de plaisir en \u00e9coutant les aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, l'interrrompt pour lui faire prendre quelque repos. Il est temps, lui dit-elle, que vous alliez go\u00fbter la douceur du sommeil apr\u00e8s tant de travaux. Vous n'avez rien \u00e0 craindre ici; tout vous est favorable. Abandonnez vous dor\u00e9navant \u00e0 la joie. Goutez la paix, et tous les autres dons des dieux dont vous allez \u00eatre combl\u00e9. Demain, quand l'Aurore avec ses doigts de r\u00eaves entr'ouvrira les portes dor\u00e9es de l'Orient, et que les chevaux du soleil, sortant de l'onde am\u00e8re, r\u00e9pandront les flammes du jour, pour chasser devant eux toutes les \u00e9toiles du ciel, nous reprendrons, mon cher T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, l'histoire de vos malheurs.\"\n\nThis obviously is copied from a similar passage in the \u00c6neid, which ought not to have been copied, because he lies open to the same censure; but the force of authority is great:\n\nAt regina gravi jamdudum saucia cura,\nVulnus alti venis, et caeco carpitur igni.\nMulta viri virtus animo, multique recurvat\nGentis honos: haerent infixo pectore vultus,\nVerbaque: nec placidam membri dat cura quietem.\nPostera Ph\u0153bea lustrabat lampade terras,\nHumentemque Aurora polo dimovet umbram;\nCum fic unanimem alloquuitur malesca fororem.\n\nLib. iv. 1.\n\n---\n\nThe language of Homer is suited to his subject, not less accurately than the actions and sentiments of his heroes are to their characters.

This unluckily has an effect contrary to what is intended; the reader, disgusted with language that dwells above the subject, is led by contrast to think more meanly of the subject than it may possibly deserve. A man of prudence, beside, will be no less careful to husband his strength in writing than in walking; a writer, too liberal of superlatives, exhausts his whole stock upon ordinary incidents, and reserves no share to express, with greater energy, matters of importance.\n\nMany writers of that kind abound so in epithets, as if poetry consisted entirely in high sounding words. Take the following instance:\n\nWhen black brow'd night her dusky mantle spread,\nAnd wrapt in solemn gloom the fable sky;\nWhen soothing sleep her opiate dews had shed,\nAnd seal'd in silken slumber every eye;\nSweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,\nWith charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun\nWhen first on this delightful land he spreads\nHis orient beams on herbs, tree, fruit, and flow'r\nGlist'ring with dew; fragrant the fertile earth\nAfter soft show'rs; and sweet the coming on\nOf grateful ev'n'ing mild, the silent night\nWith this her solemn bird, and this fair moon,\nAnd these the gems of heav'n, her starry train:\nBut neither breath of morn, when she ascends\nWith charm of earliest birds, nor rising sun\nOn this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, flow'r,\nGlist'ring with dew, nor fragrance after show'rs,\nNor grateful ev'n'ing mild, nor silent night,\nWith this her solemn bird, nor walk by moon,\nOr glittering star light, without thee is sweet.\n\nParadise Lost, book iv. l. 634.\n\n\"What mean ye, that ye use this proverb, The fathers have eaten four grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion to use this proverb in Israel. If a man keep my judgements to deal truly, he is just; he shall surely live. But if he be a robber, a shedder of blood: if he have eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife: if he have oppressed the poor and needy, have spoiled by violence, have not restored the pledge, have lifted up his eyes to idols, have given forth upon usury, and have taken increase: shall he live? he shall not live: he shall surely die; and his blood shall be upon him. Now, lo, if he beget a son, that feeth all his father's fins, and considereth, and doth not such like; that hath not eaten upon the mountains, hath not lifted up his eyes to idols, nor defiled his neighbour's wife, hath not oppressed any, nor withheld the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment: that hath not received usury nor increase, that hath executed my judgements, and walked in my statutes: he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live. The soul that finneth, it shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. Have I any pleasure that the wicked should die, saith the Lord God; and not that he should return from his ways, and live?\"\n\nEzekiel xvii.\n\nA concise comprehensive style is a great ornament in narration; and a superfluity of unnecessary words, not less than of circumstances, a great nuisance. A judicious selection of the striking circumstances, clothed in a nervous style, is delightful. In this style, Tacitus excels all writers, ancient and modern. Instances are numberless: take the following specimen:\n\n\"Crebra hinc pra\u00eblia, et f\u00e6pius in modum iatrocinii: per saltus, per paludes; ut cuique fors aut virtus: temere, proviso, ob iram, ob pr\u00e6dam, jussu, et aliquando ignaris ducibus.\"\n\nAnnal. lib. xii. \u00a7 39.\n\nAfter Tacitus, Ossian in that respect justly merits the place of distinction. One cannot go wrong for examples in any part of the book.\n\nIf a concise or nervous style be a beauty, tautology must be a blemish; and yet writers, fettered by verse, are not sufficiently careful to avoid this slovenly practice: they may be pitied, but they cannot be justified.\n\nTake for a specimen the following instances, from the best poet, for verification at least, that England has to boast of:\n\nHigh on his helm celestial lightnings play,\nHis heavy shield emits a living ray;\nTh' unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,\nLike the red star that fires the autumnal skies.\n\nIliad. 5.\n\nStrength and omnipotence invest thy throne.\n\nIbid. 576.\n\nSo silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,\nIn fable streams soft trickling waters shed.\n\nIbid. ix. 19.\n\nHis clanging armour rung.\n\nIbid. xii. 94.\n\nFear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.\n\nIbid. xv. 4.\n\nThe blaze of armour flash'd against the day.\n\nIbid. xvii. 736.\n\nAs when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow.\n\nIbid. xix. 380.\n\nAnd like the moon, the broad resplendent shield\nBlaz'd with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.\n\nIbid. xix. 402.\n\n\"No\u2014could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,\nOr beat the pinions of the western gale,\nAll were in vain\u2014\n\nThe humid sweat from every pore defends.\n\nIbid. xxiii. 829.\n\nWe close this article with a curious inquiry. An object, however ugly to the sight, is far from being so when represented by colours or by words. What is the cause of this difference? With respect to painting, the cause is obvious: a good picture, whatever the subject be, is agreeable by the pleasure we take in imitation; and this pleasure overbalancing the disagreeableness of the subject, makes the picture upon the whole agreeable. With respect to the description of an ugly object, the cause follows. To connect individuals in the social state, no particular contributes more than language, by the power it possesses of an expeditious communication of thought, and a lively representation of transactions. But nature hath not been satisfied to recommend language by its utility merely: independent of utility, it is made susceptible of many beauties, which are directly felt, without any intervening reflection. And this unfolds the mystery; for the pleasure of language is so great, as in a lively description to overbalance the disagreeableness of the image raised by it. This, however, is no encouragement to choose a disagreeable subject; for the pleasure is incomparably greater where the subject and the description are both of them agreeable.\n\nThe following description is upon the whole agreeable, though the subject described is in itself dismal:\n\nNine times the space that measures day and night\nTo mortal men, he with his horrid crew.\n\nLay\nLay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,\nConfounded though immortal! but his doom\nReserved him to more wrath; for now the thought\nBoth of loft happiness and lasting pain\nTorments him: round he throws his baleful eyes\nThat witness'd huge affliction and dismay,\nMix'd with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.\nAt once as far as angels ken he views\nThe dismal situation waste and wild:\nA dungeon horrible, on all sides round\nAs one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames\nNo light, but rather darknefs visible\nServ'd only to discover sights of woe,\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes\nThat comes to all; but torture without end\nStill urges, and a fiery deluge, fed\nWith ever-burning sulphur unconsum'd!\nSuch place eternal justice had prepar'd\nFor those rebellious. *Paradise Lost*, book i. 50.\n\nAn unmanly depression of spirits in time of danger is not an agreeable sight; and yet a fine description or representation of it will be relished:\n\n*K. Richard*. What must the king do now? must he submit?\n\nThe king shall do it: must he be depos'd?\nThe king shall be contented: must he lose\nThe name of king? o' God's name let it go:\nI'll give my jewels for a set of beads;\nMy gorgeous palace, for a hermitage;\nMy gay apparel, for an almsman's gown;\nMy figur'd goblets, for a dish of wood;\nMy sceptre, for a palmer's walking-staff;\nMy subjects, for a pair of carved saints;\nAnd my large kingdom, for a little grave;\nA little, little, grave,\u2014an obscure grave.\nOr I'll be bury'd in the king's highway;\nSome way of common tread, where subjects feet\nMay hourly trample on their sovereign's head;\nFor on my heart they tread now, whilst I live;\nAnd, bury'd once, why not upon my head?\n\n*Richard II.*, act iii. sc. 6.\n\nObjects that strike terror in a spectator, have in poetry and painting a fine effect. The picture, by raising a slight emotion of terror, agitates the mind; and in that condition every beauty makes a deep impression. May not contrast heighten the pleasure, by opposing our present security to the danger of encountering the object represented?\n\nThe other shape,\nIf shape it might be call'd that shape had none\nDistinguishable in member, joint, or limb;\nOr substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,\nFor each seem'd either; black it flood as night,\nFierce as ten furies, terrible as hell,\nAnd shook a dreadful dart. *Par. Lost*, book ii. 666.\n\nNow storming fury rose,\nAnd clamour such as heard in heaven till now\nWas never: arms on armour clashing bray'd\nHorrible discord, and the madding wheels\nOf brazen chariots rage; dire was the noise\nOf conflict; overhead the dismal hiss\n\nOf fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,\nAnd flying vaulted either holt with fire.\nSo under fiery cope together rush'd\nBoth battles main, with ruinous assault\nAnd unextinguishable rage: all heaven\nRefounded, and had earth been then, all earth\nHad to her centre hooke. *Ibid*, book vi. 207.\n\n*Ghoft.*\u2014But that I am forbid\nTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,\nI could a tale unfold, whose lightest word\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\nMake thy two eyes, like stars start from their spheres,\nThy knotty and combined locks to part,\nAnd each particular hair to stand on end,\nLike quills upon the fretful porcupine:\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\nTo ears of flesh and blood. *Hamlet*, act i. sc. 8.\n\n*Gratiano*. Poor Desdemona! I'm glad thy father's dead:\nThy match was mortal to him; and pure grief\nShore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,\nThis fight would make him do a desperate turn:\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\nAnd fall to reprobation. *Othello*, act v. sc. 8.\n\nObjects of horror must be excepted from the foregoing theory; for no description, however lively, is sufficient to overbalance the disgust raised even by the idea of such objects. Every thing horrible ought therefore to be avoided in a description.\n\n*Narses*, the eunuch who rivalled Belisarius in holiness under the reign of the emperor Justinian, emerged from obscurity A.D. 538. From the domestic service of the palace, and the administration of the private revenue, he was suddenly exalted to the head of an army. He is ranked among the few eunuchs who have refused that unhappy name from the contempt and hatred of mankind. A feeble diminutive body concealed the soul of a statesman and a warrior. His youth had been employed in the management of the loom and distaff, in the cares of the household, and the service of female luxury; but, while his hands were busy, he secretly exercised the faculties of a vigorous and discerning mind. A stranger to the schools and the camp, he studied in the palace to dissemble, to flatter, and to persuade; and as soon as he approached the person of the emperor, Justinian listened with surprise and pleasure to the manly counsels of his chamberlain and private treasurer. The talents of Narses were tried and improved in frequent embassies; he led an army into Italy, acquired a practical knowledge of the war and the country, and presumed to strive with the genius of Belisarius. Twelve years after his return, the eunuch was chosen to achieve the conquest which had been left imperfect by the first of the Roman generals. Instead of being dazzled by vanity or emulation, he seriously declared, that unless he were armed with an adequate force, he would never consent to risk his own glory and that of his sovereign. Justinian granted to the favourite what he might have denied to the hero: the Gothic war was rekindled from its ashes, and the preparations were not unworthy of the ancient majesty of the empire.\n\nNarses defeated the Goths, the Franks, and the Alamanni;\nAlamanni; the Italian cities opened their gates to the conqueror; he entered the capital in triumph; and having established the seat of his government at Ravenna, continued 15 years to govern Italy under the title of Exarch.\n\nHis virtues, we are told, were stained with avarice; and in this provincial reign he accumulated a treasure of gold and silver which surpassed the modesty of a private fortune. His government was oppressive or unpopular; and the general discontent was expressed with freedom by the deputies of Rome. Before the throne of Justinian they boldly declared, that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable than the despotism of a Greek eunuch; and that unless their tyrant were instantly removed, they would consult their own happiness in the choice of a master. Thus was his disgrace the effect of the people's dissatisfaction; and his death, though in the extreme period of old age, was unseasonable and premature, since his genius alone could have repaired the last and fatal error of his life. He died about the year 567, and, as some say, at the advanced age of 95; but this does not appear very probable. See Gibbon's Rom.

In order to this, it may not be improper to refer back to the times that have gone before us, that we may better discover the nature of public revenues, the manner of their expenditure, and the causes of public debt.\n\nIn that rude state of society which precedes the extension of commerce and the improvements of manufactures, when those expensive luxuries which commerce and manufactures can alone introduce, are altogether unknown; the person who possesses a large revenue can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other way than by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain. Among our feudal ancestors, the long time during which estates used to continue in the same family, sufficiently demonstrates the general disposition of nations' people to live within their income. Though the rustic hospitality constantly exercised by the great landholders may not to us in the present times seem consistent with that order which we are apt to consider as inseparably connected with good economy, yet we must certainly allow them to have been at least so far frugal as not commonly to have spent their whole income. Some part of this money, perhaps, they spent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury with which the circumstances of the times could furnish them; but some part of it they seem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well indeed do any thing else but hoard whatever money they saved. To trade was disgraceful to a gentleman; and to lend money at interest, which at that time was considered as usury and prohibited by law, would have been still more so.\nThe same disposition to save and to hoard prevailed in the sovereign as well as in the subjects. Among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known, the sovereign is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the parsimony requisite for accumulation. In that situation the expense even of a sovereign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court. The ignorance of the times affords but few of the trinkets in which that finery consists. Standing armies are not then necessary; so that the expense even of a sovereign, like that of any other great lord, can be employed in scarce anything but bounty to his tenants and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and hospitality very seldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost always does. All the ancient sovereigns of Europe accordingly had treasuries. Every Tartar chief in the present times is said to have one.\n\nIn a commercial country abounding with every sort of expensive luxury, the sovereign, in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in his dominions, naturally spends a great part of his revenue in purchasing those luxuries. His own and the neighbouring countries supply him abundantly with all the costly trinkets which compose the splendid but insignificant pageantry of a court. His ordinary expense becomes equal to his ordinary revenue, and it is well if it does not frequently exceed it. The amassing of treasure can no longer be expected; and when extraordinary exigencies require extraordinary expenses, he must necessarily call upon his subjects for an extraordinary aid. The late king of Prussia and his father are the only great princes of Europe who, since the death of Henry IV. of France in 1610, are supposed to have amassed any considerable treasure. The parsimony which leads to accumulation has become almost as rare in republican as in monarchical governments. The Italian republics, the United Provinces of the Netherlands, are all in debt. The canton of Berne is the single republic in Europe which has amassed any considerable treasure. The other Swiss republics have not. The taste for some sort of pageantry, for splendid buildings at least and other public ornaments, frequently prevails as much in the apparently sober senate house of a little republic as in the dilapidated court of the greatest king.\n\nThe want of parsimony in time of peace imposes the necessity of contracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in the treasury but what is necessary for carrying on the ordinary expense of the peace establishment. In war an establishment of three or four times that expense becomes necessary for the defence of the state, and consequently a revenue three or four times greater than the peace revenue. Supposing that the sovereign should have what he scarce ever has, the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the augmentation of his expense; yet still the produce of the taxes, from which this increase of revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come into the treasury till perhaps ten or twelve months after they are imposed. But the moment in which war begins, or rather the moment in which it appears likely to begin, the army must be augmented, the fleets must be fitted out, the garrisoned towns must be put into a posture of defence; that army, that fleet, those garrisoned towns, must be furnished with arms, ammunition, and provisions. An immediate and great expense must be incurred in that moment of immediate danger, which will not wait for the gradual and slow returns of the new taxes. In this exigency government can have no other resources but in borrowing.\n\nThe same commercial state of society which, by the operation of moral causes brings government in this manner into the necessity of borrowing, produces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination to lend. If it commonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing, it likewise brings along with it the facility of doing so.\n\nA country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, necessarily abounds with a set of people through whose hands not only their own capitals, but the capitals of all those who either lend them money or trust them with goods, pass as frequently or more frequently than the revenue of a private man, who without trade or business lives upon his income, passes through his hands. The revenue of such a man can regularly pass through his hands only once in a year. But the whole amount of the capital and credit of a merchant who deals in a trade of which the returns are very quick may sometimes pass through his hands two, three, or four times in a year. A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, therefore, necessarily abounds with a set of people who have it at all times in their power to advance, if they choose to do so, a very large sum of money to government. Hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to lend.\n\nThe progress of the enormous debts which at present oppresses, and will in the long-run probably ruin, Comment all the great nations of Europe, has been pretty uniform. In England, after the Revolution, when new connexions with Europe introduced a new system of foreign politics, the expenses of the nation, not only in settling the new establishment, but in maintaining long wars, as principals, on the continent, for the security of the Dutch barrier, reducing the French monarchy, settling the Spanish succession, supporting the house of Austria, maintaining the liberties of the Germanic body, and other purposes, increased to an unusual degree; insomuch that it was not thought advisable to raise all the expenses of any one year by taxes to be levied within that year, lest the unaccustomed weight of them should create murmurs among the people. It was therefore the policy of the times to anticipate the revenues of their posterity, by borrowing immense sums for the current service of the state, and to lay no more taxes upon the subject than would suffice to pay the annual interest of the sums so borrowed; by this means converting the principal debt into a new species of property, transferable from one man to another at any time and in any quantity. This system indeed seems to have had its original in the state of Florence, A.D. 1344; which government then owed about 60,000l. sterling; and being unable to pay it, formed the principal into an aggregate sum, called metaphorically a mount or bank, the shares whereof were transferable like our stocks, with interest at per cent, the prices varying according to the exigencies of the state.\nThis laid the foundation of what is called the national debt; for a few long annuities created in the reign of Charles II. will hardly deserve that name.\n\nNations, like private men, have generally begun to borrow upon what may be called personal credit, without affixing or mortgaging any particular fund for the payment of the debt; and when this resource has failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mortgages of particular funds.\n\nWhat is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain, is contracted in the former of those two ways. It consists partly in a debt which bears, or is supposed to bear, no interest, and which resembles the debts that a private man contracts upon account; and partly in a debt which bears interest, and which resembles what a private man contracts upon his bill or promissory note. The debts which are due either for extraordinary services, or for services either not provided for or not paid at the time when they are performed; part of the extraordinary expenses of the army, navy, and ordnance, the arrears of subsidies to foreign princes, those of seamen's wages, &c., usually constitute a debt of the first kind. Navy and exchequer bills, which are issued sometimes in payment of a part of such debts, and sometimes for other purposes, constitute a debt of the second kind; exchequer bills bearing interest from the day on which they are issued, and navy bills six months after they are issued. The Bank of England, either by voluntarily discounting those bills at their current value, or by agreeing with government for certain considerations to circulate exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at par, paying the interest which happens to be due upon them, keeps up their value, and facilitates their circulation, and thereby frequently enables government to contract a very large debt of this kind. During the great reconnoitre in King William's time, when the bank of England thought proper to put a stop to its usual transactions, exchequer bills and tallies are said to have sold from 25 to 60 per cent. discount; owing partly, no doubt, to the supposed instability of the new government established by the Revolution, but partly too to the want of the support of the bank of England.\n\nWhen this resource is exhausted, and it becomes necessary, in order to raise money, to assign or mortgage some particular branch of the public revenue for the payment of the debt, government has upon different occasions done this in two different ways. Sometimes it has made this assignment or mortgage for a short period of time only, a year or a few years, for example; and sometimes for perpetuity. In the one case, the fund was supposed sufficient to pay within the limited time both principal and interest of the money borrowed; in the other, it was supposed sufficient to pay the interest only, or a perpetual annuity equivalent to the interest; government being at liberty to redeem at any time this annuity upon paying back the principal sum borrowed. When money was raised in the one way, it was said to be raised by anticipation; when in the other, by perpetual funding, or, more shortly, by funding.\n\nIn the reign of King William, when the debt began to be amassed, and during a great part of that of Queen Anne, before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice of perpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but for a short period of time (for four, five, six, or seven years only), and a great part of the grants of every year consisted in loans upon anticipation of the produce of those taxes. The produce being frequently insufficient for paying within the limited term the principal and interest of the money borrowed, deficiencies arose to make good which it became necessary to prolong the term.\n\nOn the 31st of December 1697, the funded and unfunded debts amounted to \u00a321,515,742l. 13s. 8\u00bdd.; at the same time, in 1714, they were \u00a333,681,076l. 5s. 6\u00bdd. In 1755, before the breaking out of the war, they amounted to \u00a329,289,673l.; and on the 5th of January 1763, at the conclusion of the peace, they had accumulated to \u00a3122,603,336l. 8s. 2\u00bdd. of funded debt, and of unfunded \u00a33,027,589l. 2s. 2\u00bdd. more. In 1775, they were very nearly 130 millions; and the last American war added upwards of 120 millions more to that enormous sum: to pay the interest of which, and the charges of management, amounting annually to nearly eight millions and a half, the extraordinary revenues elsewhere enumerated * (excepting only the land-tax and annual malt-tax) are in the first place mortgaged and made perpetual by parliament. Perpetual we say; but still redeemable by the same authority that imposed them: which, if at any time can pay off the capital, will abolish those taxes which are raised to discharge the interest.\n\nBy this means, then, the quantity of property in the kingdom is greatly increased in idea compared with former times; yet, if we coolly consider it, not at all increased in reality. We may boast of large fortunes, and quantities of money in the funds. But where does this money exist? It exists only in name, in paper, in public faith, in parliamentary security: and that is undoubtedly sufficient for the creditors of the public to rely on. But then what is the pledge which the public faith has pawned for the security of these debts? The land, the trade, and the personal industry of the subject; from which the money must arise that supplies the several taxes. In these, therefore, and these only, the property of the public creditors does really and intrinsically exist; and of course the land, the trade, and the personal industry of individuals, are diminished in their true value just so much as they are pledged to answer. If A's income amounts to 100l. per annum; and he is so far indebted to B, that he pays him 50l. per annum for his interest; one half of the value of A's property is transferred to B the creditor. The creditor's property exists in the demand which he has upon the debtor, and nowhere else; and the debtor is only a trustee to his creditor for one half of the value of his income. In short, the property of a creditor of the public consists in a certain portion of the national taxes; by how much therefore he is the richer, by so much the nation, which pays these taxes, is the poorer.\n\nThe only advantage that can result to a nation from public debts, is the increase of circulation, by multiplying the cash of the kingdom, and creating a new species of currency, assignable at any time and in any quantity; always therefore ready to be employed in any beneficial undertaking, by means of this its transferable quality; and yet producing some profit even when\nNational when it lies idle and unemployed. A certain proportion of debt seems to be highly useful to a trading people; but what that proportion is, it is not for us to determine. This much is indubitably certain, that the present magnitude of our national encumbrances very far exceeds all calculations of commercial benefit, and is productive of the greatest inconveniences.\n\nFor, first, The enormous taxes that are raised upon the necessaries of life for the payment of the interest of this debt, are a hurt both to trade and manufactures, by raising the price as well of the artificer's subsistence as of the raw material, and of course, in a much greater proportion, the price of the commodity itself. Nay, the very increase of paper circulation itself, when extended beyond what is requisite for commerce or foreign exchange, has a natural tendency to increase the price of provisions as well as of all other merchandise. For as its effect is to multiply the cash of the kingdom, and this to such an extent that much must remain unemployed, that cash (which is the universal measure of the respective values of all other commodities) must necessarily sink in its own value, and everything grow comparatively dearer. Secondly, If part of this debt be owing to foreigners, either they draw out of the kingdom annually a considerable quantity of specie for the interest; or else it is made an argument to grant them unreasonable privileges in order to reduce them to reside here. Thirdly, If the whole be owing to subjects only, it is then charging the active and industrious subject, who pays his share of the taxes to maintain the indolent and idle creditor who receives them. Lastly, and principally, It weakens the internal strength of a state, by anticipating those resources which should be reserved to defend it in case of necessity. The interest we now pay for our debts would undoubtedly be sufficient to maintain the most vigorous war that any national motives could possibly require. If indeed our ancestors in King William's time had annually paid, so long as their exigencies lasted, a far less sum than we now annually raise upon their accounts, they would not in time of war have borne so great burdens as they have bequeathed to and settled upon their posterity in time of peace; and might have been eased the instant the exigence was over.\n\nOn the whole, then, the national debt is undoubtedly a subject of vast importance, and as such it has been always considered; for much has been said and written upon it, and many schemes have been proposed at various times and by various persons for gradually removing it, it being considered by the most judicious as a most pernicious encumbrance to a commercial country. Some, we are aware, think it of vast utility; but this opinion is too eccentric, and in our estimation too feebly supported, to be convincing. The public debt is indubitably a great grievance; and every lover of his country must surely wish to see it removed: the period, however, when this blessing shall take place, if indeed it ever arrive, must at least be very distant.\n\nWe refer such as will, for farther information on this interesting topic to those who have treated of it at full length, as Smith in his Wealth of Nations, and Sir John Sinclair in his History of the Revenue. The writings of Dr Price likewise deserve considerable attention, especially as one of his plans for the reduction of the debt has in fact been adopted, and in consequence established, by the legislature: His three plans may be found in a pamphlet by William Morgan, entitled, A Review of Dr Price's Writings on the Subject of the Finances of this Kingdom.\n\nNativity, or Natal day, the day of a person's birth. The word nativity is chiefly used in speaking of the saints; as, the nativity of St John the Baptist, &c. But when we say the Nativity, it is understood of that of Jesus Christ, or the feast of Christmas.\n\nNativity, nativitas, in ancient law books, signifies bondage or servitude.\n\nNativity, in Astrology, the theme or figure of the heavens, and particularly of the twelve houses, at the moment when a person was born; called also the horoscope.\n\nCasting the nativity, or by calculation seeking to know how long the queen should live, &c. was made felony, an. 23 Eliz. c. 2.\n\nNativo habendo, in Law, a writ directed to the sheriff, for a lord who claimed inheritance in any villain, when a villain was run away from him, for the apprehending and restoring him to the lord.\n\nNativix, in Natural History, a name given by some old writers to the nerita.\n\nNatalia, the modern name of the Lesser Asia, being the most westerly part of Turkey in Asia, and consisting of a large peninsula, which extends from the river Euphrates as far as the Archipelago, the sea of Marmora, the straits of Gallipoli and of Constantinople, which separate it from Europe on the west. It is bounded on the north by the Black Sea, and on the south by the Mediterranean.\n\nNatrix, in Zoology, the name of the common or water-snake, called also torquata, from the ring about its neck. See Ophiology Index.\n\nNatrum, or Natron, the nitre of the ancients, one of the fixed alkalis. See Soda, Chemistry Index.\n\nIt is found in great abundance in many parts of Asia, where the natives sweep it up from the surface of the ground, and call it soap earth. The earliest account we have of it is in the Scriptures, where we find that the salt called nitre in those times would ferment with vinegar, and possessed a detergent quality, so that it was used in baths and in washing. Solomon compares the flinging of fongs with a heavy heart, to the contrariety of vinegar and nitre; and Jeremiah says, that if the finer wash himself with nitre, his sin is not cleansed off. These are properties that perfectly agree with this salt, but not at all with our saltpetre, which is the nitre of the moderns.\n\nNatter-Jack, a species of Rana, which see, Herpetology Index.\n\nNatural, in general, something that relates to nature. See Nature.\n\nNatural Children, are those born out of lawful wedlock. See Bastard.\n\nNatural Functions, are those actions whereby the aliment are changed and assimilated so as to become a part of the body.\n\nNatural, in Heraldry, is used where animals, fruits, flowers, &c. are blazoned with the colours they naturally have, though different from the common colours.\nof heraldry; and this is to prevent their armories being accused of falsity, when blazoned with the names of colours unknown in heraldry.\n\n**Natural Note**, in Music, is used in opposition to flat and sharp notes, which are called artificial notes. See Note, Scale, &c.\n\n**Natural** is also used; or something coming immediately out of the hands of nature; in which sense it stands opposed to factitious or artificial, which signifies something wrought by art. See Artificial.\n\nBishop Wilkins observes, that there appears a world of difference between natural and artificial things, when viewed with microscopes. The first ever appear adorned with all imaginable elegance and beauty; the latter, though the most curious in their kind, infinitely rude and unshewn: the finest needle appears a rough bar of iron; and the most accurate engraving or embossment, as if done with a mattock or a trowel.\n\n**Natural Beauty**, or the beauty of natural objects, is that quality or those qualities in the works of nature, or more properly of God, which are calculated to excite pleasing sensations in the minds of all such persons of true taste as attentively observe them. It will not, we trust, be deemed improper or impertinent, therefore, to introduce a few observations on this subject, previous to our treating of natural history.\u2014To many, it is hoped, it will appear to be a very proper introduction to that important article. \"That sensibility to beauty, which, when cultivated and improved, we term taste, is universally diffused through the human species; and it is most uniform with respect to those objects, which being out of our power, are not liable to variation from accident, caprice, or fashion. The verdant lawn, the shady grove, the variegated landscape, the boundless ocean, and the starry firmament, are contemplated with pleasure by every attentive beholder. But the emotions of different spectators, though similar in kind, differ widely in degree; and to relish with full delight the enchanting scenes of nature, the mind must be uncorrupted by avarice, sensuality, or ambition; quick in her sensibilities; elevated in her sentiments; and devout in her affections. He who possesses such exalted powers of perception and enjoyment, may almost say, with the poet,\n\nI care not, Fortune! what you me deny;\nYou cannot rob me of free Nature's grace;\nYou cannot shut the windows of the sky,\nThrough which Aurora shows her bright'ning face;\nYou cannot bar my confident feet to trace\nThe woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve:\nLet health my nerves and finer fibres brace,\nAnd I their toys to the great children leave:\nOf fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave.\n\n\"Perhaps such ardent enthusiasm may not be compatible with the necessary toils and active offices which Providence has assigned to the generality of men. But there are none to whom some portion of it may not prove advantageous; and if it were cherished by each individual, in that degree which is consistent with the indispensable duties of his station, the felicity of human life would be considerably augmented. From this source, the refined and vivid pleasures of the imagination are almost entirely derived; and the elegant arts owe their choicest beauties to a taste for the contemplation of nature. Painting and sculpture are express imitations of visible objects; and where would be the charms of poetry, if divested of the imagery and embellishments which the borrow from rural scenes? Painters, statuaries, and poets, therefore, are always ambitious to acknowledge themselves the pupil of nature; and as their skill increases, they grow more and more delighted with every view of the animal and vegetable world. But the pleasure resulting from admiration is transient; and to cultivate taste, without regard to its influence on the passions and affections, 'is to rear a tree for its blossoms, which is capable of yielding the richest and most valuable fruit.' Physical and moral beauty bear so intimate a relation to each other, that they may be considered as different gradations in the scale of excellence; and the knowledge and relish of the former should be deemed only a step to the nobler and more permanent enjoyments of the latter.\n\n\"Whoever has visited the Leasowes, in Warwickshire, must have felt the force and propriety of an inscription which meets the eye at the entrance into those delightful grounds.\n\nWould you then taste the tranquil scene?\nBe sure your bosoms be serene:\nDevoid of hate, devoid of strife,\nDevoid of all that poisons life:\nAnd much it vails you, in their place,\nTo graft the love of human race.\n\n\"Now such scenes contribute powerfully to inspire that serenity which is necessary to enjoy and to heighten their beauties. By a secret contagion, the soul catches the harmony which she contemplates; and, the frame within assimilates itself to that which is without. For,\n\nWho can forbear to smile with Nature? Can\nThe florid passions in the bosom roll,\nWhile every gale is peace, and every grove\nIs melody?\n\n\"In this state of sweet composure, we become susceptible of virtuous impressions, from almost every surrounding object. The patient ox is viewed with generous complacency; the guileless sheep with pity; and the playful lamb raises emotions of tenderness and love. We rejoice with the horse, in his liberty and exemption from toil, while he ranges at large through enamelled pastures; and the frolics of the colt would afford unmixed delight, did we not recollect the bondage which he is soon to undergo. We are charmed with the song of birds, foamed with the buzz of insects, and pleased with the sportive motions of fishes, because these are expressions of enjoyment; and we exult in the felicity of the whole animated creation. Thus an equal and extensive benevolence is called forth into exertion; and having felt a common interest in the gratifications of inferior beings, we shall be no longer indifferent to their sufferings, or become wantonly instrumental in producing them.\n\n\"It seems to be the intention of Providence, that the lower order of animals should be subservient to the comfort, convenience, and sustenance of man. But his right of dominion extends no farther; and if this right be exercised with mildness, humanity, and justice, the subjects of his power will be no less benefi-\nFor various species of living creatures are annually multiplied by human art, improved in their perceptive powers by human culture, and plentifully fed by human industry. The relation, therefore, is reciprocal between such animals and man; and he may supply his own wants by the use of their labour, the produce of their bodies, and even the sacrifice of their lives, whilst he co-operates with all-gracious Heaven in promoting happiness, the great end of existence.\n\n\"But though it be true, that partial evil, with respect to different orders of sensitive beings, may be universal good; and that it is a wise and benevolent institution of nature, to make destruction itself, within certain limitations, the cause of an increase of life and enjoyment; yet a generous person will extend his compassionate regards to every individual that suffers for his sake: and whilst he sighs\n\nEven for the kid or lamb that parts its life\nBeneath the bloody knife,\n\nhe will naturally be solicitous to mitigate pain, both in duration and degree, by the gentlest modes of inflicting it.\n\n\"We are inclined to believe, however, that this sense of humanity would soon be obliterated, and that the heart would grow callous to every soft impression, were it not for the benignant influence of the smiling face of nature. The count de Lauzun, when imprisoned by Louis XIV. in the castle of Pignerol, amused himself during a long period of time with catching flies, and delivering them to be devoured by a rapacious spider. Such an entertainment was equally singular and cruel; and inconsequent, we believe, with his former character, and his subsequent turn of mind. But his cell had no window, and received only a glimmering light from an aperture in the roof. In less unfavourable circumstances, may we not presume, that instead of sporting with misery, he would have released the agonizing flies, and bid them enjoy that freedom of which he himself was bereaved?\n\n\"But the taste for natural beauty is subservient to higher purposes than those which have been enumerated; and the cultivation of it not only refines and humanizes, but dignifies and exalts the affections. It elevates them to the admiration and love of that Being who is the author of all that is fair, sublime, and good in the creation. Scepticism and irreligion are hardly compatible with the sensibility of heart which arises from a just and lively relish of the wisdom, harmony, and order subsisting in the world around us: and emotions of piety must spring up spontaneously in the bosom that is in unison with all animated nature. Actuated by this divine inspiration, man finds a fane in every grove; and, glowing with devout fervour, he joins his song to the universal chorus, or mutes the praise of the Almighty, in more expressive silence. Thus they\n\n\"Whom Nature's works can charm, with God himself Hold converse: grow familiar, day by day,\nWith his conceptions; act upon his plan;\nAnd form to his the relish of their souls.\"\n\nOn the whole then, it certainly appears, that the advantages resulting from a taste for natural beauties are great and important: it is equally certain, that as it is useful, so it is a continual source of real enjoyment; for a more rational pleasure cannot possibly occupy the attention or captivate the affections of mankind, than that which arises from a due consideration of the works of nature. Pleasure, we know, is a necessary ingredient in human life, in order to some measure to counterbalance the pains, the evils, and little necessities, which are at times perhaps unavoidable, and in order to render life tolerable. It is the part then of the moralist, and it has been frequently his business, to point out and recommend such pleasures as are highly gratifying, and are yet perfectly innocent. The Spectator, whose works will be admired as long as the language in which they are written is understood, recommends strongly and elegantly the pleasure of a garden; and a later writer, of no common degree of merit, and of very considerable fame, has an essay on Dr Knox, the same subject, from which we shall select a few observations, and to conclude the article. \"Not he alone (says this elegant writer) is to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind, who makes an useful discovery; but he also who can point out and recommend an innocent pleasure. Of this kind are the pleasures arising from the observation of nature; and they are highly agreeable to every taste uncorrupted by vicious indulgence. Rural scenes of almost every kind are delightful to the mind of man. But the misfortune is, that the greater part are hurried on in the career of life with too great rapidity to be able to give attention to that which solicits no passion. The darkest habitation in the dirtiest street of the metropolis, where money can be earned, has greater charms with many than the groves of Hagley.\n\n\"The patron of refined pleasure, the elegant Epicurus, fixed the seat of his enjoyment in a garden. He was of opinion, that a tranquil spot, furnished with the united sweets of art and nature, was the best adapted to delicate repose. And even the severer philosophers of antiquity were wont to discourse in the shade of a spreading tree, in some cultivated plantation. It is obvious, on intuition, that nature often intended solely to please the eye in her vegetable productions. She decorates the flowery that springs beneath our feet in all the perfections of external beauty. She has clothed the garden with a constant succession of various hues. Even the leaves of the tree undergo a pleasing vicissitude. The fresh verdure which they exhibit in the spring, the various shades which they assume in summer, the yellow and russet tinge of autumn, and the nakedness of winter, afford a constant pleasure to a lively imagination. From the snowdrop to the moss rose, the flower garden displays an infinite variety of shape and colour. The taste of the florist has been ridiculed as trifling; yet surely without reason. Did nature bring forth the tulip and the lily, the rose and the honeyuckle, to be neglected by the haughty pretender to superior reason? To omit a single social duty for the cultivation of a polyanthus were ridiculous as well as criminal; but to pass by the beauties lavished before us, without observing them, is no less ingratitude than stupidity. A bad heart finds little amusement but in a communication with the active world, where scope is given for the indulgence of malignancy.\"\nmalignant passions; but an amiable disposition is commonly known by a taste for the beauties of the animal and the vegetable creation.\" In short, since the world was made for our use, since the beauties of nature are alike displayed before all men, and since they are unquestionably an inexhaustible fund of innocent amusement; that subject must be of vast importance which enables us to relish them properly.","sp":244,"ep":250},{"h":"NATURAL HISTORY","t":"The objects of nature may be considered under two points of view; 1st, With respect to their form, structure, habits, and individual properties when viewed in a state of inactivity; 2dly, With respect to the mutual changes which they produce when made to act on each other. Hence the study of nature may be divided into two parts, NATURAL HISTORY and NATURAL SCIENCE; the former considering bodies in comparatively an inactive state, the latter in a state of mutual action.\n\nNatural History, then, is that part of natural knowledge which teaches us to distinguish and describe the objects of nature, to examine their appearance, structure, properties and uses, and to collect, preserve, and arrange them (A).\n\n1. When we take a general survey of the objects with which we are surrounded, we are bewildered amidst the number and variety that are everywhere presented to our view. The air, the woods, the fields, the waters, teem with myriads of animals; a large proportion of the earth's surface is covered with a green mantle of luxuriant herbage, interspersed with plants and flowers of a thousand varied tints; and when we search below this, when we explore the cloud-capt mountain, the gloomy mine, the sequestered cavern, or the rocky cliff, we discover a great variety of mineral substances, either piled into irregular masses, or lying in uniform beds or layers, disposed in veins or seams, or scattered at random through the other stony matters.\n\nTo the casual observer, the number and variety of these objects would appear almost infinite. He would consider it equally impossible to enumerate them as to number the stars, or count the sands on the sea shore. This idea, however, arises from his feeling them in confusion and disorder. The naturalist, by separating them into those groups or classes, in which they often naturally present themselves, has succeeded not only in distinguishing the several kinds from each other, but even in guessing pretty accurately at the number of species that have hitherto been discovered.\n\nThere are two objects which should principally occupy the attention of the naturalist: 1st, To classify natural substances; 2dly, To examine their structure.\n\nThe number of natural productions being consequently very great, it is necessary to find out some means of distinguishing them from each other, and of recognizing them on seeing them anew. These means are the peculiarities, or the assemblages of peculiarities, that exclusively belong to each body. Now there is scarcely any substance that has a simple character, that is, which can be distinguished from every other substance by any one of its properties singly. It is only by the combination of several of these properties that we can distinguish an object from others which resemble it in possessing some one or more of those very properties; and the more numerous the species we compare, the more necessary it becomes to bring their properties together, in order to assign to each a character that may distinguish it from the rest. Hence to distinguish a species, considered independently from all others that exist in nature, it is necessary to express its character almost the whole of its properties, and the more of these we take into the character, the more complete will be our description of the object. But no man can acquire a sufficiently accurate knowledge of all natural objects to enable him to give a complete description of them: human life is too short to admit of the completion of such a task. All that can be expected from our limited faculties is to acquire a general knowledge of natural objects, confining our principal attention to such as possess some striking qualities, or appear convertible to the useful purposes of life.\n\nTo gain this end, two modes of procedure have been adopted by naturalists. According to the first mode, we employ characters that proceed by degrees from particulars to generals. We begin by comparing together a certain number of species that bear the nearest relation to each other. In drawing the characters of these species, it is requisite to express only those differences, which, on a supposition that they are the most nearly related, form but a small part of their properties; a number of species thus brought together constitutes what is called a genus or tribe.\n\n(A) Some writers divide natural history into general and particular, which are thus defined by Cuvier. General natural history considers under a single point of view, all natural bodies, and the common result of all their actions in the great whole of nature. It determines the laws of coexistence of their properties; it establishes the degrees of resemblance that exist between different bodies, and classifies them according to these degrees. The particular natural history of any body, to be perfect, should comprehend, 1st, The description of all the sensible properties of that body, and of all its parts; 2d, The mutual relations of these parts, the motions which they produce, and the changes which they undergo while they remain united; 3d, The active and passive relations of this body with every other body in the universe; and 4th, The explanation of all these phenomena. See Tableau \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire d'Histoire Naturelle.\nThe remainder of these properties which are common to all the species of the genus combine to form the character, or rather the description, of the genus, distinguishing it from all those which might be formed by bringing together other species; but the number of these common properties being still very considerable, we repeat the same means in order to reduce the characters of the genera to smaller terms. We compare together only those genera which most nearly resemble each other, and the generic characters now employed must only express those differences which form but a small part of their common properties. Those properties, which are common to all the genera, compose a character that distinguishes this assemblage or group from all other groups or genera. Such an assemblage of genera is called an order.\n\nRepeating the same operation, and bringing together such orders as are most nearly allied, we form a more general assemblage, called a class; and again uniting a certain number of classes, we form a higher division, to which naturalists have given the name of kingdom: this chain of divisions in which the higher links comprehend the lower, forms what is called a method. The other mode of procedure is to rise gradually from generals to particulars, beginning with the slightest and most obvious differences, thus forming the first division or kingdom; dividing each kingdom into classes, each class into orders, each order into genera, each genus into species, and each species into varieties. This descending series constitutes what is called a system, and is that which has been generally adopted by naturalists.\n\nTo illustrate this systematical classification of natural objects, let us select a familiar example. Among the various creatures that pass under our observation, a great number are possessed of life, of sensation, and voluntary motion; these we call animals, and of these we form the animal kingdom. On examining various groups of animals, we find that many have four extremities, and suckle their young by means of teats; these we call quadrupeds or mammalia. We have thus formed a class of animals. Again we find that of the mammalia some have hoofed feet and blunt fore-teeth, and feed almost entirely on vegetables. These will constitute an order of the class of mammalia, to which Linnaeus has given the name of belluae. Of this order a certain number of animals agree in having five fore-teeth in both jaws, and form a genus or tribe distinguished by this particular from the other animals of the same order, and commonly called the horse tribe. Lastly, in this tribe we find one species that has solid hoofs, a tail bristly at the end, an upright mane, and a black crofs on the shoulder of the male. This species is the common ass.\n\nIn framing an artificial system of natural history, most writers have agreed on the division of natural bodies into kingdoms, proceeding on the supposition that those marks which are to distinguish the objects of one kingdom from those of another are sufficiently fixed and certain.\n\nLet us examine for a little how far this supposition agrees with nature's works as we find them.\n\nThe division of natural objects commonly adopted is into three kingdoms; the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. This division has been almost universally received, as perfectly consistent with nature; and is by most persons thought to be so clear and distinct, that they suppose it impossible to mistake in referring any particular object to its proper kingdom. This arises from their having noticed only such objects as bear evident marks of the division to which they belong; but if we draw their attention to a variety of other individuals, they will acknowledge themselves to be incompetent to the decision, or will erroneously refer to one division, what has, after accurate examination, been determined to belong to another.\n\nThere is one whole class of productions, called zoophytes by naturalists, which seem to form the connecting links between the different kingdoms. They are animals of the polypus kind, mostly covered with a calcareous crust, differing little in composition from the shells of lobsters, shrimps, and other shell-fish, and formed like them from an exudation or secretion on the surface of their bodies. These polypi are connected together by thousands, or even millions, and assume a great variety of appearances according to their arrangement: the same species, however, always assuming the same, or very nearly the same appearance. Some are connected together in form of stem and branches, as the flustra, fuculata, corallines and others; many of which have their offspring in the egg state attached to them, and so situated as to bear exact resemblance to the feed-vessels of plants. These are altogether so like to many of the sea-plants, as to be generally confounded with them, under the title of sea-weeds; but the attentive naturalist may, by examining them in their natural state, perceive the tentacula or feelers of each polypus extended in its search for food, and hastily retracting within its shell upon the least alarm. Many of this description are found attached to oysters or other shell-fish; and often to stones and pebbles which are covered or occasionally wetted by the sea.\n\nOther zoophytes assume less regular figures, and are much more firm and solid, resembling the productions of the mineral kingdom. Madrepores and millepores, called often brainstones, are of this kind. At first sight they look very like stones and pebbles, or like pieces of chalk or marble, but on an accurate inspection, any one may perceive marks of an organic structure; and when they are in a recent state, may detect the inhabitants of their numerous cells.\n\nThe above examples would suffice to prove, how insufficient is either a hasty examination or the judging by similarity of appearance, for determining to what kingdom of nature any particular object belongs. But there are many other productions to which few persons could without hesitation assign their places: For instance, where would we arrange the green powdery substance so common on paling; the spotted and streaked appearance on stones; the mould on cheese, or the green jelly-like matter that floats on the surface of the stagnant waters? Naturalists in general have assigned these productions to the vegetable kingdom; but Sennegier and a few others have maintained that some of them are animals.\n\nAccording to some writers, the most philosophical notion which we can form on this subject is, that the division of natural objects into kingdoms is artificial, and that Nature, acknowledging no such bonds, passes imperceptibly from the animal to the vegetable, and from the\nthe vegetable to the mineral world, without defining where one ceases or where the next begins.\n\nAs the appearances of natural productions are insufficient, so are their properties and powers for determining which are animals or which vegetables, according to the received acceptation of the terms. If locomotion is allowed to be the characteristic of an animal, where shall we place the oyster, or the zoophytes of which we have just been speaking, or where some species of ulva and conserva, plants that swim about detached in water? If feeling or sensation be the test, who shall decide, that the sensitive plant (mimosa pudica), possesses it not? and who determine that the leaves of the fly-trap, (Dionaea muscipula), when they contract, and catch the fly as soon as it alights, do not feel the depoiler that comes to rob it of its honey?\n\nThough these and similar objections may certainly be made to the artificial division of nature's works into kingdoms, yet it is convenient to have such a division; and even the very difficulty of establishing to which kingdom any object belongs, is an additional spur to the genius and industry of the naturalist.\n\nThe most natural division of the works of nature is that which distinguishes them into organized and inorganic bodies; and on the whole, we have seen no attempt to establish the differences between these so successful as that adopted by M. Dumeril in his late scientific work, \"Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire d'Histoire Naturelle.\"\n\n\"Some objects, says he, as animals and plants, have formerly constituted a part of other individuals, similar to themselves, from which they have been separated at a certain period, under the form of eggs, of germs, or of little living creatures; and their existence is evidently owing to this generation; they are born. Others, on the contrary, as stones, salts, water, may be formed by certain circumstances, and even by ourselves at pleasure. They have not necessarily made a part of other similar bodies; their existence seems to depend on certain fortuitous circumstances, that have produced the approximation of their constituent principles, and their origin might be referred to attraction. These bodies are formed. Vegetables and animals in increasing their size, only develop themselves. Whatever may be their minutefolds, we shall, on a careful examination, find them already formed, with their parts requiring only to be evolved. Their increase proceeds from within outwards by intus-suffection. Stones, and a great many other bodies, are augmented only by the same matter from which they are produced; their growth takes place always from without, by a sort of aggregation.\n\n\"As the increase of the bodies which compose these two great subdivisions is not alike in both, a duration very different ought to be the result of this dissimilarity. In fact, minerals are susceptible of indefinite increase, and their end is always indeterminate; it is vague, and depends on the circumstances under which they are placed. Plants and animals ought, from the same circumstances which favoured their development, to stop when their extension has been carried to the highest degree so that the end or death of these bodies is fixed and necessary.\n\n\"The masses in which stones and other similar bodies generally present themselves, are angular, inflated, and very variable in their size. The individuals which we call plants and animals, have always, and necessarily, a form that is constant, for the most part, rounded and symmetrical, and their extension is limited within certain bounds.\n\n\"There is this great difference between these bodies; that those which increase by aggregation may be divided into molecules, or parts infinitely small, bearing a very near resemblance to the finals from which they were taken; while in those which develop themselves, no portion can be taken away and exist by itself, at least unless it develop new parts, which replace those that are wanting.\n\n\"The bodies which do not develop themselves, are in general formed of fluids or solids which remain constantly in the same points; they are composed of very few elements, which may be separated and again reunited. The bodies which develop themselves, on the contrary, are essentially composed of solids and fluids, which are always changing, and in a state of renovation; they have always, and from necessity, more or less confidence, they are penetrated and augmented by fluids, and after being decomposed they can never be formed again such as they were before.\"\n\nFor the more convenient study of natural history, the whole subject may be divided into five great branches: viz. Meteorology, Hydrography, Mineralogy, Botany, and Zoology.\n\n1. Meteorology includes the description of all natural phenomena which take place in the atmosphere, that surrounds our globe. In the present work it is considered under the articles Meteorology, Meteorology, Atmospheric Electricity, Cloud, Moon, Influence of, &c.\n\n2. Hydrography comprehends the natural history of hydrography, the sea, of rivers, lakes, and other collections of water, that make up so large a part of the earth. Much of this subject will be found treated of under the article River, and various parts of it have been discussed under Chemistry and Mineralogy.\n\n3. Mineralogy is that part of the subject which treats Mineralogy of the solid inorganic bodies that are found on the surface or in the bowels of the earth. It has been considered under the articles Geology and Mineralogy.\n\n4. Botany comprehends the natural history of vegetation. See Botany.\n\n5. Zoology includes the natural history of all animals, mated beings, and is subdivided into many subordinate classes.\n\nThese classes are different in number and denomination, according to the different systems of naturalists. Linnaeus, whom we have principally followed in this work, has arranged animals under six classes: viz. 1. Mammalia, or those animals which suckle their young at mammary paps; see Man, Mammalia and Cetology. 2. Aves, or birds; see Ornithology. 3. Amphibia, or those animals which can live either on land or in water; see Reptology and Ophiology. 4. Piscis, or fishes; see Ichthyology. 5. Insecta, or insects; see Entomology. And 6. Vermes, or worms; see Helminthology and Conchology.\n\nLater naturalists have divided animals into a greater number of classes, and have subdivided these differently. Of these arrangements, that of M. Cuvier seems the most deserving of notice. After considering man, whom he very properly distinguishes from the other mammalia by allotting to him a separate book, he divides the rest of\nof the animal kingdom into nine classes, viz. Mammiferous animals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Mollusca, Worms, Crustaceans, animals, Insects and Zoophytes.\n\nWe have already given an outline of four of these classes, viz. of the Mammiferous animals, under Mammalia, and of Mollusca, Worms and Zoophytes, under Helminthology. To complete our view of Cuvier's arrangement, we shall here add an outline of the remaining five classes.\n\nCuvier divides birds into five orders, viz. Rapacious birds or Accipitres, Passerine birds, Climbers or Scansores, Gallinaceous birds, Waders or Grallae, and Anserine birds.\n\n1. The Rapacious birds have short feet, toes furnished with strong claws, and a hooked bill. They are subdivided into three sections; viz. Nudicollis, having the head and part of the neck without feathers; containing the vulture tribe. Plumicolles, having the head covered with feathers and a cere at the base of the bill, containing the falcon tribe; including Griffons, Eagles, Sparrow-hawks, Buzzards, Kites and Falcons. Nycteriides, having the head flattened backward from the front and the eyes directed forward; containing the owl tribe.\n\n2. The Passerine birds are distinguished by having four toes, three before and one behind, with the external toes wholly or partially united. They are subdivided into seven sections; viz. Laniarires, having the bill grooved towards the end of the mandible; containing the Shrikes, Flycatchers, Thrushes, Chatterers and Tanagers.

Subulirostres, having the bill slender like an awl; containing the Titmice, Manakins, Larks, and Wagtails. Planirostres, having the bill short, flattened horizontally, and opening very wide; containing the Swallows and Goat-fuckers. Tenurirostres, having the bill slender, elongated and solid; containing the Nut-hatches, Creepers, Humming birds, Hoopees, Bee-eaters, King's fishers and Todies.\n\n3. The Climbers have two toes before and two behind. They are subdivided into two sections; viz. Cuneirostres, having a slender bill; containing Jacamars, Wood-peckers, Wry-necks, and Cuckoos. Levirostres, having the bill thick and light; containing the Anis, Toucacoes, Mulophages, Curucuis, Barbets, Toucans and Parrots.\n\n4. The Gallinaceous birds have the front toes united at their base by a short membrane. They are subdivided into two sections, viz. Alectrides, having common wings fitted for flying; containing the Pigeons, Grouse, Peacocks, Pheasants, Pintados, Turkeys, Curafowls, Guans, Bustards. Brevipennes, having wings too short for flight; containing the Ostrich, Cassowary and Dodo tribes.\n\n5. The Waders have elevated and naked tarsi and the two outer toes united. They are subdivided into five sections, viz. Brevirostres, having the bill short and thick; containing the Trumpeters, Screamers, Secretaries, Boat-bills, and Flamingos. Cultrirostres, having the bill long, strong, and like a knife; containing the Herons, Jabiru and Ibises.

They are subdivided into four sections, viz. Pennipes, having all the four toes united; containing the Pelicans, Tropic-birds and Darters. Macropteres, having the thumb free, the bill not indented, and very long wings; containing the Terns, Gulls, Skimmers, Petrels and Albatrosses. Serrirostres, having the thumb free, the bill broad and ferrated, and wings of a moderate size; containing the Ducks and Mergansers. Brachypteres, having the thumb either free or wanting, the bill not ferrated, and the wings very short, containing the Grebes, Auks and Manchots.\n\nThe Amphibia or Reptiles are divided into two orders, as follows.\n\n1. Those that have a heart with two auricles. This order is subdivided into two sections, viz. Chelonia, having a back shell and the jaws invested with horn, containing the Tortoise tribe, including Turtles and Tortoises. Sauria, having a fleshy body and teeth; containing the Lizard tribe, including the Crocodiles, Guanas, Dragons, Lizards, Skinks, and some others.\n\n2. Those that have a heart with one auricle. This order is also subdivided into two sections, viz. Ophidia, having a fleshy body, no feet, and always without branchiae; containing the tribes of Anguis, Amphibolone, Caecilia, Acrocordon, Angaha, Coluber or Snake, Boa, and Crotalus or Rattle-Snake. Batrachia, having a naked skin, feet and branchiae in the young animals; containing the Frogs, Salamanders, and (according to Cuvier's original tables) the Siren.\n\nThe fishes are divided into two orders, Cartilaginous and Bony fishes.\n\n1. Those which have a Cartilaginous skeleton are divided into two sections, viz. Chondropterygii, with fixed branchiae; containing the Lampreys, Hags, Rays, Dog-fish and Sea-monsters. Branchioslegt, with free branchiae; containing the tribes Batrachus or American Toad-fish, Polyodon, Accipenser or Sturgeons, Pegasus, Synagathus or Pipe-fish, Centricetus or Bellows-fish, Balistes or Horned-fish, Olfracon or Trunk-fish, Tetraodon or Sun-fish, Oveides, Mola or Moles, Diodon or Porcupine-fish, Lophius or Frog-fish, and Cyclopterus or Lump-fish.\n\n2. The fishes with a bony skeleton are subdivided into four sections, viz. Apodes, having no ventral fins; containing the tribes of Murena or Eels, Gymnothrix, Synbranchus, Sphaebranchus, Gymnotus or Electric-eels, Trichurus, Gymneterus, Ophidium, Ammotydes, or Sand-eels; Anarhichas, or Sea-wolves; and Xiphias or Sword-fish. Jugulares, having the ventral fins situated before the pectoral; containing the Haddock, Blennys, Hunch-back, Dragonets, Sea-dragons, and Star-gazers. Thoracici, with the ventral fins situated below the pectoral; containing the Bull-heads, Scorpions, Gurnards, Gobys, Summullets, Mackerel, Stickle-backs, Long-tails, Lonchirus, Johnes, Sciences, Dor\u00e9es, Stromateus, Theuthis, Chaetodon, Dorados, Bodians,\nThe Crustacea are divided into two orders, as follows:\n\n1. Monoculi, containing the tribes of Limulus, Calygos, Apus, Cyclops, and Polyphemus.\n\n2. Ecrevisses, or Crabs, containing the tribes of Cancer, Inachus, Pagurus, Aethacus, Palinurus, Scyllarus, and Squilla.\n\nThe Insects are distributed by Cuvier under two general orders, viz. Those with jaws, and those without jaws.\n\n1. Insects with jaws are arranged under five sections, viz. Gnathaptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Orthoptera. The Gnathaptera have no wings, and are subdivided into Polyneurata, having several pairs of jaws, containing the tribes of Phylodes, Oniscus, and Cymothoa; Millepedes, with two jaws and feet at each ring of the body, containing the tribes of Julus and Scolopendra; Araneidea, having the head joined to the corselets, eight feet, and abdomen without feet; Setigerae, having the head distinct, six feet, and abdomen terminated by filken threads; Ricinini, with the head distinct, six feet, and the abdomen naked. The Neuroptera have four reticulated wings, and are subdivided into Odonatae, having the mouth covered with the lip, and the wings extended during repose; Teclipennae, with the mouth saillant, and wings hidden below the body during repose; Agnatha, with a very small mouth, and no mandibles. The Hymenoptera have four veined wings, and of these some have the abdomen joined to the thorax by a pedicle; as the Melitaeae, having the lip prolonged into a trunk; the Duplipedennae, having the upper wings folded lengthwise; the Chrysidae, having the antennae bent, and the abdomen hollow below; the Anthophiles, with the antennae filiform, wings not folded, abdomen round, and lips short; the Trouffeurs, with fetaceous antennae, of 12 or 13 joints, rolling up spirally; the Myrmeces, with fetaceous bent antennae, and a rounded abdomen; the Insectiroides, with bent antennae of 30 joints, and a prominent fling; Cynipes, with filiform antennae and a spiral fling. Others of this section have the abdomen sessile as the Uroceri, with palps scarcely apparent, and a very prominent fling, and the Tenthredos with very prominent palps and a ferrated fling. The Coleoptera have four wings, the uppermost of which are hard, and the lower fold tranversely; they have either six palps, as the Carnaffers, with filiform or fetaceous antennae; or four palps; and of these latter some have the tarfs five jointed, as the Lamellicornes, with clavated antennae, having the club lamellated; the Clavicorne, with the antennae either perforated or solid; the Brachelyteres, with moniliform antennae and short elytra; the Woodpeckers, with filiform antennae and hard elytra; and the Apalutes, with filiform antennae and soft elytra. Others have the tarfs four or five-jointed; as the Lucifuges, with variable antennae and hard elytra; and the Blistering-flies, with variable antennae and soft elytra. Others again have the tarfs four jointed; as the Rostricornes, with antennae on the beak; the Wood eaters, with setiform antennae; the Termitiforms, with clavated antennae, and a body often cylindrical, and the club solid; the Planiforms, with granulated antennae and a flattened body; and the Herbivori, with filiform or moniliform antennae and a swollen body. A few have the tarfs three-jointed, as the Coccinelles. The Orthoptera have four wings, the upper hard and the lower folded longitudinally. They include the Forficules, having the anus terminated by a forceps; the Blatte, with a flattened body and the head retiring below the corselet; the Mantis and Speculites, with a very long corselet; and the Leapers, with cylindrical body and long hinder legs formed for jumping.\n\n2. The Insects without jaws are subdivided into Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Aptera. The Hemiptera have four wings frequently crooked, and a jointed beak; and include the Frontirostres, having the beak rising from the fore part of the head; the Collirrostres, with the beak appearing to grow from the neck; and the Planipennae, with the wings not crooked and spreading. The Lepidoptera have four wings covered with scales and a spirial trunk; they include the Butterflies, with the antennae terminated by a solid mass; the Hepheriae, with the antennae curved at their extremity; the Fulicornes, with the antennae swelling towards the middle, and the Seticornes, with fetaceous antennae. The Diptera have only two wings; and include the Hydrophyes, with filiform or plumose antennae and a trunk; the Sarcoptes, with a fleshy retractile trunk, terminated by two lips; the Sclerogonmes, with very short antennae, a horned projecting sucker, but no trunk; and the Gad-flies, with short antennae, and neither sucker nor trunk. The Aptera have no wings; they include the Parasitical insects, or Fleas, Lice, and Mites.\n\nIt is not surprising that naturalists of taste and genius, from the gradation that seems to take place among the chain of beings examined, should have been led to form the notion that there exists in nature a regular series or chain of beings, the links of which, if we could discover them all, would be found to resemble each other so nearly, as only to exhibit to the superficial observer a few shades of difference. Natura non per saltum movet, has become a sort of axiom in natural history.\n\nThe notion of a chain of being is alluring, and does not want arguments in its favour. The Esquimaux Indian, or the inhabitant of Terra del Fuego, seems scarcely superior in form, and very little in intellect, to the Oran Otan; the Platypus, the flying Lemur, flying Squirrels, and, still more, the Bats, appear to form the connecting links between quadrupeds and birds; while the Seals, the Walruses, and the whole order of Cete, connect the former with the fishes. In this latter class, the Flying Fish, in its capability of supporting itself in the air, seems to approach the feathered tribes, while some of these, as the Penguins, in their habits and manner of life, bear some distant resemblance to fishes. Again, the Siren and the Eels so nearly resemble each other, that it has been disputed whether the former should be reckoned among the Amphibia or the Fishes; while one species of Lizard, (Lacerta lumbricoides), is so like an earth-worm, as apparently to connect the Amphibia and the Vermes. Further, the diminutive Humming-bird (Trochilus exilis), and the Humble\nHumble Bee, (*Apis terrestris*), are so nearly alike, both in size and manner of life, as to form no very exceptionable links of union between the birds and insects.\n\nIf we compare the vegetable tribes with some of the inferior classes of animals, we shall perceive many points of resemblance, which may seem to indicate a continuance of the same chain. Besides the *Mimosa pudica* and *Disocca mucicula*, already mentioned, the *Hedyarum gyran*, or moving plant, is a remarkable instance of the mobility of vegetables; the carrion flower (*Stapelia biflora*), and some species of *morel*, bear the odour of putrid animal substances; while on the other hand, the *Manitis ficifolia* might be mistaken for a dried leaf; several species of *Pinnatula* (sea pens) and *Sertularia*, for ferns; the *Madrepora fungites* (mushroom madrepora), for a petrified mushroom; and the *Tubularia magnifica*, and *Actinia*, when expanded, for the most beautiful full-blown flowers.\n\nLastly, on comparing the mineral kingdom with the classes of organized beings, we find several so nearly resembling stones, as scarcely, to be distinguished from them.\n\nThough the view which we have given above, of the circumstances that have led naturalists to form the idea of a regular chain of beings, is specious; it will not bear the scrutiny of a strict examination. The resemblances which we have pointed out, are more apparent than real; and anatomy and chemistry, added to a more accurate acquaintance with the works of nature, have proved, that those links which, to superficial observers, appear most allied, are yet separated by considerable chasms. In fact, if we were to admit these resemblances as ever so accurate, they would lead us to form, not one chain, but many.\n\nIt must be considered as a very difficult, though a very curious problem, to ascertain the number of species at present known throughout the several subdivisions of nature. From the different modes in which different naturalists have distributed the objects of their research, and from the additions that are perpetually made to our knowledge, it may be impossible to fix the precise number of known species at any given time; but we may make a tolerably near approximation to the truth; and this we shall now attempt, going through the several kingdoms, classes, and orders, as they have been treated of in the former parts of this work.\n\nI.

La C\u00e9p\u00e9de, in a note to the discourse delivered by him at the close of his course of Natural History, states the numbers of some classes as follows: *Mammalia*, 416 species; *Birds*, 2534; *Reptiles*, 125; *Serpents*, 180; *Fishes*, 992; in all 4247.\n### D.

Though the classification of natural bodies is of the highest importance towards making us acquainted with unknown species, and distinguishing them from those which we already know; this alone is not sufficient to form a naturalist. His principal object should be to learn the habits, manners, and uses of the objects which he is studying; and he may perhaps be assisted in this object by the following observations.\n\n1. In Zoology, or the natural history of the animal kingdom, it is necessary to ascertain both the distinctive characters of each individual animal, and its peculiar habits, properties and uses.\n\nThe naturalist first learns that the sheep, for instance, is in the class mammalia, being one of those animals that suckle their young; in the order pecora, because it is hoofed, and has no cutting teeth in the upper jaw; and that it is distinguished from other animals of the same order, by its having several blunt wedge-like incisive fore-teeth in the lower jaw only, hollow reclined horns, and no tusks.\n\nThis information would satisfy many, who call themselves naturalists; but it is far from being all that is required; the philosophical investigator of Nature inquires into its habits; as its food, its period of gestation, its season of lambing, the weather and climate most suited to its health and vigour. He endeavours to learn what produces the difference in its fleece, whether climate, food, or some peculiarity in the breed; and is anxious to ascertain what variety is most disposed to fatten, and what food effects this speedily; with many other very useful particulars.\n\nThe information of the first kind is of consequence and even necessary in many cases; but that of the latter is most useful.\n\nIf a traveller discover an animal possessing any useful property, or producing any useful drug, if he have not the first kind of information, he gives so confused and inaccurate a description of it, that others, mistaking the animal, discredit the author's account, and the world loses the benefit of his discovery.\n\n2. Botany, or the natural history of the vegetable kingdom, in the usual acceptation of the term, implies and only\n\n(c) This number, drawn from the article Botany, compared with the three first volumes of Wildenow's edition of the Species Plantarum, and with Perlon's edition of the Systema Vegetabilium, of Linn\u00e9, is certainly very far below the truth. Many years ago, the number of known species was reckoned at above twenty thousand, and there is reason to believe that it exceeds fifty thousand.","sp":256,"ep":257},{"h":"NATURAL HISTORY","t":"Objects and only the knowledge of the distinctive characters of utility of plants; and he who knows the greatest number, and is most accurate in determining the different species, is accounted the best botanist.\n\nThis however constitutes but a small part of the science; there is another distinct department, which may properly be termed the philosophy of botany, which is both more interesting and more useful. This includes the knowledge of the structure, or the anatomy of plants; and the knowledge of the uses, or functions of their various parts, as of the leaves, the bark, the pith, the roots, the juices, &c.; which is called the physiology of plants. It includes also an acquaintance with the soil and climate adapted to different vegetables, their mode of propagation, and the various uses to which their several parts or productions may be applied.\n\nBotany, in the first sense, which may be called practical botany, is sublative, and absolutely necessary to the study of the philosophy of botany; for no one that is unacquainted with the classification of plants can either convey to others his own information, or himself receive the benefit of that of others, respecting either the structure and economy, or the habits and the uses of such plants, as may have been investigated.\n\nIf medical virtues are discovered in any vegetable production; without the accuracy of the practical botanist, to ascertain and describe the particular plant which affords it, the discovery is often lost; or perhaps, what is worse, the virtues are attributed to a different plant, and it is only by repeated failures, and in some cases after much mischief, that the error is detected.\n\nIt is evident that the same may happen to the agriculturist, the dyer, or any other artizan, who has discovered in the vegetable kingdom the means of improving his art, but has not botanical knowledge sufficient to give an accurate character of the plant, to which he is indebted for his discovery.\n\n3. In Mineralogy, or the natural history of the mineral kingdom, almost half the students are of that class, who content themselves with collecting, and being able to arrange systematically the minerals they meet with. But in this department of natural history, as well as the other two, which we have considered, something more than arrangement is required.\n\nIt is the man who can analyze, and separate the component parts of mineral productions; who knows the art of assaying, and who knows a priori the probable site of a quarry, or a mine, and can tell the direction of a stratum of coal, or of marble, that we may call a mineralogist.\n\nThe natural history of the mineral kingdom includes geology, or the data upon which are founded the different theories of the formation of the earth. It includes the knowledge of those facts, upon which the art of mining, and the art of separating and purifying metals, is founded; and its object is to teach likewise the properties of those metals, as well as of the earths, and other mineral productions, when separated and in their simple state.\n\nWith respect to the utility of the study of natural history, we have unavoidably given many instances of it, in considering the object of the science. We need therefore add but few others.\n\nThe grazier knows the advantage of attending to the objects and habits and distinctive marks of our domestic animals. It is natural history, though not often studied scientifically, that teaches him what variety of sheep to prefer; by what means to obtain a variety of cows, remarkable for their quantity of milk; how to choose the stock to the best adapted to his land, and what is the best food for them during winter.\n\nMuch benefit is likely to accrue from the attention lately paid to the cultivation of what are termed the artificial grasses. Instead of sowing his hay feeds indiscriminately, the grazier may select only such grasses as are, by observation, found to be most suited to his soil and cattle.\n\nThe farmer's knowledge of the proper succession of crops, the best times for sowing them, when to weed, and with what to manure, as well as how to destroy both weeds and insects, is the knowledge of a naturalist; and surely he, who is scientifically acquainted with the growth of plants, knowing what part the soil acts in vegetation, and what is the aliment most required by them, will have great advantage over the mere empirical farmer, who has no better reason for what he does, than that his father did the same before him.\n\nBy studying the natural history of insects, we learn the habits of such as are noxious and injurious, and thence derive the means of destroying them.\n\nThe mineralogist has often enriched individual proprietors of land, and benefited his country, by the discovery of mines; he is enabled to direct the planners of canals by warning them of obstructions; and his knowledge has aided the physician in ascertaining the virtues of minerals, and of mineral waters.\n\nIn the arts, a knowledge of natural history prevents that confusion, and those innumerable errors that must be committed, when the natural productions which are employed cannot be accurately discriminated from others.\n\nIt is to the naturalist that we are many times indebted for the introduction of foreign animals and foreign plants into our own country. Wheat, oats, barley, and other vegetables, which are now become necessary to our existence, were not originally of British growth. The potato, now so general and so useful, was first introduced into this country by Gerard, a noted botanist, and was for some time cultivated in his garden as a rarity. The sugar-cane, the bread-fruit tree, the farinaceous palms, the flax and hemp, have all been transported by naturalists of the present day, to regions where they never grew before.\n\nBesides the above, and many similar instances of advantage to be derived from studying the different branches of natural history, these two incalculable benefits necessarily arise to the student himself, from attending to the whole, or any part of the science; namely, a power of abrading the mind, and reasoning methodically; and a habit of contemplating the Creator in his works*:\n\nOur limits do not permit us to enter further into the fertile topic of the utility and advantages of natural history. Its utility, in a moral and religious point of view, has been ably illustrated by Mr Ray, in his \"Wisdom of God;\" by Mr Bingley, in the introduction\nMode of preserving specimens.\n\nArt of preserving specimens.\n\nIII. We have stated it to be one of the principal objects of natural history, to teach the mode of preserving specimens. This art, called by the French Taxidermie, is exceedingly curious, and would well deserve a much fuller consideration than we can here allot to it. We shall confine our attention on this subject entirely to the animal kingdom, and even here we must be very brief.\n\nThe art of preparing and mounting the skins of animals appears to be pretty old; but it made no great progress before the 17th century, when Reaumur made some attempts to preserve the specimens from the attacks of insects. In the Journal de Physique for 1773, there is a memoir addressed to the Royal Society of London, by M. Kuckhan, on the methods of preparing birds, which is very curious, but is liable to many objections. In the same volume is a memoir by Mauduit, principally respecting the means of preserving animal specimens from the attacks of insects. His preservatives are of a poisonous nature; and, of course, their use is dangerous, while they do not appear to have been attended with the expected success. The arsenical soap of Becquer, much celebrated about the same time, is liable to similar objections.\n\nThe latest, and probably the best work on this subject, is that published a few years ago by M. Nicolas; and from this the following observations are derived.\n\nThe instruments employed in the preparation of specimens are much the same as those used by anatomists in their ordinary dissections, consisting of small knives or scalpels, forceps or pincers of various forms, probes, needles, and pins or wires.\n\nThe preservatives employed by M. Nicolas to protect the specimen from insects, are principally of two kinds: 1. Sulphur, which he applies to the skins by means of fumigation, thus impregnating them with fulphurous acid; 2. A liquor for macerating the skins, another liquor for rubbing over the hair, and a pomatum for anointing the inside of the skin. The first liquor is prepared by steeping a pound and a half of powdered oak bark, and four ounces of powdered alum, in twenty English pints of cold water, for two days, taking care to shake the mixture from time to time.\u2014The pomatum is prepared of a pound of white soap, half a pound of caustic potash, four ounces of powdered alum, two English pints of water, four ounces of oil of petroleum, and the same of camphire. The soap, cut into small pieces, is put into an earthen pipkin, over a moderate fire; the water poured over it; and when the whole is formed into a sort of soft paste, the alum and then the oil are added; the whole well stirred together, removed from the fire, and when it is nearly cold the camphire is added, being before hand rubbed down in a mortar with a little spirit of wine. The pomatum, thus prepared, must be kept in glass vessels, well stopp'd; and, when used, is to be lowered with water to the consistence of thin cream, and laid on the skins by means of a pencil brush.\n\nThe liquor employed for preserving the fur is prepared by infusing an ounce of white soap three very small, two ounces of camphire broken into very small pieces, the same of colocynth or bitter-apple grossly powdered, in two English pints of spirit of wine, for four or five days, shaking the vessel from time to time, after which the liquor is to be filtered through blotting-paper.\n\nM. Nicolas has given directions for preparing and preserving specimens of all the various classes of animals. We shall, as far as our limits permit, briefly follow him through each.\n\nIn skinning quadrupeds, he proposes to make an incision along the middle of the back, from the haunches to the shoulders, except in those animals whose skin is very thick and hard, or is fet with spines, in which the opening must be made at the belly in the usual manner. In detaching the skin from the flesh, we must occasionally employ the knife, and as we proceed, must insert tow between the skin and flesh, to prevent foiling the fur. When the whole body is detached, and the skin drawn down as far as the ankles, the nose, and the tip of the tail, the whole body is to be cut away except the head and extremities, which are left to give a better form and support to the specimen. All the fleshy and fatty parts, the brain, and the eyes, however, must be cut away, and nothing left but the bones, the spaces between which and the skin must be stuffed with tow cut fine, and a little soft clay must be put within the orbits, in order to fix the artificial eyes.\n\nBefore stuffing, the skin is to be steeped for several days, from five to fifteen, according to the size of the animal, in the liquor first described, and after steeping, the inside is to be well anointed with the pomatum.\n\nWhen the legs and head are stuffed, the cavity of the skull filled with very dry moss, and the eyes fixed, wires are to be passed through the inside of the body, the extremities, and the head and tail, in the following manner. Three iron wires of a moderate size, well annealed, at least twice as long as the animal, are to be twisted together for nearly half their length, and while one wire is left straight, the other two are to be bent at each end, so as to form a cross. When the skin is turned, ready for stuffing, these wires are to be placed within it in such a manner as that the straight wire shall pass through the head and tail, and the crooking wires through the extremities, coming out at the ball of each foot; and in this way after the cavity is filled up with tow, and the open part neatly stitched, the specimen may be fixed on a board in its natural position. Nothing remains now but to impregnate the fur with the bitter liquor last described, which is done by means of a sponge, with which the whole outside is to be well washed, then covered with folds of linen, and dried in the shade.\n\nThe art of preserving birds is perhaps the most curious part of the present subject, and is that to which the most attention has been given. M. Nicolas has explained at some length the mode recommended by M. Kuckhan in the Journal de Physique; that by Dr Letton, in the Naturalist's and Traveller's Companion; that of Mauduit, inserted in the fifth number of the Encyclop\u00e9die Methodique; and that of Dufresne, adopted by M. Daudin, and inserted in his Trait\u00e9 d'Ornithologie; after which he details his own.\n\nHe describes three methods of preparing birds, according as we can procure fresh-killed specimens, whole dried skins brought from abroad, or detached parts of feathers.\nMode of preserving specimens.\n\nWe shall here confine ourselves to the first of these, as being best adapted to the generality of our readers.\n\nWhen a fresh-killed bird is procured, it is to be placed upon a table, upon its back, with the tail turned towards the operator, who, after having separated with his fingers the feathers which cover the belly towards the right and left, is to make with a scalpel, a longitudinal incision through the skin, from the point of the breast-bone to about the middle of the belly. The edges of the skin are now to be raised with a pair of flat pincers, on each side, carefully separating the flesh as occasion may require, by the knife, and inserting a little cotton from time to time, to prevent foiling the feathers. In this way the skin is to be detached from the shoulders and neck, and as much as possible of the body laid bare, after which a pretty strong thread is to be passed through the nostrils, and tied under the lower mandible, leaving the ends of the thread when tied together, at least twice as long as the neck. Now, holding the bird by the thread, with the back turned towards him, the operator is to hold together the feathers on the two edges of the incision as well as those that cover the breast, and pushing the head of the bird inwards with his thumb so as to form the neck into an arch, is to cut this off near the body, detach from it the gullet and wind-pipe, and all the fleshy parts, both of the neck and head, by drawing the skin as far back as possible towards the beak, and cutting off the neck-bones close to the head; he is to empty the skull with a little iron instrument in the form of an ear-picker, and clean it properly with cotton. He is now to wrap cotton or tow about the head and neck, and to separate the rest of the skin, leaving the pinions and bones of the wings, legs, and the tail, as directed for quadrupeds. After this has been done, the skin is to be turned out like a glove, with all its feathers turned inwards, all the natural openings of the bird, as well as any shot-holes, &c. made in killing the bird, are to be stitched up with a needle and fine thread; then the whole skin as well as the bones, are to be washed with a strong infusion of tan with a little alum, by means of a pencil-brush, and the skin inclosed in a covered vessel that it may not dry too hastily.\n\nIn ten or twelve hours time we may wash the skin and bones again with the astringent liquor. Twice washing in this manner will be sufficient for very small birds, but those of a middling size will require maceration in the first liquor employed for quadrupeds during two days, and four or five days for those of larger size.\n\nThe skins being well impregnated with the astringent liquor, are to be smeared with the foamy pomatum, have artificial eyes fixed in the orbits by means of wax, and fluffed and mounted much in the same manner as quadrupeds, except that the wires employed for this purpose are rather differently bended.\n\nGreat nicety is required in fixing the different parts of a bird in its natural position, and in arranging the feathers smoothly and evenly. M. Nicolas directs thin plates of lead, to be placed so as to secure the wings in the proper position till the whole is completely arranged.\n\nTo preserve the feet and legs of birds, he anoints them with linseed oil mixed with camphire, and applied a little warm.\n\nThe last operation consists in enveloping the bird with bandages of muslin or fine linen, pinned round the neck, breast, body, and rump, as well to secure the feathers in their places during drying, as to allow of their being drenched with the bitter liquor to preserve them from the attacks of insects.\n\nThe different orders of insects require different modes of preparation. The following is a summary of our author's mode of preserving each kind.\n\nFor the coleoptera and hemiptera.\u2014One of these insects, as soon as caught, is to be carefully wrapped in very fine paper, with the ends of the paper curled round to prevent the animal from moving; and this roll of paper including the insect, is to be put into a little box of pasteboard till the insect-hunter returns home. Each insect is then to be held between the thumb and forefinger of the left hand, the wings to be raised by means of a pin, and held open with the middle finger, while the abdomen of the animal is slit open from the back, and the entrails abstracted by means of an iron wire, and the cavity as well as the edges of the wound are to be washed with the bitter spirituous liquor described in No. 36, by means of a very fine pencil. Then a small cotton plug impregnated with oil of petroleum is to be stuffed into the cavity, with the point of a wire, till the cavity is sufficiently full, when the wings are to be suffered to return to their natural situation, and the insect is ready for mounting. For mounting these insects, M. Nicolas employs little squares of card, through the middle and across which he passes a small iron wire well annealed, and about the size of a harpsicord string. A very fine needle is now to be passed through the animal, as near as possible to the corset; and after having covered the upright iron wire with a light coating of gum-water, he passes it through the hole made by the needle, and fixes the animal in such a manner that its feet may rest upon the card.\n\nFor the lepidoptera.\u2014He recommends them to be put, when caught, into a triangular piece of paper, and afterwards into a pasteboard box of the same form, opening with a hinge. For mounting these insects it is sufficient to perforate their bodies with a fine needle, armed with a double thread impregnated with the bitter spirituous liquor, making the needle enter by the head and come out at the end of the belly, and then cutting the thread with scissors. The insect thus prepared is mounted by means of a card, as directed for the coleoptera, and a piece of wood about an inch long, seven or eight lines broad, and a proper thickness, is placed below the wings on each side very near the body, and the wings are kept down by means of plates of lead.\n\nIn the preparation of specimens of fishes, M. Nicolas prefers the method of Mauduit to that given by Dr Lettlow in the Naturalist's and Traveller's Companion; but as Mauduit's methods require much skill and address, he recommends the following, especially for the flat kinds of fish.\n\nHe makes a longitudinal incision with scissors along the belly of the fish from the anus to the lower mandible, and then gradually and carefully separates the skin from the flesh with the assistance of the blade and flat handle of a scalpel, till he has laid bare one side of the animal. He then passes to the other side, proceeding in the same manner to detach the skin from that part, after which he separates the head from the body with a pair\npair of scissors, and clears away the fleshy parts attached to the head. He now detaches the skin from the back as far as the anus, and then laying the fish on the table, he passes the flat handle of the scalpel below the skin that covers the tail and neighbouring parts, in order to separate it completely. This done, he pushes the tail inwards, and with the assistance of the scalpel and drawing the skin very gently, he detaches this as near as possible to the end of the tail, which he then separates with scissors, thus leaving the skin with nothing attached to it but the head and extremity of the tail. It only remains now to clear away the ears and eyes, and properly clean the head.\n\nThe skin is now steeped for some days in the tanning liquor, then laid on a table, and when the head is properly arranged, a model of the body of the fish made of soft clay, mixed with fine sand, is placed within the skin, which is made to fit neatly over it, is then bound with little bandages of linen, and suffered to dry. When the clay is quite dry and hard, and the skin has acquired so much firmness as to retain its proper form, it is to be gently beaten all over to break the clay, so that it may be withdrawn through the opening. When this is done, the whole inside of the skin and head is to be smeared by means of a pencil brush with the soap pomatum. After which it is to be entirely filled with cut tow, and the opening stitched up as neatly as possible. Then artificial eyes are to be placed in the orbits by means of soft wax, and the whole body is to be covered with a coat of white varnish prepared by dissolving four ounces of clear turpentine, three ounces of sandarac, and one ounce of mastic in teak, with eight ounces of oil of turpentine, and four ounces of spirit of wine, in a bottle placed in a water bath.\n\nIn preparing specimens of reptiles,\u2014after what has been said above, little direction will be required. The skin is to be stript backwards as far as the head, which is to be cut off and cleaned as in other specimens; after which the skin is to be macerated, anointed within with pomatum, stuffed and varnished as before.\n\nThe crustacea, including crabs, lobsters, star-fish, and sea-urchins, require but little preparation. In crabs the shell, and in lobsters the tail, is to be separated from the rest of the body; as much as possible of the meat is to be picked out from the body and large claws; the whole interior is to be smeared with the soap pomatum, and after having united the parts, the whole is to be suffered to dry.\n\nThe star-fish and urchins, if taken alive, should be killed by plunging them in spirit of wine, and afterwards drying them in the sun or in an oven moderately heated.\n\nAs to worms the only mode of preserving the mollusca, or those with naked bodies, is to keep them in spirits; and of the testacea, or shell-fish, the only part thought worth preserving is the shell; for the preparation of which, see Conchology.\n\nThe above is but an imperfect abstract of M. Nicolas's \"Methode de preparer et conserver les Animaux de toutes les classes,\" which is illustrated by plates, and is well deserving the attention of collectors of specimens.\n\nThere is also an excellent essay on this subject by Dutrelle, under Taxidermie, in the Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle.\n\nIt will be expected that in this introductory article on natural history, we should say something of its rise and progress. Much of our observations on this subject have been anticipated in preceding articles on the particular branches of natural history, so that little remains for us to do in this place than to give a general sketch of the early history of this branch of physics.\n\nWe have reason to believe that the works of nature Jewish have formed the favourite study among the ingenious and writers inquisitive from the earliest ages of the world. From the continual allusions to the Creator's works, and the beautiful metaphors drawn from them, which abound in the inspired writings of the Jewish prophets and poets, especially those of Job, Isaiah, Daniel and David, we know that these sages were well acquainted with natural history, as far at least as observation extended. Solomon, as we are told, was acquainted with all vegetables, \"from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall,\" and probably so wise a man was well acquainted with the other kingdoms of nature. Some writers have gone so far as to assert that Aristotle and Theophrastus learned natural history from the writings of Solomon, though on what data they ground this assertion, we are at a loss to determine.\n\nThe principal writers on natural history among the ancients, whose writings have come down to us are Aristotle, Theophrastus and Pliny the elder. Of the first Aristotle, we may remark with Haller, that his writings on this subject exhibit a continued chain of physical and anatomical facts, which for the most part appear to have been the result of accurate observation. He relied less than any of the ancient naturalists on uncertain and fabulous report; he industriously collected and examined natural bodies, and appears to have himself dissected many animals, especially fishes, or at least to have been present at their dissection. There are even to be found in his writings, references by letters to figures which he employed to illustrate his observations.\n\nTheophrastus wrote chiefly on the natural history of plants and animals, on winds, and on fire. His works have been edited by Heineius, but, except in plants, they do not contain much that is worthy of our observation more than what is to be found in the writings of Aristotle.\n\nThe natural history of Pliny is a valuable repository of ancient knowledge, which, notwithstanding all its errors and extravagances, we may venture to call after the panegyric of his nephew, a comprehensive and learned work, little less various than nature herself. The author in the dedication of his work to Vespasian, sensible of the defects with which it abounds, apologizes for them, from the consideration that the path which he took had been in a great measure untrodden, and held forth to the traveller few inducements; while some parts of his subject had been so often handled, that readers were become cloyed with them: that it was an arduous task to give what is old an appearance of novelty; to add weight and authority to what is new; to cast a luster upon subjects that have been obscured by time; to render acceptable what is become trite and disgusting; to obtain credit to doubtful relations; and, in a word, to represent every thing according to nature, and with all its natural properties. His design must be acknowledged to be grand and noble, and when we consider that the work was composed in the midst of important engagements,\nengagements, and chiefly at broken periods stolen from sleep, we shall not wonder that it was imperfectly executed.\n\nThe ancients had no idea of methodical or systematic distinctions. As they were acquainted with but few bodies in comparison with the moderns, and attended only to those which were useful to man; they distinguished them only by their usual properties, their native country, their habitations, and the useful purposes to which they might be applied. From the few productions which they described, they were not led to perceive the necessity of searching among them for distinctive marks or relations, which may prevent their being confounded with each other. They doubtedly believed that their descriptions were sufficient, and that the names which they imposed would descend with their customs to posterity, without being affected by the disorders and alterations that have changed the face of countries and the seat of empires. But the revolutions that have defoliated the fairest regions of the globe, by inflating or displacing their inhabitants, or by confounding them with one another, and altering their language, have frequently almost extinguished the lamp of science. After many ages of ignorance and barbarity, we find in the few works of the ancient naturalists, which have escaped the ravages of war and the devastations of civil discord, little more than uncertainty and obscurity, with respect to those species which they have described. Notwithstanding the labours of numerous commentators, we do not certainly know what species of plant is the cicuta employed by the Greeks for the execution of criminals, and which terminated the life of Socrates. We cannot be sure that the animals, which we find best characterized in the ancient writings, bore the names which we attribute to them; nor are we more certain with respect to the ancient nomenclature of minerals.\n\nAs long as studious men cultivated the sciences only through the medium of the writings of the ancients, and attempted nothing beyond the interpretation of these, natural history, like every other branch of physics, remained obscure and confused, and fiction or imagination took the place of facts; but when they perceived the advantage of studying nature herself, and interrogating her by observation, methods were erected, and distinctive characters for the species introduced. This fortunate revolution took place in the 16th century. Caesalpinus first attempted to reduce vegetables to classes, and distinguish them into tribes according to their form.\u2014Gesner, besides the fine hints that he first gave of the constant relation between the structure of the seed and that of the other parts of plants, was the first who attempted any systematic and methodical arrangement of animals. In the 17th century, Morison, Ray, and Rivinus, improved on the hints of Caesalpinus respecting the classification of vegetables; and Aldrovandus, Rhedi, and Swammerdam upon those of Gesner.\n\nrespecting animals; and in a short time this first impulse given to the art of arranging and distinguishing natural bodies by constant characters, was communicated to all those who were employed in the study of nature. Tournefort, profiting by all the attempts towards method and system in the classification of vegetables that had been made before him, advanced a considerable step in botany, by his beautiful method of distinguishing plants according to the form of their flowers and fruits, which he published towards the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe same year of the 18th century (1707) gave Linn\u00e9 birth to two men who have advanced the science of Buffon's natural history far beyond any of their predecessors. We need scarcely mention the names of Linn\u00e9 and Buffon. The Swedish naturalist extended his enlarged views through every branch of natural history; he arranged in his Systema Naturae and Systema Vegetabilium all the productions of nature, and distinguished them by characters that were precise and simple; he created a new language for expressing with brevity all these characters, and thus presented to the view, as in a compendious picture, all the properties of bodies. Buffon, proceeding in a different road, treated more copiously the most important parts of natural history, and of the animals that are most nearly allied to man, in a work which the fire of his genius and the brilliancy of his style have rendered a universal favourite. The rival of Aristotle and Pliny, whose genius he seems to have combined in the greatness of his views and extent of his plan, and altogether one of the first writers of his age, he inspired a passion for the study of nature in numbers, who without his works would never have engaged in such a study, and communicated to his countrymen that taste which has ever since survived him.\n\nAfter what has been given in the particular treatises on natural history in this Encyclopedia, both as to the progress of the science, and the principal works on each department of it, since the time of Linn\u00e9 and Buffon; it is unnecessary for us to trace its progress beyond that period. The advances made within these few years are immense, our stock of information is prodigiously increased, and the modes of study greatly improved and facilitated. The labours of Cuvier, Geoffroy, Lacepede, Dumont, Dumeril, Lamarck, Duvernois, Sennin, Bloch, Spallanzani, Esper, Joffre, Wildenow, Werner, Patrin, St Fond, Brochant, Bronniart, Klaproth, Fourcroy, Vaquelin, Shaw, Latham, Bancroft, Cateby, Ellis, Smith, Withering, Woodville, Kirwan, Playfair, Thomson, Jameon, &c. with the affluence to be derived from the Annales de Museum National, the Naturalist's Miscellany, the Linnaean Transactions, and the splendid plates of Merian, Schreber, Curtis, Sowerby, Sotheby, &c. afford ample proofs of the industry and success with which this delightful field has been cultivated, and of the rich harvest that has been derived from the united efforts of so many men of genius and talents.\nNatural Philosophy, is commonly defined to be that branch of knowledge which considers the powers and properties of natural bodies, and their mutual actions on one another. The province of moral philosophy is the mind of man; its inquiries and researches are into the intellectual world. Natural philosophy, on the other hand, is only concerned with the material part of the creation. The Moralist's business is to inquire into the nature of virtue, the causes and effects of vice; to propose remedies for it, and to point out the mode of attaining happiness, which only can be the result of virtuous conduct. The Naturalist, on the contrary, has nothing to do with spirit; his business is solely about body or matter; and he ought to have a solid and accurate knowledge of all material substances, together with their affections and properties; and if possible, he is to investigate the reasons of such and such appearances.\u2014Indeed, the first and principal part of this science is, to collect all the manifest and sensible appearances of things, and reduce them into a body of natural history. Philosophy, it has often been said, and it is even now very generally thought, to mean an inquiry into all the causes of things; but experience informs us, that though we are acquainted with a good number of effects, we can trace but few of their causes; so that philosophy itself will really be found to be in general but a collection of facts. Still, however, it differs from natural history in its appropriated sense; the business of which is only to observe the appearances of natural bodies separately, and from these appearances to classify them with other bodies; natural philosophy goes farther, and recites the action of two or more bodies of the same or different kinds upon one another; and though it can neither investigate nor point out the causes of those effects, whatever they are, yet, from mathematical reasoning combined with experience, it can be demonstrated, that in such circumstances such effects must always take place. There are evidently two ways of making observations on the material world: the first is, when we view things nearly as they happen to occur, without any design or intervention of our own; in which way, indeed, no great improvements can be expected in the art, because chance having the direction, only exhibits occasional or temporary properties. The other method is, when, after a thorough acquaintance with bodies, we apply them to other bodies equally known, diligently attending to the result, and observing whether anything new arises. Such seems to be in general the nature of our article; nor is it our intention to be much more particular at present. We must therefore refer our readers reflectively to those parts of the subject, respecting which they wish for more satisfaction and minute details. The ancient and modern definitions of the word philosophy, together with its origin, as well as the manner of philosophizing in former times as well as at present, with the gradual improvement of science, particularly natural, we shall introduce, we think, more properly under the words Philosophy and Physics. We need only add under the present article, what however is well known, that natural philosophy was till lately divided only into four parts, commonly called the four branches, viz. 1. Mechanics; 2. Hydrostatics; 3. Optics; and 4. Astronomy; and these again are subdivided into various parts. Modern discoveries have added, however, two more parts to the number, viz. Magnetism and Electricity. It is remarkable, that in the English universities these two latter branches are never taken notice of in lecturing on natural philosophy, the old division being still retained, without any mention of these two important articles. The reason may be, that they are only subject to experiment, and not yet reduced to mathematical reasoning; which is the method of teaching philosophy in one of those celebrated seminaries. Of these branches of this extensive science, it is not our intention to take even a general view in this place. We must therefore refer our readers to each particular article, where they will find them treated at considerable length.","sp":257,"ep":263},{"h":"NATURALISATION","t":"in Law, the act of naturalizing an alien, or putting him into the condition of a natural born subject, and entitling him to the rights and privileges thereof.

Sometimes we confound that which a man has by nature with what accrues to him by birth; as when we say, that such a man is noble by nature. 4. Sometimes we take nature for an internal principle of motion; as when we say, that\na stone by nature falls to the earth. Sometimes we understand by nature, the established course of things.\n\n6.

It is not by any kind of accident that this meteor appears under these circumstances; on the contrary, it is the necessary result of the approximation of one vessel towards another, or towards the land. The existence of the meteor, and the knowledge of its different modifications, are what constitute the certainty and the precision of my informations.\n\n\"If I am asked, how it is possible that the approach of a ship towards land should give birth to any meteor whatsoever in the atmosphere, and what connexion there can be between two objects at such a distance from each other? I reply, that I am not obliged to give an account of the hows and the wherefores: that it is sufficient for me to have discovered the fact, without being obliged to account for its principle.\"\n\nThe writer concludes, by defining to be called on for experimental proofs, and by promising in future a complete treatise of Naucopy, with maps, plates, &c.","sp":371,"ep":371},{"h":"NAULUM","t":"in Roman antiquity, a piece of money put into the mouth of a person deceased to enable him to pay Charon the ferryman for his passage.

These mock sea fights are supposed to have originated at the time of the first Punic war, when the Romans first instructed their men in the knowledge of naval affairs. Afterwards they were intended to entertain the populace, as well as to improve the seamen. They were often, like other shows, exhibited at the expense of individuals, to increase their popularity.\nIn these spectacles they sometimes strove to excel each other in swiftness; and sometimes engaged in a warlike manner. The naumachiae of Claudius indeed was a most savage diversion. The combatants used to destroy each other to amuse a tyrant and a cruel mob. As they passed before him, they used this melancholy greeting, \"Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant.\" The emperor replied, \"Ave victor!\" This they understood as an answer of kindness, and a grant of their lives; but they soon discovered that it proceeded from wanton cruelty, and barbarous insensibility. In the time of the emperor Domitian, such a vast number of vessels engaged as would have nearly formed two regular fleets for a real fight, and the channel of water was equal in magnitude to a natural river. The emperor Heliogabalus is reported to have filled the channel where the vessels were to ride with wine instead of water. Tritons and sea monsters were frequently exhibited during the engagement. Suetonius and Dio Cassius inform us, that at one of these sea fights of Domitian a violent shower fell; the emperor, however, continued till the end of the engagement, often changing his clothes, nor would he suffer any one to depart; and as the rain continued for several hours, many were seized with distempers, and some even died, Suet. cap. 4.

When the Greeks Nauportus returned from the Trojan war, Nauplius was pleased to see them distressed in a storm on the coasts of Euboea; and to make their disaster still more universal, he lighted fires on such places as were surrounded with the most dangerous rocks, that the fleet might be shipwrecked upon the coast. This had the desired effect; but Nauplius was so disappointed when he saw Ulysses and Diomedes escape from the general distress, that he threw himself into the sea. According to some mythologists there were two persons of this name; one a native of Argos, who went to Colchis with Jason.

This was sometimes defended with towers, and beautified with gates, through which they issued forth to attack their enemies. Homer hath left us a remarkable description of the Grecian fortifications of this fort, in the Trojan war, beginning at ver. 436. Iliad 9.\n\nThen, to secure the naval camp and towers,\nThey rais'd embattled walls with lofty towers:\nFrom space to space were ample gates around,\nFor passing chariots; and a trench profound,\nOf large extent; and deep in earth below\nStrong piles infix'd flood adverse to the foe.\n\nPOPE'S Transl.\n\nTowards the sea, or within it, they fixed great pales of wood, like those in their artificial harbours: before these vessels of burden were placed in such order, as that they might be instead of a wall, and give protection to those within; in which manner Nicias is reported by Thucydides to have encamped himself: but this seems only to have been practised when the enemy was thought superior in strength, and raised great apprehensions of danger in them. When their fortifications were thought strong enough to defend them from the assaults of enemies, it was frequent to drag their ships to shore, which the Greeks called \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, the Romans salubducere.

It is bounded on the south and east by Arragon, on the north by the Pyrenees, and on the west by Old Castile and Bilcay; extending from south to north about 80 miles, and from east to west about 75. It abounds in sheep and cattle; game of all kinds, as boars, flags, and roebucks; and in wild fowl, horses, and honey; yielding also some grain, wine, oil, and a variety of minerals, medicinal waters, and hot baths. Some of the ancient chiefs of this country were called Sobrarbadores, from the custom, as it is supposed, which prevailed among some of those free nations, of choosing and swearing their\nNavarre, their princes under some particular tree. The name of the province is supposed to be a contraction of Nava Errea, signifying, in the language of the Vacones, its ancient inhabitants, \"a land of valleys.\" \u2014For the particulars of its history, see the article Spain.\n\nNavarre, Peter, an officer of eminence in the 16th century, and particularly celebrated for his dexterity in the directing and springing of mines. He was a native of Bilcay, and of low extraction. According to Paul Jove, who affirms that he had an account of the matter from his own mouth, he was first a sailor; but being disgusted with that employment, he fought his fortune in Italy, when poverty compelled him to become footman to the cardinal of Aragon. He afterwards enlisted himself a soldier in the Housline army; and having served there for some time, went to sea again, and distinguished himself by his courage. The reputation of his valour having reached the ears of Gonzalo de Cordova, the general employed him in the war against Naples, and raised him to the rank of a captain. Having contributed greatly to the taking of that city by very opportunely springing a mine, the emperor rewarded him for this signal service with the earldom of Alveto, situated in that kingdom, and gave him the title of Count of Navarre. Having the command of a naval expedition against the Moors in Africa, he was at first very successful, and took possession of Oran, Tripoli, and some other places; but being afterwards shipwrecked on the island of Gerbes, the great heats and the Moorish cavalry destroyed a part of his army. Our hero was equally unfortunate in Italy: He was made prisoner at the famous battle of Ravenna in 1512, and languished in France for the space of two years. When finding that the king of Spain, who had been prejudiced against him by his courtiers, would do nothing towards his ransom, he went into the service of Francis I, who gave him the command of 20 companies of infantry, consisting of Galcons, Biscayans, and the inhabitants of the Pyrenean mountains. He distinguished himself in several successful expeditions, until the year 1522, when having been sent to the relief of the Genoese, he was taken by the Imperialists. They conducted him to Naples, where he remained a prisoner for three years in the Castle del Ovo. From this confinement he was released by the treaty of Madrid, and afterwards fought at the siege of Naples under Lauric in 1528: but being again made prisoner at the unfortunate retreat from Averfa, he was conducted a second time to the Castle del Ovo. Here the prince of Orange, having, by order of the emperor, caused several persons of the Angevine faction to be beheaded, our hero would undoubtedly have suffered the same fate, if the governor, seeing his distressed situation, and feeling for the misfortunes of so great a man, had not saved him the shame of this last punishment by allowing him to die a natural death. Others pretend that he was strangled in his bed, having arrived at a very advanced age. Paul Jove and Philip Thomassin have written his life. This last informs us, that he was of a tall size, had a swarthy countenance, black eyes, beard, and hair. A duke of Sessa, in the last century, being desirous to honour his memory and that of the marshal de Lautree, caused a monument to be erected to each of them in the church of Saint-Marie-le-Neuve at Naples, where they had been interred without any funeral honours.\n\nNavarre, Martin, fumated Azpilcueta, because he was born in the kingdom which bears that name, successively professor of jurisprudence at Toulouse, Salamanca, and Coimbra, was consulted from all quarters as the oracle of law. For a part of his knowledge he was indebted to the schools of Cahors and Toulouse, in which he had studied. His friend Barthelemy Carrewza, a Dominican, and archbishop of Toledo, having been charged with heresy by the court of inquisition at Rome, Navarre set out at the age of 80 years to defend him. Pius V appointed him advisor to Cardinal Francis Alciat, vice-penitentiary. Gregory XIII never passed his gate without sending for him; and sometimes would converse with him for an hour together on the street: he even deigned to visit him, accompanied by several cardinals. These honours did not render him more haughty. His character became so eminent, that even in his own time the greatest encomium that could be paid to a man of learning was to say that he was a Navarre: this name thus included the idea of erudition, as that of Rocei formerly marked an accomplished comedian. Azpilcueta was the oracle of the city of Rome, and of the whole Christian world. For the influence which he had acquired, he was indebted not only to his knowledge, but also to his probity and virtue. Faithful to the duties which the church prescribed, his temperance and frugality preferred to him a vigorous constitution; and at a very advanced age his genius was equal to the fervent study. His savings enabled him to give liberal assistance to the poor. His charities, indeed, were so great, that his mule, it is said, would stop as soon as the perceived a beggar. He died at Rome in 1586, at the age of 92. His works were collected and printed in 6 vols. folio at Lyons in 1597, and at Venice in 1602. They display more learning than judgment, and are now very seldom consulted. Navarre was uncle by the mother's side to St Francis of Sales.

Now 161, and 116, half the second distance, are found to agree between 43 and 44 degrees; therefore, to latitude $43^\\circ$ and distance 161, the corresponding difference of latitude is $117'7'$; the excess of which above $116'$ is $1'7'$; and to latitude $44^\\circ$, and distance 161, the difference of latitude is $115'8'$; hence $117'7' - 115'8' = 1'9'$, the change answering to a difference of $1^\\circ$ of latitude.\n\nTherefore, $1'9 : 1'7 :: 1^\\circ : 53'$\n\nHence, the latitude is $43^\\circ 53'$.\n\nBy Gunter's Scale.\n\nThe extent from $180$ to $232$ on the line of numbers, being laid in the same direction on the line of lines, from $347$, the complement of the latitude sailed from, will reach to $46^\\circ 7'$, the complement of the latitude come to.\n\nChap.

Of Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nThe earth is a sphere, and the meridians meet at the poles; and since a rhumb-line makes equal angles with every meridian, the line a ship describes is, therefore, that kind of a curve called a spiral.\n\nLet AB (fig. 15.) be any given distance sailed upon an oblique rhumb, PBN, PAM the extreme meridians, MN a portion of the equator, and PCK, PEL two meridians intersecting the distance AB in the points CE infinitely near each other. If the arches BS, CD, and AR, be described parallel to the equator, it is hence evident, that AS is the difference of latitude, and the arch MN of the equator, the difference of longitude, answering to the given distance AB and course PAB.\n\nNow, since CE represents a very small portion of the distance AB, DE will be the corresponding portion of a meridian; hence the triangle EDC may be considered as rectilineal. If the distance be supposed to be divided into an infinite number of parts, each equal to CE, and upon these, triangles be constructed whose sides are portions of a meridian and parallel, it is evident these triangles will be equal and similar; for, besides the right angle, and hypotenuse which is the same in each, the course or angle CED is also the same. Hence, by the 12th of V. Euc. the sum of all the hypotenuses CE, or the distance AB, is to the sum of all the sides DE, or the difference of latitude AS, as one of the hypotenuses CE is to the corresponding side DE. Now, let the triangle GIH (fig. 16.) be constructed similar to the triangle CDE, having the angle G equal to the course: then as GH : GI :: CE : DC :: AB : AS.\n\nHence, if GH be made equal to the given distance AB, then GI will be the corresponding difference of latitude.\n\nIn like manner, the sum of all the hypotenuses CE, or the distance AB, is to the sum of all the sides CD, as CE is to CD, or as GH to HI, because of the similar triangles.\n\nThe several parts of the same rectilineal triangle will, therefore, represent the course, distance, difference of latitude, and departure.\n\nAlthough the parts HG, GI, and angle G of the rectilineal triangle GIH, are equal to the corresponding parts AB, AS, and angle A, of the triangle ASB upon the surface of the sphere; yet HI is not equal to BS, for HI is the sum of all the arcs CD; but CD is greater than OQ, and less than ZX; therefore HI is greater than BS, and less than AR. Hence the difference of longitude MN cannot be inferred from the departure reckoned either upon the parallel sailed from, or on that come to, but on some intermediate parallel.\nMiddle Latitude Sailing.","sp":281,"ep":284},{"h":"NAVIGATION","t":"Windward As radius - 10.00000\nSailing. is to the secant of FCE - 5\u00bd points 10.32661\nfo is CF - 9 miles 0.95424\n\nTo find CB, the distance on the larboard tack.\nAs to the fine of B - 4 points 9.84948\nis to the fine of E - 9 points 9.99157\nfo is the distance CE - 27 miles 1.43136\n\nto the distance BC - 37.45 1.57345\nTo find BE half the distance on the larboard tack.\nAs the fine of B - 4 points 9.84948\nis to the fine of C - 3 points 9.74474\nfo is the distance CE - 27 miles 1.43136\n\nto the distance BE - 21.21 1.32662\n\nWhole distance AC - 42.42\n\nEx. 6.

X. Of Current Sailing.\n\nThe computations in the preceding chapters have been performed upon the assumption that the water has no motion. This may no doubt answer tolerably well in those places where the ebbsings and flowings are regular, as then the effect of the tide will be nearly counterbalanced. But in places where there is a constant current or setting of the sea towards the same point, an allowance for the change of the ship's place arising therefrom must be made: And the method of resolving these problems, in which the effect of a current, or heave of the sea, is taken into consideration, is called current sailing.\n\nIn a calm, it is evident a ship will be carried in the direction and with the velocity of the current. Hence, if a ship sails in the direction of the current, her rate will be augmented by the rate of the current; but if sailing directly against it, the distance made good will be equal to the difference between the ship's rate as given by the log and that of the current. And the absolute motion of the ship will be a-head, if her rate exceeds that of the current; but if less, the ship will make sternway. If the ship's course be oblique to the current, the distance made good in a given time will be represented by the third side of a triangle, whereof the distance given by the log, and the drift of the current in the same time, are the other sides; and the true course will be the angle contained between the meridian and the line actually described by the ship.\n\nEx.\nEx. 1. A ship sailed NNE at the rate of 8 knots an hour, during 18 hours, in a current setting NWbW 2\u00bd miles an hour. Required the course and distance made good?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nDraw the NNE line CA (fig. 45) equal to 18 \u00d7 8 = 144 miles; and from A draw AB parallel to the NWbW rhumb, and equal to 18 \u00d7 2\u00bd = 45 miles: now BC being joined will be the distance, and NC the course. The first of these will measure 159 miles, and the second 6\u00b0 23'.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nIn the triangle ACB, given AC = 144 miles, AB = 45 miles, and the angle CAB = 9 points, to find BAC and BC.\n\nTo find the course made good.\n\n| Dist.

A ship from a port in latitude 42\u00b0 52' N, sailed SbWbW 17 miles in 7 hours, in a current setting between the north and west; and then the same port bore ENE, and the ship's latitude by observation was 42\u00b0 42' N. Required the setting and drift of the current?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nDraw the SbWbW line CA (fig. 46) equal to 17 miles, and make CB equal to 10 miles, the difference of latitude: through B draw the parallel of latitude BD, and draw the WSW line CD, intersecting BD in D: AD being joined, will represent the drift of the current, which applied to the scale will measure 20.2, and the angle DAE will be its setting, and will be found equal to 72\u00b0.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nIn the triangle CBD, given CB = 10 miles, and the angle BCD = 6 points; to find the distance CD.\n\nAs radius = 10.00000\nis to the secant of BCD = 6 points = 10.41710\nso is the diff. of lat. CB = 10 miles = 1.00000\n\nto the distance CD = 26.13 = 1.41710\n\nAgain, in the triangle ACD are given the distance AC = 17 miles, CD = 26.13, and the angle ACD 4\u00bd points; to find the remaining parts.\n\nTo find the setting of the current.\n\nDistance DC = 26.13 Angle ACD = 4\u00bd points.\nDistance AC = 17.0 CAD + CDA 11\u00bd\n\nSum - 43.13 CAD + CDA = 5\u00bd = 64\u00b0 41'\n\nDifference - 9.13 As the sum of the sides - 43.13 = 1.63478\nis to the differ. of the sides - 9.13 = 0.96047\nso is tan. half sum angles - 64\u00b0 41' = 10.32599\n\nto tan. half diff. angles - 24 6 = 9.65078\n\nAngle CAD = 88\u00b0 47'\nAngle CAE = ACB = 1\u00bd pt. = 16\u00b0 52'\n\nSetting of the current EAD = 71\u00b0 55'\n\nTo find the drift of the current.\n\nAs the fine of CAD = 88\u00b0 47' = 9.99999\nis to the fine of ACD = 4\u00bd points = 9.88819\nso is the distance CD = 26.13 = 1.41710\n\nto the drift of current AD = 20.2 = 1.30539\n\nHence the hourly rate of the current is 20.2 = 2.9 knots.\n\nEx. 3. A ship, from latitude 38\u00b0 20' N, sailed 24 hours in a current setting NWbN, and by account is in latitude 38\u00b0 42' N, having made 44 miles of sailing; but the latitude by observation is 38\u00b0 53' N. Required the course and distance made good, and the drift of the current.\n\nBy Construction.\n\nMake CE (fig. 47) equal to 22 miles, the difference of latitude by DR, and EA = 54 miles, the departure, and join CA; make CD = 38 miles, the difference of latitude by observation; draw the parallel of latitude DB, and from A draw the NWbN line AB, intersecting DB in B, and AB will be the drift of the current in 24 hours: CB being joined, will be the distance made good, and the angle DCB the true course. Now, AB and CB applied to the scale, will measure 19.2 and 50.5 respectively; and the angle DCB will be 41\u00b0 4'.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nFrom B draw BF perpendicular to AE, then in the triangle AFB are given BF = 16 miles, and the angle ABF = 3 points; to find AB and AF.\n\nTo find the drift of the current AB.\n\nAs radius = 10.00000\nis to the secant of ABF = 3 points = 10.68015\nso is BF = 16 miles = 1.20412\n\nto the drift of the current AB = 19.24 = 1.28427\n\nHence the hourly rate = 19.24 = 0.8.\n\nTo find AF.\n\nAs radius = 10.00000\nis to the tangent of ABF = 3 points = 9.82489\nso is BF = 16 points = 1.20412\n\nto AF = 10.69 = 1.02901\n\nDeparture by account EA = 44\n\nTrue departure EF = DB = 33.31\n\nNow,\nNow, in the triangle CDB are given the difference of latitude and departure; to find the course and distance.\n\nTo find the course.\n\nAs the difference of latitude CD = 38\u00b0 - 1.57978\nis to the departure DB = 33\u00b031' - 1.52257\nso is radius = 10.00000\n\nTo the tangent of the course = 41\u00b014' - 9.94279\n\nTo find the distance.\n\nAs radius = 10.00000\nis to the secant of the course = 41\u00b014' - 10.12376\nso is the difference of latitude = 38\u00b0 - 1.57978\n\nTo the distance = 5\u00b053' - 1.70354\n\nEx. 4. In the Straits of Sunda, at 2 P.M. steering SEbS at the rate of 5 knots an hour, I passed close by the small islands off Hog point. At 6, not having changed our course, came to anchor on the Java shore. Upon setting the said island from this anchoring place, I find it bears due north, its distance by the chart being 22 miles. It follows from hence, that our course has been affected by a current. Required its velocity and direction?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nFrom A (fig. 48), draw the SEbS line AB = 20, which will represent the ship's apparent track through the water; draw AC equal to 22 miles south, and C will be the ship's real place; and BC being joined will be the current's drift in four hours; which applied to the scale will measure 12.3; from A draw AD parallel to BC, and the angle CAD will be the direction of the current, and will be found to measure 64\u00b03'.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nIn the triangle ABC, given AB = 20 m.

XI. Instruments proposed to solve the various Problems in Sailing, independent of Calculation.\n\nVarious methods, beside those already given, have been proposed to save the trouble of calculation.\u2014One of these methods is by means of an instrument composed of rulers, so disposed as to form a right-angled triangle, having numbers in a regular progression marked on their sides. These instruments are made of different materials, such as paper, wood, brafs, &c. and are differently constructed, according to the fancy of the inventor. Among instruments of this kind, that by John Cooke, Esq. seems to be the best. A number of other instruments, very differently constructed, have been proposed for the same purpose; of these, however, we shall only take notice of the rectangular instrument, by A. Mackay, LL.D. F.R.S.E., &c.\n\nI. Of Cooke's Triangular Instrument.\n\nDescription. The stock abcd (fig. 50.) is a parallelopiped: The length from a to b is two feet, the breadth from a to d two inches, and the depth is one inch and a half. The stock is perforated longitudinally, so as to be capable of containing within it ef, a cylindrical piece of wood one inch diameter; gh is an aperture on the surface of the stock about a quarter of an inch wide, which discloses one twelfth part of the surface of the cylinder contained; the edge dc is divided into twelve parts, each of these is subdivided into six parts, and each of these again into ten parts. The surface of the cylinder is divided longitudinally into twelve parts, and on each of them is engraved a portion...\nPractice.\n\nPortion of a line of meridional parts 22 feet long, which contains the meridional parts for every minute from the equator as far towards the pole as navigation is practicable; and the smallest division on it is not less than \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) th of an inch. By rolling and sliding this cylinder, any part of any line on it may be brought into any position which may be required: the box \\( i \\) is engraved into the edge of the stock \\( a b \\), so that it may move freely from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\); a limb from this box extends to \\( k \\), which serves to mark that degree of the perpendicular \\( i l \\) which is parallel to the centre of the semicircle \\( m \\); \\( i l \\) is two feet long, and graduated on both edges as the stock; it is perpendicular to the stock, and is fixed in the box \\( i \\), by which it may be moved from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\); \\( o p n \\) is a semicircle of five inches radius, engraved, as appears in the plate, which slides freely from \\( c \\) to \\( d \\) in a groove in the edge of the stock \\( c d \\); \\( m q \\) is the index moving on the centre \\( m \\), the edge of which marks the course on the semicircle; it is two feet long, and divided into 72 parts; and these are subdivided in the same manner as those on the stock and perpendicular, to which they are equal; \\( r \\) is a vernier attached to the index to show minutes; \\( s \\) is a vernier composed of concentric semicircles, which slides along the edge \\( q m \\), to the intersection of the perpendicular and index, where it serves as a vernier to both; below \\( s \\) is a small piece of ivory, with a mark on it to point out the degree of the line \\( d c \\), which is perpendicularly under the centre of the semicircle. Fig. 51, is a view of the back part of the instrument.\n\nUse. The method of working every case which occurs in navigation, is to make the instrument similar to that ideal triangle which is composed of the difference of latitude, departure, and distance; or, to that composed of the meridional difference of latitude, difference of longitude, and enlarged distance; or, to that composed of the difference of longitude, departure, and fine of the middle latitude; which is done by means of the data procured from the compass, log-line, and quadrant: whence it follows, from the nature of similar triangles, or from the relation which exists between the sides of triangles and the fines of their opposite angles, that the parts of the instrument become proportional to those which they represent; and will ascertain the length of the lines, or the extent of the angles sought, by its graduations.\n\nIn the practice of this instrument, a small square is necessary in order to bring the centre of the semicircle perpendicularly over the meridional degree corresponding to the latitude.\n\nPlane Sailing.\n\nProb. I. The course and distance failed being given, to find the difference of latitude and departure.\n\nExample. A ship from latitude \\( 24^\\circ 18' \\) N., sailed NW by N. 168 miles. Required the latitude come to, and departure?\n\nSet the centre of the semicircle perpendicularly over the given latitude \\( 24^\\circ 18' \\), and the index to the course 3 points; move the perpendicular until it cut the index at the given distance 168; then at the point of intersection on the perpendicular is 93.3 miles, the departure, and on the base, by the edge of the box, is \\( 26^\\circ 38' \\), the latitude come to.\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\n\nProb. II. Both latitudes and course given, to find instruments the distance and departure.\n\nExample. Let the latitude failed from be \\( 43^\\circ 50' \\) N., that come to \\( 47^\\circ 8' \\) N., and the course NNE. Required the distance and departure?\n\nMove the centre of the semicircle to the latitude left \\( 43^\\circ 50' \\), and the edge of the box to the latitude come to \\( 47^\\circ 8' \\); fix the index at the given course 2 points; then at the point of intersection of the index and perpendicular is the distance 214 miles on the index, and the departure 82 miles on the perpendicular.\n\nProb. III. Given the course and departure, to find the distance and difference of latitude.\n\nExample. Let the latitude failed from be \\( 32^\\circ 38' \\) N., the course SW by S., and the departure 200 miles. Required the distance and latitude come to?\n\nMove the centre of the semicircle to the latitude left \\( 32^\\circ 38' \\), let the index to the given course 3 points, and move the perpendicular till the given departure 200 cuts the index; at this point on the index is 360 miles, and the edge of the box will cut the latitude come to \\( 27^\\circ 39' \\) N.\n\nProb. IV. Given the difference of latitude and distance, to find the course and departure.\n\nExample. Let the latitude left be \\( 17^\\circ 10' \\) N., the latitude come to \\( 21^\\circ 40' \\) N., and the distance failed on a direct course between the north and west 300 miles. Required the course and departure?\n\nMove the semicircle and box to the given latitudes, and the index until the distance found thereon meets the perpendicular; then at the point of contact on the perpendicular is 130.8, the departure, and on the semicircle by the index is \\( 25^\\circ 50' \\), the course.\n\nProb. V. The distance and departure given, to find the course and difference of latitude.\n\nExample. The distance failed is 246 miles between the south and east, the departure is 138 miles, and the latitude left \\( 51^\\circ 10' \\) N. Required the course and latitude come to?\n\nSet the centre of the semicircle to \\( 51^\\circ 10' \\), the latitude failed from; find the distance 246 on the index, and the departure 138 on the perpendicular; then move both till their points meet, and the course \\( 34^\\circ 10' \\) will be found on the semicircle by the index, and the latitude in \\( 47^\\circ 47' \\) N., by the edge of the box.\n\nProb. VI. Both latitudes and departure given, to find the course and distance.\n\nExample. A ship from latitude \\( 43^\\circ 10' \\) N., failed between the north and west till she is in latitude \\( 47^\\circ 14' \\) N., and has made 170 miles of departure. Required the course and distance?\n\nMove the centre of the semicircle over \\( 43^\\circ 10' \\), and the edge of the box to \\( 47^\\circ 14' \\); find the departure on the perpendicular, and bring the edge of the index thereto; now at the point of intersection is the distance 207.4 miles on the index, and the course \\( 34^\\circ 52' \\) on the semicircle.\n\nTraverse Sailing.\n\nExample. A ship from latitude \\( 46^\\circ 48' \\) N., failed SSW by W. 24 miles, SW by W. 36 miles, and SSE by E. 40 miles.\nRequired the latitude in, together with the direct course and distance?\n\nSet the semicircle to the latitude sailed from $46^\\circ 48'$, and the index to the course SSW $\\frac{3}{2}$ W; mark the distance 24 on the index, and bring the perpendicular to meet it; then the index will cut the departure 11.3 on the perpendicular, and the perpendicular will cut the latitude $46^\\circ 27'$ N on the base. For the next course and distance, bring the semicircle to the latitude marked by the perpendicular, and lay down the course SSW; if it be towards the first meridian, move the last marked departure until it meets the index, and the limb of the box will mark the present departure; but if the course be from the first meridian, bring the last departure 11.3 to the limb of the box, the index will mark the departure made good 18.3 on the perpendicular, and the latitude arrived at $45^\\circ 52'$ will be marked on the base by the perpendicular: proceed in the same manner with all the courses of which the traverse consists, then the difference of latitude $1^\\circ 36'$ will be intercepted between the latitude sailed from $46^\\circ 48'$, and the latitude come to $45^\\circ 12'$ last marked by the perpendicular; and also the departure made good will be intercepted between that point on the perpendicular where the first departure commenced, and that where the last terminated. Now, with the difference of latitude $1^\\circ 36'$ and the departure, the course will be S $8^\\circ 30'$ W, and distance 97 miles, by last problem in Plane Sailing.\n\nParallel Sailing.\n\nProb. I. The difference of longitude between two places in one parallel of latitude given, to find the distance between them.\n\nExample. Let the common latitude be $49^\\circ 30'$ N, and the difference of longitude $3^\\circ 30'$. Required the distance?\n\nSet the index to $49^\\circ 30'$, the complement of the latitude on the semicircle; mark the difference of longitude in miles on the index; then move the perpendicular until it meets the termination of the difference of longitude on the index, and the part of the perpendicular intercepted between the limb of the box and the point of intersection will be the distance 136.4 miles.\n\nProb.

Of Dr. Mackay's Rectangular Instrument.\n\nDescription. Fig. 52. is a representation of this instrument, of about one-third of the original size.\u2014The length CA is divided into 100 equal parts, and the breadth CB into 70; but in this plate every second division only is marked, in order to avoid confusion; through these divisions parallels are drawn, terminating at the opposite sides of the instrument. Upon the upper and right hand sides are two scales; the first contains the degrees of the quadrant, and the other the points and quarters of the compasses. M is an index moveable about the centre C, and divided in the same manner as the sides (1). Fig. 53. is a portion of the enlarged meridian, so constructed that the first degree is equal to three divisions on the instrument; and therefore, in the use of this line, each division on the instrument is to be accounted 20 minutes. The size of the plate would not admit of the continuation of the line.\n\nUse. From a bare inspection of this instrument, it is evident that any triangle whatever may be formed on it. In applying it to nautical problems, the course is to be found at top, or right-hand side, in the column of degrees or points, according as it is expressed; the distance is to be found on the index, the difference of latitude at either side column, and the departure at the head or foot of the instrument. The numbers in these columns may represent miles, leagues, &c.; but when used in conjunction with the enlarged meridional line, then 10 is to be accounted 100 miles, 20 is to be effected 200 miles, and so on, each number being increased in a tenfold ratio; and the intermediate numbers are to be reckoned accordingly.\n\nPlane Sailing.\n\nProb. I. The course and distance sailed given, to find the difference of latitude and departure.\n\nExample. Let the course be NE; N, distance 44 miles. Required the difference of latitude and departure?\n\nMove the index until the graduated edge be over $3\\frac{1}{2}$ points, and find the given distance 44 miles on the index; this distance will be found to cut the parallel of 34 miles, the difference of latitude in the side column, and that of 28 miles, the departure at the top.\n\nProb. II. Given the course and difference of latitude, to find the distance and departure.\n\nExample. Required the distance and departure answering to the course $28^\\circ$, and difference of latitude 60 miles?\n\nLay the index over the given course $28^\\circ$; find the difference of latitude 60 miles in the side column; its parallel will cut the index at 68 miles, the distance and the corresponding departure at the top is 32 miles.\n\nProb. III. The course and departure given, to find the distance and difference of latitude.\n\nExample. Let the course be SSW and the departure 36 miles. Required the distance and difference of latitude?\n\nLay the index over two points; find the departure at the top, and its parallel will cut the index at 94 miles the distance, and the difference of latitude on the side column is 87 miles.\n\nProb. IV. Given the distance and difference of latitude, to find the course and departure.\n\nExample. The distance is 35 leagues, and the difference of latitude 30 leagues. Required the course and departure?\n\nBring 35 leagues on the index to the parallel of 30 leagues in the side; then the departure at the top is 18 leagues, and the course by the edge of the index on the line of rhumbs is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ points.\n\nProb. V. Given the distance and departure, to find the course and difference of latitude.\n\nExample. Let the distance be 58 miles, and the de-\n\n(1) In the original instrument are two slips, divided like the side and end of the instrument. One of these slips is moveable in a direction parallel to the side of the instrument, and the other parallel to the end.\nPractice.\n\nInstruments parture 15 miles. Required the course and difference of latitude?\n\nMove the index until 38 found thereon cuts the parallel of 15 from the top: this will be found to intersect the parallel of 56 miles, the difference of latitude; and the course by the edge of the ruler is 15\u00b0.\n\nProb. VI. The difference of latitude and departure being given, to find the course and distance.\n\nExample. Let the difference of latitude be 30 miles, the departure 28 miles. Required the course and distance.\n\nBring the index to the intersection of the parallels of 30 and 28; then the distance on the index is 41 miles, and the course by its edge is 43\u00b0.\n\nTraverse Sailing.\n\nFind the difference of latitude and departure answering to each course and distance by Problem I. of Plane Sailing, and from thence find the difference of latitude and departure made good; with which find the course and distance by the last problem.\n\nAn example is unnecessary.\n\nParallel Sailing.\n\nProb. I. Given the difference of longitude between two places on the same parallel, to find the distance between them.\n\nExample. Let the latitude of a parallel be 48\u00b0, and the difference of longitude between two places on it 3\u00b0 40\u2032. Required their distance?\n\nPut the index to 48\u00b0, the given latitude, and find the difference of longitude 22\u00b0 on the index, and the corresponding parallel from the side will be 147, the distance required.\n\nProb. II. The latitude of a parallel, and the distance between two places on that parallel, being given, to find the difference of longitude between them.\n\nExample. The latitude of a parallel is 56\u00b0, and the distance between two places on it 200 miles. Required their difference of longitude?\n\nPut the index to the given latitude, and find the distance in the side column, and the intersection of its parallel with the index will give 358, the difference of longitude sought.\n\nProb. III. Given the distance and difference of longitude between two places on the same parallel, to find the latitude of that parallel.\n\nExample. The number of miles in a degree of longitude is 46.5. Required the latitude of the parallel?\n\nBring 60 on the index to cut the parallel of 46.5 from the side, then the edge of the index will give 39\u00b0 17\u2032, the latitude required.\n\nMiddle Latitude and Mercator's Sailing.\n\nProb. I. The latitudes and longitudes of two places being given, to find the course and distance between them.\n\nExample. Required the course and distance between Genoa, in latitude 44\u00b0 25\u2032 N, longitude 8\u00b0 36\u2032 E, and Palermo, in latitude 38\u00b0 10\u2032 N, longitude 13\u00b0 38\u2032 E?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nTake the interval between 38\u00b0 10\u2032 and 44\u00b0 25\u2032 on the enlarged meridian, which laid off from C upwards will reach to 500; now find the difference of longitude 302 at the top, and bring the divided edge of the index to the intersection of the corresponding parallels, without the index will show the course 31\u00b0 8\u2032 on the line of degrees; then find the difference of the latitude 375 on the side column, and its parallel will intersect the index at 438, the distance.\n\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nPut the index to 41\u00b0 18\u2032, the complement of the middle latitude on degrees, and the difference of longitude 302 on the index will intersect the parallel of 227, the departure, in the side column. Now move the index to the intersection of the parallels of 375 and 227, the first being found in the side column, and the other at top or bottom; then the distance answering thereto on the index will be 438, and the course on the scale of degrees is 41\u00b0 10\u2032.\n\nProb. II. Given one latitude, course, and distance, to find the other latitude and difference of longitude.\n\nExample. Let the latitude and longitude sailed from be 39\u00b0 22\u2032 N, and 12\u00b0 8\u2032 W respectively, the course NNW \u00bd W, and distance 500 miles. Required the latitude and longitude come to?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nPut the index to the course 2\u00bd points, and find the distance 500 miles thereon; then the corresponding difference of latitude will be 44\u00b0 1 miles, and the departure 23\u00bd miles, hence the latitude is in 46\u00b0 43\u2032 N. Now take the interval between the latitudes of 39\u00b0 22\u2032 and 46\u00b0 43\u2032 on the enlarged meridian, which laid off from C will reach to about 605, the parallel of which will intersect the vertical parallel of the difference of longitude 323 at the edge of the index: hence the longitude is 17\u00b0 31\u2032 W.\n\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nFind the difference of latitude and departure as before, and hence the latitude in is 46\u00b0 43\u2032 N, and the middle latitude 43\u00b0 3\u2032. Now put the index to 43\u00b0 3\u2032, and the horizontal parallel of the departure 23\u00bd will intersect the index at 322, the difference of longitude.\n\nProb. III. Both latitudes and course given, to find the distance and difference of longitude.\n\nExample. The latitude sailed from is 22\u00b0 54\u2032 S, and longitude 42\u00b0 40\u2032 W, the course is SE by E, and latitude come to 26\u00b0 8\u2032 S. Required the distance sailed; and longitude in?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nBring the index to 5 points, the given course, and the parallel of 194, the difference of latitude found in the side column will intersect the index at 349, the distance; and it will cut the vertical parallel of 290, the departure.\n\nTake the interval between the given latitudes 22\u00b0 54\u2032 and 26\u00b0 8\u2032 on the enlarged meridian; lay off that extent from the centre on the side column, and it will reach to 213: the parallel of this number will intersect the vertical parallel of 319, the difference of longitude. Hence the longitude in is 37\u00b0 21\u2032 W.\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nWith the given course and difference of latitude find the distance and departure as before; then bring the index to the middle latitude 24\u00b0 31\u2032; find the departure 290 in the side column, and its parallel will intersect the index at 319, the difference of longitude.\n\nProb. IV. One latitude, course, and departure, given, to find the other latitude, distance, and difference of longitude.\n\nExample. The latitude and longitude left are 20\u00b0 30\u2032 N. and 49\u00b0 17\u2032 W, respectively; the course is NE 3 N, and departure 212 miles. Required the latitude and longitude come to, and distance failed?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nPut the index to the given course 33\u00bd points, and the vertical parallel of 212 will cut the index at 356, the distance, and the horizontal parallel of 286, the difference of latitude; the latitude come to is therefore 25\u00b0 16\u2032 N.\n\nNow take the interval between the latitudes 20\u00b0 30\u2032, and 25\u00b0 16\u2032 on the enlarged meridian, which laid off from the centre C will reach to 311; and this parallel will intersect the vertical parallel of the difference of longitude 230, at the edge of the index. Hence the longitude in is 45\u00b0 27\u2032 W.\n\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nFind the distance and difference of latitude as directed above; then bring the index to 22\u00b0 53\u2032, the middle latitude, and the horizontal parallel of 212, the departure, will intersect the index at 230, the difference of longitude.\n\nProb. V. Both latitudes and distance given, to find the course and difference of longitude.\n\nExample. The distance failed is 500 miles between the north and west; the latitude and longitude left are 40\u00b0 10\u2032 N, and 9\u00b0 20\u2032 W respectively, and the latitude in is 46\u00b0 40\u2032 N. Required the course and longitude in?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nBring the distance 500 on the index to intersect the horizontal parallel of the difference of latitude 390; then the course 38\u00b0 44\u2032 is found on the line of degrees by the edge of the index, and the vertical parallel of the above point of intersection is that answering to 313, the departure.\n\nTake the interval between the latitudes 40\u00b0 10\u2032, and 46\u00b0 40\u2032, which lay off from the centre C, and its horizontal parallel will intersect the vertical parallel of 431, the difference of longitude, by the edge of the index, it being in the same position as before. Hence the longitude in is 16\u00b0 31\u2032 W.\n\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nThe course and departure are found as formerly, and the middle latitude is 43\u00b0 25\u2032, to which bring the edge of the index, and the horizontal parallel of 313, the departure, will intersect the index at 431 the difference of longitude.\n\nProb. VI. Both latitudes and departure given, to find the course, distance, and difference of longitude.\n\nExample. Let the latitude sailed from be 42\u00b0 52\u2032 N, long. 9\u00b0 17\u2032 W, the departure 250 miles W, and the Sea-Charts latitude come to 35\u00b0 18\u2032 N. Required the course and distance failed, and the longitude come to?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nFind the point of intersection of the horizontal parallel of 394, the difference of latitude, and the vertical parallel of 250, the departure; to this point bring the index, and the corresponding division thereon will be 467 miles, and the course on the scale of degrees by the edge of the index will be 32\u00b0 24\u2032.\n\nTake the interval between the latitudes on the enlarged meridian; which being laid off from the centre will reach to 512; now the horizontal parallel of 512 will cut the vertical parallel of 325, the difference of longitude, at the edge of the index. The longitude come to is therefore 14\u00b0 42\u2032 W.\n\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nThe course and distance are to be found in the same manner as above. Then bring the index to 39\u00b0 35\u2032, the middle latitude, and the horizontal parallel of 250 will intersect the edge of the index at 324\u00bd, the difference of longitude.\n\nProb. VII. Given one latitude, distance, and departure, to find the other latitude, course, and difference of longitude.\n\nExample. A ship from latitude 32\u00b0 38\u2032 N, longitude 17\u00b0 6\u2032 W, sailed 586 miles between the south and west, and made 336 miles of departure:\u2014Required the course, and the latitude and longitude come to?\n\nBy Mercator's Sailing.\n\nMove the index till the distance 586 intersects the vertical parallel of the departure 336; then the corresponding horizontal parallel will be 480, the difference of latitude, and the course 33\u00b0. Hence the latitude in is 24\u00b0 38\u2032 N.\n\nNow take the interval between the latitudes on the enlarged meridian, which laid off from the centre will reach to 547, the horizontal parallel of which will cut the vertical parallel of 383, the difference of longitude. The longitude in is therefore 23\u00b0 26\u2032 W.\n\nBy Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\nFind the course and difference of latitude as before, and hence the middle latitude is 28\u00b0 38\u2032, to which bring the index, and the horizontal parallel of 336, the departure, will intersect the index at 383, the difference of longitude.\n\nIt seems unnecessary to enlarge any further on the use of this instrument, as the above will make it sufficiently understood.\n\nChap. XII. Of Sea-Charts.\n\nThe charts usually employed in the practice of navigation, are of two kinds, namely, Plane and Mercator's Charts. The first of these is adapted to represent a portion of the earth's surface near the equator; and the last for all portions of the earth's surface. For a particular description of these, reference has already been made from the article Chart, to those of Plane and Mercator; and as these charts are particularly described under the above articles, it is therefore sufficient in this place to describe their use.\nUse of the Plane Chart.\n\nProb. I. To find the latitude of a place on the chart.\n\nRule. Take the least distance between the given place and the nearest parallel of latitude; now this distance applied the same way on the graduated meridian, from the extremity of the parallel, will give the latitude of the proposed place.\n\nThus the distance between Bonavista and the parallel of 15 degrees, being laid from that parallel upon the graduated meridian, will reach to $16^\\circ 5'$, the latitude required.\n\nProb. II. To find the course and distance between two given places on the chart.\n\nRule. Lay a ruler over the given places, and take the nearest distance between the centre of any of the compasses on the chart and the edge of the ruler; move this extent along, so as one point of the compass may touch the edge of the rule, and the straight line joining their points may be perpendicular thereto; then will the other point show the course: The interval between the places, being applied to the scale, will give the required distance.\n\nThus the course from Palma to St Vincent will be found to be about SSW $\\frac{3}{4}$ W, and the distance $13^\\circ \\frac{1}{4}$ or 795 m.\n\nProb. III. The course and distance failed from a known place being given, to find the ship's place on the chart.\n\nRule. Lay a ruler over the place failed from, parallel to the rhumb, expressing the given course; take the distance from the scale, and lay it off from the given place by the edge of the ruler; and it will give the point representing the ship's present place.\n\nThus, suppose a ship had sailed SWW $160$ miles from Cape Palmas; then by proceeding as above, it will be found that she is in latitude $2^\\circ 57'$ N.\n\nThe various other problems that may be resolved by means of this chart require no further explanation, being only the construction of the remaining problems in Plane Sailing on the chart.\n\nUse of Mercator's Chart.\n\nThe method of finding the latitude and longitude of a place, and the course or bearing between two given places by this chart, is performed exactly in the manner as in the Plane Chart, which see.\n\nProb. I. To find the distance between two given places on the chart.\n\nCase I. When the given places are under the same meridian.\n\nRule. The difference or sum of their latitudes, according as they are on the same or on opposite sides of the equator, will be the distance required.\n\nCase II. When the given places are under the same parallel.\n\nRule. If that parallel be the equator, the difference or sum of their longitudes is the distance; otherwise, take half the interval between the places, lay it off upwards and downwards on the meridian from the given parallel, and the intercepted degrees will be the distance between the places.\n\nOr, take an equal extent of a few degrees from the meridian on each side of the parallel, and the number of extents, and parts of an extent, contained between the places, being multiplied by the length of an extent, will give the required distance.\n\nCase III. When the given places differ both in latitude and longitude.\n\nRule. Find the difference of latitude between the given places, and take it from the equator or graduated parallel; then lay a ruler over the two places, and move one point of the compass along the edge of the ruler until the other point just touches a parallel; then the distance between the place where the point of the compass rests by the edge of the ruler, and the point of intersection of the ruler and parallel, being applied to the equator, will give the distance between the places in degrees and parts of a degree, which multiplied by 60 will reduce it to miles.\n\nProb. II. Given the latitude and longitude in, to find the ship's place on the chart.\n\nRule. Lay a ruler over the given latitude, and lay off the given longitude from the first meridian by the edge of the ruler, and the ship's present place will be obtained.\n\nProb. III. Given the course sailed from a known place, and the latitude in, to find the ship's present place on the chart.\n\nRule. Lay a ruler over the place sailed from, in the direction of the given course, and its intersection with the parallel of latitude arrived at will be the ship's present place.\n\nProb. IV. Given the latitude of the place left and the course and distance failed, to find the ship's present place on the chart.\n\nRule. The ruler being laid over the place sailed from, and in the direction of the given course, take the distance failed from the equator, put one point of the compass at the intersection of any parallel with the ruler, and the other point of the compass will reach to a certain place by the edge of the ruler. Now this point remaining in the same position, draw in the other point of the compass until it just touch the above parallel when swept round: apply this extent to the equator, and it will give the difference of latitude. Hence the latitude in will be known, and the intersection of the corresponding parallel with the edge of the ruler will be the ship's present place.\n\nThe other problems of Mercator's Sailing may be very easily resolved by this chart; but as they are of less use than those given, they are, therefore, omitted, and may serve as an exercise to the student.","sp":299,"ep":309},{"h":"NAVIGATION","t":"Method of finding the Latitude and Longitude at Sea.\n\nPlate CCCLXVII Fig. 54.\n\nA quadrant of the common construction, of which the following are the principal parts:\n\n1. ABC, the frame of the quadrant.\n2. BC, the arch or limb.\n3. D, the index; ab, the subdividing scale.\n4. E, the index-glass.\n5. F, the fore horizon glass.\n6. G, the back horizon-glass.\n7. K, the coloured or dark glasses.\n8. HI, the vanes or sights.\n\nOf the Frame of the Quadrant.\n\nThe frame of the quadrant consists of an arch BC, firmly attached to the two radii AB, AC, which are bound together by the braces LM, in order to strengthen it, and prevent it from warping.\n\nOf the Index D.\n\nThe index is a flat bar of brass, and turns on the centre of the octant: at the lower end of the index there is an oblong opening; to one side of this opening the vernier scale is fixed, to subdivide the divisions of the arch; at the end of the index there is a piece of brass, which bends under the arch, carrying a spring to make the subdividing scale lie close to the divisions. It is also furnished with a screw to fix the index in any desired position. The best instruments have an adjusting screw fitted to the index, that it may be moved more slowly, and with greater regularity and accuracy, than by the hand. It is proper, however, to observe, that the index must be previously fixed near its right position by the above-mentioned screw.\n\nOf the Index Glass E.\n\nUpon the index, and near its axis of motion, is fixed a plane speculum, or mirror of glass quicksilvered. It is let in a brass frame, and is placed so that its face is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. This mirror being fixed to the index moves along with it, and has its direction changed by the motion thereof; and the intention of this glass is to receive the image of the sun, or any other object, and reflect it upon either of the two horizon-glasses, according to the nature of the observation.\n\nThe brass frame with the glass is fixed to the index by the screw e; the other screw serves to re-place it in a perpendicular position, if by any accident it has been deranged.\n\nOf the Horizon Glasses F, G.\n\nOn the radius AB of the octant are two small speculums: the surface of the upper one is parallel to the index glass, and that of the lower one perpendicular thereto, when o on the index coincides with o on the limb. These mirrors receive the reflected rays, and transmit them to the observer.\n\nThe horizon-glasses are not entirely quicksilvered; the upper one F is only silvered on its lower half, or that next the plane of the quadrant, the other half being left transparent, and the back part of the frame cut away, that nothing may impede the sight through the unilvered part of the glass. The edge of the foil of this glass is nearly parallel to the plane of the instrument, and ought to be very sharp, and without a flaw. The other horizon glass is silvered at both ends. In the middle there is a transparent slit, through which the horizon may be seen.\n\nEach of these glasses is set in a brass frame, to which there is an axis passing through the wood work, and is fitted to a lever on the under side of the quadrant, by which the glass may be turned a few degrees on its axis, in order to set it parallel to the index-glass. The lever has a contrivance to turn it slowly, and a button to fix it. To set the glasses perpendicular to the plane of the instrument, there are two sunk screws, one before and one behind each glass: these screws pass through the plate on which the frame is fixed into another plate; so that by loosening one and tightening the other of these screws, the direction of the frame with its mirror may be altered, and set perpendicular to the plane of the instrument.\n\nOf the Coloured Glasses K.\n\nThere are usually three coloured glasses, two of which are tinged red and the other green. They are used to prevent the solar rays from hurting the eye at the time of observation. These glasses are set in a frame, which turns on a centre, so that they may be used separately or together as the brightness of the sun may require. The green glass is particularly useful in observations of the moon; it may be also used in observations of the sun, if that object be very faint. In the fore-observation, these glasses are fixed as in fig. 54.; but when the back observation is used, they are removed to N.\n\nOf the two Sight Vanes, H, I.\n\nEach of these vanes is a perforated piece of brass, designed to direct the sight parallel to the plane of the quadrant. That which is fixed at I is used for the fore, and the other for the back, observation. The vane I has two holes, one exactly at the height of the silvered part of the horizon glass, the other a little higher, to direct the sight to the middle of the transparent part of the mirror.\n\nOf the divisions on the Limb of the Quadrant.\n\nThe limb of the quadrant is divided from right to left into 90 primary divisions, which are to be considered as degrees, and each degree is subdivided into three equal parts, which are therefore of 20 minutes each: the intermediate minutes are obtained by means of the scale of divisions at the end of the index.\n\nOf the Vernier, or Subdividing Scale.\n\nThe dividing scale contains a space equal to 21 divisions of the limb, and is divided into 20 equal parts. Hence the difference between a division on the dividing scale and a division on the limb is one twentieth of a division on the limb, or one minute. The degree and minute pointed out by the dividing scale may be easily found thus.\n\nObserve what minute on the dividing scale coincides with a division on the limb; this division being added to the degree and part of a degree on the limb, immediately\nPractice.\n\nMethod of finding the Latitude and Longitude at Sea.\n\ndately preceding the first division on the dividing scale, will be the degree and minute required.\n\nThus suppose the fourteenth minute on the dividing scale coincided with a division on the limb, and that the preceding division shown by the vernier was $50^\\circ 42'$; hence the division shown by the vernier was $50^\\circ 44'$. A magnifying glass will assist the observer to read off the coinciding divisions with more accuracy.\n\nAdjustments of Hadley's Quadrant.\n\nThe adjustments of the quadrant consist in placing the mirrors perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. The fore horizon-glass must be set parallel to the speculum, and the planes of the speculum and back horizon glasses produced must be perpendicular to each other when the index is at $o$.\n\nAdjustment I. To set the index-glass perpendicular to the plane of the quadrant.\n\nMethod 1. Set the index towards the middle of the Fig. 55, and limb, and hold the quadrant so that its plane may be nearly parallel to the horizon; then look into the index-glass; and if the portion of the limb seen by reflection appears in the same plane with that seen directly, the speculum is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. If they do not appear in the same plane, the error is to be rectified by altering the position of the screws behind the frame of the glass.\n\nMethod 2. This is performed by means of the two adjusting tools, fig. 55, 56, which are two wooden frames, having two lines on each, exactly at the same distance from the bottom.\n\nPlace the quadrant in a horizontal position on a table; put the index about the middle of the arch; turn back the dark glasses; place one of the above-mentioned tools near one end of the arch, and the other at the opposite end, the side with the lines being towards the index-glass; then look into the index-glass, directing the sight parallel to the plane of the instrument, and one of the tools will be seen by direct vision, and the other by reflection. By moving the index a little, they may be brought exactly together. If the lines coincide, the position of the mirror is right; if not, they must be made to coincide by altering the screws behind the frame, as before.\n\nAdjustment II. To set the fore horizon-glass perpendicular to the plane of the instrument.\n\nSet the index to $o$; hold the plane of the quadrant parallel to the horizon; direct the sight to the horizon, and if the horizons seen directly and by reflection are apparently in the same straight line, the fore horizon-glass is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument; if not, one of the horizons will appear higher than the other. Now if the horizon seen by reflection is higher than that seen directly, release the nearest screw in the pedestal of the glass, and screw up that on the farther side, till the direct and reflected horizons appear to make one continued straight line. But if the reflected horizon is lower than that seen directly, unscrew the fartherest, and screw up the nearest screw till the coincidence of the horizons is perfect, observing to leave both screws equally tight, and the fore horizon-glass will be perpendicular to the plane of the quadrant.\n\nAdjustment III. To set the fore horizon-glass parallel to the index-glass, the index being at $o$.\n\nSet $o$ on the index exactly to $o$ on the limb, and fix it in that position by the screw at the under side; hold the plane of the quadrant in a vertical position, and direct the sight to a well-defined part of the horizon; then if the horizon seen in the silvered part coincides with that seen through the transparent part, the horizon-glass is adjusted; but if the horizons do not coincide, unscrew the milled screw in the middle of the lever on the other side of the quadrant, and turn the nut at the end of the lever until both horizons coincide, and fix the lever in this position by tightening the milled screw.\n\nAs the position of the glass is liable to be altered by fixing the lever, it will therefore be necessary to re-examine it, and if the horizons do not coincide, it will be necessary either to repeat the adjustment, or rather to find the error of adjustment, or, as it is usually called, the index-error; which may be done thus:\n\nDirect the sight to the horizon, and move the index until the reflected horizon coincides with that seen directly; then the difference between $o$ on the limb and $o$ on the vernier is the index error; which is additive when the beginning of the vernier is to the right of $o$ on the limb, otherwise subtractive.\n\nAdjustment IV. To set the back horizon-glass perpendicular to the plane of the instrument.\n\nPut the index to $o$; hold the plane of the quadrant parallel to the horizon, and direct the sight to the horizon through the back sight vane. Now if the reflected horizon is in the same straight line with that seen through the transparent part, the glass is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. If the horizons do not unite, turn the knurled screws in the pedestal of the glass until they are apparently in the same straight line.\n\nAdjustment V. To set the back horizon-glass perpendicular to the plane of the index-glass produced, the index being at $o$.\n\nLet the index be put as much to the right of $o$ as twice the dip of the horizon amounts to; hold the quadrant in a vertical position, and apply the eye to the back vane; then if the reflected horizon coincides with that seen directly, the glass is adjusted; if they do not coincide, the screw in the middle of the lever on the other side of the quadrant must be released, and the nut at its extremity turned till both horizons coincide. It may be observed, that the reflected horizon will be inverted; that is, the sea will be apparently uppermost and the sky lowermost.\n\nAs this method of adjustment is esteemed troublesome, and is often found to be very difficult to perform at sea, various contrivances have therefore been proposed to render this adjustment more simple. Some of these are the following.\n\n1. Mr Dollond's method of adjusting the back horizon-glass.\n\nIn this method an index is applied to the back horizon-glass, by which it may be moved so as to be parallel to the index glass, when $o$ on the vernier coincides with $o$ on the limb. When this is effected, the index of the back horizon-glass is to be moved exactly $90^\\circ$ from its former position, which is known by means of a divided arch for that purpose; and then the plane of the back horizon-glass will be perpendicular to the plane of the index-glass produced.\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\n2. Mr Blair's method of adjusting the back horizon-glas.\n\nAll that is required in this method is to polish the lower edge of the index-glas, and expose it to view. The back horizon-glas is adjusted by means of a reflection from this polished edge, in the very same method as the fore horizon glas is adjusted by the common method.\n\nIn order to illustrate this, let R I H E (fig. 57.) represent a pencil of rays emitted from the object R, incident on the index-glas I, from which it is reflected to the fore horizon-glas H, and thence to the eye at E. By this double reflection, an image of the object is formed at r. RHE represents another pencil from the same object R, coming directly through the fore horizon-glas to the eye at E; so that the doubly reflected image r appears coincident with the object R itself, seen directly.\n\nWhen this coincidence is perfect, and the object R so very distant as to make the angle IRH insensible, the position of the speculums I and H will differ insensibly from parallelism; that is, the quadrant will be adjusted for the fore observation. Now it is from the ease and accuracy with which this adjustment can at any time be made, that the fore-observation derives its superiority over the back-observation. But by grinding the edge of the index glas perpendicular to its reflecting surface, and polishing it, the observation is rendered capable of an adjustment equally easy and accurate as the fore horizon-glas: for by a pencil of rays emitted from the object S, incident on the reflecting edge of the index-glas D, thence reflected to the back horizon-glas B, and from that to the eye at e, an image will be formed at s; which image being made to coincide with the object S itself, seen directly, affords the position of the back horizon glas relative to the index-glas, with the same precision, and in a manner equally direct, as the former operation does that of the fore horizon-glas.\n\nDirections for adjusting the Back Horizon-Glas.\n\nThe method of adjusting the quadrant for the back-observation is this. If it is to be done without making use of the telescope, place the index at o, and, applying the eye to the hole in the sight vane (K), or tube for directing the sight, direct it through the back horizon-glas to the horizon, if that is the object to be used for adjusting. The two horizons are then to be made to coincide, holding the quadrant first in a vertical and then in a horizontal position; by which means both adjustments will be effected as in the fore-observation.\n\nThere will be no difficulty in finding the reflected horizon, if the observer first directs his eye to that part of the horizon-glas where he observes the image of the polished edge of the index-glas, which will appear double. When the direct horizon is made to appear in this case, the reflected one will be seen close by it, unless the instrument wants a great adjustment. In this case, a little motion of the back horizon-glas backwards and forwards will presently bring it into view.\n\nWhen the horizon, or any obscure terrestrial object, is to be made use of for adjusting by means of the reflecting edge, there is a precaution to be taken, without which the observer will sometimes meet with what will appear an unaccountable difficulty; for if the sky, or other object behind him, should happen to be pretty bright, he will not be able to discern the horizon at all. This arises from the image of the object behind him, which is reflected from the silvered surface of the index-glas, appearing to coincide with the horizon; in which case, the bright picture of the former, which is formed in the bottom of the eye, prevents the fainter impression of the latter from being perceived. This will be avoided, either by applying a black screen over the silvered surface of the index-glas, or, without being at this trouble, by standing at a door or window, so that only the dark objects within can be reflected from the index-glas; but if the observation is to be made in the open air, a hat, or any such dark obstacle, held before the silvered surface of the index-glas, will very effectually remove this inconvenience.\n\nIt may be remarked, that some observers, instead of making the principal adjustment, place the speculums parallel, by moving the index without altering the position of the horizon-glas: and the difference between o on the vernier and o on the limb is the index error, which must be subtracted from all angles measured by the back-observation, when o on the index, is to the right of o on the limb; and added when to the left.\n\n3. Mr Wright's method of adjusting the back horizon glas of his improved patent quadrant.\n\nFig. 58. is a representation of the quadrant complete in all its parts for use. A, is the reflecting surface of the index-glas, which is made of the usual length, and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch broad. The bottom part is covered in front by the brass frame, and the reflecting surface is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) on the back. B, the fore horizon-glas, placed as usual: O, the back horizon-glas, now placed under the fore sight-vane on the first radius of the quadrant I: C, the sight-vane of the fore horizon-glas: D, the sight-vane of the back horizon-glas: E, the coloured glasses in a brass frame, in the proper place for the fore observation: F, a hole in the frame to receive the coloured glasses when an observation is to be taken with the back horizon-glas in the common way, by turning the back to the sun: G, a hole in the frame of the farthest radius K, to receive the coloured glasses when an observation is to be taken by the new method; which is by looking through the lower hole in the sight-vane of the back horizon-glas, directly at\n\n(K) Besides the hole in the sight vane, commonly made, there must be another nearer to the horizon-glas, and so placed that an eye directed through it to the centre of the horizon-glas shall there perceive the image of the polished edge of the index-glas. This hole must not be made small like the other, but equal to the ordinary size of the pupil of the eye, there being on some occasions no light to spare.\nat the fun in the line of sight DN; the horizon from behind will then be reflected from the back of the index-glasfs to the horizon-glasfs, and from thence to the eye. (See fig. 62.) H, a brass clamp on the upper end of the index, having a milled screw underneath, which fastens the round plate to the index when required. (See fig. 59.) IK, the graduated arch of the quadrant divided into 90 degrees; L, the brass index which moves over the graduated arch; M, the vernier to subdivide the divisions on the arch into single minutes of a degree.\n\nFig. 59 shows the upper part of the index L on a larger scale, with part of the brass frame that fastens the index-glasfs, and the three adjusting screws D to adjust its axis vertical to the plane of the quadrant; B, the centre on which the milled plate O moves over the index: The dotted line BF is the distance it is required to move; K, the adjusting screw to stop it in its proper place for adjusting the back observation-glasfs; G, a piece of brass fastened to the index opposite to the clamp H, to keep the plate O always close to the index L.\n\nFig. 60 represents the parallel position of the index and horizon glasfs after adjustment by the sun: BC, a ray from the sun incident on the index-glasfs C, and from thence reflected to the fore horizon-glasfs D, and again to the eye at E, in the line DE, where the eye sees the sun at A by direct vision, and the image by reflection, in one; the parallel lines AE and BC being so near to each other, that no apparent angle can be observed in the planes of the index and horizon-glasfs, when adjusted by a distant object.\n\nIn fig. 61, the index-glasfs is removed 45 degrees from the plane of the fore horizon glasfs, and fixed in its proper place for adjusting the back horizon-glasfs parallel to its plane, in the same manner as the fore horizon-glasfs is adjusted.\n\nIn fig. 62, the index-glasfs (after the adjustment of the fore and back horizon-glasfs) is carried forward by the index on the arch 90 degrees, and makes an angle of 45\u00b0 with the plane of the fore horizon-glasfs, and is at right angles to the plane of the back horizon-glasfs. The eye at E now sees the sun in the horizon at H, reflected by the index and horizon-glasfs from the zenith at Z, the image and object being 90 degrees distant. The back horizon K is now reflected from the back surface of the index-glasfs C to the horizon-glasfs M, and from thence to the eye at D, in a right line with the fore horizon F. In order to make an exact contact of the fore and back horizons at F, the index must be advanced beyond the 90th degree on the arch, by a quantity equal to twice the dip of the horizon.\n\nThe quadrant is adjusted for the fore-observation as usual, having previously fixed the index-glasfs in its proper place by the milled screw at H, as represented in fig. 59.\n\nTo adjust the Quadrant for the Back-observation.\n\nFasten the index to 90\u00b0 on the limb; loosen the screw H (fig. 59.), and turn the plate O by the milled edge until the end of the adjusting screw K touch the edge of the clamp M; and by means of a distant object observe if the glasfs are then parallel, as at fig 60.: if they are, fasten the screw H; if not, with a screw-driver turn the screw K gently to the right or left to make them perfect, and then fasten the screw. Now remove the index back to O on the limb, and the index-glasfs will be parallel to the back horizon-glasfs E, fig. 61.; If not, make them so by turning the adjusting screw of the glasfs E, the eye being at the upper hole in the sight-vane D, and the sight directed to the horizon, or any distant object in the direction DN (fig. 58.) Now the index remaining in this position, the index-glasfs is to be returned, to stop at the pin E, and it will be parallel to the fore horizon-glasfs as at first: then the quadrant will be adjusted for both methods of observation.\n\nTo observe the Sun's Altitude by the Back-observation.\n\nRemove the coloured glasfses to G (fig. 58.), and look through the lower hole in the sight-vane D, in the line of direction DN, directly to the sun, and move the index forward on the arch exactly in the same manner as in the fore-observation: make the contact of the sun's limb and the back horizon exact, and the degrees and minutes shown by the index on the limb is the sun's zenith distance. It may be observed, that the horizon will be inverted. If the sun's lower limb be observed, the semidiameter is to be subtracted from the zenith distance; but if the upper limb is observed, the semidiameter is to be added.\n\nThe observation may be made in the usual manner, by turning the back to the sun. In this case the coloured glasfses are to be shifted to F, and proceed according to the directions formerly given.\n\nUse of Hadley's Quadrant.\n\nThe altitude of any object is determined by the position of the index on the limb, when by reflection that object appears to be in contact with the horizon.\n\nIf the object whose altitude is to be observed be the sun, and if so bright that its image may be seen in the transparent part of the fore horizon-glasfs, the eye is to be applied to the upper hole in the sight-vane; otherwise, to the lower hole: and in this case, the quadrant is to be held so that the sun may be bisected by the line of separation of the silvered and transparent parts of the glasfs. The moon is to be kept as nearly as possible in the same position; and the image of the star is to be observed in the silvered part of the glasfs adjacent to the line of separation of the two parts.\n\nThere are two different methods of taking observations with the quadrant. In the first of these the face of the observer is directed towards that part of the horizon immediately under the sun, and is therefore called the fore observation. In the other method, the observer's back is to the sun, and it is hence called the back-observation. This last method of observation is to be used only when the horizon under the sun is obscured, or rendered indistinct by fog or any other impediment.\n\nIn taking the sun's altitude, whether by the fore or back observation, the observer must turn the quadrant about upon the axis of vision, and at the same time turn himself about upon his feet, so as to keep the sun always in that part of the horizon-glasfs which is at the same distance as the eye from the plane of the quadrant. In this way the reflected sun will describe an arch of a parallel circle round the true sun, whose convex side will\nwill be downwards in the fore-observation and upwards in the back; and consequently, when by moving the index, the lowest point of the arch in the fore-observation, or highest in the back, is made to touch the horizon, the quadrant will stand in a vertical plane, and the altitude above the visible horizon will be properly observed. The reason of these operations may be thus explained: The image of the sun being always kept in the axis of vision, the index will always show on the quadrant the distance between the sun and any object seen directly which its image appears to touch; therefore, as long as the index remains unmoved, the image of the sun will describe an arch everywhere equidistant from the sun in the heavens, and consequently a parallel circle about the sun, as a pole. Such a translation of the sun's image can only be produced by the quadrant's being turned about upon a line drawn from the eye to the sun, as an axis. A motion of rotation upon this line may be resolved into two, one upon the axis of vision, and the other upon a line on the quadrant perpendicular to the axis of vision; and consequently a proper combination of these two motions will keep the image of the sun constantly in the axis of vision, and cause both jointly to run over a parallel circle about the sun in the heavens; but when the quadrant is vertical, a line thereon perpendicular to the axis of vision, becomes a vertical axis; and as a small motion of the quadrant is all that is wanted, it will never differ much in practice from a vertical axis. The observer is directed to perform two motions rather than the single one equivalent to them on a line drawn from the eye to the sun; because we are not capable, while looking towards the horizon, of judging how to turn the quadrant about upon the elevated line going to the sun as an axis, by any other means than by combining the two motions above mentioned, so as to keep the sun's image always in the proper part of the horizon-glass. When the sun is near the horizon, the line going from the eye to the sun will not be far removed from the axis of vision; and consequently the principal motion of the quadrant will be performed on the axis of vision, and the part of motion made on the vertical axis will be but small. On the contrary, when the sun is near the zenith, the line going to the sun is not far removed from a vertical line, and consequently the principal motion of the quadrant will be performed on a vertical axis, by the observer's turning himself about, and the part of the motion made on the axis of vision will be but small. In intermediate altitudes of the sun, the motions of the quadrant on the axis of vision, and on the vertical axis, will be more equally divided.\n\nObservations taken with the quadrant are liable to errors, arising from the bending and elasticity of the index, and the resistance it meets with in turning round its centre: whence the extremity of the index, on being pushed along the arch, will sensibly advance before the index-glass begins to move, and may be seen to recoil when the force acting on it is removed. Mr Hadley seems to have been apprehensive that his instrument would be liable to errors from this cause; and in order to avoid them, gives particular directions that the index be made broad at the end next the centre, and that the centre, or axis itself, have as easy a motion as is consistent with steadiness; that is, an entire freedom from looseness, or shake as the workmen term it. By strictly complying with these directions the error in question may indeed be greatly diminished; so far, perhaps, as to render it nearly infensible, where the index is made strong, and the proper medium between the two extremes of a shake at the centre on one hand, and too much stiffness there on the other, is nicely hit; but it cannot be entirely corrected. For to more or less of bending the index will always be subject; and some degree of resistance will remain at the centre, unless the friction there could be totally removed, which is impossible.\n\nOf the reality of the error to which he is liable from this cause, the observer, if he is provided with a quadrant furnished with a screw for moving the index gradually, may thus satisfy himself. After finishing the observation, lay the quadrant on a table, and note the angle; then cautiously loosen the screw which fastens the index, and it will immediately, if the quadrant is not remarkably well constructed, be seen to start from its former situation, more or less according to the perfection of the joint and the strength of the index. This starting, which is owing to the index recoiling after being released from the confined state it was in during the observation, will sometimes amount to several minutes; and its direction will be opposite to that in which the index was moved by the screw at the time of finishing the observation. But how far it affects the truth of the observation, depends on the manner in which the index was moved in setting it to zero, for adjusting the instrument; or in finishing the observations necessary for finding the index error.\n\nThe easiest and best rule to avoid these errors seems to be this: In all observations made by Hadley's quadrant, let the observer take notice constantly to finish his observations, by moving the index in the same direction which was used in letting it to zero for adjusting; or in the observations necessary for finding the index error. If this rule is observed, the error arising from the spring of the index will be obviated. For as the index was bent the same way, and in the same degree in adjusting as in observing, the truth of the observations will not be affected by this bending.\n\nTo take Altitudes by the Fore-observation.\n\nI. Of the Sun.\n\nTurn down either of the coloured glasses before the horizon-glass, according to the brightness of the sun; direct the sight to that part of the horizon which is under the sun, and move the index until the coloured image of the sun appear in the horizon-glass; then give the quadrant a slow vibratory motion about the axis of vision; move the index until the lower or upper limb of the sun is in contact with the horizon, at the lowest part of the arch described by this motion; and the degrees and minutes shown by the index on the limb will be the altitude of the sun.\n\nII. Of the Moon.\n\nPut the index to zero, turn down the green glass, place the eye at the lower hole in the sight-vane, and observe the moon in the silvered part of the horizon-glass; move the index gradually, and follow the moon's reflected image until the enlightened limb is in contact with\nwith the horizon, at the lower part of the arch described by the vibratory motion as before, and the index will show the altitude of the observed limb of the moon. If the observation is made in the day-time, the coloured glass is unnecessary.\n\nIII. Of a Star or Planet.\n\nThe index being put to o, direct the sight to the star through the lower hole in the flight-vane and transparent part of the horizon-glass; move the plane of the quadrant a very little to the left, and the image of the star will be seen in the silvered part of the glass. Now move the index, and the image of the star will appear to descend; continue moving the index gradually until the star is in contact with the horizon at the lowest part of the arch described; and the degrees and minutes shown by the index on the limb will be the altitude of the star.\n\nTo take Altitudes by the Back-observation.\n\nI. Of the Sun.\n\nPut the stem of the coloured glasses into the perforation between the horizon-glasses, turn down either according to the brightness of the sun, and hold the quadrant vertically; then direct the sight through the hole in the back flight-vane, and the transparent slit in the horizon-glass to that part of the horizon which is opposite to the sun; now move the index till the sun is in the silvered part of the glass, and by giving the quadrant a vibratory motion, the axis of which is that of vision, the image of the sun will describe an arch whose convex side is upwards; bring the limb of the sun, when in the upper part of this arch, in contact with the horizon; and the index will show the altitude of the other limb of the sun.\n\nII. Of the Moon.\n\nThe altitude of the moon is observed in the same manner as that of the sun, with this difference only, that the use of the coloured glasses is unnecessary unless the moon is very bright; and that the enlightened limb, whether it be the upper or lower, is to be brought in contact with the horizon.\n\nIII. Of a Star or Planet.\n\nLook directly to the star through the vane and transparent slit in the horizon-glass, move the index until the opposite horizon, with respect to the star, is seen in the silvered part of the glass; and make the contact perfect as formerly. If the altitude of the star is known nearly, the index may be set to that altitude, the sight directed to the opposite horizon, and the observation made as before.\n\nSect. II. Of finding the Latitude of a Place.\n\nThe observation necessary for ascertaining the latitude of a place, is that of the meridional altitude of a known celestial object; or two altitudes when the object is out of the meridian. The latitude is deduced with more certainty and with less trouble from the first of these methods, than from the second; and the sun, for various reasons, is the object most proper for this purpose at sea. It, however, frequently happens, that by the interpolation of clouds, the sun is obscured at noon; and by this means the meridian altitude is lost. In this case, therefore, the method by double altitudes becomes necessary. The latitude may be deduced from three altitudes of an unknown object, or from double altitudes, the apparent times of observation being given.\n\nThe altitude of the limb of an object observed at sea, requires four separate corrections in order to obtain the true altitude of its centre: these are for semidiameter, dip, refraction, and parallax. (See Astronomy, and the respective articles). The first and last of these corrections vanish when the observed object is a fixed star.\n\nWhen the altitude of the lower limb of any object is observed, its semidiameter is to be added thereto in order to obtain the central altitude; but if the upper limb be observed, the semidiameter is to be subtracted. If the altitude be taken by the back-observation, the contrary rule is to be applied. The dip is to be subtracted from, or added to, the observed altitude, according as the fore or back-observation is used. The refraction is always to be subtracted from, and the parallax added to, the observed altitude.\n\nProb. I. To reduce the sun's declination to any given meridian.\n\nRule. Find the number in Table IX. answering to the longitude in the table nearest to that given, and to the nearest day of the month. Now, if the longitude is west, and the declination increasing, that is, from the 20th of March to the 22d of June, and from the 22d of September to the 22d of December, the above number is to be added to the declination: during the other part of the year, or while the declination is decreasing, this number is to be subtracted. In east longitude, the contrary rule is to be applied.\n\nEx. 1. Required the sun's declination at noon 16th April 1810, in longitude 84\u00b0 W?\n\nSun's declination at noon at Greenwich 9\u00b0 59.2' N\nNumber from Table IX. + 5.0\n\nReduced declination 10\u00b0 4.2\n\nEx. 2. Required the sun's declination at noon 22d March 1793, in longitude 151\u00b0 E?\n\nSun's declination at noon at Greenwich 0\u00b0 53' N\nEquation from Table X. - 10\n\nReduced declination 0\u00b0 43' N\n\nProb. II. Given the sun's meridian altitude, to find the latitude of the place of observation.\n\nRule. The sun's semidiameter is to be added to, or subtracted from, the observed altitude, according as the lower or upper limb is observed; the dip answering to the height from Table V. is to be subtracted if the fore-observation is used; otherwise, it is to be added; and the refraction answering to the altitude from Table IV. is to be subtracted: hence the true altitude of the sun's centre will be obtained. Call the altitude south or north, according as the sun is south or north at the time of observation; which subtracted from 90\u00b0, will give the zenith distance of a contrary denomination.\n\nReduce the sun's declination to the meridian of the place of observation, by Prob. I.; then the sum or difference\nference of the zenith distance and declination, according as they are of the same or of a contrary denomination, will be the latitude of the place of observation, of the same name with the greater quantity.\n\nEx. 1. October 19, 1810, in longitude 32\u00b0 E, the meridian altitude of the sun's lower limb was 48\u00b0 53' S, height of the eye 18 feet.

August 23, 1812, in longitude 107\u00b0 E, the meridian altitude of the sun's lower limb by the back-observation was 61\u00b0 8' N, and the height of the eye 14 feet. Required the latitude?\n\nObserved altitude sun's upper limb 61\u00b0 8' N Sun's semidiameter -0 16 Dip +0 3\u00bd Refraction -0 \u00bd True altitude of sun's centre 60 55 N Zenith distance 29 5 S Reduced declination 11 26 N Latitude 17 39 S\n\nThe dip in Table V. answers to an entirely open and unobstructed horizon. It, however, frequently happens, that the sun is over the land at the time of observation, and the ship nearer to the land than the visible horizon would be if unconfined. In this case, the dip will be different from what it would otherwise have been, and is to be taken from Table VI., in which the height is expressed at the top, and the distance from the land in the tide column in nautical miles.\u2014Seamen, in general, can estimate the distance of any object from the ship with sufficient exactness for this purpose, especially when that distance is not greater than six miles, which is the greatest distance of the visible horizon from an observer on the deck of any ship.\n\nProb. III. Given the meridian altitude of a fixed star, to find the latitude of the place of observation.\n\nRule. Correct the altitude of the star by dip and refraction, and find the zenith distance of the star as formerly; take the declination of the star from Table XI. and reduce it to the time of observation. Now, the sum or difference of the zenith distance and declination of the star, according as they are of the same or of a contrary name, will be the latitude of the place of observation.\n\nEx. 1. December 1, 1810, the meridian altitude of Sirius was 59\u00b0 50' S, height of the eye 14 feet.

Required the latitude?\n\nObserved altitude of Procyon 71\u00b0 15' N Dip and refraction -0 3 True altitude 71 12 N Zenith distance 18 48 S Declination 5 43 N Latitude 13 5 S\n\nProb. IV. Given the meridian altitude of a planet, to find the latitude of the place of observation.\n\nRule. Compute the true altitude of the planet as directed in last problem (which is sufficiently accurate for altitudes taken at sea); take its declination from the Nautical Almanac, page iv. of the month, and reduce it to the time and meridian of the place of observation; then the sum or difference of the zenith distance and declination of the planet will be the latitude as before.\n\nEx. 1. August 7, 1812, the meridian altitude of Saturn was 68\u00b0 42' N, and height of the eye 15 feet. Required the latitude?\n\nObserved altitude of Saturn 68\u00b0 42' N Dip and refraction -0 4 True altitude 68 38 N Zenith distance 21 22 S Declination 22 42 S Latitude 44 6 S\n\nEx. 2.

V. Given the meridian altitude of the moon, to find the latitude of the place of observation.\n\nRule. Take the number answering to the ship's longitude, and daily variation of the moon's passing the meridian; which being applied to the time of passage given in the Nautical Almanac, will give the time of the moon's passage over the meridian of the ship.\n\nReduce this time to the meridian of Greenwich; and by means of the Nautical Almanac find the moon's declination, horizontal parallax, and semidiameter at the reduced time.\n\nApply the semidiameter and dip to the observed altitude of the limb, and the apparent altitude of the moon's centre will be obtained; to which add the correction answering to the apparent altitude and horizontal parallax, and the sum will be the true altitude of the moon's centre; which subtracted from 90\u00b0, the remainder is the zenith distance, and the sum or difference of the zenith distance and declination, according as they are of the same or of a contrary name, will be the latitude of the place of observation.\n\nEx. I. December 24, 1792, in longitude 30\u00b0 W, the meridian altitude of the moon's lower limb was 81\u00b0 15' N, height of the eye 12 feet.

If the object be on the meridian below the pole at the time of observation, then the sum of the true altitude and the complement of the declination is the latitude, of the same name as the declination or altitude.\n\nEx. I. July 2, 1812, in longitude 15\u00b0 W, the altitude of the sun's lower limb at midnight was 80\u00b0 58', height of the eye 18 feet.

VI. Given the latitude by account, the declination and two observed altitudes of the sun, and the interval of time between them, to find the true latitude.\n\nRule. To the log. secant of the latitude by account, add the log. secant of the sun's declination; the sum, rejecting 20 from the index, is the logarithm ratio. To this add the log. of the difference of the natural sines of the two altitudes, and the log. of the half elapsed time from its proper column.\n\nFind this sum in column of middle time, and take out the time answering thereto; the difference between which and the half elapsed time will be the time from noon when the greater altitude was observed.\n\nTake the log. answering to this time from column of rising, from which subtract the log. ratio, the remainder is the logarithm of a natural number; which being added to the natural sine of the greater altitude, the sum is the natural cosine of the meridian zenith distance; from which and the sun's declination the latitude is obtained as formerly.\n\nIf the latitude thus found differs considerably from that by account, the operation is to be repeated, using the computed latitude in place of that by account (i.).\n\nEx. I.\n\n(1.) This method is only an approximation, and ought to be used under certain restrictions; namely,\n\nThe observations must be taken between nine o'clock in the forenoon and three in the afternoon. If both observations be in the forenoon, or both in the afternoon, the interval must not be less than the distance of the time of observation of the greatest altitude from noon. If one observation be in the forenoon and the other in the afternoon, the interval must not exceed four hours and a half; and in all cases, the nearer the greater altitude is to noon the better.\n\nIf the sun's meridian zenith distance be less than the latitude, the limitations are still more contracted. If the latitude be double the meridian zenith distance, the observations must be taken between half past nine in the morning and half past two in the afternoon, and the interval must not exceed three hours and a half. The observations must be taken still nearer to noon, if the latitude exceed the zenith distance in a greater proportion.

VII. Given the latitude by account, the sun's declination, two observed altitudes, the elapsed time, and the course and distance run between the observations; to find the ship's latitude at the time of observation of the greater altitude.\n\nRule. Find the angle contained between the ship's course and the sun's bearing at the time of observation of the least altitude, with which enter the Traverse Table as a course, and the difference of latitude answering to the distance made good will be the reduction of altitude.\n\nNow, if the least altitude be observed in the forenoon, the reduction of altitude is to be applied thereto by addition or subtraction, according as the angle between the ship's course and the sun's bearing is less or more than eight points. If the least altitude be observed in the afternoon, the contrary rule is to be used.\n\nThe difference of longitude in time between the observations is to be applied to the elapsed time by addition or subtraction, according as it is east or west. This is, however, in many cases so inconsiderable as to be neglected.\n\nWith the corrected altitudes and interval, the latitude by account and sun's declination at the time of observation of the greatest altitude, the computation is to be performed by the last problem.\n\nEx. 1.

VIII. Given the altitudes of two known stars, observed at the same or at different times; and if at different times, the interval between the observations; to find the latitude.\n\nRULE. If both altitudes be observed at the same time, call the difference between their right ascensions the reduced interval.\n\nBut if the altitudes be taken at different times, reduce the interval between the observations to sidereal time, by adding thereto the proportional part answering to the interval, and 3\u00b0 56', the daily acceleration of the fixed stars. Now to the right ascension of the first observed star, add the interval in sidereal time, and the difference between this sum and the right ascension of the other star will be the reduced interval.\n\nTo the logarithm rising of the reduced interval, add the logarithmic cosines of the stars declinations; subtract the natural number answering to the sum of these logarithms from the natural cosine of the difference or sum of the stars declinations, according as they are of the same or of a contrary name, and the remainder will be the natural sine of arch first.\n\nTo the logarithmic cosine of arch first add the logarithmic secant of declination of the star having the least polar distance, and the logarithm half elapsed time of the reduced interval, the sum will be the logarithm half elapsed time of arch second.\n\nFrom the natural cosine of the difference between arch first and the altitude of the star having the greatest polar distance, subtract the natural sine of the altitude of the other star, and find the logarithm of the remainder; to which add the logarithm secant of arch first, and the logarithmic secant of the altitude of the star having the greatest polar distance, the sum will be the logarithm rising of arch third. The difference between arches second and third is arch fourth.\n\nTo the logarithm rising of arch fourth add the logarithmic cosines of the declination and altitude of the star having the greatest polar distance; subtract the corresponding natural number from the natural cosine of the difference between the altitude and declination, the polar distance being less than 90\u00b0; otherwise, from their sum, and the remainder will be the natural sine of the latitude.\n\nEx.

II. Containing the Method of finding the Longitude at Sea by Lunar Observations.\n\nSECT. I. Introduction.\n\nThe observations necessary to determine the longitude by this method are, the distance between the sun and moon, or the moon and a fixed star near the ecliptic, together with the altitude of each. The stars used in the Nautical Almanack for this purpose are the following: namely, \u03b1 Arietis, Aldebaran, Pollux, Regulus, Spica Virginis, Antares, \u03b1 Aquilae, Fomalhaut, and \u03b1 Pegasi; and the distances of the moon's centre from the sun, and from one or more of these stars, are contained in the viii, ix, x, and xi. pages of the month, at the beginning of every third hour apparent time, by the meridian of Greenwich. The distance between the moon and the sun, or one of these stars, is observed with a sextant; and the altitudes of the objects are taken as usual with a Hadley's quadrant.\n\nIn the practice of this method, it will be found convenient to be provided with three assistants, two of these are to take the altitudes of the sun and moon, or moon and star, at the same time the principal observer is taking the distance between the objects; and the third assistant is to observe the time, and write down...\nOf finding down the observations. In order to obtain accuracy, it will be necessary to observe several distances, and the corresponding altitudes; the intervals of time between them being as short as possible; and the sum of each divided by the number will give the mean distance and mean altitudes; from which the time of observation at Greenwich is to be computed by the rules to be explained.\n\nIf the sun or star from which the moon's distance is observed be at a proper distance from the meridian, the time at the ship may be inferred from the altitude observed at the same time with the distance: in this case, the watch is not necessary; but if that object be near the meridian, the watch is absolutely necessary, in order to connect the observations for ascertaining the apparent time at the ship and at Greenwich with each other.\n\nAn observer without any assistants may very easily take all the observations, by first taking the altitudes of the objects, then the distance, and again their altitudes, and reduce the altitudes to the time of observation of the distance; or, by a single observation of the distance, the apparent time being known, the longitude may be determined.\n\nA set of observations of the distance between the moon and a star, and their altitudes, may be taken with accuracy during the time of the evening or morning twilight; and the observer, though not much acquainted with the stars, will not find it difficult to distinguish the star from which the moon's distance is to be observed. For the time of observation nearly, and the ship's longitude by account being known, the estimate time at Greenwich may be found; and by entering the Nautical Almanac with the reduced time, the distance between the moon and given star will be found nearly. Now let the index of the sextant to this distance, and hold the plane of the instrument so as to be nearly at right angles to the line joining the moon's cusps, direct the sight to the moon, and by giving the sextant a slow vibratory motion, the axis of which being that of vision, the star, which is usually one of the brightest in that part of the heavens, will be seen in the transparent part of the horizon glass.\n\n**Sect. II. Of the Sextant.**\n\nThis instrument is constructed for the express purpose of measuring with accuracy the angular distance between the sun and moon, or between the moon and a fixed star, in order to ascertain the longitude of a place by lunar observations. It is, therefore, made with more care than the quadrant, and has some additional appendages that are wanting in that instrument.\n\nFig. 63. represents the sextant, so framed as not to be liable to bend. The arch AA is divided into 120 degrees; each degree is divided into three parts; each of these parts, therefore, contains 20 minutes, which are again subdivided by the vernier into every half minute or 30 seconds. The vernier is numbered at every fifth of the longer divisions, from the right towards the left, with 5, 10, 15, and 20; the first division to the right being the beginning of the scale.\n\nIn order to observe with accuracy, and make the images come precisely in contact, an adjusting screw B is added to the index, which may thereby be moved with greater accuracy than it can be by hand; but this screw does not act until the index is fixed by the finger screw C. Care should be taken not to force the adjusting screw when it arrives at either extremity of its adjustment. When the index is to be moved any considerable quantity, the screw C at the back of the sextant must be loosed; but when the index is brought nearly to the division required, this back screw should be tightened, and then the index may be moved gradually by the adjusting screw.\n\nThere are four tinged glasses D, each of which is set in a separate frame that turns on a centre. They are used to defend the eye from the brightness of the solar image and the glare of the moon, and may be used separately or together as occasion requires.\n\nThere are three more such glasses placed behind the horizon glass E, to weaken the rays of the sun or moon when they are viewed directly through the horizon glass. The paler glass is sometimes used in observing altitudes at sea, to take off the strong glare of the horizon.\n\nThe frame of the index glass I is firmly fixed by a strong cock to the centre plate of the index. The horizon glass F is fixed in a frame that turns on the axes or pivots, which move in an exterior frame; the holes in which the pivots move may be tightened by four screws in the exterior frame. G is a screw by which the horizon glass may be set perpendicular to the plane of the instrument: should this screw become loose, or move too easy, it may be easily tightened by turning the capstan headed screw H, which is on one side of the socket through which the stern of the finger screw passes.\n\nThe sextant is furnished with a plain tube (fig. 64.) Fig. 64. without any glasses; and to render the objects still more distinct, it has two telescopes, one (fig. 65.) re. Fig. 65. presenting the objects erect, or in their natural position; the longer one (fig. 66.) shows them inverted; Fig. 66. it has a large field of view, and other advantages, and a little use will soon accustom the observer to the inverted position, and the instrument will be as readily managed by it as by the plain tube alone. By a telescope the contact of the images is more perfectly distinguished; and by the place of the images in the field of the telescope, it is easy to perceive whether the sextant is held in the proper place for observation. By sliding the tube that contains the eye-glasses in the inside of the other tube, the object is suited to different eyes, and made to appear perfectly distinct and well defined.\n\nThe telescopes are to be screwed into a circular ring at K; this ring rests on two points against an exterior ring, and is held thereto by two screws: by turning one or other of these screws, and tightening the other, the axis of the telescope may be set parallel to the plane of the sextant. The exterior ring is fixed on a triangular brass stem that slides in a socket, and by means of a screw at the back of the quadrant may be raised or lowered so as to move the centre of the telescope to point to that part of the horizon glass which shall be judged the most fit for observation. Fig. 67. is a circular head, with tinged glasses to screw Fig. 67. on the eye end of either of the telescopes or the plain tube. The glasses are contained in a circular plate which\nOf finding which has four holes; three of these are fitted with the lens at Sec. Tinged glasses, the fourth is open. By pressing the finger against the projecting edge of this plate, and turning it round, the open hole, or any of the tinged glasses, may be brought between the eye-glass of the telescope and the eye.\n\nFig. 68. is a magnifying glass, to assist the observer to read off the angle with more accuracy: and fig. 69. a screw-driver.\n\nMr Hoppe of Church-street, Minories, London, has lately contrived a sextant, with two arches, which is, therefore, preferable to the common sextant.\n\nAdjustments of the Sextant.\n\nThe adjustments of a sextant are, to set the mirrors perpendicular to its plane and parallel to each other when the index is at zero, and to set the axis of the telescope parallel to the plane of the instrument. The three first of these adjustments are performed nearly in the same manner as directed in the section on the quadrant: as however the sextant is provided with a set of coloured glasses placed behind the horizon glass, the index error may be more accurately determined by measuring the sun's diameter twice, with the index placed alternately before and behind the beginning of the divisions: half the difference of these two measures will be the index error, which must be added to, or subtracted from, all observations, according as the diameter measured with the index to the left of o is less or greater than the diameter measured with the index to the right of the beginning of the divisions.\n\nAdjustment IV. To set the Axis of the Telescope parallel to the Plane of the Instrument.\n\nTurn the eye end of the telescope until the two wires are parallel to the plane of the instrument; and let two distant objects be selected, as two stars of the first magnitude, whose distance is not less than 9\u00b0 or 10\u00b0; make the contact of these objects as perfect as possible at the wire nearest the plane of the instrument; fix the index in this position; move the sextant till the objects are seen at the other wire, and if the same points are in contact, the axis of the telescope is parallel to the plane of the sextant; but if the objects are apparently separated, or do partly cover each other, correct half the error by the screws in the circular part of the supporter, one of which is above and the other between the telescope and sextant; turn the adjusting screw at the end of the index till the limbs are in contact; then bring the objects to the wire next the instrument; and if the limbs are in contact, the axis of the telescope is adjusted; if not, proceed as at the other wire, and continue till no error remains.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to know the angular distance between the wires of the telescope; to find which, place the wires perpendicular to the plane of the sextant, hold the instrument vertical, direct the sight to the horizon, and move the sextant in its own plane till the horizon and upper wire coincide; keep the sextant in this position, and move the index till the reflected horizon is covered by the lower wire: and the division shown by the index of the limb, corrected by the index error, will be the angular distance between the wires. Other and better methods will readily occur to the observer at land.\n\nUse of the Sextant.\n\nWhen the distance between the moon and the sun or a star is to be observed, the sextant must be held so that its plane may pass through the eye of the observer and both objects; and the reflected image of the most luminous of the two is to be brought in contact with the other seen directly. To effect this, therefore, it is evident, that when the brightest object is to the right of the other, the face of the sextant must be held upwards; but if to the left, downwards. When the face of the sextant is held upwards, the instrument should be supported with the right hand, and the index moved with the left hand. But when the face of the sextant is from the observer, it should be held with the left hand, and the motion of the index regulated by the right hand.\n\nSometimes a fitting posture will be found very convenient for the observer, particularly when the reflected object is to the right of the direct one; in this case, the instrument is supported by the right hand, the elbow may rest on the right knee, the right leg at the same time resting on the left knee.\n\nIf the sextant is provided with a ball and socket, and a staff, one of whose ends is attached thereto, and the other rests in a belt fastened round the body of the observer, the greater part of the weight of the instrument will by this means be supported by his body.\n\nTo observe the Distance between the Moon and any Celestial Object.\n\n1. Between the Sun and Moon.\n\nPut the telescope in its place, and the wires parallel to the plane of the instrument; and if the sun is very bright, raise the plate before the silvered part of the speculum; direct the telescope to the transparent part of the horizon glass, or to the line of separation of the silvered and transparent parts according to the brightness of the sun, and turn down one of the coloured glasses; then hold the sextant so that its plane produced may pass through the sun and moon, having its face either upwards or downwards according as the sun is to the right or left of the moon; direct the sight through the telescope to the moon, and move the index till the limb of the sun is nearly in contact with the enlightened limb of the moon; now fasten the index, and by a gentle motion of the instrument make the image of the sun move alternately past the moon; and, when in that position where the limbs are nearest each other, make the coincidence of the limbs perfect by means of the adjusting screw: this being effected, read off the degrees and parts of a degree shown by the index on the limb, using the magnifying glass; and thus the angular distance between the nearest limbs of the sun and moon is obtained.\n\n2. Between the Moon and a Star.\n\nDirect the middle of the field of the telescope to the line of separation of the silvered and transparent parts of the horizon glass; if the moon is very bright, turn down the lightest coloured glass; and hold the sextant so that its plane may be parallel to that passing through the eye of the observer and both objects; its face being upwards if the moon is to the right of the star, but if to the left, the face is to be held from the observer; now direct the sight through the telescope to the star, and move...\nOf finding when the moon appears by the reflection to be nearly in contact with the star; falten the index, and turn the adjusting screw till the coincidence of the star and enlightened limb of the moon is perfect; and the degrees and parts of a degree shown by the index will be the observed distance between the moon's enlightened limb and the star.\n\nThe contact of the limbs must always be observed in the middle between the parallel wires.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult for those not much accustomed to observations of this kind, to find the reflected image in the horizon glass: it will perhaps in this case be found more convenient to look directly to the object, and, by moving the index, to make its image coincide with that seen directly.\n\n**Sect. III. Of the Circular Instrument of Reflexion.**\n\nThis instrument was proposed with a view to correct the errors to which the sextant is liable; particularly the error arising from the inaccuracy of the divisions on the limb. It consists of the following parts; a circular ring or limb, two moveable indices, two mirrors, a telescope, coloured glasses, &c.\n\nThe limb of this instrument is a complete circle of metal, and is connected with a perforated central plate by six radii: it is divided into 720 degrees; each degree is divided into three equal parts; and the division is carried to minutes by means of the index scale as usual.\n\nThe two indices are moveable about the same axis, which passes exactly through the centre of the instrument:\u2014the first index carries the central mirror, and the other the telescope and horizon glass; each index being provided with an adjusting screw for regulating its motion, and a scale for showing the divisions on the limb.\n\nThe central mirror is placed on the first index immediately above the centre of the instrument, and its plane makes an angle of about 30\u00b0 with the middle line of the index. The four screws in its pedestal for making its plane perpendicular to that of the instrument have square heads, and are therefore easily turned either way by a key for that purpose.\n\nThe horizon glass is placed on the second index near the limb, so that as few as possible may be intercepted of the rays proceeding from the reflected object when to the left. The perpendicular position of this glass is rectified in the same manner as that of the horizon glass of a sextant, to which it is similar. It has another motion, whereby its plane may be disposed so as to make a proper angle with the axis of the telescope, and a line joining its centre, and that of the central mirror.\n\nThe telescope is attached to the other end of the index. It is an achromatic astronomical one, and therefore inverts objects; it has two parallel wires in the common focus of the glasses, whose angular distance is between two and three degrees; and which, at the time of observation, must be placed parallel to the plane of the instrument. This is easily done, by making the mark on the eye-piece coincide with that on the tube. The telescope is moveable by two screws in a vertical direction with regard to the plane of the instrument, but is not capable of receiving a lateral motion.\n\nThere are two sets of coloured glasses, each set containing four, and differing in shade from each other. The glasses of the larger set, which belongs to the central mirror, should have each about half the degree of shade with which the correspondent glass of the set belonging to the horizon mirror is tinged. These glasses are kept tight in their places by small prelling screws, and make an angle of about 8\u00bd\u00b0 with the plane of the instrument; by which means the image from the coloured glass is not reflected to the telescope. When the angle to be measured is between 5\u00b0 and 34\u00b0, one of the glasses of the largest set is to be placed before the horizon glass.\n\nThe handle is of wood, and is screwed to the back of the instrument, immediately under the centre, with which it is to be held at the time of observation.\n\nFig. 70. is a plan of the instrument, wherein the limb Fig. 70a is represented by the divided circular plate; A is the central mirror; a a, the places which receive the stems a a of the glasses, fig. 73.; EF, the first or central index with its scale and adjusting screw; MN, the second or horizon index; GH, the telescope; IK, the screws for moving it towards or from the plane of the instrument; C, the plane of the coloured glasses, fig. 72.; and D, its place in certain observations.\n\nFig. 71. is a section of the instrument, wherein the several parts are referred to by the same letters as in fig. 70.: Fig. 72. represents one of the horizon coloured glasses; and fig. 73. one of the central coloured glasses: Fig. 74. is the key for turning the adjusting screws of the mirrors: Fig. 75. is the handle: Fig. 76. a section of one of the radii towards its middle: Fig. 77. is used in some terrestrial observations for diminishing the light of the direct object, whose place at the time of observation is D: Fig. 78. is the tool for adjusting the central mirror; and for rectifying the position of the telescope with regard to the plane of the instrument, there is another tool exactly of the same size. The height of these is nearly equal to that of the middle of the central mirror.\n\n**Adjustments of the Circular Instrument.**\n\nI. To set the horizon glass so that none of the rays from the central mirror shall be reflected to the telescope from the horizon mirror, without passing through the coloured glass belonging to this last mirror.\u2014Place the coloured glass before the horizon mirror; direct the telescope to the silvered part of that mirror, and make it nearly parallel to the plane of the instrument; move the first index; and if the rays from the central mirror to the horizon glass, and from thence to the telescope, have all the same degree of shade with that of the coloured glass used, the horizon glass is in its proper position; otherwise the pedestal of the glass must be turned until the uncoloured images disappear.\n\nII. Place the two adjusting tools on the limb, about 3\u00bd\u00b0 of the instrument distant, one on each side of the division on the left, answering to the plane of the central mirror produced: then the eye being placed at the upper edge of the nearest tool, move the central index till one half only of the reflected image of this tool is seen in the central mirror towards the left, and move the other tool till its half to the right is hid by the same edge of the mirror; then, if the upper edges of both tools are apparently in the same straight line,\nOf finding the central mirror is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument; if not, bring them into this position by the screws in the pedestal of the mirror.\n\nIII. To set the horizon mirror perpendicular to the plane of the instrument.\u2014The central mirror being previously adjusted, direct the light through the telescope to any well-defined distant object; then if, by moving the central index, the reflected image passes exactly over the direct object, the mirror is perpendicular; if not, its position must be rectified by means of the screws in the pedestal of the glass.\n\nA planet, or star of the first magnitude, will be found a very proper object for this purpose.\n\nIV. To make the line of collimation parallel to the plane of the instrument.\u2014Lay the instrument horizontally on a table; place the two adjusting tools on the limb, towards the extremities of one of the diameters of the instrument; and at about 15 or 20 feet distant let a well-defined mark be placed, so as to be in the same straight line with the tops of the tools; then raise or lower the telescope till the plane, passing through its axis and the tops of the tools, is parallel to the plane of the instrument, and direct it to the fixed object; turn either or both of the screws of the telescope till the mark is apparently in the middle between the wires; then is the telescope adjusted; and the difference, if any, between the divisions pointed out by the indices of the screws will be the error of the indices. Hence this adjustment may in future be easily made.\n\nIn this process the eye tube must be so placed as to obtain distinct vision.\n\nV. To find that division to which the second index being placed the mirrors will be parallel, the central index being at zero.\u2014Having placed the first index exactly to 0, direct the telescope to the horizon mirror, so that its field may be bisected by the line of separation of the silvered and transparent parts of that mirror; hold the instrument vertically, and move the second index until the direct and reflected horizons agree; and the division shown by the index will be that required.\n\nThis adjustment may be performed by measuring the sun's diameter in contrary directions, or by making the reflected and direct images of a star or planet to coincide.\n\nUse of the Circular Instrument.\n\nTo observe the Distance between the Sun and Moon.\n\nI. The sun being to the right of the moon.\n\nSet a proper coloured glass before the central mirror, if the distance between the objects is less than $3^\\circ$; but if above that quantity, place a coloured glass before the horizon mirror; make the mirrors parallel, the first index being at 0, and hold the instrument so that its plane may be directed to the objects, with its face downwards, or from the observer; direct the light through the telescope to the moon; move the second index, according to the order of the divisions on the limb, till the nearest limbs of the sun and moon are almost in contact; fasten that index, and make the coincidence of the limbs perfect by the adjusting screw belonging thereto; then invert the instrument, and move the central index towards the second by a quantity equal to twice the arch passed over by that index; direct the plane of the instrument to the objects; lock directly to the moon, and the sun will be seen in the field of the telescope; fasten the central index, and make the contact of the same two limbs exact by means of the adjusting screw; then half the angle shown by the central index will be the distance between the nearest limbs of the sun and moon.\n\nII. The sun being to the left of the moon.\n\nHold the instrument with its face upwards, so that its plane may pass through both objects; direct the telescope to the moon, and make its limb coincide with the nearest limb of the sun's reflected image, by moving the second index; now put the instrument in an opposite position; direct its plane to the objects, and the flight to the moon, the central index being previously moved towards the second by a quantity equal to twice the measured distance; and make the same two limbs that were before observed coincide exactly, by turning the adjusting screw of the first index; then half the angle shown by the first index will be the angular distance between the observed limbs of the sun and moon.\n\nThis instrument has of late been greatly improved by Captain Mendoza.\n\nTo observe the Angular Distance between the Moon and a Fixed Star or Planet.\n\nI. The star being to the right of the moon.\n\nIn this case the star is to be considered as the direct object; and the enlightened limb of the moon's reflected image is to be brought in contact with the star or planet, both by a direct and inverted position of the instrument, exactly in the same manner as described in the last article. If the moon's image is very bright, the lightest tinged glass is to be used.\n\nII. The star being to the left of the moon.\n\nProceed in the same manner as directed for observing the distance between the sun and moon, the sun being to the right of the moon, using the lightest tinged glass, if necessary.\n\nSect.

V. To find the equation of equal altitudes.\n\nRule. To the cosecant of half the interval of time in degrees add the tangent of the latitude, and to the cotangent of half the interval add the tangent of the declination. Now if the latitude and declination be of a contrary name, add the corresponding natural numbers; but if of the same name, subtract them. Then to the ar. co. log. of this sum or difference add the proportional logarithm of one-fourth of the interval expressed in time, and the proportional logarithm of the daily variation of declination; the sum will be the proportional logarithm of the equation of equal altitudes in minutes and seconds, which are to be esteemed seconds and thirds.\n\nExample. Let the latitude of the place of observation be $57\u00b0\\ 9'N$, the interval of time between the observations of the equal altitudes $5h\\ 17'$, the sun's declination $17\u00b0\\ 48'S$, and the daily change of declination $16\u00b0\\ 19'$.

VI. To find the error of a watch by equal altitudes of the sun.\n\nRule. In the morning, when the sun is more than two hours distant from the meridian, let a set of observations be taken, consisting, for the sake of greater accuracy, of at least three altitudes, which, together with the corresponding times per watch, are to be wrote regularly, the time of each observation being increased by 12 hours. In the afternoon, observe the instants when the sun comes to the same altitudes, and write down each opposite to its respective altitude. Now half the sum of any two times answering to the same altitude will be the time of noon per watch uncorrected. Find the mean of all the times of noon thus deduced from each corresponding pair of observations, to which the equation of equal altitudes is to be applied by addition or subtraction according as the sun is receding from or approaching to the elevated pole, and the sum or difference will be the time per watch of apparent noon, the difference between which and noon will be the error of the watch for apparent time; and the watch will be fast or slow according as the time of noon thereby is more or less than 12 hours.\n\nExample.

III. Of the Variation of the Compass.\n\nThe variation of the compass is the deviation of the points of the mariner's compass from the corresponding points of the horizon; and is denominated east or west variation, according as the north point of the compass is to the east or west of the true north point of the horizon.\n\nA particular account of the variation, and of the several instruments used for determining it from observation, may be seen under the articles AZIMUTH, COMPASS, and VARIATION: and for the method of communicating magnetism to compass needles, see MAGNETISM.\n\nProb. I. Given the latitude of a place, and the sun's magnetic amplitude, to find the variation of the compass.\n\nRule. To the log. secant of the latitude, add the log. sine of the sun's declination, the sum will be the log. cosine of the true amplitude; to be reckoned from the north or south according as the declination is north or south.\n\nThe difference between the true and observed amplitudes, reckoned from the same point, and if of the same name, is the variation; but if of a different name, their sum is the variation.\n\nIf the observation be made in the eastern hemisphere, the variation will be east or west according as the observed amplitude is nearer to or more remote from the north than the true amplitude. The contrary rule holds good in observations taken in the western hemisphere.\n\nEx. 1. May 15, 1794, in latitude 33\u00b0 10' N, longitude 18\u00b0 W, about 5h A.M., the sun was observed to rise EBN. Required the variation?\n\nSun's decl.

S 45\u00b0 0' W\n\nVariation -17\u00b0 7' which is east, as the observed amplitude is farther from the north than the true amplitude, the observation being made at sunsetting.\n\nIt may be remarked, that the sun's amplitude ought to be observed at the instant the altitude of its lower limb is equal to the sum of 15 minutes and the dip of the horizon. Thus, if an observer be elevated 18 feet above the surface of the sea, the amplitude should be taken at the instant the altitude of the sun's lower limb is 19 minutes.\n\nProb. II. Given the magnetic azimuth, the altitude and declination of the sun, together with the latitude of the place of observation; to find the variation of the compass.\n\nRule. Reduce the sun's declination to the time and place of observation, and compute the true altitude of the sun's centre.\n\nFind the sum of the sun's polar distance and altitude and the latitude of the place, take the difference between the half of this sum and the polar distance.\n\nTo the log. secant of the altitude add the log. secant of the latitude, the log. cosine of the half sum, and the log. cosine of the difference; half the sum of these will be the log. sine of half the sun's true azimuth, to be reckoned from the south in north latitude, but from the north in south latitude.\n\nThe difference between the true and observed azimuths will be the variation as formerly.\n\nEx. 1.

IV. Of a Ship's Journal.**\n\nA journal is a regular and exact register of all the various transactions that happen aboard a ship whether at sea or land, and more particularly that which concerns a ship's way, from whence her place at noon or any other time may be justly ascertained.\n\nThat part of the account which is kept at sea is called *sea work*; and the remarks taken down while the ship is in port are called *harbour work*.\n\nAt sea, the day begins at noon, and ends at the noon of the following day: the first 12 hours, or those contained between noon and midnight, are denoted by P.M. signifying *after midday*; and the other 12 hours, or those from midnight to noon, are denoted by A.M. signifying *before midday*. A day's work marked Wednesday March 6, began on Tuesday at noon, and ended on Wednesday at noon. The days of the week are usually represented by astronomical characters. Thus \u2609 represents Sunday; \u2601 Monday; \u2602 Tuesday; \u2603 Wednesday; \u2604 Thursday; \u2605 Friday; and \u2606 Saturday.\n\nWhen a ship is bound to a port so situated that she will be out of sight of land, the bearing and distance of the port must be found. This may be done by Mercator's or Middle-latitude Sailing; but the most expeditious method is by a chart. If islands, capes, or headlands intervene, it will be necessary to find the several courses and distances between each successively. The true course between the places must be reduced to the course per compass, by allowing the variation to the right or left of the true course, according as it is west or east.\n\nAt the time of leaving the land, the bearing of some known place is to be observed, and its distance is usually found by estimation. As perhaps the distance thus found will be liable to some error, particularly in hazy or foggy weather, or when that distance is considerable, it will therefore be proper to use the following method for this purpose.\n\nLet the bearing be observed of the place from which the departure is to be taken; and the ship having run a certain distance on a direct course, the bearing of the same place is to be again observed. Now having one side of a plain triangle, namely the distance sailed, and all the angles, the other distances may be found by Prob. I. of Oblique-Sailing.\n\nThe method of finding the course and distance sailed in a given time is by the compass, the log-line, and half-minute-glass. These have been already described. In the royal navy, and in ships in the service of the East India Company, the log is hove once every hour; but in most other trading vessels only every two hours.\n\nThe several courses and distances sailed in the course of 24 hours, or between noon and noon, and whatever remarks are thought worthy of notice, are set down with chalk on a board painted black, called the *log-board*, which is usually divided into five columns: the first column on the left hand contains the hours from noon to noon; the second and third the knots and parts of a knot sailed every hour, or every two hours, according as the log is marked; the fourth column contains the courses steered; the fifth the winds; and in the sixth the various...\nvarious remarks and phenomena are written. The log-board is transferred every day at noon into the log-book, which is ruled and divided after the same manner.\n\nThe courses steered must be corrected by the variation of the compass and leeway. If the variation is west, it must be allowed to the left hand of the course steered; but if east, to the right hand, in order to obtain the true course. The leeway is to be allowed to the right or left of the course steered according as the ship is on the larboard or starboard tack. The method of finding the variation, which should be determined daily if possible, is given in the preceding chapter; and the leeway may be underlined from what follows.\n\nWhen a ship is close hauled, that part of the wind which acts upon the hull and rigging, together with a considerable part of the force which is exerted on the sails, tends to drive her to the leeward. But since the bow of a ship exposes less surface to the water than her side, the resistance will be less in the first case than in the second; the velocity in the direction of her head will therefore in most cases be greater than the velocity in the direction of her side; and the ship's real course will be between the two directions. The angle formed between the line of her apparent course and the line she really describes through the water is called the angle of leeway, or simply the leeway.\n\nThere are many circumstances which prevent the laying down rules for the allowance of leeway. The construction of different vessels, their trim with regard to the nature and quantity of their cargo, the position and magnitude of the sail set, and the velocity of the ship, together with the swell of the sea, are all susceptible of great variation, and very much affect the leeway. The following rules, are, however, usually given for this purpose:\n\n1. When a ship is close hauled, has all her sails set, the water smooth, with a light breeze of wind, she is then supposed to make little or no leeway.\n2. Allow one point when the top-gallant sails are handed.\n3. Allow two points when under close reefed topsails.\n4. Allow two points and a half when one top-sail is handed.\n5. Allow three points and a half when both top-sails are handed.\n6. Allow four points when the fore course is handed.\n7. Allow five points when under the main-sail only.\n8. Allow six points when under balanced mizen.\n9. Allow seven points when under bare poles.\n\nThese allowances may be of some use to work up the day's work of a journal which has been neglected; but a prudent navigator will never be guilty of this neglect.\n\nA very good method of estimating the leeway is to observe the bearing of the ship's wake as frequently as may be judged necessary; which may be conveniently enough done by drawing a small semicircle on the taffrail, with its diameter at right angles to the ship's length, and dividing its circumference into points and quarters. The angle contained between the semidiameter which points right aft, and that which points in the direction of the wake, is the leeway. But the best and most rational way of bringing the leeway into the day's log is to have a compass or semicircle on the taffrail, as before described, with a low crutch or swivel in its centre; after heaving the log, the line may be slipped into the crutch just before it is drawn in, and the angle it makes on the limb with the line drawn right aft will show the leeway very accurately; which, as a necessary article, ought to be entered into a separate column against the hourly distance on the log-board.\n\nIn hard blowing weather, with a contrary wind and a high sea, it is impossible to gain any advantage by sailing. In such cases, therefore, the object is to avoid as much as possible being driven back. With this intention it is usual to lie to under no more sail than is sufficient to prevent the violent rolling which the vessel would otherwise acquire, to the endangering her masts, and straining her timbers, &c. When a ship is brought to, the tiller is put close over to the leeward, which brings her head round to the wind. The wind having then very little power on the sails, the ship loses her way through the water; which ceasing to act on the rudder, her head falls off from the wind, the sail which she has set fills, and gives her fresh way through the water; which acting on the rudder brings her head again to the wind. Thus the ship has a kind of vibratory motion, coming up to the wind and falling off from it again alternately. Now the middle point between those upon which the comes up and falls off is taken for her apparent course; and the leeway and variation is to be allowed from thence, to find the true course.\n\nThe setting and drift of currents, and the heave of the sea are to be marked down. These are to be corrected by variation only.\n\nThe computation made from the several courses corrected as above, and their corresponding distances, is called a day's work; and the ship's place, as deduced therefrom, is called her place by account, or dead reckoning.\n\nIt is almost constantly found that the latitude by account does not agree with that by observation. From an attentive consideration of the nature and form of the common log, that its place is alterable by the weight of the line, by currents, and other causes, and also the errors to which the course is liable, from the very often wrong position of the compass in the binnacle, the variation not being well ascertained, an exact agreement of the latitudes cannot be expected.\n\nWhen the difference of longitude is to be found by dead reckoning, if then the latitudes by account and observation disagree, several writers on navigation have proposed to apply a conjectural correction to the departure or difference of longitude. Thus, if the course be near the meridian, the error is wholly attributed to the distance, and the departure is to be increased or diminished accordingly; if near the parallel, the course only is supposed to be erroneous; and if the course is towards the middle of the quadrant, the course and distance are both assumed wrong. This last correction will, according to different authors, place the ship upon opposite sides of her meridian by account. As these corrections are, therefore, no better than guessing, they should be absolutely rejected.\n\nIf the latitudes are not found to agree, the navigator ought to examine his log-line and half-minute-flags, and correct the distance accordingly. He is then to consider if the variation and leeway have been properly ascertained; if not, the courses are to be again corrected, and\nand no other alteration whatever is to be made on them. He is next to observe if the ship's place has been affected by a current or heave of the sea, and to allow for them according to the best of his judgement. By applying these corrections, the latitudes will generally be found to agree tolerably well; and the longitude is not to receive any farther alteration.\n\nIt will be proper, however, for the navigator to determine the longitude of the ship from observation as often as possible; and the reckoning is to be carried forward in the usual manner from the last good observation; yet it will perhaps be very satisfactory to keep a separate account of the longitude by dead reckoning.\n\nGeneral Rules for working a Day's Work.\n\nCorrect the several courses for variation and leeway; place them, and the corresponding distances, in a table prepared for that purpose. From whence, by Traverse Sailing, find the difference of latitude and departure made good: hence the corresponding course and distance, and the ship's present latitude, will be known.\n\nFind the middle latitude at the top or bottom of the Traverse Table, and the distance answering to the departure found in a latitude column, will be the difference of longitude: Or, the departure answering to the course made good, and the meridional difference of latitude in a latitude column, is the difference of longitude. The sum, or difference of which, and the longitude left, according as they are of the same or of a contrary name, will be the ship's present longitude of the same name with the greater.\n\nCompute the difference of latitude between the ship and the intended port, or any other place whose bearing and distance may be required: find also the meridional difference of latitude and the difference of longitude. Now the course answering the meridional difference of latitude found in a latitude column, and the difference of longitude in a departure column, will be the bearing of the place, and the distance answering to the difference of latitude will be the distance of the ship from the proposed place. If these numbers exceed the limits of the Table, it will be necessary to take aliquot parts of them; and the distance is to be multiplied by the number by which the difference of latitude is divided.\n\nIt will sometimes be necessary to keep an account of the meridian distance, especially in the Baltic or Mediterranean trade, where charts are used in which the longitude is not marked. The meridian distance on the first day is that day's departure; and any other day it is equal to the sum or difference of the preceding day's meridian distance and the day's departure, according as they are of the same or of a contrary denomination.\n### NAVIGATION\n\n**A Journal of a Voyage from London to Funchal in Madeira, in his Majesty's Ship the Resolution, A\u2014\u2014 M\u2014\u2014 Commander, anno 1793.**\n\n| Days of month | Winds | Remarks on board his Majesty's ship Resolution, 1793. |\n|---------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 5 Sep. 28     | SW    | Strong gales and heavy rain.

Hence the distance of the Eddystone at the time the last bearing of the light was taken will be found equal to 18 miles; and as the bearing of the Eddystone from the ship at that time was NE, the ship's bearing from the Eddystone was SE. Now the variation 2\u00b0 points W, being allowed to the left of SW, gives SW 1/2 W, the true course. The other courses are in like manner to be corrected, and inserted in the following table, together with their respective distances, beginning at 10 o'clock A.M. the time when the last bearing of the Eddystone was taken. The difference of latitude, departure, course, and distance made good, are to be found by Traverse Sailing.\n\n| Courses | Diff. | Diff. of Lat. | Departure |\n|---------|-------|---------------|-----------|\n|         |       | N. | S. | E. | W. |\n| SW 1/2 W | 18   | 17.0 | 6.1 |\n| WB 3/4 S | 22   | 5.3  | 21.3 |\n| SW 3/4 W | 58   | 34.6 | 46.6 |\n| S 52\u00b0 3' W | 93 | 56.9 = 57m. | 74\u00b0 |\n\nLatitude by account - 49\u00b0 11' N.\nSum - 99\u00b0 19'\nMiddle latitude - 49\u00b0 40'\n\nNow to middle latitude as a course, and the departure 74m. in a latitude column, the difference of long. in a distance column is 114\u00b0 = 1\u00b0 54' W.\nLongitude of Eddystone - 4\u00b0 24' W.\nLongitude in by account - 6\u00b0 18' W.\n### NAVIGATION\n\n**A Journal from England towards Madeira**\n\n| Hours | Kn. | Fa. | Courses | Winds | Remarks |\n|-------|-----|-----|---------|-------|---------|\n| 1     | 6   | 5   | WSW    | NE    | Freth breezes.

Hence the difference of latitude is 124.8, and the departure 28.2.\n\nThe latitude by account is therefore 45\u00b0 4' N, and the middle latitude 46\u00b0 6', to which, and the departure 28.2 in a latitude column, the difference of longitude in a distance column is 41\u00b0 W; which being added to 12\u00b0 32' W, the yesterday's longitude gives 13\u00b0 13' W, the longitude in by account. But the longitude by observation was 12\u00b0 28' W at half past 8 P.M.; since that time the ship has run 96 miles; hence the departure in that interval is 21.2 m. Now half the difference of latitude 47 m. added to 44\u00b0 59', the latitude by observation at noon, the sum 45\u00b0 46' is the middle latitude; with which and the departure 21.2, the difference of longitude is found to be 31\u00b0 W; which, therefore, added to 12\u00b0 28', the longitude observed, the sum is 12\u00b0 59' W, the longitude by observation reduced to noon.\n\nTo find the bearing and distance of Porto Sancto.\n\n| Latitude ship | 44\u00b0 59' N.

Mer. parts - - - 2746\n\nLatitude at noon - - - 39\u00b0 3 N. Mer. parts - - - 2549\n\nMeridional difference of latitude - - - 197\n\nThen, to course 1 1/2 points, and meridional difference of latitude 197 in a latitude column, the difference of longitude in a departure column is 49\u00b0 W; which added to 14\u00b0 1' W, the longitude by observation, the sum 14\u00b0 50' W is the longitude reduced to noon.\n\nAgain, The distance run between the preceding noon and 9h 22' P.M. is 75 miles; hence the corresponding difference of latitude is 72.8, or 73 miles; the ship's latitude at that time is therefore 40\u00b0 48' N.\n\nLatitude at time of observation - - - 49\u00b0 48' N. Mer. parts - - - 2686\n\nLatitude at noon - - - 39\u00b0 3 N. Mer. parts - - - 2549\n\nMeridional difference of latitude - - - 137\n\nNow, with the corrected course, and meridional difference of latitude, the difference of longitude is 34\u00b0 W; which added to 14\u00b0 20' W, the sum is 14\u00b0 54' W, the reduced longitude. The mean of which and the former reduced longitude is 14\u00b0 52' W, the correct longitude.\n\nVol. XIV.

Other methods might have been used for the same purpose; for which the two instruments already described and explained seem well adapted. We cannot, however, omit recommending the sliding gunter, which will be found very expeditious, not only in performing a day's work, but also in resolving most other nautical problems. See Sliding-Gunter.\n\nIt will be found very satisfactory to lay down the ship's place on a chart at the noon of each day, and her situation with respect to the place bound to, and the nearest land will be obvious. The bearing and distance of the intended or any other port, and other requisites, may be easily found by the chart as already explained; and indeed, every day's work may be performed on the chart; and thus the use of tables superseded.\n\n**EXPLANATION OF THE TABLES.**\n\n**Table I. To reduce points of the compass to degrees, and conversely.**\n\nThe two first and two last columns of this table contain the several points and quarter-points of the compass; the third column contains the corresponding number of points and quarters; and the fourth, the degrees &c., answering thereto. The manner of using this table is obvious.\n\n**Table II. The miles and parts of a mile in a degree of longitude at every degree of latitude.**\n\nThe first column contains degrees of latitude, and the second the corresponding miles in a degree of longitude; the other columns are a continuation of the first and second. If the given latitude consists of degrees and minutes, a proportional part of the difference between the miles answering to the given and following degrees of latitude is to be subtracted from the miles answering to the given degree.\n\n*Example.* Required the number of miles in a degree of longitude, in latitude 57\u00b0 9'.\n\nThe difference between the miles answering to the latitudes of 57\u00b0 and 58\u00b0 is 0.89.\n\nThen as 60' : 9' :: 0.89 : 0.13\n\nMiles answering to 57\u00b0 = 32.68\n\nMiles answering to 57\u00b0 9' = 32.55\n\nThis table may be used in Parallel and Middle Latitude Sailing.\n\n**Table III. Of the Sun's Semidiameter.**\n\nThis table contains the angle subtended by the sun's semidiameter at the earth, for every sixth day of the year. The months and days are contained in the first column, and the semidiameter expressed in minutes and seconds in the second column. It is useful in correcting altitudes of the sun's limb, and distances between the sun's limb and the moon.\nTABLE IV. Of the Refraction in Altitude.\n\nThe refraction is necessary for correcting altitudes and distances observed at sea; it is always to be subtracted from the observed altitude, or added to the zenith distance. This table is adapted to a mean state of the atmosphere in Britain, namely, to 29.6 inches of the barometer, and 50\u00b0 of the thermometer. If the height of the mercury in these instruments be different from the mean, a correction is necessary to reduce the tabular to the true refraction. See REFRACTION.\n\nTABLES V. VI. Of the Dip of the Horizon.\n\nThe first of these tables contain the dip answering to a free or unobstructed horizon; and the numbers therein, as well as in the other table, are to be subtracted from the observed altitude, when the fore-observation is used; but added, in the back-observation.\n\nWhen the sun is over the land, and the ship nearer it than the visible horizon when unconfined: in this case, the sun's limb is to be brought in contact with the line of separation of the sea and land; the distance of that place from the ship is to be found by estimation or otherwise; and the dip answering thereto, and the height of the eye, is to be taken from Table VI.\n\nTABLE VII. Of the Correction to be applied to the time of high water at full and change of the moon, to find the time of high water on any other day of the moon.\n\nThe use of this table is fully explained at Section II. Chap I. Book I. of this article.\n\nTABLES VIII. IX. X. Of the Sun's Declination, &c.\n\nThe first of these tables contains the sun's declination, expressed in degrees, minutes, and tenths of a minute, for four successive years, namely, 1793, 1794, 1795, and 1796; and by means of Table X. may easily be reduced to a future period; observing that, after the 28th of February 1800, the declination answering to the day preceding that given is to be taken.\n\nEx. I. Required the sun's declination May 1, 1816?\n\nMay 1, 1812 is four years after the same day in 1812.\n\nSun's declination May 1, 1812 - 15\u00b0 6.7 N\n\nEquation from Table X. - +0.6\n\nSun's declination May 1, 1799 - 15\u00b0 7.3 N\n\nEx. II. Required the sun's declination August 20, 1805?\n\nThe given year is 12 years after 1793, and the time is after the end of February 1800.\n\nNow, Sun's dec. August 19, 1793 - 12\u00b0 34' 6\"\n\nEquation from Table X. to 12 years - - 1\u00b0 9'\n\nSun's declination August 20, 1805 - 12\u00b0 32' 7\"\n\nThe declination in Table VIII. is adapted to the meridian of Greenwich, and Table IX. is intended to reduce it to any other meridian, and to any given time of the day under that meridian. The titles at the top and bottom of this table direct when the reduction is to be added or subtracted.\n\nTABLE XI. Of the Right Ascensions and Declinations of Fixed Stars.\n\nThis table contains the right ascensions and declinations of 60 principal fixed stars, adapted to the beginning of the year 1793. Columns fourth and fifth contain the annual variation arising from the precession of the equinoxes, and the proper motion of the stars; which serves to reduce the place of a star to a period a few years after the epoch of the table with sufficient accuracy. When the place of a star is wanted, after the beginning of 1793, the variation in right ascension is additive; and that in declination is to be applied according to its sign. The contrary rule is to be used when the given time is before 1793.\n\nExample. Required the right ascension and declination of Bellatrix, May 1, 1798.\n\nRight ascension January 1, 1793 = 5h 14' 3\"\n\nVariation = 3\".21 \u00d7 5\u00bd y. = +0 0 17\n\nRight Ascension, May 1, 1798 = 5h 14' 20\"\n\nDeclination = 6\u00b0 8' 53\" N\n\nVariation = 4\" \u00d7 5\u00bd y. = +0 0 21\n\nDeclination May 1, 1798 = 6\u00b0 9' 14\" N\n\nThe various other tables necessary in the practice of navigation are to be found in most treatises on that subject. Those used in this article are in Mackay's Treatises on the Longitude and Navigation.\n### Table I.

See Phoenicia and Trade.\n\nInland Navigation, the method of conveying commodities from one part of a country to another by means of rivers, lakes, canals, or arms of the sea. See Canal.\n\nWe have already, under Canal, taken notice of a method proposed by Dr Anderson of raising and lowering vessels by means of mechanical powers, instead of dams and locks. We shall describe another mechanical contrivance proposed by Mr Leach for the same purpose. This machinery is composed of an inclined plane and wheel in axis. The inclined plane is a parallelogram whose length reaches from the end of one canal to the beginning of another, or to the sea or navigable river, to which the vessel is next to be conveyed; the breadth ought to be 22\u00bd feet. It may be made of good oak or deal plank, and sufficiently strong to bear the weight to be laid upon it; and it must be very strongly supported by beams of oak or other wood. It ought to be divided in the middle by a ledge or rib of 12 inches square, the side ribs being nine by 12 inches. The elevation must depend upon particular circumstances. Fig. 1 shows the inclined part of the machine; AB being the wooden part just described, placed between the side of the hill W and the navigable river F. According to the dimensions already given, the two paths A and B on which the vessels move are exactly ten feet wide. G represents the canal, brought perhaps from the distance of several miles to the top of the precipice WW. At the end of the canal, and quite across from R to R, must be built a very strong wall; in which are two sluices with flood gates at K and L, to let out the water occasionally. Between the head of the plane AB, and the end of the canal G, is a horizontal platform divided into two parts, as is represented in the figure by the letters HI. At the end of the canal are six rollers M and N, of use in carrying the boats and lighters in and out of the canal. Near the end of the canal, at S, and T, are two other sluices, with their flood-gates, for letting out a quantity of fluid to drive the other part of the machine. O and P represent the two ends of the towing paths, one on each side of the canal.\n\nFig. 2 shows the vehicle by which the lighters are conveyed up and down the inclined plane, by the two paths A and B, fig. 1. AA (fig. 2) represents part of the inclined plane, B the vehicle in the position in which it rolls up and down the two paths. C is the body of the vehicle, which is made hollow, to contain a quantity of water occasionally used as a counterbalance for its corresponding vehicle. DDD are three rollers between the bottom of the vehicle and the plane, for the purpose of rolling the boats up and down. HHH are six rollers: four by the horizontal part of the vehicle on which the boat E is to rest in its passage up and down the plane; the other two rollers are in a moveable part, which is fastened to the body of the vehicle with a pair of very strong hinges; and in the passage of the vehicle up and down the plane, it turns up between the head of the boat and the plane, preventing the former from rubbing against the plane. When the vehicle gets up to the top, this moveable part falls down on the platform marked HI, becoming parallel with the horizontal part of the vehicle; after which it serves for a launch and passage to place the boat upon the rollers MN (fig. 1) at the end of the canal. This passage part of the vehicle, together with the three rollers at the end of the canal, is likewise of great use in towing a boat out of the canal, in order to place it on the horizontal part. At the bottom of the cavity of the vehicle is a large hole F, with a valve opening inwardly. Through this hole the water enters when the vehicle sinks into the navigable river F, for the purpose of receiving a boat on the top or horizontal part of the vehicle till it is quite full and then will sink entirely under water, while the boat is towed in on the horizontal part. A small rope K is fastened to the valve, on purpose to lift it up and to keep it so, while the vehicle and boat are ascending up the plane out of the canal; that so the water may discharge itself till as much as is necessary be got out, or till it becomes an equal balance for the corresponding vehicle and its contents, which are defending by the other path. Hence we see, that every machine must have two of these vehicles furnished with rollers as already described, and so constructed that one may be as nearly as possible a counterbalance to the other. As it is necessary that the vehicles should be water tight, the inside of them must be caulked very tight; and they should be spacious enough to hold as much water as will balance the largest boat with its contents. Here it may be observed, that every vessel will be balanced by as many cubic feet of water as it displaces by being put into the water when loaded. The quantity may easily be known, by observing how far the boat sinks in the water, and calculating the bulk of the part immersed.\n\nThe machine which puts the vehicles in motion, may either be constructed with an under-shot or breast-water wheel; or by an over-shot water-wheel; or by two walking-wheels, for men to walk in as in cranes, &c.\n\nFig. 3 shows a front view of the under-shot water-wheel movement; where A is the end of the axis or cylinder of the cog or spur wheel; the diameter of which axis is four feet, and its length not less than 22 feet, as it must be extended quite across the canal from one side to the other, and placed on the top of very strong supports on each side of the canal, about seven feet above the surface of the water, as the loaded boat is to pass backwards and forwards under the cylinder, and at a convenient distance from the wall RR (fig. 1), and placed between the two sluices S and T; on the end of which cylinder is the cog-wheel B (fig. 3). The wheel B is supposed to be 20 feet of diameter, having on its edge 120 cogs; and underneath the cog-wheel is the breast-water one C, 24 feet in diameter, from the tip of one aller-board to the tip of its opposite. On the end of the axis of the water-wheel D is a trundle two feet and a half in diameter, with 15 rounds and flaves contained therein. This must be placed between the two sluices S and T, to let the water out of the canal; which, falling on the float-boards, will turn the wheel round from the right hand towards the left, when the sluice on the left hand of the wheel is opened; but the contrary way when that of the right is opened.\u2014The water falling.\nInland Na- falling upon the boards passes along with the wheel in the circular cavity EGF, and is discharged at G, whatever way the wheel may turn.\n\nTo the axis or cylinder of this machine, which must always be horizontal, are fixed a pair of strong ropes; the ends of each pair fastened to the upper part of the cylinder; it being necessary that they should act in contrary directions. Each must extend the whole length of the plane, and their strength must be proportioned to the weight necessary to be sustained. The two vehicles already mentioned are fastened to the other ends of the ropes; so that one pair of the ropes are wound up by the cylinder turning one way, and the other by its turning the contrary way. Thus when one of the vehicles is at the upper part of the path A, ready to discharge its boat and cargo into the upper canal, the other boat will be at the foot of the path B, all under water in the lower canal, and ready for the reception of a boat to be towed in on the horizontal part of it; so that as one vehicle rolls up on one side of the plane, the other will roll down on the other side, and vice versa.\n\nFig. 4 shows the movement by means of an overshot water-wheel. It consists of a water-wheel C, and two spur or cog wheels A and B. The water-wheel is 18 feet in diameter, and has two rows of buckets placed contrariwise to one another, that it may turn round in contrary directions, according as the one or the other sluice, S, or T, is opened. On its axis F is a trundle of three feet diameter, having 18 rounds or flaves which fall into the cogs of the second spur-wheel B, causing it to turn round in a direction contrary to that of the water-wheel. This second wheel is likewise 18 feet in diameter, with a trundle of three feet having 18 rounds or flaves.\u2014The diameter of the upper spur-wheel A is also 18 feet, but the diameter of its axis is six feet. On the edge of the wheel are 108 cogs. These fall in between the flaves of the axis of the other spur-wheel; and thus the third wheel turns round the same way with the water wheel C. The cylinder of this upper spur-wheel must be placed across the canal between the two sluices, on very strong supports, as explained in the former movement; and the two pair of ropes in the same manner.\n\nThe movement of the walking wheel is shown (fig. 5.). A1 and A2 are two wheels for men to walk in, each of them 24 feet in diameter. B1 and B2 are the axes or cylinders of the two wheels, of equal lengths; viz. 11 feet each, and four in diameter.\u2014At one end of each of the two cylinders C1 and C2, is a wheel of the same diameter with the cylinder. On the edges of these wheels are teeth of an equal number in each wheel; and as the teeth of the wheels mutually fall into each other, the revolutions of both must be performed in the same time. By this contrivance also the cylinders will turn different ways; and the ropes on the two different cylinders will constantly one pair be wound up, and the other wound down, by the natural moving of the machine. DDD is the frame that supports the whole, which must be made very firm and secure.\n\nLet us now suppose, that there is a boat in the upper canal to be brought down, but none to go up for a balance. In this case, as one of the vehicles must be at the top to receive the boat, the other will be at the bottom to take in water. Let then any of the movements just described be set to work, and it is plain, that as the upper vehicle with its boat descends, the under vehicle will ascend with the water; the valve being in the mean time lifted up till a sufficient quantity of water has flowed out, to make the one nearly a counterbalance to the other; so that the vessel may slide down gently and without any violence.\n\nIf it happens that a boat is to go up while none is to come down, one of the vehicles being at the foot of the plane under water, and in readiness to have the boat towed upon its horizontal part, one of the sluices at K or L is to be opened, and a quantity of water let into the cistern of the upper vehicle sufficient to counterbalance the boat with its contents which is to ascend. This being done, the machine is set to work, the valve of the under vehicle kept open till the water is all discharged; and then the boat will roll up to the top of the plane.\n\nFrom this description of the canal and machinery for raising and lowering the vessels, the reader can be at no loss to understand the principles on which it depends. It would be superfluous to adduce examples, or follow our author through his calculations relative to particular cases. We shall only observe, that the difference of time in which vessels may be raised or lowered by the machinery just described, in comparison with what can be done in the common way by dams and locks, must give a very favourable idea of the new method. According to Mr Leach's computations, a boat with its cargo weighing 10 tons might be raised by the walking machine in 12 or 14 minutes, by the under-shot wheel in 15 minutes, and by the overshot wheel in 30 minutes; and that through a space of no less than 30 fathoms measured on the inclined plane, or 114 feet perpendicular.\n\nNAVIGATORS ISLANDS.

The whole house is a very irregular building; the rooms numerous, accessible by 16 staircases, with most frequent and sudden ascents and descents, &c. The great hall has a gallery at one end, adorned with four vast crests carved in wood, viz. a griffin and dolphin, with the scolops; an unicorn, and an ox with a coronet round his neck. In front is a figure in wood of an armed man; two others, perhaps valets, in short jackets and caps. The top and upper end of the room is painted in squares, representing the Saxon kings and heroes. This castle was built by one of the Dacres about the reign of Henry III. In the garden walls were stones with Roman inscriptions, which the late earl of Carlisle gave to Sir Thomas Robinson, and were by him removed to his museum at Rookby: On one of these stones is this inscription, pediment centum quinquaginta Britannorum; whence it appears that the Romans, when in possession of Britain, sometimes indulged the national troops with the favour of garrisoning their own territories.","sp":372,"ep":372},{"h":"NAXIA","t":"or NAXOS, a considerable island of the Archipelago, 25 miles in length, and 88 in circumference.

This island has no harbour; and yet they carry on a considerable trade in barley, wine, figs, cotton, silk, flax, cheese, salt, oxen, sheep, mules, and oil. They burn only oil of mastic, though olive oil is exceedingly cheap. It is inhabited both by Greeks and Latins, who live in great dread of the Turks; for when the meanest of their ships appear here, they always wear red caps like galley-slaves, and tremble before the lowest officer; but as soon as they are gone, they put on their caps of velvet. The ladies are so vain, that when they return out of the country, they have 40 women in their train, half on foot and half on asses, one of whom carries a napkin or two, another a petticoat, another a pair of stockings, and so on; which is a very ridiculous sight to strangers. There are four archbishops fees in this island, and a great many villages; but so thin of people, that the whole island does not contain above 8000 inhabitants. The highest mountain is Zia, which signifies \"the mountain of Jupiter.\" There are but few antiquities, except some small remains of the temple of Bacchus.

The great fertility of the country gave rise to the name of Little Sicily, Naxus being the most fruitful of all the Cyclades, as Agathamerus informs us, and no less fertile than Sicily itself. As for the name of Naxus, some assert that it was borrowed from one Naxus, under whose conduct the Carians possessed themselves of the island; others pretend it received its name from Naxus, the son of Endymion. Stephanus, Suidas, and Phavorinus, derive the name of Naxos, from the Greek word naxos, signifying, \"to sacrifice,\" and will have it to have been so called from the many sacrifices offered here to Bacchus. With these Bochart agrees, as to its being called Naxos from the sacrifices performed here in honour of Bacchus, but will have the word naxos to be a corruption of the Phoenician naeifa, or niefa, signifying \"a sacrifice, offering.\" Naxos is, according to Pliny, 75, but reckoned by the present inhabitants 100 miles in compass. It has Paros to the west, Myconos and Delos to the north, and Ios to the south. This island is the most fruitful of the Archipelago, and was formerly famed for the excellent wines it produced. Archilochus, as quoted by Athenaeus, compares them to the nectar of the gods; and Asclepiades, cited by Stephanus, affirms us, that Bacchus took more delight in Naxos than in any other place whatsoever, having himself taught the inhabitants to cultivate their vines. The wine of Naxos maintains to this day its ancient reputation, being by some deemed the best of the Levant. Besides wine, this island abounds with all sorts of delicious fruits, the plains being covered with orange, olive, lemon, cedar, citron, pomegranate, mulberry, and fig trees. It was formerly famous for quarries of that sort of marble which the Greeks called ophites, from its being green, and speckled with white spots like the skin of a serpent. The best emerald is found here on the mountains near the western coast, whence the neighbouring cape is called by the Italians capo smaragdo, or the emerald cape. As to the inhabitants of Naxos, Diodorus relates that the island was first peopled by the Thracians. Thess were in a little time subdued by a body of Thessalians, who, having possessed the island for the space of 200 years and upwards, were compelled to abandon it by a drought and famine.\n\nAfter the Trojan war, the Carians settled here, and called the island Naxos, from their king, who was the son of Polemon. He was succeeded by his son Leucippus, and Leucippus by his son Smardius, in whose reign Theseus, coming out of Crete, landed here with Ariadne, whom he was, in his sleep, commanded by Bacchus to leave in this island. In process of time a colony of Cnidians and Rhodians settled here under the conduct of Hippothous and Xuthus; and last of all the Ionians, who, in time, possessed the whole island; whence the Naxians are, by Herodotus, called Ionians, and ranged among the Athenian colonies.

When one of them visits her, he walks round the house, striking with his sabre on his buckler; he then opens his door, and leaves a domestick with his arms in a kind of porch, who serves to inform others that the lady is engaged. It is said, that one day in the week the four doors are all opened, and all her husbands visit her, and dine together with her. Each husband gives a sum of money, or portion, at the time of marriage; and the wife only has the charge of the children. The Nayres, even the Samoim, and the other princes, have no other heirs than the children of their fathers. This law was established, that the Nayres, having no family, might be always ready to march against the enemy. When the nephews are of age to bear arms, they follow their uncles.

Eusebius says, it is 15 miles from Legion towards the east. This city is much celebrated in the Scriptures, for having been the usual place of the residence of Jesus Christ for the first 33 years of his life, Luke ii. 51. It was there our Saviour became incarnate, where he lived in obedience to Joseph and Mary, and from whence he took the name of a Nazarean. After he had begun to execute his mission, he preached there sometimes in the synagogue, Id. iv. 16. But because his countrymen had no faith in him, and were offended at the manner of his original, he did not many miracles there, Matth. xiii. 54, 58; nor would he dwell therein; so he fixed his habitation at Capernaum for the latter part of his life, Id. iv. 13. The city of Nazareth was situated upon an eminence; and on one side there was a precipice, from whence the Nazareans one day had a design of throwing down our Saviour, because he upbraided them with their incredulity, Luke iv. 29.\n\nSt Epiphanius says, that in his time Nazareth was only a village, and that to the reign of Constantine it was inhabited by Jews alone, exclusive of all Christians. Adamnanus, a writer of the seventh age, says, that in his time there were two great churches to be seen at Nazareth, one in the midst of the city, built upon two arches, in the place where our Saviour's house had stood. Under the two arches now mentioned, was a very fine fountain, which furnished water to the whole city, and from whence water was drawn also by the help of a pulley for the use of the church above. The second church of Nazareth was built in a place where the house stood wherein the angel Gabriel revealed to the virgin Mary the mystery of our Lord's incarnation; and we are assured that the church of Incarnation, which is supported by two arches, is still in being to this\nNazareth, this day. Mr Maundrell tells us, that there is a convent built over what is said to be the place of annunciation; for the chamber where she received the angel's salutation was about 500 years ago removed from Nazareth, and, according to the Roman legends, transported by angels to Loreto, then a small village in the pope's dominions, now become a bishopric, &c.\n\nHowever, Calmet's opinion (which is certainly the true one) upon the different translations of this famous house of Loreto, is, that they were no other than so many different buildings made upon the model of the church of Nazareth, just as in several places sepulchres have been built upon the model of that at Jerusalem. Mariti tells us, that in the eastern part of the city stands the church dedicated to the Blest Virgin: the zeal of the Cenobites raised it from the ruins of that which had been destroyed by the Saracens. It is a very handsome building, and consists of three naves; in the middle of which is the principal altar; to which there is an ascent by two magnificent stairs, much admired for their iron balustrades, the work of an ingenious monk of the convent. The descent to the grotto or annunciation chapel below is by steps of beautiful marble, cut with great taste. Two beautiful columns of oriental granite strike the eye of the observer in the entrance. They appear to have been constructed both to support and ornament the grotto. The altar of this subterranean chapel is extremely elegant; and the different kinds of marble with which it is ornamented, receive an additional lustre from the combined light of several silver lamps presented by Christian princes. On solemn festivals, the walls and the pilasters are ornamented with various pieces of tapestry, representing the mysteries of the virgin; a superb present from the House of Austria. In the western part of the city stands a Christian church, built, as it is said, on the site of the ancient synagogue where Jesus showed the Jews the accomplishment of the prophecies in his person. This place served a long time as a shelter for flocks, but at present it is in good repair. In the neighbourhood may be seen a fountain of excellent water, which is, however, esteemed by the people on another account. They conjecture that it was contiguous to the habitation of the virgin, and that it was used by her. At some distance is a large stone of a round form, called Christ's Table. It is pretended that he came hither more than once with his disciples to eat. The inhabitants of Nazareth pay it a kind of worship, burning perfumes and incense around it. It is situated in 34\u00b0 E. Long, and in 32\u00b0 N. Lat.; and formerly held the third rank under the patriarch of Jerusalem. At present it is part of the domains of the chief of Acre. The ancient city, after the ravages of fanaticism, was reduced to a miserable hamlet, containing only a few Arab huts.\u2014Under the protection of Daher Omar, however, it recovered very considerably, and is now of far more importance.","sp":373,"ep":374},{"h":"NAZARITE","t":"or Nazarean, or Nazarines, a term which may signify, 1. One that is of Nazareth, or any native of this city. 2. It was given to Jesus Christ and his disciples, and is commonly taken in a sense of derision and contempt in such authors as have written against christianity. 3. It has been taken for a sect of heretics called Nazareans. 4. For a Nazarite, a man that has laid himself under the obligation of a vow to observe the rules of Nazariteness, whether it be for Nazarite his whole life, as Samson and John the Baptist, or only for a time, as those mentioned in Numbers vi. 18, 19, 20. Amos ii. 11, 12. Lastly, The name Nazarite, in some passages of Scripture, denotes a man of particular distinction and great dignity in the court of some prince. But we must speak of these several sorts of Nazarites something more distinctly.\n\nThe name of Nazarene belongs to Jesus Christ, not only because of his having lived the greatest part of his life at Nazareth, and because this city has always been considered as his country, but also because the prophets had foretold that he should be called a Nazarene, Matth. ii. 23. \"And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.\" We find no particular place in the prophets in which it is said that the Messiah should be called a Nazarene; and St Matthew only quotes the prophets in general. Perhaps he would intimate, that the consecration of the Nazarites, and the great purity of which they made profession, was a type and a sort of prophecy of those of our Saviour, or else that the name \u05e0\u05d6\u05d9\u05e8 or Nazarite given to the patriarch Joseph, Gen. xlii. 26. Deut. xxxiii. 16. was a prophecy which was to be fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, of whom Joseph was a figure. Lastly, St Jerome was of opinion, that St Matthew here alludes to that passage of Isaiah xi. 1. and lx. 21. \"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch (in Hebrew \u05e0\u05d6\u05e8) shall grow out of his roots.\" This branch or \u05e0\u05d6\u05e8, and this rod, are certainly intended to denote Jesus Christ, by the general consent of all the fathers and interpreters.\n\nWhen the word Nazarean is put for the heretics known by this name, it denotes Christians converted from Judaism, whose chief error consisted in defending the necessity or expediency of the works of the law, and who obstinately adhered to the practice of the Jewish ceremonies. The name of Nazarenes at first had nothing odious in it, and it was often given to the first Christians. The fathers frequently mention the gospel of the Nazarenes, which differs nothing from that of St Matthew, which was either in Hebrew or Syriac, for the use of the first converts, but was afterwards corrupted by the Ebionites. These Nazarenes preserved this first gospel in its primitive purity. Some of them were still in being in the time of St Jerome, who does not reproach them with any error. They were very zealous observers of the law of Moses, but held the traditions of the Pharisees in very great contempt.\n\nNazarite, when put to signify those under the ancient law who made a vow of observing a more than ordinary degree of purity (Numb. ubi. cit.), denotes a man or woman who engage themselves by a vow to abstain from wine and all intoxicating liquors, to let their hair grow without cutting or shaving, not to enter into any house that was polluted by having a dead corpse in it, nor to be present at any funeral. And if by chance any one should have died in their presence, they began again the whole ceremony of their consecration and Nazariteness. This ceremony generally lasted eight days, sometimes a month, and sometimes their whole lives. When the time of their Nazariteness\nNazarene ship was accomplished, the priest brought the person to the door of the temple, who there offered to the Lord a he lamb for a burnt-offering, a she lamb for an expiatory sacrifice, and a ram for a peace-offering. They offered likewise loaves and cakes, with wine necessary for the libations. After all this was sacrificed and offered to the Lord, the priest or some other shaved the head of the Nazarite at the door of the tabernacle, and burnt his hair, throwing it upon the fire of the altar. Then the priest put into the hand of the Nazarite the shoulder of the ram roasted, with a loaf and a cake, which the Nazarite returning into the hands of the priest, he offered them to the Lord, lifting them up in the presence of the Nazarite. And from this time he might again drink wine, his Nazaritehip being now accomplished.\n\nAs to those that were perpetual Nazarites, as were Samson and John the Baptist, it appears that they were consecrated to their Nazaritehip by their parents, and continued all their lives in this state, without drinking wine or cutting their hair.\n\nThose that made a vow of Nazaritehip out of Palestine, and could not come to the temple when their vow was expired, contented themselves with observing the abstinence required by the law, and after that cutting their hair in the place where they were; as to the offerings and sacrifices prescribed by Moses, which were to be offered at the temple by themselves, or by others for them, they deferred this till they could have a convenient opportunity. Hence it was, that St Paul being at Corinth, and having made the vow of a Nazarite, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea, and put off fulfilling the rest of his vow till he should arrive at Jerusalem. Acts xviii. 18. When a person found that he was not in a condition to make a vow of Nazaritehip, or had not leisure to perform the ceremonies belonging to it, he contented himself by contributing to the expense of the sacrifice and offerings of those that had made and fulfilled this vow; and by this means he became a partaker in the merit of such Nazaritehip.\n\nWhen St Paul came to Jerusalem, in the year of Christ 58, the apostle St James the Less, with the other brethren, said to him, Acts xxii. 23, 24, that to quiet the minds of the converted Jews, who had been informed that he everywhere preached up the entire abolition of the law of Moses, he ought to join himself to four of the faithful who had a vow of Nazaritehip upon them, and contribute to the charge of the ceremony at the shaving of their heads; by which the new converts would perceive that he continued to keep the law, and that what they had heard of him was not true.\n\nThe Hebrew word Nazir, or Nazarite, which is made use of to express a man exalted to great dignity, as it is said of the patriarch Joseph, Gen. xlii. 26, and Deut. xxxiii. 16, \"that he was separate from his brethren,\" as it is in our translation; or as the Vulgate and others understand the Hebrew, \"that he was a Nazarite among his brethren,\" is variously understood. Some think that the Hebrew word \u05e0\u05d6\u05d9\u05e8, Nazir, in these places, signifies one who is crowned, chosen, separated, or distinguished; the word \u05e0\u05d6\u05d9\u05e8, Nazir signifies a crown. The Septuagint translates this word a chief, or him that is honoured. Calmet thinks that this was a term of dignity in the courts of eastern princes, and that at this day in the court of Persia the word Nazir signifies the superintendent general of the king's household, the Nazirian chief officer of the crown, the high steward of his family, treasurers, and revenues; and that in this sense Joseph was the Nazir of the court of Pharaoh. Le Clerc translates the Nazir, a prince, and calls Joseph \"the prince of his brethren,\" in the two places already quoted. Mr Pool declares in favour of this last translation.

Herodotus, as he is quoted by Cudworth, mentions an oracle which declared that \"God himself could not shun his destined fate.\" And among the fragments of Philemon collected by Le Clerc, is the following sentence:\n\n\u0394\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f41 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72\u03bd, \u1f41 \u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd.\n\n\"We are subject to kings, kings to the gods, and God to Necessity.\" Hence it is, that, in the Iliad, we find Jove himself, the fire of gods and men, regretting that he was restrained by Necessity from refusing his favourite son from the sword of Patroclus. Nay to such a height was this impiety carried in the earliest ages of Greece, that we find Hesiod and Homer teaching that the gods themselves were generated by Necessity, of Night and Chaos.\n\nThis power, though always represented as blind and unintelligent, was however worshipped as a goddess, bearing in her hand large iron nails, wedges, anchors, and melted lead, as emblems of the inflexible severity of her nature. \"In the city of Corinth she had a temple, in which the goddess Violence likewise reigned, and into which no person was ever permitted to enter but the priest who officiated in sacris.\"\n\nLearned men have exercised their ingenuity in vain attempts to trace this potentest notion to its origin. Some, who wished to interpret it in a pious sense, have supposed that the gods who are subject to Necessity were only those who were the ministers of the supreme numen; and that by necessity itself was meant nothing more than divine providence. But this is not consistent with Hesiod and Homer's Generation of the Gods, or with the epithets fava necesse, dura necesse, by which this power was perpetually distinguished. Others, and among them Moheim, have supposed that this monstrous fable was invented by the Pagan priests, and diligently inculcated upon the minds of the people, in order to excuse the vilenesses of the objects of their worship. For, says he, who could be indignant at Jupiter's numberless adulteries, after it was known that in all his actions he was the servant of blind Necessity: In the thefts of Mercury, the whoredoms of Venus, and the frequent squabbles of the other gods, there could be no moral turpitude, if they were under the influence of a superior power.\n\nNumina cum videas duris obnoxia futis,\nInviaque polys exonerare deos.\nNecesflty. This account of the matter is at least as plausible as any other which is usually given; but the real case undoubtedly was, that when men \"did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient; when their foolish heart was darkened, and professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.\" See PARCE.\n\nNecessity, in Law, as it implies a defect of will, excuses from the guilt of crimes. See Crime.\n\nCompulsion and inevitable necessity are a constraint upon the will, whereby a man is urged to do that which his judgement disapproves; and which, it is to be presumed, his will (if left to itself) would reject. As punishments are therefore only inflicted for the abuse of that free will which God has given to man, it is highly just and equitable that a man should be excused for those acts which are done through unavoidable force and compulsion.\n\n1. Of this nature, in the first place, is the obligation of civil subjection, whereby the inferior is constrained by the superior to act contrary to what his own reason and inclination would suggest: as when a legislator establishes iniquity by a law, and commands the subject to do an act contrary to religion or sound morality. How far this excuse will be admitted in furo conscientiae, or whether the inferior in this case is not bound to obey the divine rather than the human law, it is not our business to decide; though, among the casuists, it is believed the question will hardly bear a doubt. But, however that may be, obedience to the laws in being is undoubtedly a sufficient extenuation of civil guilt before the municipal tribunal. The sheriff who burnt Latimer and Ridley, in the bigotted days of Queen Mary, was not liable to punishment from Elizabeth for executing so horrid an office; being justified by the commands of that magistracy which endeavoured to restore Superstition, under the holy auspices of its merciless filter, Persecution.\n\nAs to persons in private relations, the principal case where constraint of a superior is allowed as an excuse for criminal misconduct, is with regard to the matrimonial subjection of the wife to her husband: for neither a son nor a servant are excused for the commission of any crime, whether capital or otherwise, by the command or coercion of the parent or master; though in some cases the command or authority of the husband, either express or implied, will privilege the wife from punishment, even from capital offences. And therefore, if a woman commit theft, burglary, or other civil offences against the laws of society, by the coercion of her husband, or even in his company, which the law construes a coercion, she is not guilty of any crime; being considered as acting by compulsion, and not of her own will. This doctrine is at least 1000 years old in this kingdom, being to be found among the laws of King Ina the West Saxon. And it appears, that among the northern nations on the continent, this privilege extended to any woman transgressing in concert with a man, and to any servant that committed a joint offence with a freeman: the male or freeman only was punished, the female or slave dismissed; procul dubio quod alterum liberatis, alterum necessitas impelleret. But (besides that, in our law, which is a stranger to slavery, no impunity is given to servants, who are as much free agents as their masters) even with regard to wives, this rule admits of an exception in crimes that are mala in se, and prohibited by the law of nature; as murder, and the like: not only because these are of a deeper dye, but also, since in a state of nature no one is in subjection to another, it would be unreasonable to screen an offender from the punishment due to natural crimes, by the refinements and subdivisions of civil society. In treason also (the highest crime which a member of society can, as such, be guilty of), no plea in coverture shall excuse the wife; no presumption of the husband's coercion shall extenuate her guilt; as well because of the odiousness and dangerous consequence of the crime itself, as because the husband, having broken through the most sacred tie of social community by rebellion against the state, has no right to that obedience from a wife, which he himself as a subject has forgotten to pay. In inferior misdemeanours also, we may remark another exception, that a wife may be indicted and set in the pillory with her husband, for keeping a brothel: for this is an offence touching the domestic economy or government of the house, in which the wife has a principal share; and is also such an offence as the law presumes to be generally conducted by the intrigues of the female sex. And in all cases where the wife offends alone, without the company or coercion of her husband, she is responsible for her offence as much as any femme-folle.\n\n2. Another species of compulsion or necessity is what our law calls dura per minas; or threats and menaces, which induce a fear of death or other bodily harm, and which take away for that reason the guilt of many crimes and misdemeanors, at least before the human tribunal. But then that fear which compels a man to do an unwarrantable action ought to be just and well-grounded; such, \"qui cadere posse in virum constaret, non timentium et metuendorum,\" as Bracton expresses it, in the words of the civil law. Therefore, in time of war or rebellion, a man may be justified in doing many treasonable acts by compulsion of the enemy or rebels, which would admit of no excuse in the time of peace. This, however, seems only, or at least principally, to hold as to positive crimes, so created by the laws of society, and which therefore society may excuse; but, not as to natural offences, so declared by the law of God, wherein human magistrates are only the executioners of divine punishment. And therefore though a man be violently assaulted, and hath no other possible means of escaping death but by killing an innocent person, this fear and force shall not acquit him of murder; for he ought rather to die himself than escape by the murder of an innocent. But in such a case he is permitted to kill the assailant; for there the law of nature, and self-defence its primary canon, have made him his own protector.\n\n3. There is a third species of necessity, which may be distinguished from the actual compulsion of external force or fear; being the result of reason and reflection, which act upon and constrain a man's will, and oblige him to do an action which without such obligation would be criminal. And that is, when a man has his choice of two evils set before him, and, being under a necessity of choosing one, he chooses the least pernicious.\npernicious of the two. Here the will cannot be said freely to exert itself, being rather passive than active; or, if active, it is rather in rejecting the greater evil than in choosing the less. Of this sort is that necessity, where a man by the commandment of the law is bound to arrest another for any capital offence, or to disperse a riot, and resistance is made to his authority: it is here justifiable, and even necessary, to beat, to wound, or perhaps to kill, the offenders, rather than permit the murderer to escape, or the riot to continue. For the preservation of the peace of the kingdom, and the apprehending of notorious malefactors, are of the utmost consequence to the public; and therefore excuse the felony, which the killing would otherwise amount to.\n\n4. There is yet another case of necessity, which has occasioned great speculation among the writers upon general law; viz. whether a man in extreme want of food or clothing may justify stealing either, to relieve his present necessities. And this both Grotius and Puffendorf, together with many other of the foreign jurists, hold in the affirmative; maintaining by many ingenious, humane, and plausible reasons, that in such cases the community of goods, by a kind of tacit concession of society, is revived. And some even of our lawyers have held the same; though it seems to be an unwarranted doctrine, borrowed from the notions of some civilians; at least it is now antiquated, the law of England admitting no such excuse at present. And this its doctrine is agreeable not only to the sentiments of many of the wisest ancients, particularly Cicero, who holds, That siem cuique incommodum ferendum est, potius quam de alterius commodis detrahendum est; but also to the Jewish law, as certified by King Solomon himself: \"If a thief steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry, he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give all the substance of his house:\" which was the ordinary punishment for theft in that kingdom. And this is founded upon the highest reason: for men's properties would be under a strange insecurity, if liable to be invaded according to the wants of others; of which wants no man can possibly be an adequate judge but the party himself who pleads them. In England especially, there would be a peculiar impropriety in admitting so dubious an abuse: for by the laws such sufficient provision is made for the poor by the power of the civil magistrate, that it is impossible that the most needy stranger should ever be reduced to the necessity of thieving to support nature. The case of a stranger is, by the way, the strongest instance put to Baron Puffendorf, and wherein he builds his principal arguments: which, however they may hold upon the continent, where the parsimonious industry of the natives orders every one to work or starve, yet must lose all their weight and efficacy in England, where charity is reduced to a system, and interwoven in our very constitution. Therefore our laws ought by no means to be taxed with being unmerciful, for denying this privilege to the necessitous; especially when we consider, that the king, on the representation of his ministers of justice, hath a power to soften the law, and to extend mercy in cases of peculiar hardship. An advantage which is wanting in many states, particularly those which are democratical: and these have in its stead introduced and adopted, in the body of the law itself, a multitude of circumstances tending to alleviate its rigour. But the founders of our constitution thought it better to vest in the crown the power of pardoning particular objects of compassion, than to countenance and establish theft by one general undistinguishing law.","sp":376,"ep":378},{"h":"NECHO","t":"king of Egypt, began his reign 690 B.C., and was killed eight years after by Sabacon king of Ethiopia. Pianmiticus his son succeeded him, and was the father, as Herodotus informs us, of Necho II. who reigned in the 616 B.C. This Necho II. is celebrated in history for attempting, though in vain, to cut a canal from the Nile to the Arabian gulf. He carried his arms as far as the Euphrates, and conquered the city of Carchemish. This prince is not only known in Scripture under the name of Necho, but also in profane history. He no sooner succeeded to the crown than he raised great land armies, and fitted out vast fleets, as well upon the Mediterranean as upon the Red Sea: he gave battle to the Syrians near the city of Migdol; routed them, and made himself master of the city of Cadys. The learned, however, are not agreed about this city Cadys. Some will have it to be Cades in Arabia Petraea, others Jerusalem; and others say it is the city of Cedes, or Kedesh, in Galilee, in the tribe of Naphtali.\n\nThe Scriptures acquaint us with the whole expedition of Necho in all its particulars, 2 King xxiii. 29. &c. and 2 Chr. xxxv. 20, 21, &c. In the year of the world 3394, this prince having drawn out his army into the field to make war with the Assyrians or Babylonians, and to take the city of Carchemish, otherwise called Circuism, upon the Euphrates, Josiah king of Judah, who was a tributary to the king of Babylon, marched to oppose his passage. Necho, who had no designs against him, sent to tell him, \"What have I to do with you, king of Judah? It is not against you that I am come forth, but against another people, against whom the Lord has commanded me to make war. Leave off therefore to set yourself against me for fear the Lord should punish you for your resistance.\" But Josiah would not hearken to the remonstrances of Necho, but gave him battle at Megiddo, where he received the wound of which he died. The people of Jerusalem set up Jehoahaz for king of Judah, and Necho soon palled forwards, without making any longer stay in Judea.\n\nBut at his return from his expedition, which was very successful, he halted at Riblah in Syria; and sending for Jehoahaz king of the Jews, he deposed him, loaded him with chains, and sent him into Egypt. Then coming to Jerusalem, he set up Eliakim, or Jehoiakim, in his place, and exacted the payment of 100 talents of silver and one talent of gold from the country. Jeremiah (xlvii. 2.) acquaints us, that the city of Carchemish was taken from Necho by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim king of Judah; so that Necho did not enjoy his conquest above four years. Josephus adds, that the king of Babylon pursuing his victory, brought under his dominion all the country which is between the Euphrates and Egypt, excepting Judea. Thus Necho was again reduced within the limits of his own country.","sp":378,"ep":378},{"h":"NECROLIUM","t":"a word used by some of the alchemical writers to express a remedy almost always capable of averting death, and continuing life to its utmost period.","sp":379,"ep":379},{"h":"NECROLOGY","t":"necrologium, formed of \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \"dead,\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, \"discourse or enumeration,\" a book anciently kept in churches and monasteries, wherein were registered the benefactors of the same, the time of their deaths, and the days of their commemoration; as also the deaths of the priors, abbots, religious, canons, &c.

The conquests of Sesostris might introduce it into India; the Israelites would naturally borrow it from the people among whom they sojourned 400 years; and it would easily find its way into Phoenicia, from the vicinity of that country to the land of its nativity. From the Egyptians and Phoenicians it was adopted, with the other rites of paganism, by the Greeks; and it was imported into Rome with Grecian literature and Grecian manners. It was not however confined to the pagan nations of antiquity; it spread itself through all the modern nations of Europe, and took such deep root as to be long retained even after those nations were converted to the Christian faith.\n\nOf its early antiquity we have complete evidence in the writings of Moses, where it is severely condemned as an abomination to the Lord; and though it appears to have been even then spread into Phoenicia, we might yet conclude its birth-place to have been Egypt, because, at their exodus, the Israelites were corrupted only by Egyptian superstitions, and because necromancy seems to be one of those whorehouses which the prophet Ezekiel represents his countrymen as having brought with them from Egypt, and continued to practise till they were carried captives into Babylon.\n\nIf from sacred we proceed to consult profane authors, we shall find them not only affirming Egypt to have been the birthplace of necromancy, but in some degree accounting for the origin of so impious a delusion.\n\nFrom Diodorus the Sicilian we learn, that the Grecian fable of Charon the ferryman of hell, of Styx, Cocytus, the Elysian Fields, Tartarus, the judgement of Minos and Rhadamanthus, &c. with the whole scenery of the infernal regions, were imported from Egypt into Greece. The ancient Egyptians, and indeed all the people of the east, made use of caves for burying places, which were well suited to the solemn sadnefs of the surviving friends, and proper receptacles for those who were never more to behold the light. In Egypt, many Necromancers of those subterraneous cavities, being dug out of the natural rock, still remain, and command the admiration of travellers; and near to the pyramids in particular there are some apartments of a wonderful fabric, which though they extend in length 4400 feet, and are about 30 feet in depth, appear to have been, if not entirely dug, at least reduced to form by the chisel or pickaxe of the artist.\n\nFrom the practice of burying in such caverns sprung the opinion that the infernal mansions were situated somewhere near the centre of the earth, which by the Egyptians was believed to be not very distant from its surface. In these dreary mansions, it was very easy for such adepts as the priests of Egypt to fabricate Erebus, Tartarus, the Elysian Fields, and all those scenes which were displayed before the initiated (see Mysteries), and by them described to the million of the people. As it was in those dark abodes that necromancy was practised, it would be no difficult matter for such magicians as withstood Moses to impose so far upon the credulous vulgar, as to make them believe, that in consequence of their invocations they actually saw the ghosts of their friends ascend out of the earth. It appears from the book of Exodus, that the Israelitish women were, even in the wilderness, well acquainted with the use of the mirror, which was therefore undoubtedly known to the Egyptians. But a mirror of a particular form and properly illuminated at the instant required, might easily be made to reflect, in a cavern from which all other light was carefully excluded, the image of the deceased, who was called upon by the necromancer; and we can readily conceive, that with respect to the question to be propounded, a person might be concealed, prepared to give such ambiguous answers as would satisfy the inquirer, and at the same time save the credit of the oracle. The terrified imaginations of the spectators would aid the delusion, and make a very slight resemblance pass for the ghost or shade of their departed friend; or the necromancer might assign plausible reasons why a spectre, after having dwelt for some time in the infernal regions, should lose something of its resemblance to the body which it animated. Such juggling tricks, though performed by artists less accomplished than Jannes and Jambres, have gained credit among people much more enlightened than the Egyptians could possibly have been when the science of necromancy was invented by their priests.\n\nThat the Israelites, notwithstanding the prohibition of their legislator, continued to practise the rites of necromancy, is apparent from Saul's transaction with the witch of Endor (see Magic). From the same transaction, it is likewise apparent that the witches of Israel, and therefore in all probability the necromancers of Egypt, pretended to evocate the ghosts of the dead by a demon or familiar spirit, which they had at their command to employ upon every emergency. This demon was called Ob; and therefore Saul desires his servants to find him a woman who was mistress of an Ob (A).\n\n(A) The original, or radical, signification of this word occurs in Job xxxii. ver. 19.; where Elihu compares his belly to new bottles, which he calls oboth, the plural of ob. But as bottles were then made of leather, new bottles filled with wine and ready to burst, as Elihu describes them, would of course be of a form nearly globular.\nIt is probable that those wretched impostors had in their pay some persons who occasionally acted the part of the demon, and when the execution of the plot required their agency, emitted, by means of a cavity dug for that purpose, a low hollow voice from below the ground. Hence we find Isaiah, in his denunciations against Ariel, saying, \"Thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground; and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit (an ob) out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.\"\n\nBut though the Egyptian priests were undoubtedly the inventors of the whole mystery of necromancy, and though it was from them imported into Greece by the Selli or priests of Dodona, it does not appear that the Grecian necromancers pretended to be masters of obs or familiar spirits. Mopius, Orpheus, Linus, Eumolpus, &c., who either travelled into Egypt in quest of knowledge, or were actually natives of that country, instructed the early Greeks in this occult science: but whatever might be the practice of these apostles themselves, their disciples professed to do all the feats of magic by performing certain rites, by offering certain sacrifices, by muttering a certain form of words, by charms, spells, and exorcisms. By these they pretended to evoke the dead as certainly as the Egyptians and Jews did by their familiar spirits. By a final display of critical learning this might be easily proved from the popular story of Orpheus and Eurydice, which certainly was founded on one of these necromantic deceptions exhibited in a cave near Dodona, where the priests had a hallowed or infernal mansion, in humble imitation of those with which the first of them were well acquainted in Egypt. It is indeed evident, without the aid of criticism: no man of any letters is ignorant, that whatever superstitions of this kind prevailed among the Romans were borrowed from the Greeks. But we all know that Virgil makes one of his shepherds, by means of certain herbs, poisons, and seerlike charms, raise up ghosts from the bottoms of their graves; and Lucan has fabricated a story of this kind, which may be considered as an exact parallel to the witch of Endor. Just before the battle of Pharsalia he makes young Pompey travel by night to a Thessalian forest, and anxiously inquire of her the issue of the war. This female necromancer, by a tedious process of charms and incantations, conjures up the ghost of a soldier who had been lately slain. The phantom, after a long preamble, denounces a prediction much of the same kind with that which the king of Israel received from Samuel at Endor; and though we have elsewhere shown, that nothing but the spirit of God could have foreseen the inevitable destruction of Saul, his sons, and his army (see Magic), it was very easy for any man of tolerable sagacity to foresee the defeat of Pompey's raw and undisciplined troops by the hardy veterans of the victorious Caesar.\n\nIt would be endless to enumerate all the fallacious evocations of ghosts, and the ambiguous responses returned by those pretended spirits, of which we have accounts from the poets and historians of the celebrated nations of antiquity. We shall therefore proceed to mention a few which occur in the fabulous history of more modern nations, and then leave the subject to the meditation of our readers. In Mallet's Northern Antiquities, we have the following account of a necromantic exploit, between which, and the descent of the ancient heroes into hell, it is impossible not to remark a striking similitude.\n\n\"Odin the sovereign of man arises. He saddles his horse Sleipner; he mounts, and is conveyed to the subterraneous abode of Hel. The dog which guards the gates of death meets him. His breath and his jaws are stained with blood. He opens his voracious mouth to bite, and barks a long time at the father of magic. Odin pursues his way; and the infernal cavern resounds and trembles under his horse's hoofs. At length he reaches the deep abode of death, and stops near the eastern gate, where stands the tomb of the prophetess. He sings with a voice adapted to call up the dead; he looks towards the world; he engraves Runic characters on her tomb; he utters mysterious words; and he demands an answer, until the prophetess is constrained to arise and thus utter the words of the dead.\u2014'Who is this unknown that dares to disturb my repose, and drag me from the grave, in which I have been dead so long, all covered with snow, and moistened with the rains?' &c.\n\nThe Gaelic druids pretended to be masters of the same secret. This is evident from the name of a species of divination, not uncommon among the Scotch Highlanders so lately as in the beginning of the 18th century. By a gentleman excellently versed in the antiquities of that people, and a steady friend to the writer of this article, we have been informed, that not many years ago some of the Highlanders relied implicitly upon certain oracular responses, called in their language taghairm. This word seems to be compounded of ta, which in some parts of the Highlands is still used to denote a spirit or ghost, and ghaim, which signifies calling upon or invoking. Taghairm, therefore, in its original import, is necromancy in the most proper sense of that word.\n\nThere were different kinds of taghairm, of which one was very lately practised in Skye. The diviner covered himself with a cow's hide, and repaired at night to some deep-founding cave, whither the person who consulted\n\nlar. Hence it may be inferred that the original import of ob was round or globular: but b and p being labials, are often changed into each other; and therefore, from the Hebrew ob is derived the Greek \u03bf\u03b2, oculus, oculatus, oculus, and the Latin ops, a name under which the earth was worshipped. Upis was a name of Diana or the moon: the father of one of the Dianas was likewise Upis; but this Upis was undoubtedly the sun. Now the difference between upis and opis is nothing; hence we are led to believe, that as they are all derived from ob, this word was employed by the early idolaters of Egypt to denote the first and greatest of Pagan gods, the sun. If so, those wretches who pretended to be ministers of obis, were exactly the same kind of impostors with the Pythoneses of the Greeks.\nNecromancers followed soon after without any attendants.\n\nAt the mouth of the cave he propounded aloud the questions of which he wanted solutions; and the man within pronounced the responses in a tone of voice similar to that with which the OBS, or pretended demons of antiquity, gave from beneath the ground their oracular answers. That in the latter days of *taghairm*, the Gaelic diviners pretended to evoke ghosts, and from them to extort solutions of difficulties proposed, we have no positive evidence; but that such was the original pretence there can be little doubt, when we reflect either upon the place where this species of divination was practised, or upon the import of the word by which it was denominated.\n\nAs we have been led to mention *taghairm*, we shall beg leave to make a few observations on another species of it, called *taghairm an uighe*, or \"taghairm by water.\" This too was last practised in the Isle of Skye, by a man of the name of M'Cuidhean, whose ancestors had long been famous for the art. He lived near a beautiful cascade on a small river; and when consulted on any matter of consequence, he covered his whole body with a cow's hide, that necessary implement of Highland divination, and placed himself between the water of the cascade and the rock over which it flowed. Then another man with a heavy pole gave repeated strokes to the water, and the diviner behind it crying out now and then in Gaelic, \"Is this a flock of arm?\" This operation was continued till M'Cuidhean was perceived to be frantic or furious, when he was considered as in a condition to answer the most important questions. He was frequently consulted about futurity; and though he could not, in the proper sense of the word, be called a necromancer, his responses were listened to as proceeding from something more than human. A degree of frenzy, either real or affected, seems to have accompanied the predictions of certain kinds of diviners in all ages; and we cannot help remarking the similarity between the madness of M'Cuidhean and that of the Sibyl in the fifth book of the *\u00c6neid*; though we cannot suppose the one to have been borrowed from the other.\n\n*At, Phabi nondum patientes, immanis in antro Bacchatur vates, magnum si pectore puffit Executif Deum: tanto magis ille fatigat Oe rabidum, fera corda domans, singulique premendo.*\n\nStruggling in vain, impatient of her load,\nAnd lab'ring underneath the vind'rous god;\nThe more she strove to shake him from her breast,\nWith more and far superior force he press'd.\n\n**DRYDEN.**\n\nThat all these pretences, whether ancient or modern, to the power of divination by means of familiar spirits, or by the art of necromancy, were groundless as well as impious, it would be affronting the understandings of our readers to offer any proof. Under the article MAGIC we have said enough on the subject, and perhaps more than enough, to those who know that demons, if they have any existence, and the departed spirits of good and bad men, are all under the control of Him who governs the intellectual as well as material world by fixed and equal laws.\u2014These details of superstition, however, will not be useless, if, by showing how poor and wretched a creature man becomes when Necropolis left to his own inventions, they shall make any one grateful for the benefits of good government, and the blessings of revealed religion.","sp":379,"ep":381},{"h":"NECTANEBUS","t":"or **NECTANABIS**, a king of Egypt, who defended his country against the Persians.

Linnaeus might, with equal propriety, have termed it a part or appendage of the itamina, calyx, or pointal, as the appearance in question is confined to no particular part of the flower, but is as various in point of situation as of form. The truth is, the term *nectarium* is exceedingly vague; and, if any determinate meaning can be affixed to it, is expressive of all the singularities which are observed in the different parts of flowers.\n\nThe tube, or lower part of flowers with one petal, Linnaeus considers as a true nectarium, because it is generally found to contain the sweet liquor formerly mentioned. This liquor Pontedera compares to that called *amnio* in pregnant animals, which enters the fertile or impregnated seeds; but that this is not at\nNectarium least its sole use, is evident from this circumstance, that the honey or liquor in question is to be found in flowers where there are either no seeds, or those which, from the want of male organs, cannot be impregnated. Thus the male flowers of nettle and willow, the female flowers of sea-side laurel and black bryony, the male and female flowers of clutia, kiggelaria, and butcher's broom, all abound with the honey or nectar alluded to.\n\nVaillant was of opinion, that the nectarium was an essential part of the corolla; for which reason he distinguished the singular appearances in fennel flower and columbine by the name of petals; the coloured leaves which are now termed the petals he denominates the flower cup.\n\nThat the nectarium, however, is frequently distinct from the petals, is evident both from the well known examples just mentioned, as likewise from the flowers of monkshood, hellebore, ilapyrum, fennel flower of Crete, barrenwort, gras of Parnassus, chocolate nut, cherleria, and sauvagea.\n\nThese general observations being premised, we proceed to take a nearer and more particular view of the principal diversities, both in form and situation, of this striking appendage to the flower. 1. In many flowers the nectarium is shaped like a spur or horn; and that either in flowers of one petal, as valerian, water milfoil (uricularia), butterwort, and calves-foot; or in such as have more than one, as larkspur, violet, fumitory, balsam, and orchis. 2. In the following plants, the nectarium is properly a part of the corolla, as lying within the substance of the petals: ranunculus, lily, iris, crown imperial, water leaf, mouse tail, ananas or pine apple, dog's-tooth violet, pipe-reed buth, valliflora, hermannia, uvaria, and swertia. 3. The nectarium is frequently placed in a series or row within the petals, though entirely unconnected with their substance. In this situation it often resembles a cup, as in narcissus. A nectarium of this kind is said by Linnaeus to crown the corolla. The following are examples: daffodil, fea daffodil, campion, viscid cam- pion, fennel-wort, flabella, cynanchum, nepenthes, cherleria, balsam-tree, African spirea, witch-hazel, olax, and passion-flower. 4. In Indian-cress, buckler, mustard, Barbadoes cherry, and monotropa, the nectarium is situated upon or makes part of the calyx. 5. The nectarium in bastard flower-fence is seated upon the anther or tops of the stamens; whence the name adenandra, or glandular anthera, which has been given to this genus of plants. In the following list it is placed upon the filaments; bean-caper, bay, fraxinella, marvel of Peru, bell-flower, lead-wort, rocella, and com melina. 6. In hyacinth, flowering-rush, stock July flower, and rocket, the nectarium is placed upon the seed-bud. 7. In honey-flower, orpine, buckwheat, col linonia, lathrea, navelwort, mercury, clutia, kiggelaria, sea-side laurel, and African spirea, it is attached to the common receptacle. Lastly, In ginger, nettle, dyer's weed, heart-seed, coffea, turmeric, grewia, bastard-orpine, vanellae, threew-tree, and willow, the nectarium is of a very singular construction, and cannot properly fall under any of the foregoing heads.\n\nIn discriminating the genera, the nectarium often furnishes an essential character.\n\nPlants which have the nectarium distinct from the petals, that is, not lodged within their substance, are affirmed by Linnaeus to be generally poisonous. The following are adduced as examples: monkshood, hel lebore, cumbine, fennel-flower, gras of Parnassus, barren-root, oleander, marvel of Peru, bean-caper, succulent fennel-wort, fraxinella, and honey-flower.","sp":381,"ep":382},{"h":"NECTROPOLIS","t":"a suburb of Alexandria in Egypt.

The rush, stripped of its bark, was as commonly in use with them as with us for this purpose; and they also used the nettle, this mullein, and many other plants, whose stalks were composed of tough filaments, for the same purpose; beating them out like hemp, and when dry dipping them in melted resin, and other such inflammable substances. When thus prepared, they are readily inflammable, like our flambeau; and this mullein, having stalks more long and large, and more firm than all the others, was used to make those lights with which they set fire to the funeral pile, for consuming the ashes of their dead friends.","sp":382,"ep":382},{"h":"NECYDALIS","t":"a genus of insects belonging to the order of coleoptera.

His father, who had once possessed a considerable patrimony at Hilston, in the county of Monmouth, was of the younger and Catholic branch of the Needham family: the head of the elder and Protestant branch was Lord Kilmory, created vicount in the year 1625. The father of Mr Needham died young, and left but a small fortune to his four children. His eldest son, who is the subject of this article, prosecuted his studies under the secular clergy of the English college of Douay, where he took orders, taught rhetoric for several years, gave eminent proofs of sagacity and genius, and surpassed all the other professors of that seminary in the knowledge of experimental philosophy. In 1740, he was engaged by his superiors in the service of the English mission, and was intrusted with the direction of the school erected at Twyford, near Winchester, for the education of the Roman Catholic youth. In 1744, he was appointed professor of philosophy in the English college at Lilbon, where, on account of his bad health, he remained only 15 months. After his return, he passed several years at London and Paris, which were principally employed in microscopical observations, and in other branches of experimental philosophy. The results of these observations and experiments were published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1749, and in a volume in 1750 at Paris in 1750; and an account of them was also given by M. de Buffon, in the first volumes of his Natural History. There was an intimate connexion between this illustrious French naturalist and Mr Needham: they made their experiments and observations together;\nNeedham together; though the results and systems which they deduced from the same objects and operations were totally different. Mr Needham was admitted to a place in the Royal Society of London in the year 1747, and in the Antiquarian Society some time after. From the year 1751 to 1767 he was chiefly employed in finishing the education of several English and Irish noblemen, by attending them as tutor in their travels through France, Italy, and other countries. He then retired from this wandering life to the English seminary at Paris, and in 1768 was chosen by the Royal Academy of Sciences in that city a corresponding member.\n\nWhen the regency of the Austrian Netherlands, in order to the revival of philosophy and literature in that country, formed the project of an Imperial academy, which was preceded by the erection of a small literary society to prepare the way for its execution, Mr Needham was invited to Brussels by Count Cobenzel and the president Neny, and was appointed successively chief director of both these foundations. He held this place, together with some ecclesiastical preferments in the Low Countries, until his death, which happened the 30th of December 1781. \"His piety, temperance, and purity of manners (we follow the expressions of the abb\u00e9 Mann) were eminent: his attachment to the doctrines and duties of Christianity was inviolable. His zealous opposition to modern infidels was indefatigable, and even passionate. His probity was untainted. He was incapable of every species of duplicity; his beneficence was universal, and his unsuspicious candour rendered him often a dupe to perfidy.\" These and other good qualities the panegyrist attributes to his deceased friend; and the learned authors of the Monthly Review, to whom Mr Needham was known, admit the justness of the panegyric. He was undoubtedly (say they), both an honest man and a worthy citizen; but though his death be a real loss to the literary world, yet he died seasonably for himself; for had he lived to see Joseph II. and the Great, making free with the paint, patches, and trinkets of the mother church, confiscating her lands, abolishing her convents, suppressing her holidays, introducing common sense into her worship, erecting political conductors to disperse the thunder of the Vatican, and achieving many other things in this style of improvement, it would have vexed full force his feeling heart. For this honest man was narrow even to superstition and bigotry in his religious system; and we never knew a man in whom there was such an unaccountable mixture of implicit faith and philosophical curiosity as in Mr Needham. He was a keen and judicious observer of nature, had a peculiar dexterity in confirming his observations by experiments, and he was always occupied (sometimes indeed with too much fancy and precipitation) in generalizing facts, and reducing them to his system. \"His pen (says Abb\u00e9 Mann) was neither remarkable for fecundity nor method: his writings are rather the great lines of a subject expressed with energy, and thrown upon paper in a hurry, than finished treaties.\" His works are well known both in Britain and in France.\n\nNeedham, a town in Suffolk, 73 miles from London, stands on the Orwell, 9 miles from Ipswich, in the road to Huntingdonshire.\n\n**Needle**, a very common little instrument or utensil made of steel, pointed at one end, and pierced at the other, used in sewing, embroidery, tapestry, &c.\n\nNeedles make a very considerable article in commerce, though there is scarce any commodity cheaper, the consumption of them being almost incredible.\u2014The sizes are from No. 1, the largest, to No. 25, the smallest. In the manufacture of needles, German and Hungarian steel is of most repute.\n\nIn the making of them, the first thing is to pass the steel through a coal fire, and under a hammer, to bring it out of its square figure into a cylindrical one. This done, it is drawn through a large hole of a wire-drawing iron, and returned into the fire, and drawn through a second hole of the iron smaller than the first; and thus successively from hole to hole, till it has acquired the degree of fineness required for that species of needles; observing every time it is to be drawn, that it be greased over with lard, to render it more manageable. The steel thus reduced to a fine wire, is cut in pieces of the length of the needles intended. These pieces are flattened at one end on the anvil, in order to form the head and eye: they are then put into the fire to soften them farther; and thence taken out and pierced at each extreme of the flat part on the anvil, by force of a puncher of well-tempered steel, and laid on a leaden block to bring out, with another puncher, the little piece of steel remaining in the eye. The corners are then filed off the square of the heads, and a little cavity filed on each side of the flat of the head; this done, the point is formed with a file, and the whole filed over: they are then laid to heat red hot on a long narrow iron, crooked at one end, in a charcoal fire; and when taken out thence, are thrown into a bath of cold water to harden. On this operation a good deal depends; too much heat burns them, and too little leaves them soft; the medium is learned by experience. When they are thus hardened, they are laid in an iron shovel, on a fire more or less brisk in proportion to the thickness of the needles; taking care to move them from time to time. This serves to temper them, and take off their brittleness; great care here too must be taken of the degree of heat. They are then straightened one after another with the hammer, the coldness of the water used in hardening them, having twisted the greatest part of them.\n\nThe next process is the polishing them. To do this, they take 12,000 or 15,000 needles, and range them in little heaps against each other on a piece of new buckram sprinkled with emery dust. The needles thus disposed, emery-dust is thrown over them, which is again sprinkled with oil of olives; at last the whole is made up into a roll, well bound at both ends. This roll is then laid on a polishing table, and over it a thick plank loaded with stones, which two men work backwards and forwards a day and a half, or two days, successively; by which means the roll thus continually agitated by the weight and motion of the plank over it, the needles within it being rubbed against each other with oil and emery, are infinitely polished. After polishing, they are taken out, and the filth washed off them with hot water and soap: they are then wiped in hot bran, a little moistened, placed with the needles in a round box, suspended in the air by a cord, which is kept stirring till the bran and needles be dry. The needles thus wiped in two or three different brans,\nare taken out and put in wooden vessels, to have the good separated from those whose points or eyes have been broken either in polishing or wiping; the points are then all turned the same way, and smoothed with an emery stone turned with a wheel. This operation finishes them, and there remains nothing but to make them into packets of 250 each. Needles were first made in England by a native of India, in 1543, but the art was lost at his death; it was, however, recovered by Christopher Greening in 1560, who was settled with his three children, Elizabeth, John, and Thomas, by Mr Damar, ancestor of the present Lord Milton, at Long Crendon in Bucks, where the manufactory has been carried on from that time to this present day.\n\nDipping-Needle, or Inclinatory Needle, a magnetic needle, so hung, as that, instead of playing horizontally, and pointing out north and south, one end dips, or inclines to the horizon, and the other points to a certain degree of elevation above it.\n\nThe dipping-needle was invented in the year 1576, by one Robert Norman, a compass-maker at Wapping. The occasion of the discovery, according to his own account, was, that it being his custom to finish and hang the needles of his compasses before he touched them, he always found, that immediately after the touch, the north-point would bend or incline downward, under the horizon; infomuch that, to balance the needle again, he was always forced to put a piece of wax on the south end as a counterpoise. The facility of this effect led him at length to observe the precise quantity of the dip, or to measure the greatest angle which the needle would make with the horizon; and this at London he found to be 71\u00b0 50\u2032. In 1723, Mr Graham made a great many observations on the dipping needle, and found the angle to be between 74\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 degrees. Mr Nairne, in 1772, found it to be somewhat above 75\u00b0. It is not certain whether the dip varies, as well as the horizontal direction, in the same place. The trifling difference between Mr Norman and Mr Nairne would lead us to imagine that the dip was unalterable; but Mr Graham, who was a very accurate observer, makes the difference more considerable. It is certain, however, from a great number of experiments and observations, that the dip is variable in different latitudes, and that it increases in going northwards. It appears from a table of observations made with the marine dipping-needle in a voyage towards the north pole in 1733, that in lat. 60\u00b0 18\u2032, the dip was 75\u00b0; and in lat. 70\u00b0 45\u2032, it was 79\u00b0 52\u2032; in lat. 80\u00b0 12\u2032, it was 81\u00b0 52\u2032; and in lat. 80\u00b0 27\u2032, it was 82\u00b0 21\u2032.\n\nSeveral authors have endeavoured to apply this discovery of the dip to the finding of the latitude; and Mr Bond attempted to apply it to the finding of the longitude also; but for want of observations and experiments he could not make any progress. The affair was farther prosecuted by Mr Whitton, who published a treatise on the longitude, and for some time imagined it was possible to find it exactly by means of the dip of the needle; yet he at last despaired of it, for the following reasons; 1. The weakness of the magnetic power. 2. The concussion of the ship, which he found it exceedingly difficult to avoid so much as was necessary for the accuracy of the experiments. 3. The principal objection was an irregularity in the motions of all magnetic needles, both horizontal and dipping, by which they, within the compass of about a degree, vary uncertainly backward and forward; even sometimes in a few hours time, without any evident cause. For a particular account of these variations, both of the horizontal and dipping needle, see the article Variation.\n\nMr Nairne made a dipping needle in 1772 for the Board of Longitude, which was used in the voyage towards the north pole. This is represented at fig. 2. The needle AA is 12 inches long, and its axis, the ends BB of which are made of gold, alloyed with copper, rests on friction wheels CCCC, of four inches diameter, each end on two friction wheels; which wheels are balanced with great care. The ends of the axis of the friction wheels are likewise of gold alloyed with copper, and moved in small holes made in bell metal; and opposite to the ends of the axes of the needle and the friction wheels, are flat agates, set in DDDD, finely polished. The magnetic needle vibrates within a circle of bell metal, EEEE, divided into degrees and half-degrees; and a line, passing through the middle of the needle to the ends, points to the divisions. The needle of this instrument was balanced before it was made magnetic; but by means of a cross, the ends of which are FFFFF, (contrived by the reverend Mr Mitchell) fixed on the axis of the needle, on the arms of which are cut very fine screws to receive small buttons, that may be screwed nearer or farther from the axis, the needles may be adjusted both ways to a great nicety, after being made magnetic, by reversing the poles, and changing the sides of the needle. GG are two levels, by which the line of 0 degrees of the instrument is set horizontal, by means of the four adjusting screws LLLLL; H is the perpendicular axis, by which the instrument may be turned, that the divided face of the circle may front the east or west; to this axis may be fixed an index I, which points to an opposite line on the horizontal plate K when the instrument is turned half round; MMMM are screws which hold the glass cover to keep the needle from being disturbed by the wind. When this needle is constructed for sea, it is suspended by an universal joint on a triangular stand, and adjusted vertically by a plumb line and button above the divided circle; and the dovetail work at the upper 90\u00b0; and the divisions on the circle are adjusted so as to be perpendicular to the horizon by the same plumb line, and an adjoining screw; and when it is adjusted, a pointer annexed to a screw, which serves to move the divided circle, is fixed at the lowest 90\u00b0. Whenever the instrument is used to find the dip, it must be so placed that the needle may vibrate exactly in the magnetic meridian.\n\nMagnetic Needle, in Navigation, a needle touched with a lodestone, and sustained on a pivot or centre; on which playing at liberty, it directs itself to certain points in or under the horizon; whence the magnetic needle is of two kinds, viz. horizontal or inclinatory. See the article Magnet.\n\nHorizontal needles are those equally balanced on each side of the pivot that sustains them, and which, playing horizontally with their two extremes, point out the north and south points of the horizon. For their application and use, see the article Compass.\n\nIn the construction of the horizontal needle, a piece of pure steel is provided; of a length not exceeding five inches.\nNeedles, inches, lest its weight should impede its volubility; very thin, to take its verticity the better; and not pierced with any holes, or the like, for ornament sake, which prevent the equable diffusion of the magnetic virtue. A perforation is then made, in the middle of its length, and a brads cap or head foldered on, whose inner cavity is conical, so as to play freely on a style or pivot headed with a fine steel point. The north point of the needle in our hemisphere is made a little lighter than the southern; the touch always destroying the balance, if well adjusted before, and rendering the north end heavier than the south, and thus occasioning the needle to dip.\n\nThe method of giving the needle its verticity or directive faculty has been shown already under the article Magnet; but if, after touching, the needle be out of its equilibrium, something must be filed off from the heavier side, till it balance evenly.\n\nNeedles in sea compasses are usually made of a rhomboidal or oblong form; we have given their structure already under the article Compass.\n\nThe needle is not found to point precisely to the north, except in very few places; but deviates from it more or less in different places, and that too at different times; which deviation is called its declination or variation from the meridian. See the article Variation.\n\nSurgeons Needles are generally made crooked, and their points triangular; however they are of different forms and sizes, and bear different names, according to the purposes they are used for.\n\nThe largest are needles for amputation; the next, needles for wounds; the finest, needles for sutures. They have others, very short and flat, for tendons; others, still shorter, and the eye placed in the middle, for tying together of vessels, &c. Needles for couching cataracts are of various kinds; all of which have a small, broad, and sharp point or tongue, and some with a fulcus at the point. Surgeons have sometimes used two needles in this operation; one with a sharp point for perforating the coats of the eye, and another with a more obtuse point for depressing or couching the opaque crystalline lens; but care should be taken in the use of any of these, that they be first well polished with cloth or leather, before they are applied to the eye.\n\nMr Warner observes, that the blade of the couching needle should be at least a third part larger than those generally used upon this occasion, as great advantages will be found in the depressing of the cataract, by the increased breadth of the blade of that instrument. The handle, also, if made somewhat shorter than usual, will enable the operator to perform with greater readiness, than he can do with a larger handled instrument.\n\nIt is to be observed, that needles of silver pierce more easily in stitching arteries after an amputation, than those made of steel.\n\nNeedle Fish.

The use of the negative sign, in algebra, is attended with several consequences that at first sight are admitted with difficulty, and has sometimes given occasion to notions that seem to have no real foundation. This sign implies, that the real value of the quantity represented by the letter to which it is prefixed is to be subtracted; and it serves, with the positive sign, to keep in view what elements or parts enter into the composition of quantities, and in\nNegative what manner, whether as increments or decrements, (that is, whether by addition or subtraction), which is of the greatest use in this art.\n\nIn consequence of this, it serves to express a quantity of an opposite quality to the positive, as a line in a contrary position; a motion with an opposite direction; or a centrifugal force in opposition to gravity; and thus often saves the trouble of distinguishing and demonstrating separately, the various cases of proportions, and preserves their analogy in view. But as the proportions of lines depend on their magnitude only, without regard to their position, and motions and forces are said to be equal, or unequal, in any given ratio, without regard to their directions; and, in general, the proportion of quantity relates to their magnitude only, without determining whether they are to be considered as increments or decrements; so there is no ground to imagine any other proportion of $-b$ and $+a$ (or of $-1$ and $1$) than that of the real magnitudes of the quantities represented by $b$ and $a$, whether these quantities are, in any particular case, to be added or subtracted. It is the same thing to subtract the decrement, as to add an equal increment, or to subtract $-b$ from $a-b$, as to add $+b$ to it; and because multiplying a quantity by a negative number implies only a repeated subtraction of it, the multiplying $-b$ by $-n$, is subtracting $-b$ as often as there are units in $n$; and is therefore equivalent to adding $+b$ so many times, or the same as adding $+nb$. But if we infer from this, that $i$ is to $-n$ as $-b$ to $nb$, according to the rule, that unit is to one of the factors as the other factor is to the product, there is no ground to imagine, that there is any mystery in this, or any other meaning than that the real magnitudes represented by $i$, $n$, $b$, and $nb$ are proportional. For that rule relates only to the magnitude of the factors and product, without determining whether any factor, or the product, is to be added or subtracted. But this likewise must be determined in algebraic computations; and this is the proper use of the rules concerning the signs, without which the operation could not proceed. Because a quantity to be subtracted is never produced in composition by any repeated addition of a positive, or repeated subtraction of a negative, a negative square number is never produced by composition from the root. Hence $\\sqrt{-1}$, or the square root of a negative, implies an imaginary quantity; and in resolution, is a mark or character of the impossible cases of a problem, unless it is compensated by another imaginary symbol or supposition, when the whole expression may have a real signification. Thus $i+\\sqrt{-1}$, and $i-\\sqrt{-1}$, taken separately, are imaginary, but their sum is $2$; as the conditions that separately would render the solution of a problem impossible, in some cases destroy each other's effect when conjoined. In the pursuit of general conclusions, and of simple forms representing them, expressions of this kind must sometimes arise where the imaginary symbol is compensated in a manner that is not always so obvious.\n\nBy proper substitutions, however, the expression may be transformed into another, wherein each particular term may have a real signification as well as the whole expression. The theorems that are sometimes briefly discovered by the use of this symbol, may be demonstrated without it by the inverse operation, or some other way; and though such symbols are of some use in the computations by the method of fluxions, its evidence cannot be said to depend upon arts of this kind.\n\nSee Algebra and Fluxions.\n\nNEGATIVE Electricity.

In the complexion of Negroes we meet with many various shades; but they likewise differ far from other men in all the features of their face. Round cheeks, high cheek-bones, a forehead somewhat elevated, a short broad, flat nose, thick lips, small ears, ugliness, and irregularity of shape, characterize their external appearance. The negro women have the loins greatly depressed, and very large buttocks, which gives the back the shape of a saddle. Vices the most notorious seem to be the portion of this unhappy race; idleness, treachery, revenge, cruelty, impudence, cheating, lying, profanity, debauchery, naughtiness, and intemperance, are said to have extinguished the principles of natural law, and to have silenced the reproaches of conscience. They are strangers to every sentiment of compassion, and are an awful example of the corruption of man when left to himself.\n\nThe origin of the negroes, and the cause of their remarkable difference from the rest of the human species, has much perplexed the naturalists. Mr Boyle has observed, that it cannot be produced by the heat of the climate: for though the heat of the sun may darken the colour of the skin, yet experience does not show that it is sufficient to produce a new blackness like that of the negroes.\n\nIn Africa itself, many nations of Ethiopia are not black; nor were there any blacks originally in the West Indies. In many parts of Asia under the same parallel with the African region inhabited by the blacks, the people are but tawny. He adds, that there are negroes in Africa beyond the southern tropic; and that a river sometimes parts nations, one of which is black, and the other only tawny. Dr Barriere alleges that the gall of negroes is black, and being mixed with their blood is deposited between the skin and scarf-skin. However Dr Mitchel of Virginia, in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 476, has endeavoured by many learned arguments to prove, that the influence of the sun in hot countries, and the manner of life of their inhabitants, are the remote causes of the colour of the negroes, Indians, &c. Lord Kames,\non the other hand, and such philosophers as he, whose genius and imagination are too lively to submit to a dry and painful investigation of facts, have contended that no physical cause is sufficient to change the colour, and what we call the regular features of white men, to the dark hue and deformity of the woolly-headed negro. Their arguments have been examined with much acuteness and ingenuity by Dr Stanhope Smith of New Jersey, Dr Hunter, and Professor Zimmerman, who have made it in a high degree probable, that the action of the sun is the original and chief cause of the black colour, as well as distorted features of the negro. See AMERICA, No 48\u201451, and COMPLEXION.\n\nTrue negroes are found in no quarter of the globe where the heat of the climate is not very great. They exist nowhere but in the torrid zone, and only in three regions situated in that zone, viz. in Senegal, in Guinea, and on the western shores of Africa, in Nubia, and the Papous land, or what is called New Guinea. In all these regions the atmosphere is scorching, and the heat excessive. The inhabitants of the north are whitest; and as we advance southwards towards the line, and those countries on which the sun's rays fall more perpendicularly, the complexion gradually assumes a darker shade. And the same men, whose colour has been rendered black by the powerful action of the sun, if they remove to the north, gradually become whiter (at least their posterior), and lose their burnt colour. Whites when transported into the burning regions of the torrid zone, are the first subject to fever; the skin of the face, hands, and feet, becomes burnt, hardens and falls off in scales. Hitherto the colour of negroes appears to be only local, extrinsic, and accidental, and their short frizzled and sparse hair is to be accounted for in the very same manner.\n\nClimate possesses great and evident influences on the hair, not only of man, but of all other animals. If in one case these transmutations are acknowledged to be consistent with identity of kind, they ought not in the other to be esteemed criterions of different species. Nature has adapted the pliancy of her work to the situations in which she may require it to be placed. The beaver and sheep removed to the warm latitudes exchange, the one its fur, and the other its wool, for a coarse hair that preserves the animal in a more moderate temperature. The coarse and black flax of the bear is converted, in the arctic regions, into the finest and whitest fur. The colour of the hair is likewise changed by climate. The bear is white under the arctic circle; and, in high northern latitudes, foxes, hares, and rabbits, are found white. Similar effects of climate are discernible on mankind. The hair of the Danes is generally red; of the English, fair or brown; and of the French, commonly black. The hair of all people of colour is black, and that of the African negroes is likewise sparse and curled in a manner peculiar to themselves; but this peculiarity is analogous to the effect which a warm climate has on almost every other animal. Cold, by obstructing the perspiration, tends to throw out the perspirable matter accumulated at the skin in an additional coat of hair. A warm climate, by opening the pores, evaporates this matter before it can be concreted into the substance of hair; and the laxness and aperture of the pores render the hair liable to be easily eradicated by innumerable incidents. Its curl may result in part from the nature of the secretion by which it is nourished, and in part from external heat. That it depends in some degree on the quality of the secretion is rendered highly probable from its appearance on the chin and other parts of the human body. Climate is as much distinguished by the nature and proportion of the secretions as by the degree of heat. (See PHYSIOLOGY, sect. 6.) Whatever be the nutriment of the hair, it is evidently combined in the torrid zone of Africa with some fluid of a highly volatile or ardent quality, which produces the rank smell of many African nations. Saline secretions tend to curl and to burn the hair. The evaporation of any volatile spirit would render its surface dry and disposed to contract; whilst the centre continuing distended by the vital motion, these opposite dilatations and contractions would necessarily produce a curve, and make the hair grow involved. External and violent heat parching the extremities of the hair, tends likewise to involve it. A hair held near the fire instantly coils itself up. Africa is the hottest country on the globe; and the influence of its heat, either external or internal, or both, in giving the peculiar form to the hair of the natives, appears, not only from its sparrows and its curl, but from its colour. It is not of a shining, but of an adult black; and its extremities tend to brown, as if it had been scorched by the fire.\n\nThe peculiarities of the negro features and form may likewise be accounted for from the excessive heat of the climate and the state of African society. Being savages, they have no arts to protect them from the rays of a burning sun. The heat and ferocity of the sky preserving the lives of the children without much care of the parents, they seem of course to be, in the interior parts of the country, negligent of their offspring. Able themselves to endure the extremes of that ardent climate, they injure their children to it from their most tender age. They suffer them to roll in the dust and sand beneath the direct rays of a vertical sun. The mother, if she be engaged, lays down the infant on the first spot she finds, and is seldom at the pains to seek the miserable shelter of a barren shrub, which is all that the interior country affords. When we reflect on the influence of a glare of light upon the eye, and on the distortions of countenance produced by our efforts to repel or prevent it, we need not wonder, that the plaintive features of a negro infant should, by constant exposure, acquire that permanent irregularity which we term their characteristic ugliness. But besides the climate, food and clothing and modes of life have prodigious effects on the human form and features. This is apparent even in polished societies, where the poor and labouring part of the community are much more coarse in their features, and ill formed in their limbs, than persons of better fortune and more liberal means of subsistence. What an immense difference exists in Scotland, for instance, between the chiefs and the commonalty of the Highland clans? If they had been separately found in different countries, they would have been ranged by some philosophers under different species. A similar distinction takes place between the nobility and peasantry of France, of Spain, of Italy, and of Germany.\n\nThat food and clothing, and the different modes of life, have as great an influence upon the shapes and features of the Africans as upon the natives of Europe, is evident.\nevident from the different appearances of the negroes in the southern republics of America according to the stations in which they are employed. \"The field slaves (says Dr Smith) are badly fed, clothed, and lodged. They live in small huts on the plantations, where they labour, remote from the society and example of their superiors. Living by themselves, they retain many of the customs and manners of their African ancestors. The domestic servants, on the other hand, who are kept near the persons, or employed in the families of their masters, are treated with great lenity; their service is light; they are fed and clothed like their superiors; they see their manners, adopt their habits, and infensibly receive the same ideas of elegance and beauty. The field slaves are, in consequence, slow in changing the aspect and figure of Africa. The domestic servants have advanced far before them in acquiring the agreeable and regular features, and the expressive countenance of civil society. The former are frequently ill-shaped. They preserve, in a great degree, the African lips, nose, and hair. Their genius is dull, and their countenance sleepy and stupid. The latter are straight and well proportioned; their hair extended to three, four, and sometimes even to six or eight inches; the size and shape of the mouth handsome, their features regular, their capacity good, and their look animated.\"\n\nUpon the whole, we hope that the reader, who shall candidly weigh in his own mind what we have said at present and under the article Complexion, will agree with us, that the black colour in the torrid zone, the sparse crisp hair of the negroes, and the peculiarities of their features and form, proceed from causes altogether extrinsic; that they depend on local temperature and the state of society; and that they are as accidental as the various shades of colour which characterize the different nations of Europe. If the whites be considered as the stock whence all others have sprung, it is easy to conceive how they have degenerated into negroes. Some have conjectured that the complete change may have taken place at the end of three centuries, whilst others have thought that it could not be effected in less than double that period. Such conjectures can be formed from no certain data; and a much greater length of time is undoubtedly necessary before negroes, when transplanted into our temperate countries, can entirely lose their black colour. By crossing the breed with whites, every taint of the negro colour may be expelled, we believe, from the fifth generation (A).\n\nBut the most serious charge brought against the poor negroes is, that of the vice said to be natural to them. If they be indeed such as their enemies represent them, treacherous, cruel, revengeful, and intemperate, by a necessity of nature, they must be a different race from the whites; for though all these vices abound in Europe, it is evident that they proceed not from nature, but from wrong education, which gives to the youthful mind such deep impressions as no future exertions can completely eradicate. Let us inquire coolly if the vices of the negroes may not have a similar origin.\n\nIn every part of Africa with which the nations of Europe have any commerce, slavery prevails of the worst kind. Three-fourths of the people are slaves to the rest, and the children are born to no other inheritance. \"Most parts of the coast differ in their governments; some are absolute monarchies, whilst others draw near to an aristocracy. In both the authority of the chief or chiefs is unlimited, extending to life, and it is exercised as often as criminal cases require, unless death is commuted into slavery; in which case the offender is sold, and if the shipping will not buy the criminal, he is immediately put to death. Fathers of free condition have power to sell their children, but this power is very seldom enforced.\" In Congo, however, a father will sell a son or daughter, or perhaps both, for a piece of cloth, a collar or girdle of coral or beads, Univer. and often for a bottle of wine or brandy. A husband may have as many wives as he pleases, and repudiate or even sell them, though with child, at his pleasure. The wives and concubines, though it be a capital crime for the former to break the conjugal faith, have a way to rid themselves of their husbands, if they have let their affections upon a new gallant, by accusing them of some crime for which the punishment is death. In a word, the bulk of the people in every state of Africa are born slaves to great men, reared as such, held as property, and as property sold (see Slavery.) There are indeed many circumstances by which a free man may become a slave: such as being in debt, and not able to pay; and in some of such cases, if the debt be large, not only the debtor, but his family likewise, become the slaves of his creditor, and may be sold. Adultery is commonly punished in the same manner, both the offending parties being sold, and the purchase-money paid to the injured husband. Obi, or pretended witchcraft (in which all the negroes firmly believe, see Witchcraft), is another, and a very common offence, for which slavery is adjudged the lawful punishment; and it extends to all the family of the offender. There are various other crimes which subject the offender and his\n\n(A) 1. A white man with a negro woman, or a negro man with a white woman, produce a mulatto, half white and half black, or of a yellow-blackish colour, with black, short, frizzled hair. 2. A white man with a mulatto woman, or a negro with a mulatto woman, produce a quadroon, three fourths white and one fourth black, or three fourths black and one fourth white, or of a lighter yellow than the former. In America, they give the name of cabres to those who are descended from a black man and a mulatto woman, or a mulatto man and a black woman, who are three fourths black and one fourth white, and who are not so black as a negro, but blacker than a mulatto. 3. A white man with a quadroon woman, or a negro with a quadroon woman, produce a metizo, seventh eighths white and one eighth black, or seven eighths black and one eighth white. 4. A white man with a metizo woman, or a negro with a metizo woman, produce, the one almost a perfect white, the other almost a perfect black, called a quinteroon. This is the last gradation, there being no visible difference between the fair quinteroons and the whites: and the children of a white and quinteroon consider themselves as free from all taint of the negro race.\nhis children to be sold; and it is more than probable, that if there were no buyers, the poor wretches would be murdered without mercy.\n\nIn such a state of society, what dispositions can be looked for in the people, but cruelty, treachery, and revenge? Even in the civilized nations of Europe, blest with the lights of law, science, and religion, some of the lower orders of the community consider it as a very trivial crime to defraud their superiors; whilst almost all look up to them with stupid malevolence or rancorous envy. That a depraved people, when they get power into their hands, are revengeful and cruel, the present age affords a dreadful proof in the conduct of the demagogues of a neighbouring nation; and it is wonderful that the negroes of Africa, unacquainted with moral principles, blinded by the cruelest and most abhorred superstitions, and whose customs tend to eradicate from the mind all natural affection, should sometimes display to their lordly masters of European extraction the same spirit that has been so generally displayed by the lower orders of Frenchmen to their ecclesiastics, their nobles, and the family of their murdered sovereign! When we consider that the majority of the negroes groan under the cruelest slavery, both in their own country and in every other where they are to be found in considerable numbers, it can excite no surprise that they are in general treacherous, cruel, and vindictive. Such are the caprices of their tyrants at home, that they could not preserve their own lives or the lives of their families for any length of time, but by a perpetual vigilance, which must necessarily degenerate, first into cunning, and afterwards into treachery; and it is not conceivable that habits formed in Africa should be instantly thrown off in the West Indies, where they are the property of men whom some of them must consider as a different race of beings.\n\nBut the truth is, that the ill qualities of the negroes have been greatly exaggerated. Mr Edwards, in his valuable History of the West Indies, affirms us that the Mandingo negroes display such gentleness of disposition and demeanour, as would seem the result of early education and discipline, were it not that, generally speaking, they are more prone to theft than any of the African tribes. It has been supposed that this propensity, among other vices, is natural to a state of slavery, which degrades and corrupts the human mind in a deplorable manner; but why the Mandingoes should have become more vicious in this respect than the rest of the natives of Africa in the same condition of life, is a question he cannot answer.\n\n\"The circumstances which (according to the same author) distinguish the Koromantyn or Gold Coast negroes from all others, are firmness both of body and mind; a ferociousness of disposition; but withal, activity, courage, and a stubbornness, or what an ancient Roman would have deemed an elevation of soul, which prompts them to enterprises of difficulty and danger, and enables them to meet death, in its most horrid shape, with fortitude or indifference. They sometimes take to labour with great promptitude and alacrity, and have constitutions well adapted for it; for many of them have undoubtedly been slaves in Africa. But as the Gold Coast is inhabited by various tribes, which are engaged in perpetual warfare and hostility with each other, there cannot be a doubt that many of the captives taken in battle, and sold in the European settlements, were of free condition in their native country, and perhaps the owners of slaves themselves. It is not wonderful that such men should endeavour, even by means the most desperate, to regain the freedom of which they have been deprived; nor do I conceive that any further circumstances are necessary to prompt them to action, than that of being sold into captivity in a distant country. One cannot surely but lament (says our author) that a people thus naturally intrepid, should be sunk into so deplorable a state of barbarity and superstition; and that their spirits should ever be broken down by the yoke of slavery. Whatever may be alleged concerning their ferociousness and implacability in their present notions of right and wrong, I am persuaded that they possess qualities which are capable of, and well deserve, cultivation and improvement.\n\n\"Very different from the Koromantyns are the negroes imported from the Bight of Benin, and known in the West Indies by the name of Eboes. So great is their constitutional timidity and despondency of mind, as to occasion them very frequently to seek, in a voluntary death, a refuge from their own melancholy reflections. They require therefore the gentlest and mildest treatment to reconcile them to their situation; but if their confidence be once obtained, they manifest as great fidelity, affection, and gratitude, as can reasonably be expected from men in a state of slavery. The females of this nation are better labourers than the men, probably from having been more hardly treated in Africa.\n\n\"The natives of Whidah, who, in the West Indies, are generally called Papaws, are unquestionably the most docile and best disposed slaves that are imported from any part of Africa. Without the fierce and savage manners of the Koromantyn negroes, they are also happily exempt from the timid and desponding temper of the Eboes. The cheerful acquiescence with which these people apply to the labours of the field, and their constitutional aptitude for such employment, arise, without doubt, from the great attention paid to agriculture in their native country. Bofman speaks with rapture of the improved state of the soil, the number of villages, and the industry, riches, and obliging manners of the natives. He observes, however, that they are much greater thieves than those of the Gold Coast, and very unlike them in another respect, namely, in the dread of pain, and the apprehension of death. They are, says he, so very apprehensive of death, that they are unwilling to hear it mentioned, for fear that alone should hasten their end; and no man dares to speak of death in the presence of the king, or any great man, under the penalty of suffering it himself, as a punishment for his presumption. He relates, further, that they are addicted to gaming beyond any people of Africa. All these propensities are observable in the character of the Papaws in a state of slavery in the West Indies. That punishment which excites the Koromantyn to rebel, and drives the Ebo negro to suicide, is received by the Papaws as the chastisement of legal authority, to which it is their duty to submit patiently. The case seems to be, that the generality of these people are in a state of absolute slavery in Africa, and, having been habituated to a life of labour, they submit to a change of situation with little reluctance.\"\nHaving recited such observations as occurred to him on contemplating the various tribes of negroes from each other, Mr Edwards thus estimates their general character, influenced as they are by circumstances which soon efface the native and original impressions which distinguish one nation from another when newly imported into the West Indies.\n\n\" notwithstanding what has been related of the firmness and courage of the natives of the Gold Coast, it is certain that the negroes in general in our islands (such of them at least as have been any length of time in a state of servitude) are of a distrustful and cowardly disposition. So degrading is the nature of slavery, that fortitude of mind is lost as free agency is retrained. To the same cause probably must be imputed their propensity to conceal or violate the truth; which is so general, that the vice of falsehood is one of the most prominent features in their character. If a negro is asked even an indifferent question by his master, he seldom gives an immediate reply; but, affecting not to understand what is said, compels a repetition of the question, that he may have time to consider, not what is the true answer, but what is the most politic one for him to give. The propensity observable in many of them to the vice of theft has already been noticed; and I am afraid (says our author), that evil communication makes it almost general. It is no easy matter, I confess, to discriminate those circumstances which are the result of proximate causes, from those which are the effects of national customs and early habits in savage life; but I am afraid that cowardice and dissimulation have been the properties of slavery in all ages, and will continue to be so to the end of the world. It is a situation that necessarily suppresses many of the best affections of the human heart.\u2014If it calls forth any latent virtues, they are those of sympathy and compassion towards persons in the same condition of life; and accordingly we find that the negroes in general are strongly attached to their countrymen, but above all, to such of their companions as came in the same ship with them from Africa. This is a striking circumstance: the term \"familiar\" is understood among them as signifying a relationship of the most endearing nature; perhaps as recalling the time when the sufferers were cut off together from their common country and kindred, and awakening reciprocal sympathy from the remembrance of mutual affliction. But their benevolence, with a very few exceptions, extends no further. The softer virtues are seldom found in the bosom of the enslaved African. Give him sufficient authority, and he becomes the most remorseless of tyrants. Of all the degrees of wretchedness endured by the sons of men, the greatest, assuredly, is the misery which is felt by those who are unhappily doomed to be the slaves of slaves; a most unnatural relation, which sometimes takes place in the sugar plantations. The same observation may be made concerning their conduct towards the animal creation. Their treatment of cattle under their direction is brutal beyond belief. Even the useful and social qualities of the dog secure to him no kind usage from an African master. One of the most pleasing traits in their character is the respect and attention which they pay to their aged countrymen. The whole body of negroes on a plantation must be reduced to a deplorable state of wretchedness, if, at any time, they suffer their aged companions to want the common necessaries of life, or Negroland\u2014many of its comforts, as far as they can procure them. They seem to be actuated on these occasions by a kind of involuntary impulse, operating as a primitive law of nature, which scorns to wait the cold dictates of reason: among them, it is the exercise of a common duty, which courts no observation, and looks for no applause.\"\n\nAs the colour, and features, and moral qualities of the negroes may be thus easily accounted for by the influence of climate and the modes of savage life, so there is good reason to believe that their intellectual endowments are equal to those of the whites who have been found in the same circumstances. Of those imitative arts in which perfection can be attained only in an improved state of society, it is natural to suppose that they have but little knowledge; but the fabric and colours of the Guinea cloths are a proof of their native ingenuity. In the West Indies many of them are expert carpenters, some watchmakers, and one or two have successfully practised physic; whilst others have figured both in Latin and in English poetry, so that we cannot doubt but that \"God, who made the world, hath made of one blood all nations of men,\" and animated them with minds equally rational.","sp":386,"ep":390},{"h":"NEGROLAND","t":"or NIGERIA, a country of Africa, lying next to Guinea towards the north, and extending from 18\u00b0 of west to 23\u00b0 of east longitude, and from 9\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 of north latitude. On the north it is bounded by Zaara or the Desert; on the east, by countries unknown; on the south, by Guinea; and on the west, by the Atlantic ocean; and is watered by the great river Niger or Senegal, which runs through it from east to west. The Europeans have settlements on the coasts of this country, especially near the mouths of the Niger and Gambia, which last is supposed to be a branch of the former. A great many nations inhabit the banks of the rivers; some Pagans, some Mohammedans, of different languages, and independent of one another. The country is fruitful, especially along the rivers; abounding in rice, Guinea grain, and Indian corn, where it is cultivated; and with cocoa nuts, plantains, pulse, palm trees, and tropical fruits; nor is it destitute of cattle, and a variety of other animals, particularly such as abound in Guinea. See GUINEA.\n\nNegroland is fertilized by the overflowing of its rivers the Senegal and Gambia, as Egypt is by the Nile. It hath not yet been ascertained whether the Gambia is a branch of the Senegal or not. As far as the Europeans have penetrated up the country, they appear to be distant; and the Mandingo negroes report that the Gambia has a different origin. The entrance into the Niger, or Senegal river, is narrow and somewhat difficult, by reason of its immovable bar, and sandy shoals, as well as the several islands at the mouth of it, and the several canals and marshes that clog it: but after sailing up eight or ten leagues, it is found broad and deep, and fit to carry large vessels; and, excepting about five or six leagues on each side above the mouth, which is sandy and barren ground, the banks are covered with stately trees and villages, and the country in general is fertile and well watered; for, like the Nile, this river overflows its banks for many leagues, and enriches the land to a great degree,\nNegroland gree, though, for want of skill, the inhabitants do not reap the advantages which they might obtain from its fertility. The people on both sides of the river live as near to it as they can, and feed great herds of cattle, sowing large and small millet, the former of which is called by us Turkey wheat, in great quantities, and with great increase. If the river fails of overflowing at its usual season, a great scarcity ensues in the adjacent country; and, even when it overflows regularly, it breeds such vast flights of grasshoppers and insects, as quite darken the air, and frequently devour the whole produce of the soil: in which case the people kill those insects and eat them; which they do either by pounding in leather bags, and then boiling them in milk, or, which is reckoned the more delicious method, by frying or broiling them over a light blaze in a fryingpan full of holes. Thus the legs and wings of the insects are burnt off, and the rest of the body is sufficiently roasted to be eaten as a dainty, which they look upon to be very wholesome and nourishing.\n\nTo the east, north-east, and south-east of the island of Senegal, the country, as far as it is known, is overrun with woods and marshes: the Senegal, Gambia, and Sherbro, which are looked upon by some as branches of one immense river, passing through it in their way to the Atlantic ocean. During the rainy months, which begin in July, and continue to October, they lay the whole country under water; and indeed the sudden rise of these rivers is incredible to such as are not acquainted with the violent rains that fall between the tropics. At Galam, 950 miles from the mouth of the Senegal, the waters rise 150 feet perpendicular from the bed of the river. At the island of Senegal, the river rises gradually, during the rainy season, above 20 feet perpendicular over part of that flat coast; which of itself so refreshes the water, that ships lying at anchor, at the distance of three leagues from its mouth, generally make use of it, and fill their water there for their voyage home. When the rains are at an end, which soon happens in October, the intense heat of the sun usually dries up those stagnating waters which lie on the higher parts, and the remainder from lakes and marshes, in which are found all sorts of dead animals. At last, those two are quite dried up; and then the effluvia that arise are almost quite insupportable. At this season the winds blow so hot from the land, that they may be compared to the heat proceeding from the mouth of an oven, and they bring with them an intolerable smell. The wolves, tigers, lions, and other wild beasts, then resort to the river, steeping their body under water, and only their snouts above it for the sake of breathing. The birds soar to an immense height in the air, and fly a vast way over the sea, where they continue till the wind changes, and comes from the west.","sp":390,"ep":391},{"h":"NEGROPONT","t":"anciently Euboea, an island of the Archipelago, stretching along the eastern coast of Achaia or Livadia, from which it is separated by a narrow channel called the Euripus. This strait is so narrow, that the island is joined to the continent by a bridge thrown over it; and here, it is thought, there was formerly an isthmus. The irregularity of the tides in the Euripus hath from the remotest antiquity been Nehemiah very remarkable, and this irregularity is found to be connected with the age of the moon. From the three last days of the old moon to the eighth day of the new moon, and from the 14th to the 20th day inclusive, they are regular; but on the other days they are irregular, flowing 12, 13, or 14 times in the space of 24 hours, and ebbing as often. The island is 90 miles long and 25 broad in the widest part; and produces corn, oil, fruit, and cattle, in great abundance. The only place in the island worth notice is the capital, which is also called Negropont; and which is walled, and contains about 15,000 inhabitants; but the Christians are said to be much more numerous than the Turks. The captain bawhaw, or admiral of Turkey, who is also governor of the city, the island, and the adjacent continent of Greece, resides here: and the harbour, which is very safe and spacious, is seldom without a fleet of galleys, ready to be put to sea against the pirates and the Maltese. A part of the bridge between the city and the coast of Greece, consists of a draw bridge no longer than just to let a galley pass through.","sp":391,"ep":391},{"h":"NEHEMIAH","t":"or NEEMIAS, son of Hachaliah, was born at Babylon during the captivity, (Neh. i. 1, 2, &c.) He was, according to some, of the race of the priests, but, according to others, of the tribe of Judah and the royal family. Those who maintain the first opinion, support it by a passage in Ezra, (x. 10,) where he is called a priest; but those who believe that he was of the race of the kings of Judah, say, 1st, That Nehemiah having governed the republic of the Jews for a considerable time, there is great probability he was of that tribe of which the kings always were. 2ndly, Nehemiah mentions his brethren Hanani, and some other Jews, who coming to Babylon during the captivity, acquainted him with the sad condition of their country. 3rdly, The office of cupbearer to the king of Persia, to which Nehemiah was promoted, is a further proof that he was of an illustrious family. 4thly, He excuses himself from entering into the inner part of the temple, probably because he was only a laic, (Neh. vi. 11.) \"Should such a man as I flee? And who is there that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life?\"\n\nThe Scripture (Ezra ii. 63. Nehem. vii. 65.) calls him neumtir/batha, that is to say, \"cup bearer;\" for he had this employment at the court of Artaxerxes Longimanus. He had an exceeding great tenderness for the country of his fathers, though he had never seen it; and one day, as some Jews newly come from Jerusalem acquainted him with the miserable estate of that city, that its walls were beat down, its gates burnt, and the Jews were become a reproach among all nations; he was sensibly affected with this relation; he faltered, prayed, and humbled himself before the Lord, that he would be favourable to the design he had then conceived of asking the king's permission to rebuild Jerusalem. The course of his attendance at court being come, he presented the cup to the king according to custom; but with a countenance sad and dejected; which the king observing, entertained some suspicion, as if he might have had some bad design; but Nehemiah (ii.) discovering the occasion of his disquiet, Artaxerxes gave him leave to go to Jerusalem, and repair its walls and gates; but, however, upon this condition, that he should\nNehemiah should return to court at a time appointed. Letters were made out, directed to the governors beyond the Euphrates, with orders to furnish Nehemiah with timbers necessary for covering the towers and gates of the city, and the house designed for Nehemiah himself, who was now appointed governor of Judea, in the year of the world 3359.\n\nNehemiah being arrived at Jerusalem with the king's commission, went round the city; and having viewed the condition of the walls, assembled the chief of the people, produced his commission, and exhorted them to undertake the reparation of the gates and walls of the city. He found every person ready to obey him; whereupon he immediately began the work. The enemies of the Jews observing their works in such forwardness, made use of all the means in their power to deter Nehemiah from this undertaking, and made several attempts to surprise him; but finding that their designs were discovered, and that the Jews kept upon their guard, they had recourse to craft and stratagem, endeavouring to draw him into an ambuscade in the fields, where they pretended they would finish the dispute at an amicable conference: but Nehemiah gave them to understand, that the work he had begun required his personal attendance; and therefore he could not come to them. He sent the same answer to four several messengers that they sent one after another on the same subject, (Id. iv. and vi.)\n\nSanballat, the chief of the enemies of the Jews, together with his associates, wrote word, that a report was spread that the Jews were building the walls of Jerusalem only with a design to make it a place of strength, to support them in an intended revolt; so that it was said also that Nehemiah had harboured false prophets to favour his designs, and to encourage the people to choose him king; and to stop the course of these rumours, he advised him to come to him, that they might confer together, and take such resolutions as should be found convenient. Nehemiah gave himself no trouble on this account, but returned for answer, that all those accusations were false and made at random. About the same time he discovered, that a false prophet, called Shemaiah, had been corrupted by his enemies, and that some of the chief of the city were secretly in confederacy with them. Yet all this did not discourage him; he went on with his work, and happily completed it in two and fifty days after it had been begun.\n\nThen he made a dedication of the walls, of the towers, and of the gates of Jerusalem, with the solemnity and magnificence that such a work required. He separated the priests, the Levites, and the princes of the people, into two companies, one of which walked to the south and the other to the north, on the top of the walls. These two companies were to meet at the temple. The procession was accompanied with music both vocal and instrumental; and when they were all come to the temple, they there read the law, offered sacrifices, and made great rejoicings. And as the feast of tabernacles happened at the same time, it was celebrated with great solemnity, (Id. viii.) Nehemiah observing that the compass of the city was too large for its inhabitants, he ordered that the chief of the nation should fix their dwelling in the city; and caused them to draw lots, by which a tenth part of the whole people of Judah were to dwell at Jerusalem, (Id. xi.) Then he applied himself to the reformation of such abuses as had crept into the administration of the public affairs. He curbed the inhumanity of the great ones, who held in a state of slavery the sons and daughters of those who were poor or unfortunate, keeping their lands in possession, which these poor people had been obliged either to mortgage or to sell to the rich. Another abuse there was, which Ezra had vainly attempted to redress, that they had contracted marriages with strange and idolatrous women. Nehemiah undertook to dissolve these marriages, succeeded in it, and sent away all such women as had been taken against the express command of the law, (Id. ix.) Having likewise observed, that the priests and Levites were obliged to take refuge wherever they could, and so the ministry of the temple was not attended or performed with that decency it ought, because they did not receive the revenues that the law had appointed for their subsistence; he obliged the people punctually to pay the ministers of the Lord what was due to them, and enjoined the priests and Levites duly to attend on their respective duties, and to discharge their functions, (Id. xiii. 10, 11, &c.) He enforced the observation of the Sabbath, which had been much neglected at Jerusalem, and would not permit strangers to come in to buy and sell, but kept the gates of the city shut all that day. And, to perpetuate as much as was possible these good regulations which he had newly established, he engaged the chief men of the nation solemnly to renew the covenant with the Lord. This ceremony was performed in the temple, and an instrument was drawn up, which was signed by the principal men, both priests and people (Id. ix. x.), in the year of the world 3551.\n\nWe read in the books of Maccabees, (2 Macc. i. 19, 20, 21, &c.), that Nehemiah sent to search for the holy fire, which before the captivity of Babylon the priests had hid in a dry and deep pit; but not finding any fire there, but instead thereof a thick and muddy water, he sprinkled this upon the altar; whereupon the wood which had been sprinkled with this water took fire presently as soon as the sun began to appear. Which miracle coming to the knowledge of the king of Persia, he caused the place to be encompassed with walls where the fire had been hid, and granted great favours and privileges to the priests. It is recorded in the same books, (2 Macc. ii. 13, 14.) That Nehemiah erected a library, wherein he placed whatever he could find, either of the books of the prophets, of David, or of such princes as had made presents to the temple. Lastly, He returned to Babylon (Id. v. 14. and xii. 6.) according to the promise he had made to King Artaxerxes, about the thirty-second year of this prince, in the year 3563. From thence he returned again to Jerusalem, where he died in peace, about the year 3580, having governed the people of Judah for about thirty years.\n\nThe book which in the English Bible, as also in the Hebrew, has the name of Nehemiah, in the Latin Bible is called the book of Esdras; and it must be confessed, that though this author speaks in the first person, and though at first reading one would think that he had writ it day by day as the transactions occurred, yet there are some things in this book which could not have been written by Nehemiah himself; for example, memorials are quoted wherein were registered the names of...\nof the priests in the time of Jonathan the son of Elia-\nshib, and even to the times of the high priest Jaddus,\nwho met Alexander the Great. These therefore must\nhave been added afterwards.\n\nIt may well be questioned, whether this Nehemiah\nbe the same that is mentioned in Ezra, (ii. 2. and\nNeh. vii. 7.) as one that returned from the Babylo-\nnian captivity under Zerubbabel; since from the first\nyear of Cyrus to the twentieth of Artaxerxes Longi-\nmanus, there are no less than ninety-two years inter-\nvening; so that Nehemiah must at this time have been\na very old man, upon the lowest computation an hun-\ndred, consequently utterly incapable of being the king's\ncup-bearer, of taking a journey from Shushan to Jeru-\nsalem, and of behaving there with all the courage and\nactivity that is recorded of him. Upon this presump-\ntion, therefore, we may conclude that this was a differ-\nent person, though of the same name, and that Tir-\nshatha (the other name by which he is called, Ezra ii.\n63. and Neh. vii. 65.) denotes the title of his office,\nand both in the Persian and Chaldean tongues was the\ngeneral name given to the king's deputies and gover-\nnors.","sp":391,"ep":393},{"h":"NEHOW","t":"one of the Sandwich islands, discovered\nby Captain Cook in his last voyage to the Pacific\nocean: these islands are eleven in number, and are situated\nfrom 18\u00b0 44' to 22\u00b0 15' N.

He received his education at the school of\nNorth Walsham; but we are unacquainted with the\nparticulars relative to his childhood, and whether the\nprogress he made in his studies was in any respect ex-\ntraordinary. It is certain, however, that he discovered\na strong predilection for the naval profession at a very\nearly period, and having quitted school at the age of\ntwelve years, went on board the Raisonable of 64 guns,\ncommanded by his mother's brother, Captain Maurice\nSuckling.\n\nIn the month of April 1773, a voyage of discovery\nto the north pole was undertaken by the honourable\nConstantine John Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave,\nin consequence of an application by the Royal Society\nto Lord Sandwich; and although the instructions which\nwere issued, prohibited all boys from being received on\nboard, yet the enterprising spirit of Horatio Nelson\nearnestly solicited to be appointed cockswain to Captain\nLutwidge, rather than submit to be left behind; and\nhis unsubdued spirit so forcibly struck the captain, that\nhis will was complied with.\n\nWhen the ship returned to England in the month of\nOctober 1773, Mr Nelson having received information\nthat a squadron was fitting out for the East Indies, em-\nployed all his interest to be appointed to one of the\nships. It was not long before he was placed in the\nSeahorse of 20 guns, commanded by the celebrated\nCaptain Farmer, and stationed in the fore-top to keep\nwatch, but soon after removed to the quarter-deck.\n\nHe obtained the professional order of lieutenant on\nthe 8th of April, 1777, and received his commission\nthe next day, as second of the Lowestoffe of 32 guns,\nCaptain William Locker, in which ship he arrived at\nJamaica; but feeling that his glowing mind was cir-\ncumfused in so small a frigate, he requested the com-\nmand of a schooner, which acted as tender to the\nLowestoffe, thus availing himself of the opportunity of\nbecoming an experienced pilot for every intricate pas-\nsage through the islands, situated on the northern side\nof Hispaniola.\n\nWhen Sir Peter Parker arrived at Jamaica in the\nyear 1778, Lieutenant Nelson was nominated by that\ngallant admiral to be the third of his own flag ship,\nthe Bristol, and by rotation he soon became the first.\nIn this ship his services terminated in the rank of a\nlieutenant.\n\nOn the 11th of June, 1779, he obtained the rank of\npost-captain; and during the nine years he had been\nin the service he not only became an able officer by his\nconstant attention to every part of his duty, and his\nkeen observation, but he also laid the foundation of be-\ning a pilot of distinguished eminence. The first ship to\nwhich he was appointed after being made a post cap-\ntain, was the Hinchinbrooke. On the arrival of Count\nd'Estrigny at Hispaniola, as an attack upon Jamaica was\nimmediately apprehended, Captain Nelson was intrusted\nwith the command of the batteries of Port Royal, with\nthe concurring approbation of the British admiral and\ngeneral. In the month of January 1780, it was re-\nsolved on to reduce Fort Juan, on the river St John,\nin the gulf of Mexico, when Captain Nelson was made\nchoice of to command the naval department, and that\nof the military was committed to Major Polson. In\naccomplishing the object of this arduous and interesting\nundertaking, Nelson's usual intrepidity was again ex-\nhibited. Having quitted the ship under his command,\nhe superintended the transporting of the troops in boats,\n300 miles up a river, which none but Spaniards had\never navigated since the time of the buccaneers.\n\nHis great and vigorous exertions were represented by\nMajor Polson to General Dalling in their true colours,\nnor was his gallantry passed over by that officer in silence. After storming an out-work belonging to the enemy, he constructed batteries, and fought the Spaniards; and it is to his conduct in the reduction of Fort Juan that the success of Britain has been justly and chiefly ascribed. He was next appointed to the Janes, at that time stationed at Jamaica; on his arrival at which place every medical assistance was given him which his situation required; but as his health still continued on the decline, he deemed it expedient to return to England in his majesty's ship Lion, the honourable William Cornwallis commander, to whose unremitting care and attention he owed the preservation of his life. He obtained the command of the Albemarle in the month of August, 1781, which put his delicate constitution to the severest trial, as he was stationed during the whole of the ensuing winter in the North seas.\n\nHe sailed from Quebec in the month of October, 1782, with a convoy to New York, where he had an opportunity of joining the fleet under Sir Samuel Hood; and in the month following he sailed with him to the West Indies, where he was honourably employed until the termination of hostilities. He soon after received orders to repair to England, being directed to attend in his way, his royal highness Prince William Henry on his visit to the Havannah. When he reached England, the Albemarle was paid off at Portsmouth on the 31st July, 1783. During the autumn of that year he paid a visit to France, where he continued till the spring of the ensuing year, when he received the command of the Boreas frigate of 28 guns, and his destination was the Leeward islands, where he continued until June 1787, and was then ordered to repair to England. In the month of March the same year he was married to the amiable and accomplished widow of Dr Neubitz, of the island of Nevis. When the Boreas frigate was paid off at Sheerness on the 30th November, 1787, he retired to the parsonage-house of Burnham Thorpe, which had been conferred upon him by his father for a place of residence, there to enjoy the consolations which result from domestic felicity.\n\nHe again came forward on the 30th of January 1793, to shine forth more conspicuous as a naval officer than he had ever done before, at which time he received the command of the Agamemnon of 64 guns, being soon placed under the orders of that truly great and illustrious character, Lord Hood, who at that period was destined to command in the Mediterranean. The unlimited confidence reposed in him by this noble and gallant admiral, is an incontrovertible evidence of the high estimation in which his courage and naval abilities were held. If his superior designed to attack batteries, or cut ships out of the harbours in which they were moored; if troops were to be landed in perilous situations, or passages of extreme difficulty to be explored, the great Nelson took the lead on every such occasion, seconded by the brave officers and crew belonging to the Agamemnon. Toulon, Batia, and Calvi, witnessed his gallant and intrepid deportment, of which Lord Hood did not fail to make honourable mention. At the siege of Calvi Captain Nelson lost the sight of his right eye, a shot from the battery of the enemy having struck that of which he had the command, and driven some particles of sand against his face with irresistible impetuosity.\n\nWhen Lord Hood left his station in the Mediterranean in the month of October, 1794, the command devolved on Admiral Hotham, who honoured our hero with an equal share of his confidence and esteem. On the 13th and 14th of March, and 13th of July 1795, he again rendered himself conspicuous in the actions which then took place with the French fleet; and soon after he was chosen by Admiral Hotham to cooperate with General De Vins, on the coast of Genoa, in which service he continued so long as Hotham retained the command, who was superceded by Sir John Jervis. This officer so much applauded the conduct of Captain Nelson, that he received the honour of wearing a pendant of distinction; and in the month of May he was removed from the Agamemnon to the Captain of 74 guns. On the 11th of August he had a captain appointed under him.\n\nFrom April to October 1795, Commodore Nelson was continually employed in the most active and arduous service, the blockade of Leghorn, the taking of Porto Ferrajo, with the island of Caprea, and finally in the evacuation of Batia. In December 1796 he hoisted his broad pendant on board La Minerve frigate, and was dispatched with that ship, and La Blanche, to Porto Ferrajo, to bring the naval stores left there to Gibraltar, which the fleet was in much want of. While on this service in the night of the 17th December, he fell in with two Spanish frigates, one of which he immediately attacked, and ordered the Blanche to bear down to engage the other. About half past ten the commodore brought his ship to close action, which continued without interruption till half past one, when the Spanish frigate of 40 guns, 28 of which were 18 pounders, struck to La Minerve.\n\nAfter various other active and important services during the three preceding months, Sir Horatio Nelson, in April 1797, hoisted his flag on board the Captain of 74 guns as rear-admiral of the blue, and in the end of May he shifted his flag from the Captain to the Theseus, when he was appointed to the command of the inner squadron at the blockade of Cadiz. While on this service he exhibited another remarkable proof of his undaunted personal courage. In the attack on the Spanish gun-boats in July, he was boarded in his barge, which had only the usual complement of 10 men, and the cookswain. The commander of the Spanish gun-boats, in a barge with 30 men and officers, made a desperate attack on the admiral and his brave companions. The conflict remained long doubtful, but after 18 of the Spaniards were killed, and almost the whole of the remainder wounded, the rear-admiral and his brave crew succeeded in carrying this superior force.\n\nOn the 15th of July the same year, Admiral Nelson was detached with a small squadron to attack the town of Santa Cruz in the island of Teneriffe. A thousand men, including marines, were landed in the course of a dark night, made themselves masters of the town, and retained possession of it for seven hours; but finding it impossible to storm the citadel, they prepared for their retreat, which the Spaniards allowed them to make unmolested, agreeable to the stipulations which had been entered into. In this unfortunate attack the brave Nelson lost his arm by a cannon-shot.\n\nBut a more splendid scene of the life of our hero is now opening. On the 13th of April 1798 he was detached\ntached from Earl St Vincent's fleet, in pursuit of the French to the coast of Egypt, with 12 sail of the line and one 50 gun ship, while the enemy's fleet consisted of 13 sail of the line and four frigates, protected by the batteries on the shore, and several gun-boats. This memorable action commenced at sunset, and terminated gloriously for the honour of our hero and that of the British navy. Nine sail of the line fell into the hands of the conqueror, two were burnt, and two effected their escape. The brave Nelson was wounded in the action, believing himself to have been shot through the head; but after his wound was examined by the surgeon, it was happily found not to be mortal, a circumstance which diffused the most lively satisfaction through the whole fleet. To the honour of this great man it ought to be mentioned, that even under the conviction of approaching dissolution, he prepared for the interesting change with calmness and fortitude, desired his chaplain to recommend him to Lady Nelson, appointed the brave Hardy to the rank of post-captain and to the command of a ship, and took an affectionate leave of Captain Louis.\n\nThe French admiral's ship, L'Orient, was blown up during the action. From the mainmast of this ship Captain Hallowell ordered a coffin to be constructed, which was presented to Admiral Nelson, and gratefully accepted by the hero, as a token of affectionate regard. For some months he had it placed upright in his cabin; but in consequence of the entreaties of an old servant, the admiral was at length prevailed on to allow it to be removed. Our readers will not be surprised that Lord Nelson should now be regarded as the great defence of the empire, and the support of her national glory. It is to his gallantry and naval skill that we are indebted for the victory of Copenhagen, and the annihilation of that formidable northern confederacy which menaced the prosperity, the commerce, the very existence of the rest of Europe.\n\nOne of the most important services which Lord Nelson performed, was the pursuit of the combined fleets of France and Spain to the West Indies. This fleet had sailed from Cadiz on the 10th of April, and it was at first conjectured that Egypt was the place of their destination. In consequence of this conjecture, Lord Nelson sailed in pursuit of the enemy for the coast of Egypt; and, having missed his object, after reconnoitring that coast, he passed the straits of Gibraltar, and anchored in Lagos bay on the 10th of May; soon after which he sailed for the West Indies with ten ships of the line; arrived off Barbadoes on the 4th of June; and having touched at Tobago, Trinidad, and Grenada, at the latter of which places he was informed that the combined fleet had been seen on the 6th off Dominica; he reached Antigua on the 12th, where he received information that the enemy had been seen on the 8th standing to the northward. Lord Nelson, without the loss of a moment, continued the pursuit of the enemy on their return to Europe, where they arrived about the end of July; and after taking in provisions and water at Gibraltar, and reconnoitring the harbour of Cadiz; he returned to England, where he arrived in the Victory, on the 18th of August, after having been engaged for nearly four months in one of the most arduous, and, at the same time, one of the most important and beneficial, although, in its immediate object, unfruitful enterprises, for which his life was distinguished.\n\nHis lordship had now been absent from England more than two years, on the Mediterranean station.\n\nThe concluding scene of this extraordinary man's naval career, kindles emotions of admiration and regret; and at once excites both transport and extreme of sorrow. Perhaps no action, in point of splendour and magnanimity, can equal that which deprived his country of one of the greatest heroes it ever produced. Britons appear to be sensible of its vast importance; yet it is not improbable that posterity will consider it as still more splendid, their love and admiration not being damped by the poignant recollection that they personally saw the man by whose loss it was accomplished.\n\nWhen Lord Nelson perceived that, in consequence of his manoeuvres, he had reduced the enemy to the absolute necessity of engaging him, he exclaimed in the presence of Captain Hardy and the other officers who surrounded him on the quarter deck; \"Now they cannot escape us; I think we shall at least make sure of twenty of them.\u2014I shall probably lose a leg, but that will be purchasing a victory cheaply.\" But alas! amidst the inexplicable satisfaction and delight, which a victory so splendid could not fail to inspire, he has left us to lament that it was purchased by the loss of a life so incomparably valuable.\n\nHis lordship's flag ship fell on board the Redoubtable, by which means he was exposed to the fire of the musketry from the tops; and the insignia of his grandeur and dignity, it is supposed, flung him out to the aims of the enemy, which in the issue were too fatally successful. His secretary was cut in two by his side with a chain shot, and soon after a ball grazed his lordship's shoulder, entered his left breast, and passed through his lungs. He lived about three hours after this tragic event, during which he remained perfectly recollected, and he displayed the same heroic magnanimity in the arms of death, which had so eminently distinguished him through the whole of his career. His last words to Captain Hardy were, \"I know I am dying, I could have wished to survive to breathe my last upon British ground, but the will of God be done!\" In a few moments he expired. His last signal ought not, and will not be forgotten, which was by telegraph,\u2014 \"That England expected every man would do his duty.\" He spoke in raptures concerning the event of the day only a short time before his dissolution, and sent word to Admiral Collingwood, desiring that he would make his affectionate farewell to all his brother seamen throughout the fleet. In this manner died, in the 47th year of his age, the greatest commander that perhaps ever adorned the British navy, leaving behind him a name dear to Great Britain, and an example of heroism which will inspire his companions in arms to emulate his virtues, that they too may live in the remembrance of a grateful posterity.\n\nHis singular plan of attack on this memorable occasion was communicated by his lordship to all his captains, who unanimously gave it as their opinion that it could not possibly fail of success, being concerted with such consummate wisdom; and they even pledged their lives for the favourable result of it. His titles were, Viscount Nelson, and Duke of Bronte.\u2014The united parliament voted him a pension of 3000l. a year, to continue during his own life and his two next heirs; the East\nEast India company made him a present of 15,000l.; the grand signor gave him a diamond aigrette worth 4000l.; the emperor of Russia gave him a diamond box worth 2500l.; the king of Naples made him presents to the amount of 3000l. together with the dukedom of Bront\u00e9, and an estate of 3000l. per annum. Thus all Europe conspired to testify the estimation in which they held this distinguished hero; and the numerous monuments which have been, and still are erecting to his memory throughout the British empire, will continue lasting evidences of the esteem in which he was held by his grateful country. Parliament also voted a sum for the purchase of an estate for his heirs, and his majesty conferred the title of earl on his immediate successor.\n\nNor were his talents wholly confined to the knowledge of naval tactics, for it is known that as a senator he was highly respectable, although he enjoyed few opportunities of coming forward in that capacity. When he did, his speeches were heard by their lordships with respect, and the most profound attention. The few specimens we have of his abilities as a politician, afford no mean proof that if he had devoted as much of his time to those studies as he did to his peculiar profession, he would have made a distinguished figure in the house of peers.","sp":393,"ep":396},{"h":"NEMEA","t":"in Ancient Geography, situated between Cleone and Philus in Argolis; whether town, district, or other thing, uncertain; there a grove stood in which the Argives celebrated the Nemean games, and there happened all the fabulous circumstances of the Nemean lion.

He was, however, expelled from heaven with Apollo for conspiring against Jupiter, when they were both employed by Laomedon king of Phrygia in building the walls of Troy; but that prince disliking Neptune without a reward, he sent a sea monster to lay waste the country, on which he was obliged to expose his daughter Hesione. He is said to have been the first inventor of horsemanship and chariot racing; on which account Mithridates king of Pontus threw chariots drawn by four horses into the sea in honour of this god; and the Romans instituted horse races in the circus at his festival, during which all other horses left working, and the mules were adorned with wreaths of flowers.\n\nIn a contest with Minerva he produced a horse by striking the earth with his trident; and on another occasion, in a trial of skill with Minerva and Vulcan, produced a bull, whence that animal was sacrificed to him. His favourite wife was Amphitrite, whom he long courted in vain, till sending a dolphin to intercede for him, he met with success; on which he rewarded the dolphin by placing him among the stars. He had also two other wives, one of whom was called Salacia from the salt water; the other Venilia from the ebbing and flowing of the tides. He had likewise many concubines, by whom he had a great number of children. He is represented with black hair, with a garment of an azure or sea green; holding his trident in his hand, and seated in a large shell drawn by sea horses; attended by the sea gods Paleoemon, Glauceus, and Phorcys, and the sea goddesses Thetis, Melita, and Panopaea, and a long train of tritons and sea nymphs.\n\nThis deity was known in Egypt by the name of Canobus or Canopus, and was worshipped as the numen aquarum or spirit of the Nile. His emblem was the figure of certain vases or pitchers, with which the Egyptians filtrated the water of their sacred river, in order to purify and render it fit for use. From the mouth of each of these vases, which were charged with hieroglyphics, arose the head and sometimes the head and hands, of a man or woman. Such are the emblems which still remain of the Egyptian Neptune or Canobus; and it was by this emblem that the tutelar god of Egypt vanquished the god of Chaldea in the ridiculous manner mentioned by Ruthenus in his Ecclesiastical History*. \n\n* Lib. 25.\n\n\"The Chaldeans (says he) who adored the fire, cap. 26. carried their god into various countries that he might try his strength in contests with other gods. He vanquished, as we may easily conceive, the images made of gold, silver, braids, and wood, &c. by reducing them to ashes; and thus the worship of fire was everywhere established. The priest of Canobus, unwilling, as became him, to admit the superiority of strange gods, contrived to make his god vanquish the god of Chaldea in a pitched battle. The vases which were worshipped as the emblems of Canobus being used for filtering the waters of the Nile, were of course perforated on all sides with very small holes. This faithful priest having stopped all the holes in one of these...\"\nthese with wax, and painted the vase of different colours for a reason which the reader will admit to be a good one, filled it up with water, and fitted to its mouth the head of an idol. This emblem of Canobus was then placed in a small fire brought by the Chaldeans as the emblem of their god; and thus the gods of Egypt and Chaldea were forced into battle. The contest, however, was of short duration. The heat melting the wax made way for the water to run out, which quickly extinguished the fire; and thus Canobus vanquished the god of the Chaldeans.\" Ridiculous as this story is, it is perfectly suitable to the genius of Paganism, and the mean artifices of the Pagan priesthood; but we suspect that the historian laboured under one mistake, and substituted the Chaldeans instead of the Persians.

These promising virtues soon, however, proved to be artificial: Nero soon displayed the real propensities of his nature. He delivered himself from the sway of his mother, and at last ordered her to be murdered. This unnatural act of barbarity might astonish some, but Nero had his devoted adherents; and when he declared that he had taken away his mother's life to save himself from ruin, the senate applauded his measures, and the people signified their approbation. Many of his courtiers shared her unhappy fate; and Nero sacrificed to his fury or caprice all such as obstructed his pleasure or diverted his inclination. In the night he generally went from his palace to visit the meanest taverns, and all the scenes of debauchery which Rome contained. In this nocturnal riot he was fond of insulting the people in the streets; and his attempts to offer violence to the wife of a Roman senator nearly cost him his life. He also turned actor, and openly appeared on the Roman stage in the meanest characters. In his attempts to excel in music, and to conquer the disadvantages of a hoarse disagreeable voice, he moderated his meals, and often passed the day without eating. The Olympian games attracted his notice: he went into Greece, and presented himself a candidate for the public honour. He was defeated in wrestling; but the flattery of the spectators adjudged him the victory, and he returned to Rome with all the splendour and pomp of an eastern conqueror, drawn in the chariot of Augustus, and attended by a band of musicians, actors, and stage dancers from every part of the empire. These private and public amusements of the emperor were indeed innocent; his character only was injured, and not the lives of the people. His conduct, however, soon became more abominable: he disguised himself in the habit of a woman, and was publicly married to one of his eunuchs. This violence to nature and decency was soon exchanged for another: Nero refused his sex, and celebrated his nuptials with one of his meanest catamites: and it was on this occasion that one of the Romans observed that the world would have been happy if Nero's father had had such a wife. But his cruelty was now displayed in a still higher degree, for he sacrificed to his wantonness his wife Octavia Poppea, and the celebrated writers, Seneca, Lucan, Petronius, &c. Nor did the Christians escape his barbarity. He had heard of the burning of Troy; and as he wished to renew that dismal scene, he caused Rome to be set on fire in different places. The conflagration became soon universal, and during nine successive days the fire continued. All was desolation: nothing was heard but the lamentations of mothers whose children had perished in the flames, the groans of the dying, and the continual fall of palaces and buildings. Nero was the only one who enjoyed the general consternation. He placed himself on the top of a high tower, and he sang on his lyre the destruction of Troy, a dreadful scene which his barbarity had realized before his eyes. He attempted to avert the public odium from his head by a pretended commiseration of the miseries of his subjects. He began to repair the streets and the public buildings at his own expense. He built himself a celebrated palace, which he called his golden house. It was liberally adorned with gold, with precious stones, and with every thing rare and exquisite. It contained spacious fields, artificial lakes, woods, gardens, orchards, and whatever exhibited a beautiful scene. The entrance of this edifice could admit a large coffin of the emperor 120 feet high; the galleries were each a mile long, and the whole was covered with gold.\ngold. The roofs of the dining halls represented the firmament, in motion as well as in figure; and continually turned round night and day, showering down all sorts of perfumes and sweet waters. When this grand edifice, which, according to Pliny, extended all round the city, was finished, Nero said, that now he could lodge like a man. His profusion was not less remarkable in all his other actions. When he went a fishing, his nets were of gold and silk. He never appeared twice in the same garment; and when he took a voyage, there were thousands of servants to take care of his wardrobe. This continuation of debauchery and extravagance at last roused the people. Many conspiracies were formed against him; but they were generally discovered, and such as were accessory suffered the severest punishments. The most dangerous conspiracy against Nero's life was that of Piso, from which he was saved by the confession of a slave. The conspiracy of Galba proved more successful, who, when he was informed that his plot was known to Nero, declared himself emperor. The unpopularity of Nero favoured his cause; he was acknowledged by all the Roman empire, and the senate condemned the tyrant to be dragged naked through the streets of Rome, and whipped to death, and afterwards to be thrown down from the Tarpeian rock like the meanest malefactor. This, however, was not executed; for Nero prevented it by a voluntary death. He killed himself, A.D. 68, in the 32nd year of his age, after a reign of 13 years and eight months. Rome was filled with acclamations on the occasion; and the citizens, more strongly to indicate their joy, wore caps, such as were generally used by slaves who had received their freedom. Their vengeance was not only exercised against the statues of the deceased monster, but many of his friends were the object of the public resentment; and many were crucified to pieces in such a violent manner, that one of the senators, amid the universal joy, said that he was afraid they should soon have cause to wish for Nero. The tyrant, as he expired, requested that his head might not be cut off from his body, and exposed to the insolence of the populace, but that the whole might be burned on the funeral pile. His request was granted by one of Galba's freedmen, and his obsequies were performed with the usual ceremonies. Though his death seemed to be the source of general gladness, yet many of his favourites lamented his fall, and were grieved to see that their pleasures and amusements were stopped by the death of this patron of debauchery and extravagance. Even the king of Parthia sent ambassadors to Rome, to console with the Romans, and to beg that they would honour and revere the memory of Nero. His statues were also crowned with garlands of flowers; and many imagined that he was not dead, but that he would soon make his appearance and take vengeance on his enemies. It will be sufficient to observe, in finishing the character of this tyrannical monster, that the name of Nero is even now used emphatically to express a barbarous and unfeeling oppressor. Pliny calls him the common enemy and fury of mankind; and so indeed he has been called by all writers, who exhibit Nero as a pattern of the most execrable barbarity and unpardonable wantonness. The same Pliny furnishes us with this singular anecdote of him: \"Nero had ordered himself to be painted under the figure of a colossus, upon cloth or canvas, 120 feet in height.\" He adds, \"that this preposterous picture, when it was finished, met with its fate from lightning, which consumed it, and involved likewise the most beautiful part of the gardens where it was placed in the conflagration.\"","sp":398,"ep":400},{"h":"NERVA","t":"COCEIUS, a Roman emperor after Domitian, who was the last of the 12 Caesars. He was a native of Narnia in Umbria; his family however was originally of Crete. Dion Cassius says he was born on the 19th of March, in the 18th year of Tiberius's reign, and of the Christian era the 32d. Nero in the 12th year of his reign made him praetor, and erected a statue for him in the palace on account of his poems (for he was one of the best poets of his age), some of which were inscribed to him. He was consul in 71 with Vespasian, and in 90 with Domitian.\n\nAncient authors uniformly celebrate him as a prince of a most mild and humane temper, of great moderation and generosity, who looked on his office as emperor, not as if it was for his own advantage, but for that of his people; and whilst he reigned, which was however but for a short time, he made the happiness of his subjects his only end and pursuit. He narrowly escaped death under Domitian; was naturally of a weak and timorous disposition; and, as some say, addicted to excessive drinking. The Romans unanimously chose him emperor; and they had no cause to repent of their choice, for he was constantly attentive to what could make them happy; he was generous, merciful, and disinterested. An instance of his great lenity appears in his pardoning Calpurnius Crassus who conspired against him. In short, he omitted nothing that might contribute to the restoring of the empire to its former lustre: recalling those who had been banished for religion, and redressing all grievances that came to his knowledge. He however found his strength failing, and that it would be impossible for him to finish his designs, in consequence of which he adopted Trajan. After his death, which happened in the year 98, he was ranked among the gods.

He had eleven brothers, who were all killed with his father by Hercules. His tender age detained him at home, and was the cause of his preservation. The conqueror spared his life and placed him upon the throne of Pylos. He married Eurydice the daughter of Clymenus; or, according to others, Anaxibia the daughter of Atreus. He soon distinguished himself in the field of battle; and was present at the nuptials of Perithous, when a bloody engagement took place between the Lapithae and Centaurs. As king of Pylos and Messenia he led his subjects to the Trojan war, where he distinguished himself among the rest of the Grecian chiefs, by eloquence, address, wisdom, justice, and uncommon prudence. Homer displays his character as the most perfect of all his heroes; and Agamemnon exclaims, that if he had 20 generals like Nestor, he should soon see the walls of Troy reduced to ashes. After the Trojan war Nestor retired to Greece, where he enjoyed in the bosom of his family the peace and tranquility which were due to his wisdom and to his age. The manner and the time of his death are unknown: the ancients are all agreed that he lived three generations of men; which length of time is supposed to be 300 years, though more probably only 90 years, allowing 30 years for each generation. From that circumstance, therefore, it was usual among the Greeks and the Latins, when they wished a long and happy life to their friends, to wish them to see the years of Nestor. He had many children; two daughters, Pheidice and Polycaete; and seven sons, Perseus, Stratocles, Aretus, Echephron, Pisistratus, Antilochus, and Thryamedes. Nestor was one of the Argonauts, according to Valerius Flaccus, v. 380, &c.\u2014A poet of Lyconia in the age of the emperor Severus. He was father to Pindar, who under the emperor Alexander wrote some fabulous stories\u2014One of the body guards of Alexander.\n\nNestor, whose secular name is not known, was a native of Ruffia, and the earliest historian of the north. He was born in 1056 at Bielozero; and in the 10th year of his age he assumed the monastic habit in the convent of Petcheriski at Kiof, and took the name of Nestor. He there made a considerable proficiency in the Greek language; but seems to have formed his style and manner rather from the Byzantine historians, Cedrenus, Zonaras, and Syncellus, than from the ancient classics. The time of Nestor\u2019s death is not ascertained; but he is supposed to have lived to an advanced age, and to have died about the year 1115.\n\nHis great work is his Chronicle, to which he has prefixed an introduction, which after a short sketch of the early state of the world, taken from the Byzantine writers, contains a geographical description of Ruffia and the adjacent regions; an account of the Slavonian nations, their manners, their emigrations from the banks of the Danube, their dispersion, and settlement in the several countries wherein their descendants are now established. He then enters upon a chronological series of the Ruffian annals, from the year 858 to about 1113. His style is simple and unadorned, such as suits a mere recorder of facts; but his chronological exactness, though it renders his narrative dry and tedious, contributes to ascertain the era and authenticity of the events which he relates.\n\nIt is remarkable (says Mr Coxe, from whom we have taken this narrative), that an author of such importance, whose name frequently occurs in the early Ruffian books, should have remained in obscurity above 600 years; and been scarcely known to his modern countrymen, the origin and actions of whose ancestors he records with such circumstantial exactness. A copy of his Chronicle was given in 1668 by Prince Radzivil to the library of Konigburg, where it lay unnoticed, till Peter the Great, in his passage through that town, ordered a transcript of it to be sent to Peterburgh. But it still was not known as the performance of Nestor; for when Muller in 1732 published the first part of a German translation, he mentioned it as the work of the abbot Theodosius of Kiof; an error which arose from the following circumstance: The ingenious editor not being at that time sufficiently acquainted with the Slavonian tongue, employed an interpreter, who, by mistaking a letter in the title, supposed it to have been written by a person whose name was Theodosius. This ridiculous blunder was soon circulated, and copied by many foreign writers, even long after it had been candidly acknowledged and corrected by Muller.","sp":400,"ep":401},{"h":"NESTORIANS","t":"a sect of ancient Christians, still said to be subsisting in some parts of the Levant; whose distinguishing tenet is, that Mary is not the mother of God. They take their name from Nestorius bishop of Constantinople, whose doctrines were spread with much zeal through Syria, Egypt, and Persia.\n\nOne of the chief promoters of the Nestorian cause was Barhumas, created bishop of Nisibis, A.D. 435. Such was his zeal and success, that the Nestorians, who still remain in Chaldea, Persia, Assyria, and the adjacent countries, consider him alone as their parent and founder. By him Phrozes the Persian monarch was persuaded to expel those Christians who adopted the opinions of the Greeks, and to admit the Nestorians in their place, putting them in possession of the principal seat of ecclesiastical authority in Persia, the see of Seleucia, which the patriarch of the Nestorians has always filled even down to our time.\u2014Barhumas also erected a school at Nisibis, from which proceeded those Nestorian doctors who in the fifth and sixth centuries spread abroad their tenets through Egypt, Syria, Arabia, India, Tartary, and China.\n\nHe differed considerably from Nestorius, holding that there are two persons in Jesus Christ, as well as that the Virgin was not his mother, as God, but only as man.\n\nThe abettors of this doctrine refuse the title Nestorians; alleging that it had been handed down from the earliest times of the Christian church.\n\nIn the tenth century, the Nestorians in Chaldea, whence they are sometimes called Chaldeans, extended their spiritual conquests beyond Mount Imaus, and introduced the Christian religion into Tartary properly so called, and especially into that country called Karii, bordering on the northern part of China. The prince of that country, whom the Nestorians converted to the Christian faith, assumed, according to the vulgar tradition, the name of John after his baptism, to which he added...\nNestorians added the surname of Presbyter, from a principle of\nmodesty; whence it is said his successors were each of\nthem called Presbyter John until the time of Gengis Khan. But Molheim observes, that the famous Presbyter John did not begin to reign in that part of Asia before\nthe conclusion of the 11th century. The Nestorians formed so considerable a body of Christians, that the\nmissionaries of Rome were industrious in their endeavours to reduce them under the papal yoke. Innocent IV., in 1246, and Nicolas IV., in 1278, used their utmost efforts for this purpose, but without success. Till\nthe time of Pope Julius III., the Nestorians acknowledged but one patriarch, who resided first at Bagdad, and afterwards at Mosul; but a division arising among\nthem, in 1551 the patriarchate became divided, at least for a time, and a new patriarch was consecrated by that pope, whose successors fixed their residence in\nthe city of Ormus in the mountainous part of Persia,\nwhere they still continue, distinguished by the name of Simeon; and so far down as the last century, these patriarchs persevered in their communion with the church of Rome, but seem at present to have withdrawn themselves from it. The great Nestorian pontiffs, who form\nthe opposite party, and look with a hostile eye on this little patriarch, have since the year 1559 been distinguished by the general denomination of Elias, and re-\nside constantly in the city of Mosul. Their spiritual\ndominion is very extensive, takes in a great part of A-\nsia, and comprehends also within its circuit the Arabian\nNestorians, and also the Christians of St Thomas, who\ndwell along the coast of Malabar. It is observed, to\nthe lasting honour of the Nestorians, that all the\nChristian societies established in the East, they have\nbeen the most careful and successful in avoiding a mul-\ntitude of superstitious opinions and practices that have\ninfected the Greek and Latin churches. About the\nmiddle of the 17th century, the Roman missionaries\ngained over to their communion a small number of Ne-\nstorians, whom they formed into a congregation or\nchurch; the patriarchs or bishops of which reside in\nthe city of Amida, or Diarbekir, and all assume the deno-\nmination of Joseph. Nevertheless the Nestorians in ge-\nneral persevere to our own times in their refusal to en-\nter into the communion of the Roman church, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties and alluring offers that\nhave been made by the pope's legate to conquer their\ninflexible constancy.","sp":401,"ep":402},{"h":"NESTORIUS","t":"from whom the sect of Nestorian\nChristians derive their name, was born in Germanica a\ncity of Syria. He received his education at Antioch,\nwhere he was likewise baptized; and soon after his bap-\ntism he withdrew himself to a monastery in the suburbs\nof that city. Upon his being admitted to the order of\npriesthood, he quickly acquired so great reputation by\nthe eloquence of his preaching, and the regularity of\nhis life, that by the emperor Theodosius he was deemed a fit person to fill the second see in the Christian\nchurch, and was accordingly consecrated bishop of Con-\nstantinople in the year 429.\n\nIn one of his first sermons after his promotion, he\npublicly declared his intention to make war upon here-\nties; and with that intolerant spirit which has so often\ndisgraced the preachers of the mild religion of Jesus, he\ncalled upon the emperor to free the earth from heretics,\npromising to give him heaven as a reward for his zeal.\n\nTo this spiritual motive he added one, that, though\ncarnal, he possibly judged of equal force:\u2014\"Join\nwith me (said he) in war against them, and I will assist\nyou against the Persians.\" Although the wiser and\nbetter part of his audience were amazed to see a man,\nbefore he had tasted (as the historian expresses himself) the water of his city, declare that he would per-\nsecute all who were not of his opinion; yet the majori-\nty of the people approved of this discourse, and encour-\naged him to execute his purpose. Accordingly, five\ndays after his consecration, he attempted to demolish\nthe church in which the Arians secretly held their as-\nsemblies; and he succeeded so far in his design, that\nthese people, growing desperate, set it on fire them-\nselves, and consumed with it some of the neighbouring\nhouses. This fire excited great commotion in the\ncity, and Nestorius was ever afterwards called an in-\ncendiary.\n\nFrom the Arians he turned his persecution against\nthe Novatians, but was stopped in his career by the in-\nterposition of the emperor. He then let loose his fury\nupon those Christians of Asia, Lydia, and Caria, who\ncelebrated the feast of Easter upon the 14th day of the\nmoon; and for this unimportant deviation from the Ca-\ntholic practice, many of these people were murdered\nby his agents both at Miletum and Sardis.\u2014One can-\nnot be sorry that such a relentless persecutor should him-\nself be afterwards condemned as a heretic, for holding\nan opinion which no man who speaks or thinks with\nphilosophical accuracy will now venture to controvert.\nThis obnoxious tenet which produced a schism in the\nchurch, and was condemned by a general council, was\nnothing more than that \"the Virgin Mary cannot with\npropriety be called the mother of God.\" The people\nbeing accustomed to hear this expression, were much\ninflamed against their bishop, imagining that he had re-\nvived the error of Paulus Samotrenus and Photinus,\nwho taught that Jesus Christ was a mere man. The\nmonks declared openly against him, and, with some of\nthe most considerable men in Constantinople, separated\nthemselves from his communion. Several bishops wrote\nto him earnest persuasions to acknowledge that Mary\nwas the mother of God; and when he would not com-\nply, they procured his condemnation in the council of\nEphesus, which deprived him of his see. He then re-\ntired to his ancient monastery at Antioch, whence he\nwas taken four years afterwards by the emperor's order,\nand banished in 435 to Tarsus. That city being taken\nand destroyed by the barbarians, he was removed to\nPanopolis, a city of Thebais; where he was not suffer-\ned to remain long, but was compelled to go from place\nto place, till, being in one of his journeys mortally\nbruised by a fall, death relieved him from the fury of\nhis persecutors.\n\nIf we examine such of his writings as remain, we\nshall find that he was very unjustly condemned. It ap-\npears that he rejected the errors of Ebion, Paulus Sa-\nmotrenus, and Photinus; that he maintained in express\nterms, that the divine Word was united to the human\nnature in Jesus Christ in the most strict and intimate\nsense possible; that these two natures, in this state of\nunion, make but one Christ and one person; that the\nproperties of the Divine and human natures may both\nbe attributed to this person; and that Jesus Christ may\nbe said to have been born of a virgin, to have suffered\nand died; but he never would admit that God could be said to have been born, to have suffered, or to have died.\u2014When we consider that every person partakes of the substance of his mother, and that it is this which constitutes the parental and filial relation between them, it is indeed surprising that the expression \"Mother of God\" should ever have been admitted into the Christian church, or that any man who understands the meaning of the words should condemn Nestorius for not having used them.","sp":402,"ep":403},{"h":"NESTUS","t":"or Nessus, a river which separates Thrace from Macedonia.

See the article FISHERY.\n\nThe taking fowls by nets is the readiest and most advantageous of all others, where numbers are to be taken. The making the nets is very easy, and what every true sportman ought to be able to do for himself. All the necessary tools are wooden needles, of which there should be several of different sizes, some round and others flat; a pair of round pointed and flat scissors; and a wheel to wind off the thread. The pack-thread is to be of different strength and thicknesses, according to the sort of birds to be taken; and the general size of the meshes, if not for very small birds, is two inches from point to point. The nets should neither be made too deep nor too long, for they are then difficult to manage; and they must be verged on each side with twisted thread. The natural colour of the thread is too bright and pale, and is therefore in many cases to be altered. The most usual colour is the ruffet; which is to be obtained by plunging the net, after it is made, into a tanners pit, and letting it lie there till it be sufficiently tinged: this is of a double service to the net, since it preserves the thread as well as alters the colour. The green colour is given by chopping some green wheat and boiling it in water, and then soaking the net in this green tincture. The yellow colour is given in the same manner with the decoction of celandine; which gives a pale straw-colour, which is the colour of stubble in the harvest-time. The brown nets are to be used on ploughed lands, the green on grassy grounds, and the yellow on stubble lands.\n\nDay-Net, among fowlers, a net generally used for taking such small birds as play in the air, and will swoop either to prey, gig, or the like; as larks, linnets, bunting, &c. The time of the year for using this net is from August to November; and the best time is very early in the morning: and it is to be observed, that the milder the air, and the brighter the sun is, the better will be the sport, and of longer continuance. The place where this net should be laid, ought to be plain champaign, either on short stubbles, green lays, or flat meadows, near corn fields, and somewhat remote from towns and villages: you must be sure to let your net lie close to the ground, that the birds creep not out and make their escape.\u2014The net is made of a fine pack-thread with a small mesh, not exceeding half an inch square; it must be three fathoms long, and but one broad: it must be verged about with a small but strong cord; and the two ends extended upon two small long poles, suitable to the breadth of the net, with four stakes, tail-rings, and drawing-lines.\u2014This net is composed of two, which must be exactly alike; and are to be laid opposite to one another, so even and close, that when they are drawn and pulled over, the sides must meet and touch each other. You must stake this net down with strong stakes, very stiff on their lines, so that you may with a nimble touch cast them to and fro at pleasure; then fasten your drawing-cord or hand-lines (of which there must be a dozen at least, and each two yards long) to the upper end of the foremost staves: and so extend them of such a straitness, that with a little strength they may rise up in the nets and cast them over.\n\nYour nets being thus laid, place your gigs, or playing-wantons, about 20 or 30 paces beyond, and as much on this side your nets: the gigs must be fastened to the tops of long poles, and turned into the wind, so as they may play to make a noise therein. These gigs are a sort of toys made of long goose-feathers, like shuttle-cocks, and with little small tunnels of wood running in broad and flat swan-quills, made round like a small hoop; and so, with longer strings fastened to a pole, will, with any small wind or air, move after such a manner, that birds will come in great flocks to play about them.\n\nWhen you have placed your gigs, then place your stake; which is a small stake of wood, to prick down into the earth, having in it a mortice-hole, in which a small and slender piece of wood, about two feet long, is fastened, so as it may move up and down at pleasure: and fasten to this longer stick a small line, which, running through a hole in the stick above-mentioned, and so coming up to the place where you are to fit, you may, by drawing the line up and down with your right hand, raise up the longer stick as you see occasion.\n\nFasten a live lark, or such like bird, to this longer stick, which, with the line making it to flit up and down by your pulling, will entice the birds to come to your net.\n\nThere is another stake, or enticement, to draw on these birds, called a looking-glass; which is a round stake of wood, as big as man's arm, made very sharp at the end, to thrust it into the ground: they make it very hollow in the upper part, above five fingers deep; into which hollow they place a three-square piece of wood about a foot long, and each two inches broad, lying upon the top of the stake, and going with a foot into the hollows: which foot must have a great knob at the top, and another at the bottom, with a deep flenderness between; to which flenderness you are to fasten a small pack-thread, which, running through a hole in the side of the stake, must come up to the place where you fit. The three-square piece of wood which lies on the top of the stake, must be of such a polite and evenness, and the foot of the socket so smooth and round, that it may whirl and turn round upon the least touch; winding the pack-thread so many times about it, which being suddenly drawn, and as suddenly let go, will keep the engine in a constant rotatory motion: then fasten with glue on the uppermost flat squares of the three-square piece, about 20 small pieces of looking-glass, and paint all the square wood between them of a light and lively red; which, in\nthe continual motion, will give such a reflection, that the birds will play about to admiration until they are taken.\n\nBoth this and the other stake are to be placed in the middle between the two nets, about two or three feet distance from each other; so that, in the falling of the nets, the cords may not touch or annoy them: neither must they stand one before or after another; the glass being kept in a continual motion, and the bird very often fluttering. Having placed your nets in this manner, as also your gigs and stakes, go to the further end of your long drawing lines and stake lines; and, having placed yourself, lay the main drawing line across your thigh, and, with your left, pull the stake line to throw the birds; and when you perceive them to play near and about your nets and stakes, then pull the net over with both hands, with a quick but not too hasty motion; for otherwise your sport will be spoiled.\n\nSee Plate CCCLXIX. where A shows the bodies of the main net, and how they ought to be laid.

They consist of 17 provinces; 10 of which are called the Austrian and French Netherlands, and the other seven the United Provinces.\n\nThe greatest part of the Netherlands was conquered by the Romans; and that part which lies towards Gaul continued in their subjection till the decline of that empire; after which the Franks became masters of it; and, under the French monarchy, it was part of the kingdom of Metz or Austra.\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century Maximilian of Austria, son of the emperor Ferdinand III. acquired, by marrying the only daughter of the duke of Burgundy, the duchies of Brabant, Limburg, and Luxemburg; the counties of Flanders, Burgundy, Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Namur; and the lordship of Friesland. Philip of Austria, son to Maximilian and Mary, married Jane the daughter of Ferdinand king of Arragon and of Isabella queen of Castile; by which means their son Charles inherited not only almost all Spain and the great countries then lately discovered in America, but also those noble provinces of the Netherlands, and was chosen emperor under the name of Charles V.\n\nTowards the latter end of the 1527, he added to his dominions the temporalities of the bishopric of Utrecht on both sides of the Yssel; and Henry of Bavaria, being distressed through war with the duke of Guelderland, and tired with the continued rebellion of his own subjects, surrendered to the emperor the temporalities of his diocese, which was confirmed by the pope, and the states of the country. In 1536, Charles V. bought of Charles of Egmond the reverence of the duchy of Guelderland and of the county of Zutphen, in case that prince should die without issue. The same year the city of Groningen took the oath of allegiance, and submitted to Charles V. and in 1543 he put a garrison into the city of Cambrai, and built a citadel there. Having thus united the 17 provinces, as it were in one body, he ordered that they should continue for ever under the same prince, without being ever separated or dismembered; for which purpose he published in November 1549, with the consent and at the request of the states of all the provinces, a perpetual and irrevocable edict or law, by which it was enacted, that in order to keep all those provinces together under one and the same prince, the right of representation, with regard to the succession of a prince or princes, should take place for ever, both in a direct and collateral line, notwithstanding the common laws of some provinces to the contrary. Charles had even a mind to incorporate these provinces with the Germanic body, and to make of them a circle of the empire, under the title of the circle of Burgundy, in order thereby to engage the princes of the empire to concern themselves for the preferment of those provinces. But the Netherlands, always jealous of their liberty, did not seem to like that incorporation; and when they were demanded to pay their share towards the expenses of the empire, they refused it: whereupon the princes of Germany refused, in their turn, to take any part in the wars in Flanders, and looked upon those provinces as by no means belonging to the Germanic body.\n\nPhilip of Austria and his son Charles, who were born in the Netherlands, had for these provinces that natural affection which men use to have for their native country; and, knowing how jealous the inhabitants were of their liberty, and of the privileges granted to them by their former princes, they took great care to preserve them, and suffered willingly that the states, who were the guardians of the people's liberty and privileges,\nshould in a manner share the supreme authority with them. Philip II., son to the emperor Charles V., had not the same affection for the Netherlands, nor those generous sentiments which his father had endeavoured to inspire him with. Being born in Spain of a Portuguese woman, he had no regard but for his native country; and, when he removed out of the Netherlands, he left them to the weak government of a woman, to the proud and haughty spirit of Cardinal de Grenville, and to the wild ambition of some lords of these provinces, who availing themselves of the imprudent conduct and continual blunders of the council of Spain, found their private interest in the disturbances they could not fail to produce. Philip II., also, instead of the mild and moderate measures which his predecessors had successfully employed on many occasions, as best suiting the genius and temper of the people, had recourse to the most violent and cruel proceedings; which, far from curing the evil, served only to exasperate it more and render it incurable. The Spaniards, whom he sent thither, being born and educated in an absolute monarchy, jealous of the liberties and envious of the riches of the people, broke through all their privileges, and used them almost after the same manner as they had done the inhabitants of their new and ill-gotten dominions in America. This treatment occasioned a general insurrection. The counts Hoorn, Egmont, and the prince of Orange, appeared at the head of it, and Luther's reformation gaining ground about the same time in the Netherlands, his disciples joined the malecontents; whereupon King Philip introduced a kind of inquisition in order to suppress them, and many thousands were put to death by that court, besides those that perished by the sword; for these persecutions and encroachments had occasioned a civil war, in which several battles were fought. The counts Hoorn and Egmont were taken and beheaded; but the prince of Orange, retiring into Holland, with the assistance of England and France, preferred Holland and some of the adjacent provinces, which entered into a treaty for their mutual defence at Utrecht in 1579; and they have ever since been styled the United Provinces; but the other provinces were reduced to the obedience of Spain by the duke of Alva and other Spanish generals. However, their ancient privileges were in a great measure restored; every province was allowed its great council or parliament, whose concurrence was required to the making of laws, and raising money for the government, though these assemblies were too often obliged to follow the dictates of the court.\n\nThe emperor Joseph II. endeavoured to deprive them even of the form of their free constitution; and he might very probably have succeeded, had he not attempted at the same time a reformation of the church. The Austrian Netherlands are wholly Catholic, and so bigotted to the Roman superstition, that though they had tamely submitted to many encroachments of the archducal house on their civil rights, no sooner did the monarch encroach upon the property of the holy mother church than they resisted his authority, and claimed all their ancient privileges political and religious. The same attachment to their ancient faith and worship made them very lately contribute to expel from their territories the French whom they had invited to relieve them from the Austrian yoke. Thus her religious bigotry for once saved a free people from the iron rod of despotism on the one hand, and the cruelties of frantic democrats on the other. The provinces under the government of France were, till the late revolution, under the same severe arbitrary dominion as the other subjects of that crown; and they now experience the same miseries with the rest of the republic.\n\nThe Spaniards continued possessed of almost eight of these provinces, until the duke of Marlborough, general of the allies, gained the memorable victory of Ramillies. After which Brussels the capital, and great part of these provinces, acknowledged Charles VI. (afterwards emperor) their sovereign; and his daughter, the late empress queen, remained possessed of them till the war that followed the death of her father, when the French made an entire conquest of them, except part of the province of Luxemburg; but they were restored by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, and the French retained only Artois, the Cambresis, part of Flanders, part of Hainault, and part of Luxemburg, of which they have had the dominion now upwards of eighty years.\n\nThe soil is generally fruitful, but differs in the several parts. The climate also differs in the several provinces; in those towards the south it does not differ much from that of England, though the seasons are more regular. In the northern provinces the winter is generally very sharp, and the summer sultry hot; but the extreme cold and excessive heat seldom continue above five or six weeks. The air is reckoned very wholesome, but is subject to thick fogs in winter, through the moistness of the country, which would be very noxious, were it not for the dry easterly winds, which, blowing off a long continent for two or three months in the year, clear the air, and occasion very sharp frosts in January and February; during which, the ports, rivers, and canals, are commonly shut up. The face of the country is low and flat; for, except some small hills and a few rising grounds in Utrecht and Guelderland, and in the parts lying towards Germany, there is no hill to be seen in the whole 17 provinces. This is the reason why they have been called the Low Countries. French Flanders abounds in grain, vegetables, flax, and cattle, but is in want of wood.

There are several ancient ruins near it, which show its former extent; and there are two large churches, besides a castle where the governor resides. The town contains about 3000 inhabitants. It is situated partly on a small plain, between Mount Jura and the lake of Neuchatel, which is 17 miles long and five broad; the side of the harbour is the usual walk of the inhabitants. Part of it too is built upon the side of the mountain; whence some of its streets are very steep. In this small place several public works have lately been executed, which Mr Coxe thinks are far beyond the revenues, or even the wants, of such a little state. Among these he inflates a superb causeway and a town-house \"built (says he) of such solid materials, as if it was intended to survive to the most distant posterity, and to rival the duration of the much-famed Roman capitol.\" At the beginning of the 18th century, commerce was very little followed in this town, owing to an absurd opinion which prevailed among the inhabitants of its being disgraceful; but this prejudice is now extinguished, and the town in a much more flourishing situation than before. The chief article of exportation is wine, which is much esteemed; and manufactures of printed linens and cottons have been established with considerable success. The flourishing state of Neuchatel is principally owing to the benefactions of Mr David Pury, late banker of the court at Lisbon. He was born at Neuchatel in 1700; but having received his education there, he quitted it in great poverty, and repaired to Geneva, where he served his apprenticeship, but in what line is not mentioned. From Geneva he went to London, where he acted as clerk to a dealer in precious stones, and acquired great reputation by estimating the value of diamonds at sight. After a long residence in England he went to Lisbon, where he carried on a very extensive commerce: and having been appointed court-banker, his fortune rapidly increased. His generosity, however, kept pace with his wealth; and he not only remitted large sums to Neuchatel while living, but left his country his heir when he died. His contributions in all are estimated by Mr Coxe at 200,000l.; a considerable part of which has been employed in constructing the public works already mentioned. Neuchatel has a grand and little council: the first is composed of 40 persons, with two matters of the keys; the little council consists of 24 members, comprehending the mayor, who is president. These two councils assemble regularly every month. The ecclesiastics likewise assemble every month, to consult on affairs belonging to the church, and to fill up the places of ministers that die. They choose a dean every year, who is president of the general assemblies, which are called cl\u00f4tures; and sometimes he is confirmed in this dignity. E. Long. 7\u00b0 10' N.

It was never executed, as we are just informed by a gentleman who left St Peterburgh about the beginning of June 1793; but the model remains, and is still shown. The same gentleman (we quote his own words) adds, \"that every mechanic thinks it practicable; and that the general belief is, that the empress would have built it, had she not found use for all her money in carrying on her warlike and diplomatic transactions with other courts.\"\nNeuchattel south by the cantons of Berne and Friburg. This principality of Neuchattel and Vallengin extend from the lake of Neuchattel to the borders of Franche Compte, being in length about 12 leagues, and fix in breadth. The plain with the lower part of the mountains is occupied by the district of Neuchattel, but Vallengin is totally enclosed by Jura. Parallel chains of these mountains run from east to west, forming several valleys in the most elevated parts. The lower grounds of this chain consist of arable lands and vineyards; the higher of large tracts of forest, which in many parts have been cleared and converted into pasture grounds, interspersed with fields of barley and oats. The inhabitants are numerous, and remarkable for their genius, politeness, and active industry. It contains three cities, one town, 95 villages, and about 300 houses dispersed in the mountains. The inhabitants are all Protestants, except two Roman catholic villages; and in 1529 they entered into a strict alliance with the cantons of Berne, Friburg, Soleure, and Lucern. The air is healthy and temperate, but the soil not everywhere equally fertile; however, there are large vineyards, which produce white and red wine, which last is excellent. The pastures on the mountains feed a great number of cattle; there are plenty of deer in the forests; the lakes and rivers abound with fish. The mildness of the government, and agreeable situation of the inhabitants in general in these districts, is evident from the great increase of population in the space of 32 years. In 1752 they contained only 28,017 subjects and 4318 aliens; but in 1784 the number was augmented to 31,576 subjects and 9704 aliens; being an increase of near a fourth part in that time. The facility with which the burghership of Neuchattel is acquired, may also be accounted one of the means of augmenting its population; for between the years 1760 and 1770, the magistrates admitted 41 persons to this privilege; from 1770 to 1780, 46; from 1780 to 1785, 51; in all 138; many of whom had children before they purchased their burghership, and 38 of them were foreigners, either German, French, or Dutch.

See Gender.\n\nThe Latins have three kinds of genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter. In English, and other modern tongues, there is no such thing as neuter nouns. See Noun.\n\nVerbs Neuter, by some grammarians called intransitive verbs, are those which govern nothing, and that are neither active nor passive. See Verb.\n\nWhen the action expressed by the verb has no object to fall upon, but the verb alone supplies the whole idea of the action; the verb is said to be neuter: as, I sleep, thou yawns, he sneezes, we walk, ye run, they stand still.\n\nSome divide verbs neuter into, 1. Such as do not signify any action, but a quality; as albet, \"it is white;\"\nNeutral Salts or a situation, as sedet, \"he sits;\" or have some relation to place; as adele, \"he is present;\" or to some other state or attribute, as regnat, \"he rules,\" &c.

Thus the old French poets say, Soupirer son tourment; the English, to sigh his woer, &c.\n\nBut this is observed only to obtain where something particular is to be expressed, not contained in the verb: as, vivere vitam beatam, to live a happy life; pugnare bonam pugnam, to fight a good fight, &c.\n\nAccording to the abbot de Dangeau, verbs neuter may be divided into active and passive; the first, those that form their tenses in English, by the auxiliary verb to have; in French, by avoir. The second, those that form them in English with the verb to be; in French \u00eatre.\u2014Thus, to sleep, to yawn, dormir, and eternuer, are neuters active.\u2014To come, and to arrive, are neuters passive.\n\nNeutral Salts, in Chemistry, compounded of an acid with any other substance capable of uniting with it and destroying its acidity, as sulphuric acid and soda, or Glauber's salt, muriatic acid and soda, or common salt.\n\nNeutrality, the state of a person or thing that is neuter, or that takes part with neither side.\n\nNew Abbey, situated near Kilcullen bridge in the county of Kildare, and province of Leinster, in Ireland.

In the inside Rowland Eustace and his lady lie buried; their figures, clothed in armour, are to be seen there. Near this is a handsome seat of the Carter family, on the opposite side of the river Liffey.\n\nNewark upon Trent, in the county of Nottingham, is a great thoroughfare in the York road, 124 miles from London. It has bridges over the Trent, which forms an island here, by dividing itself into two streams two miles above the town, which meet again two miles below it. A magnificent castle was built here in the reign of King Stephen, which held out stoutly in the barons wars for King John, who died here, October 19, 1216; and it also stood out for King Charles I., to the last; but after he had put himself into the hands of the Scots army then before it, the governor by his order surrendered it, after which it was demolished.\u2014It was situated near the river; the walls of the towers are very thick, and of a very great height; and were there no historical testimony, these remains are sufficient evidence that it was formerly of great importance. In the court before these ruins is a very fine bowling green, and near it a manufactory of facking. The town being subject to inundations from the river Trent, and often from that circumstance made impassable, a turnpike road, at the instigation of a publican, was made about twenty years ago, so high as to be passed with safety in the greatest floods, by arches of brick being made in several places to carry off the water, constructed by Mr Smeaton, at the expense of \u00a32,000. Near the town there is a bridge constructed for the same purpose, made mostly upon dry land, consisting of nine arches. Its church, which is reckoned one of the finest in the kingdom, was built by Henry VI. and has a lofty spire.\n\nNewborough, or Newburgh, in the Isle of Anglesey, North Wales, distant from London 254 miles, though but a small town, situated over against Caernarvon in North Wales, about 17 miles southwest from Beaumaris, is governed by a mayor, two bailiffs, and a recorder.

Notwithstanding its name signifies New-Borough, it is as old almost as the Conquest. It made so much broad cloth formerly, that in the reign of Henry VIII. here flourished John Wincomb, commonly called Jack of Newbury, one of the greatest clothiers that ever was in England, who kept 100 looms in his house; and in the expedition to Flodden Field against the Scots, marched with 100 of his own men, all armed and clothed at his own expense; and he built all the west part of the church. Also Mr Kenric, the son of a clothier here, though afterwards a merchant in London, left \u00a34000 to the town, as well as \u00a33000 to Reading, to encourage the woollen manufactory. It makes a great quantity of shalloons and druggets, but not near so much broad cloth now as formerly; yet it is a flourishing town, with spacious streets, and a large market place, in which is the guild-hall. In the neighbourhood, on the banks of the Kennet, there is a stratum of petrified wood dug out for firing, where they frequently find trunks of large oaks yet undecayed, with petrified hazel nuts, fir cones, &c. with the bones and horns of stags, antelopes, &c. tusks of boars, and heads of beavers. The river Kennet, which abounds with excellent trout, eels, and cray-fish, runs through the town; and here is plenty of all other provisions. It was made a corporation by Queen Elizabeth, and is governed by a mayor, high steward, aldermen, &c.\n\nNewcastle-under-Line, a town in England, in the county of Stafford, on a branch of the Trent, is 15 miles north of Stafford, 33 south south-east of Warrington, and 149 from London: had a castle, now in ruins; and is so called from an older castle, which formerly stood two miles off, at Chesterfield-under-Line. It was incorporated by King Henry I. and again by Queen Elizabeth and King Charles II., and is governed by a mayor, two justices, two bailiffs, and 24 common council. The clothing trade flourishes here; but its chief manufactory is hats, here being an incorporated company of felt-makers. A great quantity of stone ware is made near this place.\n\nNewcastle on Tyne, the capital of the county of Northumberland in England, 15 miles north of Durham, 94 north of York, 63 south by east of Berwick, 60 east of Carlisle, and 271 from London, stands at the end of the Piets wall, on the north side of the Tyne,\nNewcastle over which it has a stately bridge into the bishopric of Durham, in which its suburb called Gatefide is situated; for the liberties of Newcastle extend no farther than the great iron gate upon the bridge which has the arms of the bishop of Durham carved on the east side and those of Newcastle on the west side. W. Long. s. 27. N. Lat. 55. 3. It is admitted to have been a Roman station, though no evidence at present appears, except at Pandon-gate, whose superstructure is of different workmanship and model from any others of the town, the arches being circular. The Carpenter's tower is also of Roman origin. In the Saxons' time it was called Moncalf, from the monks here, who all fled when it was depopulated by the Danes; and afterwards Newcastle, from a castle built here by William the Conqueror's son, Robert, in 1080, to defend the country against the Scots, whose kings had this town before the Norman conquest, and sometimes resided here.\n\nSeveral monasteries and houses were built here soon after the castle; and it was greatly enlarged and enriched by a good trade to the coasts of Germany, and by the sale of its coal to other parts of England; for which, and for other merchandise, it is become the great emporium of the north of England, it being the neatest and largest town in those parts, next to York. In the reign of Edward I. it was burnt by the Scots; but a very rich burglar who was taken prisoner, soon ransomed himself for a good sum of money, and began the first fortifications of the place, which he extended from Sand-gate to Pampeldon, and thence to the Austin friars gate; which the townsmen finished, and encompassed with stout walls, which extended two miles, wherein are seven gates and many turrets, with several cafemats bomb-proof. To which two other gates were added in more modern times, viz. Bridge-gate and Sand-gate: the wall between them was afterwards removed to open the quay. Edward III. granted the corporation the duties and customs of the town for seven years, to enable them to complete the fortification. It is a borough at least as ancient as King Richard II. who granted that a sword should be carried before the mayor; and King Henry VI. made it a town and county corporate of itself, independent of Northumberland. Henry VII. built a monastery here for the Franciscans. Besides which, it had several religious foundations, several of which structures have been converted to companies halls and private residences. In the reign of Henry VIII. this place is said to have exceeded in the strength and magnificence of its works all the cities of England, and most places in Europe. The town is governed by a mayor, 12 aldermen, a recorder, sheriff, town clerk, a clerk of the chambers, two coroners, eight chamberlains, a sword-bearer, a water bailiff, and seven sergeants at mace. Its situation, especially the most bulky part of it towards the river, is very uneven, it being built on the declivity of a steep hill, and the houses very close. The castle overlooks the whole town. That part built by Robert was of great strength, and square, and surrounded by two walls; the square was 62 feet by 54, and the walls 13 feet thick, within which was a chapel. The outward fortifications are now defaced, and their site crowded with buildings. The tower remains entire, and situated on a lofty eminence, and its principal entrance is to the south. This castle belongs to the county, and makes no part of the liberties.\u2014It is Newcastle now the county prison, and in the great hall the judges hold the assizes. Here Baliol king of Scotland did homage to King Edward I. in 1292; as did Edward Baliol in 1334 to King Edward III. Here is a magnificent exchange and a customhouse; and a very fine quay. There is a handsome mansion house for the mayor, who is allowed 1000l. a-year, for his table, besides a coach and barge. The old bridge was carried away in a flood, and the present was erected about 1775, of nine noble elliptic arches. With the old bridge 22 houses were thrown down, and six lives lost. It was originally built of wood; but having been destroyed by fire in 1248, was rebuilt of stone, and consisted of 12 arches, three of which on the north side were closed up, and served for cellars: this was again rebuilt about 1450, and was crowded with wooden buildings; but near the middle was a tower with an iron gate, used as a town prison. A strong building crossed the bridge, which was used as a magazine. On the south front was a statue of King Charles II. The water which destroyed this bridge, on November 11, 1771, was upwards of 12 feet above high water mark in spring tides.\u2014On removing the foundations of the piers of the old bridge to erect the present, by observations made, and medals found, part of it is supposed to have existed from the time of the Romans. It is computed that above 6000 keelmen are employed here, who have formed themselves into a friendly society; and, by their own contributions, built a noble hospital containing 50 chambers, for such of their fraternity as are poor, disabled, or past their labour; and it is supported by the contribution of those that are in health. The town is extremely populous; and, notwithstanding the multitude of those employed in and about the coal pits, with which the town is in a manner surrounded, has abundance of poor; but it has also many wealthy inhabitants, and it is said they pay above 4000l. a-year to their relief. It is observed, that this town has the greatest public revenue in its own right as a corporation, of any town in England, it being computed at no less than 8000l. a-year. In 1774, the receipts of the corporation were 20,360l. gs. 8d.; and their disbursements about 19,445l. The number of inhabitants is about 36,891, exclusive of a number of seamen who cannot be accurately estimated. Here are four churches or chapels. That of St Nicholas is the mother church, a curious fabric, built cathedral-wise by David king of Scots, 240 feet long, 75 broad, and proportionably high, with a tower steeple 194 feet in height, of Gothic architecture; also St Andrew's, St John's, and All Saints, lately rebuilt on the site of the old structure, of a circular form. Here are also several meeting houses, and four charity schools for 300 children; a fine hall for the surgeons, and a large prison called Newgate; also a hospital for lunatics, another for the lying-in of married women, as well as a fund raised for the relief of those who are delivered at their own houses. Here is a well endowed and large infirmary, and an assembly room that attracts attention, containing every useful apartment, and a ball-room 93 feet by 40: The front is ornamented with six Ionic pillars, &c.

The views upon the banks exhibit the grandest and most lovely scenes. The river is in most places broader than the Thames at London. It is deep, rapid, and transparent as crystal, and its banks are lined on each side with a continued range of handsome buildings. On the north side the fortresses, the academy of sciences and that of art are the most striking objects; on the opposite side are the imperial palace, the admiralty, the mansions of many Russian nobles, and the English line, so called because (a few houses excepted) the whole row is occupied by the English merchants. In front of these buildings, on the south side, is the quay, which stretches for three miles, except where it is interrupted by the admiralty; and the Neva, during the whole of that space, has been lately embanked at the expense of the emperors, by a wall, parapet, and pavement of hewn granite; a most elegant and durable monument of imperial munificence. There is a communication between the opposite sides of the river by a bridge of pontoons, which when anything is apprehended from the force of ice rushing down the stream, can be, and is generally indeed, removed. The great depth of the river, it appears, prevents the building of a stone bridge; and, if it could be built, there is no reason to suppose it could possibly resist the force of those vast shoals of ice which in the beginning of winter come down this rapid river. An attempt, however, has been made to remedy this inconvenience; and a Russian peasant has actually projected the plan of throwing a wooden bridge of one arch across it, which in its narrowest part is 980 feet in breadth. As we think this is a matter of very considerable importance, as well as of curiosity, we shall give the following copious account of the plan and its author, in Mr Cox's own words; who tells us that the artist had then executed a model 98 feet in length, which he saw and examined with considerable attention.\n\n\"The bridge is upon the same principle with that of Shaffhausen, excepting that the mechanism is more complicated, and that the road is not so level. I shall attempt to describe it by supposing it finished, as that will convey the best idea of the plan. The bridge is roofed at the top, and covered at the sides; it is formed by four frames of timber, two on each side, composed of various beams or trusses, which support the whole machine. The road is not, as is usual, carried over the top of the arch, but is suspended in the middle.\n\n\"The following proportions I noted down with the greatest exactness at the time when they were explained to me by the artist:\n\nLength of the abutment on the north end, 658 feet.\nSpan of the arch, 980 feet.\nLength of the abutment on the south end, 658 feet.\nLength of the whole structure, including the abutments, 2296 feet.\n\nThe plane of the road upon its first ascent makes an angle of five degrees with the ordinary surface of the river.\n\nMean level of the river to the top of the bridge in the centre, 168 feet.\nDitto to the bottom of the bridge in the centre, 126 feet.\nHeight of the bridge from the bottom to the top in the centre, 42 feet.\nHeight from the bottom of the bridge in the centre to the road, 7 feet.\nHeight from the bottom of ditto to the water, 84 feet.\nHeight from the water to the spring of the arch, 56 feet.\n\nSo that there is a difference of 35 feet between the road at the spring of the arch and the road at the centre; in other words, an ascent of 35 feet in half 980, or in the space of 490 feet, which is little more than eight tenths of an inch to a foot. The bridge is broadest towards the sides, and diminishes towards the centre.\n\nIn the broadest part it is 168 feet.\nIn the centre or narrowest part, 42 feet.\nThe breadth of the road is 28 feet.\n\n\"The artist informed me, that to complete the bridge would require 49,650 iron nails, 12,908 large trees, 5500 beams to strengthen them; and that it would cost 300,000 rubles or \u00a36,000l. He speaks of this bold project with the usual warmth of genius; and is perfectly convinced that it would be practicable. I must own that I am of the same opinion, though I hazard it with great diffidence. What a noble effect would be produced by a bridge striking across the Neva, with an arch 980 feet wide, and towering 168 feet from the surface of the water! The description of such a bridge seems almost chimerical; and yet upon inspection of the model we become reconciled to the idea. But whether the execution of this stupendous work may be deemed possible or not, the model itself is worthy of attention, and reflects the highest honour on the inventive faculties of that unimproved genius. It is so compactly constructed, and of such uniform solidity, that it has supported 3540 pood, or 127,440 pounds, without having in the least swerved from its direction, which I am told is far more, in proportion to its size, than the bridge if completed would have occasion to sustain from the pressure of the carriages added to its own weight.\n\n\"The person who projected this plan is a common Russian peasant. This extraordinary genius was apprentice to a shopkeeper at Nizhni Novgorod: opposite to his dwelling was a wooden clock, which excited his curiosity. By repeated examination he comprehended the internal structure, and without any assistance formed one exactly similar in its proportion and materials. His success in this first essay urged him to undertake the construction of metal clocks and watches.\"\nwatches. The empress, hearing of these wonderful exertions of his native genius, took him under her protection, and sent him to England; from whence, on account of the difficulties attending his ignorance of the language, he soon returned to Russia. I saw a repeating watch of his workmanship at the Academy of Sciences: it is about the bigness of an egg; in the inside is represented the tomb of our Saviour, with the stone at the entrance, and the sentinels upon duty: suddenly the stone is removed, the sentinels fall down, the angels appear, the women enter the sepulchre, and the same chant is heard which is performed on Easter-eve. These are trifling, although curious performances; but the very planning of the bridge was a most sublime conception. This person, whose name is Kulibin, bears the appearance of a Russian peasant: he has a long beard, and wears the common dress of the country. He receives a pension from the empress, and is encouraged to follow the bent of his mechanical genius.","sp":406,"ep":407},{"h":"NEVEL","t":"or NEBEL, in the Jewish antiquities, a kind of musical instrument.

Francis I. made it a duchy and peerage in 1521, in favour of Francis of C\u00e9ves, to whom it came by marriage. It devolved afterwards to the house of Mantua, and then to the Palatine family, who in 1651 sold it to Cardinal Mazarine.

The town is fortified with walls, defended with many high towers and deep ditches, and is the seat of a bishopric, suffragan of Sens, as likewise of a bailiwick and chamber of accounts. There is a stone bridge on the Loire, with 20 arches, a draw-bridge on each side, and towers to defend them.

It makes a beautiful appearance from the sea, being a large conical mountain covered with fine trees, of an easy ascent on every side, and entirely cultivated. The circumference is about 21 miles, with a considerable tract of level ground all around. The climate in the lower part is reckoned to be warmer than Barbadoes, but it is more temperate towards the summit. The soil is very fine in the lower part, but grows coarser as we ascend. The productions are nearly the same with those of St Christopher's. There are three pretty good roads or bays, with small towns in their vicinity; Charles Town, Moreton bay, and Newcastle. This pleasant island was settled under the auspices of Sir Thomas Warner from St Christopher's. His successor, Governor Lake, was considered as the Solon of this little country, in which he disposed of every thing with such prudence, wisdom, and justice, as procured him a high reputation with the French as well as English. In the Dutch war they met with some disturbance from the French; but by being covered by an English squadron, the enemy were obliged to desist from their intended invasion, after a smart engagement in sight of the island. Sir William Stapleton sometimes resided here, and Sir Nathaniel Johnston constantly, at which time the inhabitants of Nevis were computed at 32,000. In the war immediately after the revolution, they exerted themselves gallantly, and had two regiments of 300 men each. In that of Queen Anne they behaved equally well, though they were less fortunate; for the French landing with a superior force, and having inveigled most of their slaves, they were forced to capitulate. About 4000 of these slaves the French carried away and sold to the Spaniards, to work in their mines. The parliament, after making due inquiry into the losses they had sustained, voted them about a third part of the sum which they had suffered. These losses by war, an epidemic disease, and repeated hurricanes, exceedingly diminished the number of the people. They are now thought not to exceed 2000 or 3000 whites, and 6000 blacks. There is here a lieutenant governor, with a council, and an assembly, which is composed of three members from each of the five parishes into which the island is divided. The commodities are cotton and sugar; and about 20 sail of ships are annually employed in this trade.","sp":408,"ep":408},{"h":"NEW STYLE","t":"first used in England in 1753, was introduced into the western world by Pope Gregory XIII.

See England, New.\n\nNew Forest of Hampshire in England, is a tract of at least 40 miles in compass, which had many populous towns and villages, and 36 mother churches, till it was destroyed and turned into a forest by William the Conqueror. There are nine walks in it; and to every one a keeper, under a lord warden, besides two rangers, and a bow-bearer. As this large tract lay many ages open and exposed to invasions from foreigners, King Henry VIII. built some castles in it; and it has now several pretty towns and villages. It is situated in that part of Hampshire which is bounded on the east by Southampton river, and on the south by the British Channel. It possesses advantages of situation, with respect to the convenience of water carriage and nearness to the dock yards, superior to every other forest, having in its neighbourhood several ports and places of shelter for shipping timber, among which Lymington is at the distance of only two miles, Bexley about half a mile, and Redbridge three or four miles from the forest; and the navigation to Portsmouth, the most considerable dock yard in this kingdom, is only about 30 miles from the nearest of those places. This is the only forest belonging to the crown of which the origin is known. Doomsday-book contains the most distinct account of its afforestation by William the Conqueror: the contents of every field, farm, or estate afforested, in hides, carucates, or virgates, by which the extent of land was then computed, together with the names of the hundreds and villages, and of the former proprietors (which are for the most part Saxon), the rent or yearly value of each possession, and the tax which had been paid for it to the crown during the reign of Edward the Confessor, before the inhabitants were expelled, and that part of the country laid waste, are all to be found in that most curious and venerable record, New Forest.\n\nWishing to discover the original extent of the forest, we extracted, for our own information, all that relates to it in that ancient survey. The extract is far too voluminous for insertion. The names of many of the places having been changed since that time, it is difficult to ascertain with precision what were then the limits of the forest. The oldest perambulation we have met with is among the Pleas of the Forest, in the eighth year of King Edward I., preserved in the Chapter-house at Westminster. The boundaries there described include all the country from Southampton river on the east to the Avon on the west, following the sea coast as far as the southern boundary between those rivers, and extending northwards as far as North Chafehead, or North Charford, on the west, and to Wade and Oarebrugg, or Owerbridge, on the east; and the greatest part, if not the whole, of that extensive district, is mentioned in Doomsday book to be the forest belonging to the crown. Another perambulation was however made in the 29th of the same king, which leaves out a great part of the country contained within the former. This perambulation, which is preserved in the tower of London, confines the forest to limits which, as far as we can trace them, appear to have been followed in the 22nd year of Charles II., when the forest was again perambulated. By the Charta de Foresta, all lands not belonging to the crown which had been afforested by Henry II., Richard I., or King John, were to be disafforested; but as no provision was made for the reduction of the more ancient afforestations, it is easy to account for the great diminution of this forest in the reign of Edward I., who was not a prince likely to submit to any encroachment on his rights. The perambulation of the 22nd of Charles II. is the last which we find on record: it contains the present legal bounds of the forest, and was given to the surveyors as their guide, in taking the plan which they have made lately by direction. From that plan, with the approbation of the lords commissioners of his majesty's treasury, an engraving was made.\n\nAccording to the last-mentioned perambulation and the plan, the forest extends from Godshill on the north-west to the sea on the south-east, about 20 miles; and from Hardley on the east to Ringwood on the west, about 15 miles; and contains within those limits about 92,365 acres statute measure. The whole of that quantity, however, is not forest land, or now the property of the crown: there are several manors and other considerable freehold estates within the perambulation, belonging to individuals, to the amount of about 24,797 acres; about 625 acres are copyhold or customary lands belonging to his majesty's manor of Lyndhurst; about 1004 acres are lease-hold under the crown, granted for certain terms of years, and forming part of the demised land revenue, under the management of the surveyor-general of crown lands; about 901 acres are purprelures or encroachments on the forest; about 1103 acres more are enclosed lands held by the master-keepers and groom-keepers, with their respective lodges; and the remainder, being about 63,845 acres, are woods and waste lands of the forest.\n\nTo perpetuate the spot where William Rufus was killed by the glance of an arrow shot at a flag, a triangular stone was erected in 1745.

Nonius Marcellus refers the origin of this custom among the Romans to Tatusius king of the Sabines, who reigned at Rome conjointly with Romulus, and who having considered as a good omen a present of some branches cut in a wood consecrated to Sirenia, the goddess of strength, which he received on the first day of the new year, authorized this custom afterwards, and gave to these presents the name of frena. However this may be, the Romans on that day celebrated a festival in honour of Janus, and paid their respects at the same time to Juno; but they did not pass it in idleness, lest they should become indolent during the rest of the year. They sent presents to one another of figs, dates, honey, &c. to show their friends that they wished for a happy and agreeable life. Clients, that is to say, those who were under the protection of the great, carried presents of this kind to their patrons, adding to them a small piece of silver. Under Augustus, the senate, the knights, and the people, presented such gifts to him, and in his absence deposited them in the capitol. Of the succeeding princes some adopted this custom and others abolished it; but it always continued among the people. The early Christians condemned it, because it appeared to be a relic of Paganism and a species of superstition; but when it began to have no other object than that of being a mark of veneration and esteem, the church ceased to disapprove of it.","sp":410,"ep":413},{"h":"NEWEL","t":"in architecture, is the upright post which a pair of winding stairs turn about; this is properly a cylinder of stone, which bears on the ground, and is formed by the end of the steps of the winding stairs.","sp":413,"ep":413},{"h":"NEWFIDLER-SEA","t":"a lake in Hungary, 17 miles in length and 6 in breadth.","sp":413,"ep":413},{"h":"NEWFOUNDLAND","t":"a large island of North America, belonging to Great Britain, lying between 46\u00b0 50' and 51\u00b0 30' N. Lat. and between 53\u00b0 30' and 58\u00b0 20' W. Long. from London. The form is that of an irregular triangle, the base or south side being 80 leagues in extent; the east side is the longest; and the whole circumference about 150 leagues. It is bounded on the north by the straits of Belleisle, which separate it from Labrador; on the east and south it hath the Atlantic ocean, and on the west the gulf of St Lawrence. The climate is rather severe; and the soil, at least on the sea coast, which is all that we know of it, is poor and barren. A few kitchen vegetables, with strawberries and raspberries, are all its produce. The country within land is mountainous, and abounds with timber; there are several rivers which are plentifully stored with various sorts of fish, abundance of deep bays, and many good ports. St John's and Placentia are the two principal settlements, and at each of these there is a fort; the number of people who remain here in the winter hath been computed at 4000. The French, by the treaty of Utrecht, were permitted to fish from Cape Bonavista on the east side round the north of the island to Point Rich on the west; and by the treaty of Paris, they are allowed the isles of St Pierre and Miquelon, upon which they are to dry their fish, but not to erect fortifications of any kind.\n\nThe great importance of this place arises from its fishery, which is in part carried on by the inhabitants at the several harbours, which are about 20 in number, who take vast quantities of cod near the coast, which they bring in and cure at their leisure, in order to have it ready for the ships when they arrive. But the great and extensive fishery is on the banks at some distance from the island. The great bank lies 20 leagues from the nearest point of land from the latitude 41\u00b0 to 49\u00b0, stretching 300 miles in length and 75 in breadth.\u2014To the east of this lies the False Bank; the next is styled Vert, or the Green Bank, about 240 miles long, and 120 over; then Banquero, about the same size; the shoals of Sand Island, Whale Bank, and the Bank of St Peter's, with several others of less note, all abounding with fish.\n\nThe cod are caught only by a hook; an expert fisher will take from 150 to 300 and upwards in a day; for the fish never bite in the night: the labour is very great. The season is from May to October, in the height of which there are from 500 to 700 sail upon the banks at a time. The fish caught in the spring months are best; they are cured in very different ways. Some are styled white fish, others mud fish, which are flowed and salted in the hold, and will not keep long; but the best and most valuable are the dried cod. The quantity taken is prodigious: yet in some seasons and in different places varies considerably, as the fish frequently change their stations. The fishing ships, as they are called, lie upon the banks, with the help of their boats take and cure their own fish, and as soon as they are full sail for a market. The pack ships proceed directly to the island, where they purchase fish from the inhabitants either by barter or bills of exchange. The principal markets for cod are Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the West Indies. The value of this fishery is computed at some hundred thousand pounds annually; employing, besides several hundred ships, some thousands of seamen, and affording a maintenance to a number of tradesmen of different occupations, by which many large towns on the west side of England accumulate much wealth, and at the same time contribute in many respects to the benefit of the public.\n\nThe great utility of this fishery was very early seen, and very vigorously pursued; for in the beginning of the reign of King James I. we had two hundred and fifty sail employed therein. It is computed, that three quintals of wet fish make one quintal of dried cod. Besides, the Evers of every hundred quintals make a hoghead of oil; and exclusive of these there are many lesser advantages that go in diminution of the expense. The fishery, as we have said above, produces differently in different seasons; but it is judged to be a very good one when it produces 300,000 quintals of fish and 3000 barrels of oil, both equally saleable and valuable commodities. As every ship carries twelve, and each of their boats eight men, and as these return home in six months, there cannot be a more noble nursery for seamen.\nNewfoundland-seamen. The artificers and traders employed in building, victualling, and repairing these vessels, are very numerous in the respective ports from which they sail. These circumstances justify the particular attention paid by government to this branch of the public service; in respect to which that they may be well informed, an annual and very distinct account, by which the whole is seen at one view, is delivered by the proper officer to the governor of Newfoundland, that is, to the commodore of his majesty's squadron. Mr Pennant, in the appendix to his Arctic Zoology, gives us, from what appears to be very good authority, the following account of this island.\n\n\"Within the circuit of 60 miles of the southern part, the country is hilly, but not mountainous. The hills increase in height as they recede from the sea; their course is irregular, not forming a chain of hills, but rising and falling abruptly. The coasts are high, and the shores most remarkably bold. The same may be said of almost every part of this vast island. The country is much wooded, and the hills (such as have not flat tops to admit the rain to stagnate on them) are clothed with birch, with hazel, spruce, fir, and pine, all small; which is chiefly owing to the inhabitants taking off the bark to cover the fish stages. This peninsula is so indented by the fine and deep bays of Placentia, St Mary, Conception, and Trinity, that it may be penetrated in all parts, which is done for the sake of fowling, or the procuring of fish for masts, ears, &c. The island is on all sides pierced with deep bays, which penetrate it in many places by isthmuses most remarkably narrow.\u2014The mountains on the south-west side, near the sea, are very high, and terminate in lofty headlands; such as Chapeau Rouge, a most remarkably high promontory, Cape St Mary's, and Cape le Hane. Such in general is the formation of the island; on the north-east, most of the hills in the interior part of the country terminate pyramidically, but form no chain. The interior parts of the country consist chiefly of morasses, or dry barren hammocks, or level land, with frequent lakes or ponds, and in some places covered with stunted black spruce. The rivers of Newfoundland are unfit for navigation, but they are of use in floating down the wood with the summer floods. Still the rivers and the brooks are excellent guides for the hunters of beavers and other animals, to penetrate up the country, which as yet has never been done deeper than 30 miles. Near the brooks it is that timber is commonly met with, but seldom above three or four miles inland, and in valleys; the hills in the northern district being naked and barren.\n\n\"In some parts of Newfoundland there is timber sufficiently large for the building of merchant ships: the hulk is made of juniper, and the pine furnishes masts and yards; but as yet none has been found large enough for a mast for a large cutter. The fishery is divided into two seasons; that on the shore, or the shore season, commences about the 20th of April, and ends about the 10th of October; the boats fish in from four to 20 fathoms of water. The most important, the bank fishing season, begins the 10th of May, and continues till the last of September, and is carried on in 30 to 45 fathoms depth of water. Banking vessels have sailed from St John's to the bank as early as the 12th of April. At first they use pork or birds for a bait; but as they catch fish, they supply themselves with a Newmarket shell fish called clams, which is found in the belly of the cod. The next bait is the lobster; after that the herring and the lance, which last till June, when the capelan comes on the coast, and is another bait. In August the squid comes into use, and finally the herring again. The greatest number of cod fish taken by a single fisherman in the season has been 12,000, but the average is 7000. The largest fish which has been taken was four feet three inches long, and weighed 40 pounds. A banking vessel of 12,000 fish ought to be filled in three weeks, and so in proportion; and 80 quintals (112 lb. each) for a boat in the same time.\n\n\"In 1785, 541 English vessels fished on the bank, a number exceeding that of the French. A heap of dried fish, 20 feet long and ten wide, and four deep, contains 300 quintals. Such a heap settles, in the course of 48 hours after it is made, about \u00bc. An extraordinary splitter will split five quintals of fish in an hour. The average in that time is two. There is no fishing during winter, on account of the inclemency of the season. It is supposed that the fish in a great measure quit the banks before that time, as in general they are very scarce when the fishing vessels go upon the banks early in the spring.\n\n\"There are a few small towns on the coasts, which have gardens sown with English pulse; but many of the inhabitants quit the country in winter.\n\n\"An admiral or some sea officer is generally governor of Newfoundland.\"","sp":413,"ep":414},{"h":"NEWMARKET","t":"in Cambridgeshire, 13 miles from Cambridge, 13 from St Edmundsbury, and 60 from London, is a town with one long street, the north side in Suffolk, the south side in Cambridgeshire.

When this, however, is not the case, and it often happens, they disgrace their authors, and are highly injurious to the public. They were first published in England, August 22, 1642. Journal de Scavans, a French paper, was first published in 1663, though one was printed in England, under the title of the Public Intelligencer, by Sir Roger L'Estrange, 1663, which he dropped, on the publication of the first London Gazette. Newspapers and pamphlets were prohibited by royal proclamation 1680. Though at the Revolution prohibitions of this kind were done away, and the press set at liberty, yet newspapers were afterwards made objects of taxation, and for this purpose were first stamped in 1713. The number of them, however, gradually increased; and there were printed in the whole kingdom during the years 1775, 12,680,000; 1776, 12,830,000; 1777, 13,150,642; 1778, 13,240,593; 1779, 14,166,842; 1780, 14,217,371; 1781, 14,397,620; 1782, 15,272,519. They are now still more numerous. The average number of newspapers printed in England at the close of the reign of George II, was 9,464,790. The number in 1790, was 14,033,397; in 1792, it was 15,005,760.","sp":414,"ep":415},{"h":"NEWTON","t":"Sir Isaac, one of the greatest philosophers and mathematicians the world has ever produced, was the only child of Mr John Newton of Coleworth, not far from Grantham in Lincolnshire, who had an estate of about \u00a3200 per annum, which he kept in his own hands. He was born at that place on Christmas day 1642. His father dying when he was young, his mother's brother, a clergyman of the name of Allscough, or Alkew, who lived near her, and directed all her affairs after the death of Mr Newton, put her son to school at Grantham. When he had finished his school learning, his mother took him home, intending, as she had no other child, to have the pleasure of his company; and that he, as his father had done, should occupy his own estate. But his uncle happening to find him in a hay loft at Grantham working a mathematical problem, and having otherwise observed the boy's mind to be uncommonly bent upon learning, he prevailed upon her to part with him; and she sent Newton him to Trinity College in Cambridge, where her brother, having himself been a member of it, had still many friends. Isaac was soon taken notice of by Dr Isaac Barrow; who, observing his bright genius, contracted a great friendship for him. M. de Fontenelle tells us, \"That in learning mathematics he did not study Euclid, who seemed to him too plain and simple, and unworthy of taking up his time. He understood him almost before he read him; and a cast of his eye upon the contents of his theorems was sufficient to make him master of them. He advanced at once to the geometry of Des Cartes, Kepler's Optics, &c. It is certain that he had made his great discoveries in geometry, and laid the foundation of his two famous works, the Principia and Optics, by the time he was 24 years of age.\"\n\nIn 1664, he took the degree of bachelor of arts; and in 1668 that of master, being elected the year before, fellow of his college. He had before this time discovered the method of fluxions; and in 1669 he was chosen professor of mathematics in the university of Cambridge, upon the resignation of Mr Barrow. The same year, and the two following, he read a course of optical lectures in Latin, in the public schools of the university; an English translation of which was printed at London in 1728, in 8vo, as was the Latin original the next year in 4to. From the year 1671 to 1679, he held a correspondence by letters with Mr Henry Oldenburg secretary of the Royal Society, and Mr John Collins fellow of that society; which letters contain a variety of curious observations.\n\nConcerning the origin of his discoveries, we are told, that as he sat alone in a garden, the falling of some apples from a tree led him into a speculation on the power of gravity; that as this power is not diminished at the remotest distance from the centre of the earth to which we can rise, it appeared to him reasonable to conclude, that it must extend much farther than was usually thought; and pursuing this speculation, by comparing the periods of the several planets with their distances from the sun, he found, that if any power like gravity held them in their courses, its strength must decrease in the duplicate proportion of the increase of distance. This inquiry was dropped; but resumed again, and gave rise to his writing the treatise which he published in 1687, under the name of Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy; a work looked upon as the production of a celestial intelligence rather than of a man. The very same year in which this great work was published, the university of Cambridge was attacked by King James II. when Mr Newton was one of its most zealous defenders, and was accordingly nominated one of the delegates of that university to the high-commission court; and the next year he was chosen one of their members for the convention parliament, in which he sat till it was dissolved. In 1696, Mr Montague, then chancellor of the exchequer, and afterwards earl of Halifax, obtained for him of the king the office of warden of the mint; in which employment he was of signal service, when the money was called in to be recoined. Three years after, he was appointed master of the mint; a place of very considerable profit, which he held till his death. In 1699, he was elected one of the members of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. In 1701, he was a second\ntime chosen member of parliament for the university of Cambridge. In 1704, he published his Optics; which is a piece of philosophy so new, that the science may be considered as entirely indebted to our author. In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne. In 1707, he published his Arithmetica Universalis. In 1711, his Analysis per Quantitatum Series, Fluxiones et Differentias, &c. was published by William Jones, Esq. In 1712, several letters of his were published in the Commercium Epistolicum. In the reign of George I. he was better known at court than before. The princess of Wales, afterwards queen consort of England, used frequently to propose questions to him, and to declare that she thought herself happy to live at the same time with him, and have the pleasure and advantages of his conversation. He had written a treatise of ancient chronology, which he did not think of publishing; but the princess desired an abstract, which she would never part with. However, a copy of it stole abroad, and was carried into France; where it was translated and printed, with some observations, which were afterwards answered by Sir Isaac. But, in 1728, the Chronology itself was published at London in quarto; and was attacked by several persons, and as zealously defended by Sir Isaac's friends. The main design of it was to find out, from some tracts of the most ancient Greek astronomy, what was the position of the colures with respect to the fixed stars, in the time of Chiron the centaur. As it is now known that these stars have a motion in longitude of one degree in 72 years, if it be once known through what fixed stars the colure passed in Chiron's time, by taking the distance of these stars from those through which it now passes, we might determine what number of years has elapsed since Chiron's time. As Chiron was one of the Argonauts, this would fix the time of that famous expedition, and consequently that of the Trojan war; the two great events upon which all ancient chronology depends. Sir Isaac places them 500 years nearer the birth of Christ than other chronologers have done.\n\nThis great man had all along enjoyed a settled and equal state of health to the age of 80, when he began to be afflicted with an incontinence of urine. However, for the five following years, he had great intervals of ease, which he procured by the observance of a strict regimen. It was then believed that he certainly had the stone; and when the paroxysms were so violent, that large drops of sweat ran down his face, he never uttered the least complaint, or expressed the smallest degree of impatience; but, as soon as he had a moment's ease, would smile and talk with his usual cheerfulness. Till then he always read and wrote several hours in a day. He had the perfect use of all his senses and understanding till the day before he died, which was on the 20th of March 1726-7 in the 85th year of his age. He lay in state in the Jerusalem chamber at Westminster, and on the 28th of March his body was conveyed into Westminster abbey; the pall being supported by the lord chancellor, the dukes of Montrose and Roxburgh, and the earls of Pembroke, Sussex, and Middlesex. The bishop of Rochester read the funeral service, being attended by all the clergy of the church. The corpse was interred just at the entrance into the choir, where a noble monument is erected to his memory.\n\nSir Isaac was of a middling stature, and in the latter part of his life somewhat inclined to be fat. His countenance was pleasing and at the same time venerable. He never made use of spectacles, and lost but one tooth during his whole life.\n\nHis temper is said to have been so equal and mild, that no accident could disturb it. Of this following remarkable instance is related. Sir Isaac had a favourite little dog, which he called Diamond; and being one day called out of his study into the next room, Diamond was left behind. When Sir Isaac returned, having been absent but a few minutes, he had the mortification to find, that Diamond having thrown down a lighted candle among some papers, the nearly finished labour of many years was in flames, and almost consumed to ashes. This loss, as Sir Isaac was then very far advanced in years, was irretrievable; yet without once striking the dog, he only rebuked him with this exclamation, \"Oh! Diamond! Diamond! thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done!\"\n\nHe was a great lover of peace, and would rather have chosen to remain in obscurity than to have the calm of life ruffled by those storms and disputes which genius and learning always draw upon those that are peculiarly eminent for them. In contemplating his genius it presently becomes a doubt, which of these endowments had the greatest share, sagacity, penetration, strength or diligence: and after all, the mark that seems most to distinguish it is, that he himself made the justest estimation of it, declaring, that, if he had done the world any service, it was due to nothing but industry and patient thought; that he kept the subject under consideration constantly before him, and waited till the first dawning opened gradually, by little and little, into a full and clear light. It is said, that when he had any mathematical problems or solutions in his mind, he would never quit the subject on any account. Dinner has been often three hours ready for him before he could be brought to table; and his man often said, when he has been getting up in a morning, he has sometimes begun to dress, and with one leg in his breeches sat down again on the bed, where he has remained for hours before he got his clothes on. From his love of peace, no doubt, arose that unusual kind of horror which he had for all disputes; a steady unbroken attention, free from those frequent recollecteds ineparably incident to others, was his peculiar felicity; he knew it, and he knew the value of it. No wonder then that controversy was looked on as his bane. When some objections, hastily made to his discoveries concerning light and colours, induced him to lay aside the design he had of publishing his optic lectures, we find him reflecting on that dispute, into which he was unavoidably drawn thereby, in these terms: \"I blamed my own imprudence for parting with so real a blessing as my quiet, to run after a shadow.\" It is true this shadow (as Mr Fontenelle observes) did not escape him afterwards, nor did it cost him that quiet which he so much valued, but proved as much a real happiness to him as his quiet itself; yet this was a happiness of his own making: he took a resolution, from these disputes, not to publish any more about that theory till he had put it above the reach of controversy, by the exactest experiments and the strictest demonstrations; and accordingly it has never been called in question since. In the same temper, after\nter he had sent the manuscript of his Principia to the Royal Society, with his consent to the printing of it by them, upon Mr Hook's injuriously insisting that himself had demonstrated Kepler's problem before our author, he determined, rather than be involved again in a controversy, to suppress the third book, and was very hardly prevailed upon to alter that resolution. In is true, the public was thereby a gainer; that book, which is indeed no more than a corollary of some propositions in the first, being originally drawn up in the popular way, with the design to publish it in that form; whereas he was now convinced that it would be best not to let it go abroad without a strict demonstration.\n\nAfter all, notwithstanding his anxious care to avoid every occasion of breaking his intense application to study, he was at a great distance from being steeped in philosophy: on the contrary, he could lay aside his thoughts, though engaged in the most intricate researches, when his other affairs required his attendance; and as soon as he had leisure, resume the subject at the point where he had left off. This he seems to have done not so much by any extraordinary strength of memory, as by the force of his inventive faculty, to which every thing opened itself again with ease, if nothing intervened to ruffle him. The readiness of his invention made him not think of putting his memory much to the trial; but this was the offspring of a vigorous intensity of thought, out of which he was but a common man. He spent therefore, the prime of his age in those abstruse researches, when his situation in a college gave him leisure, and even while study was his proper profession. But as soon as he was removed to the mint, he applied himself chiefly to the business of that office; and so far quitted mathematics and philosophy, as not to engage in any pursuits of either kind afterwards.\n\nThe amiable quality of modesty is represented as standing foremost in the character of this great man's mind and manners. It was in reality greater than can be easily imagined, or will be readily believed; yet it always continued so without any alteration, though the whole world, says Fontenelle, confounded against it; and let us add, though he was thereby robbed of his inventions of fluxions. Nicholas Mercator publishing his Logarithmotechnia in 1668, where he gave the quadrature of the hyperbola by an infinite series, which was the first appearance in the learned world of a series of this sort drawn from the particular nature of the curve, and that in a manner very new and abstracted; Dr Barrow, then at Cambridge, where Mr Newton, at that time about 26 years of age, resided, recollected that he had met with the same thing in the writings of that young gentleman; and there not confined to the hyperbola only, but extended, by general forms, to all sorts of curves, even such as are mechanical; to their quadratures, their rectifications, and their centres of gravity; to the solids formed by their rotations, and to the surfaces of those solids; so that, when their determinations were possible, the series stopped at a certain point, or at least their sums were given by stated rules; and, if the absolute determinations were impossible, they could yet be infinitely approximated; which is the happiest and most refined method, says Mr Fontenelle, of supplying the defects of human knowledge that man's imagination could possibly invent. To be matter of so fruitful and general a theory was a mine of gold to a geometrician; but it was a greater glory to have been the discoverer of so surprising and ingenious a system. So that Mr Newton finding, by Mercator's book, that he was in the way to it, and that others might follow in his track, should naturally have been forward to open his treasures, and secure the property, which consisted in making the discovery; but he contented himself with his treasure which he had found, without regarding the glory. What an idea does it give us of his unparalleled modesty, when we see him declaring, that he thought Mercator had entirely discovered his secret, or that others would, before he was of a proper age for writing? His MS. upon infinite series was communicated to none but Mr John Collins and the lord Brounker; and even that had not been complied with, but for Dr Barrow, who would not suffer him to indulge his modesty so much as he desired.\n\nIt is further observed, concerning this part of his character, that he never talked either of himself or others, nor ever behaved, in such a manner as to give the most malicious censurers the least occasion even to suspect him of vanity. He was candid and affable, and always put himself upon a level with his company. He never thought either his merit or his reputation sufficient to excite him from any of the common offices of social life; no singularities, either natural or affected, distinguished him from other men. Though he was firmly attached to the church of England, he was adverse to the persecution of the non-conformists. He judged of men by their manners; and the true schismatics, in his opinion, were the vicious and the wicked. Not that he confined his principles to natural religion, for he was thoroughly persuaded of the truth of revelation; and amidst the great variety of books which he had constantly before him, that which he studied with the greatest application was the Bible: and he under- stood the nature and force of moral certainty as well as he did that of a strict demonstration.\n\nSir Isaac did not neglect the opportunities of doing good, when the revenues of his patrimony, and a profitable employment, improved by a prudent economy, put it in his power. We have two remarkable instances of his bounty and generosity; one to Mr MacLaurin, professor of mathematics at Edinburgh, to whom he offered \u00a32l. per annum, and the other to his niece Barton, on whom he settled an annuity of \u00a3100. When decency upon any occasion required expense and show, he was magnificent without grudging it, and with a very good grace; at all other times, that pomp which seems great to low minds only, was utterly retrenched, and the expense referred for better uses. He never married, and perhaps he never had leisure to think of it. Being immersed in profound studies during the prime of his age, and afterwards engaged in an employment of great importance, and even quite taken up with the company which his merit drew to him, he was not sensible of any vacancy in life, or of the want of a companion at home. He left \u00a32,000l. at his death; but made no will, which Mr Fontenelle tells us was because he thought a legacy was no gift. As to his works, besides what were published in his lifetime, there were found after his death, among his papers, several discourses upon subjects of antiquity, history, divinity, chemistry,\nNewtonian philosophy, and mathematics, several of which were published at different times.\n\nNewtonian Philosophy, the doctrine of the universe, and particularly of the heavenly bodies, their laws, affections, &c., as delivered by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nThe term Newtonian Philosophy is applied very differently; whence divers confused notions relating thereto. Some authors under this philosophy include all the corporeal philosophy, considered as it now stands corrected and reformed by the discoveries and improvements made in several parts thereof by Sir Isaac Newton. In which sense it is that Gravesham calls his elements of physics, Introductio ad Philosophiam Newtonianam. And in this sense the Newtonian is the same with the new philosophy; and stands distinguished from the Cartesian, the Peripatetic, and the ancient Corporeal.\n\nOthers, by Newtonian philosophy, mean the method or order which Sir Isaac Newton observes in philosophizing; viz. the reasoning and drawing of conclusions directly from phenomena, exclusive of all previous hypotheses; the beginning from simple principles; deducing the first powers and laws of nature from a few select phenomena, and then applying those laws, &c., to account for other things. And in this sense the Newtonian philosophy is the same with the experimental philosophy, and stands opposed to the ancient corporeal.\n\nOthers, by Newtonian philosophy, mean that wherein physical bodies are considered mathematically, and where geometry and mechanics are applied to the solution of the appearances of nature. In which sense the Newtonian is the same with the mechanical and mathematical philosophy.\n\nOthers again, by Newtonian philosophy, understand that part of physical knowledge which Sir Isaac Newton has handled, improved, and demonstrated, in his Principia.\n\nOthers, lastly, by Newtonian philosophy, mean the new principles which Sir Isaac Newton has brought into philosophy; the new system founded thereon; and the new solutions of phenomena thence deduced; or that which characterizes and distinguishes his philosophy from all others.\u2014Which is the sense wherein we shall chiefly consider it.\n\nAs to the history of this philosophy, we have nothing to add to what has been given in the preceding article. It was first made public in the year 1687, by the author, then a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and in the year 1713, republished with considerable improvements.\u2014Several authors have since attempted to make it plainer; by setting aside many of the more sublime mathematical researches, and substituting either more obvious reasonings or experiments in lieu thereof; particularly Whiston in his Practical Phil. Mathem. Gravesham in Elements, et Institut. and Dr Pemberton in his View.\n\nThe whole of the Newtonian philosophy, as delivered by the author, is contained in his Principia or Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. He founds his system on the following definitions:\n\n1. The quantity of matter is the measure of the same, arising from its density and bulk conjunctly.\u2014Thus air of a double density, in a double space, is quadruple in quantity; in a triple space, sextuple in Newtonian quantity, &c.\n\n2. The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly. This is evident, because the motion of the whole is the motion of all its parts; and therefore in a body double in quantity, with equal velocity, the motion is double, &c.\n\n3. The vis insita, or innate force of matter, is a vis insita power of resisting, by which every body, as much as defined and in it lies, endeavours to persevere in its present state, whether it be of rest, or moving uniformly forward in a right line.\u2014This definition is proved to be just, only by the difficulty we find in moving anything out of its place; and this difficulty is by some reckoned to proceed only from gravity. They contend, that in those cases where we can prevent the force of gravity from acting upon bodies, this power of resistance becomes insensible, and the greatest quantities of matter may be put in motion by the very least force. Thus there have been balances formed to exact, that when loaded with 200 weight in each scale, they would turn by the addition of a single drachm. In this case 400lb. of matter was put in motion by a single drachm, i.e. by \\( \\frac{1}{25} \\) part of its own quantity: and even this small weight, they say, is only necessary on account of the inaccuracy of the machine; so that we have no reason to suppose, that, if the friction could be entirely removed, it would take more force to move a ton weight than a grain of sand. This objection, however, is not taken notice of by Sir Isaac; and he bestows on the resisting power above mentioned the name of vis inertiae; a phrase which is perhaps not well chosen, and with which inferior writers have endeavoured to make their readers merry at the expense of Newton. A force of inactivity, it has been said, is a forceless force; and analogous to a black whale, a cold heat, and a tempestuous calm.\n\nBut objections of more importance have been made to the whole of this doctrine than those which merely respect the term vis inertiae. \u201cAn endeavour to remain at rest (we are told *) is unnecessary, whilst nothing attempts to disturb the rest. It is likewise impossible to be conceived, as it implies a contradiction. A man, by opposing force to force, may endeavour third and not to be moved; but this opposition is an endeavour without the design to move, but by counteracting another force to prevent being moved. An Book of the endeavour not to move therefore cannot exist in bo-Principia, dies, because it is absurd; and if we appeal to fact, we shall find every body in an actual and constant endeavour to move.\u201d It has been likewise observed, and we think justly, that \u201cif bodies could continue to move by any innate force, they might also begin to move by that force. For the same cause which can move a body with a given velocity at one time, could do it, if present, at any other time; and therefore if the force by which bodies continue in motion were innate and essential to them, they would begin to move of themselves, which is not true.\u201d Newton indeed says that this innate force is the cause of motion under certain circumstances only, or when the body is acted upon by a force impressed ab extra. But if this impressed force do not continue as well\nNewtonian as begin the motion, if it cease the instant that\nthe impression is over, and the body continue to\nmove by its vis inertiae, why is the body ever stopped?\n\"If in the beginning of the motion the body, by\nits innate force, overcomes a certain resistance of fric-\ntion and air, in any following times, the force being\nundiminished, it will overcome the same resistance for\never. These resistances, therefore, could never change\nthe state of a moving body, because they cannot\nchange the quantity of its motive force. But this is\ncontrary to universal experience.\" For these reasons\nwe are inclined to think that bodies are wholly pas-\nsive; that they endeavour nothing; and that they con-\ntinue in motion not by any innate force or vis inertiae, but\nby that force, whatever it be, which begins the motion,\nand which, whilst it remains with the moving body,\nis gradually diminished, and at last overcome by op-\nposite forces, when the body of course ceases to\nmove.\n\n4. An impressed force is an action exerted upon a\nbody, in order to change its state, either of rest or of\nmoving uniformly forward in a right line.\u2014This force\nconsists in the action only; and remains no longer\nin the body when the action is over. For a body\nmaintains every new state it acquires by its vis inertiae\nonly.\n\nIt is here implied, and indeed fully expressed, that\nmotion is not continued by the same power that pro-\nduced it. Now there are two grounds on which the\ntruth of this doctrine may be supposed to rest.\n\n\"Firstly, On a direct proof that the impressed force\ndoes not remain in the body, either by showing the\nnature of the force to be transitory and incapable of\nmore than its first action; or that it acts only on the\nsurface, and that the body escapes from it; or that\nthe force is somewhere else, and not remaining in the\nbody. But none of these direct proofs are offered.\n\n\"Secondly, It may rest on an indirect proof, that\nthere is in the nature of body a sufficient cause for\nthe continuance of every new state acquired; and\nthat therefore any adventitious force to continue mo-\ntion, though necessary for its production, is super-\nfluous and inadmissible. As this is the very ground\non which the supposition stands, it ought to have been\nindubitably certain that the innate force of the body\nis sufficient to perpetuate the motion it has once ac-\nquired, before the other agent, by which the motion\nwas communicated, had been dispelled from the office.\nBut the innate force of body has been shown not\nto be that which continues its motion; and there-\nfore the proof, that the impressed force does not re-\nmain in the body, fails. Nor indeed is it in this case\ndefensible to support the proof, because we should then\nbe left without any reason for the continuance of mo-\ntion.*\"\n\nWhen we mention an impressed force, we\nmean such a force as is communicated either at the\nsurface of the body or by being diffused through the\nmains.\n\n5. A centripetal force is that by which bodies are\ndrawn, impelled, or any way tend towards a point, as\nto a centre.\u2014The quantity of any centripetal force\nmay be considered as of three kinds, absolute, accele-\nrative, and motive.\n\n6. The absolute quantity of a centrifugal force is the\nmeasure of the same, proportional to the efficacy of the\ncause that propagates it from the centre, through the Newtonian\nspaces round it.\n\n7. The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is\nthe measure of the same, proportional to the velocity\nwhich it generates in a given time.\n\n8. The motive quantity of a centripetal force is a\nmeasure of the same, proportional to the motion\nwhich it generates in a given time. This is always\nknown by the quantity of a force equal and contrary\nto it, that is just sufficient to hinder the descent of the\nbody.\n\nScholia.\n\nI. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself,\nand from its own nature, flows equably, without re-\ngard to any thing external, and, by another name, is\ncalled duration. Relative, apparent, and common time,\nis some sensible and external measure of duration,\nwhether accurate or not, which is commonly used in-\nstead of true time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a\nyear, &c.\n\nII. Absolute space, in its own nature, without re-\ngard to any thing external, remains always similar and\nimmoveable. Relative space is some moveable dimen-\nsion or measure of the absolute spaces; and which is\nvulgarly taken for immoveable space. Such is the di-\nmension of a subterraneous, an aerial, or celestial space,\ndetermined by its position to bodies, and which is vul-\ngarly taken for immoveable space; as the distance of\na subterraneous, an aerial, or celestial space, deter-\nmined by its position in respect of the earth. Abso-\nlute and relative space are the same in figure and mag-\nnitude; but they do not remain always numerically the\nsame. For if the earth, for instance, moves, a space\nof our air which, relatively and in respect of the\nearth, remains always the same, will at one time be one\npart of the absolute space into which the earth passes;\nat another time it will be another part of the same;\nand so, absolutely understood, it will be perpetually\nmutable.\n\nIII. Place is a part of space which a body takes place de-\nup; and is, according to the space, either absolute or fixed.\nrelative. Our author says it is part of space; not the\nsituation, nor the external surface of the body. For\nthe places of equal solids are always equal; but\ntheir superficies, by reason of their dissimilar figures,\nare often unequal. Positions properly have no quan-\ntity, nor are they so much the places themselves as the\nproperties of places. The motion of the whole is the\nfame thing with the sum of the motions of the parts;\nthat is, the translation of the whole out of its place is\nthe same thing with the sum of the translations of the\nparts out of their places; and therefore the place of\nthe whole is the same thing with the sum of the places\nof the parts; and for that reason it is internal, and in\nthe whole body.\n\nIV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body of motion.\nfrom one absolute place into another, and relative mo-\ntion the translation from one relative place into ano-\nther. Thus, in a ship under sail, the relative place of\na body is that part of the ship which the body pos-\nsesses, or that part of its cavity which the body fills,\nand which therefore moves together with the ship;\nand relative rest is the continuance of the body in the\nsame part of the ship, or of its cavity. But real\nabsolute\nNewtonian absolute rest is the continuance of the body in the same part of that immoveable space in which the ship itself, its cavity, and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is really at rest, the body which relatively rests in the ship will really and absolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth. But if the earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will arise partly from the true motion of the earth in immoveable space; partly from the relative motion of the ship on the earth: and if the body moves also relatively in the ship, its true motion will arise partly from the true motion of the earth in immoveable space, and partly from the relative motions as well of the ship on the earth as of the body in the ship; and from these relative motions will arise the relative motion of the body on the earth. As if that part of the earth where the ship is, was truly moved towards the east, with a velocity of 1000 parts; while the ship itself with a fresh gale is carried towards the west, with a velocity expressed by 10 of these parts; but a sailor walks in the ship towards the east with one part of the said velocity: then the sailor will be moved truly and absolutely in immoveable space towards the east with a velocity of 1001 parts; and relatively on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of 9 of those parts.\n\nAbsolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from relative, by the equation or correction of the vulgar time. For the natural days are truly unequal, though they are commonly considered as equal, and used for a measure of time: astronomers correct this inequality for their more accurate deducing of the celestial motions. It may be that there is no such thing as an equable motion whereby time may be accurately measured. All motions may be accelerated or retarded; but the true or equable progress of absolute time is liable to no change. The duration or perseverance of the existence of things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or slow, or none at all; and therefore ought to be distinguished from what are only sensible measures thereof, and out of which we collect it by means of the astronomical equation. The necessity of which equation for determining the times of a phenomenon is evinced, as well from the experiments of the pendulum clock as by eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.\n\nAs the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order of the parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their places, and they will be moved (if we may be allowed the expression) out of themselves. For times and spaces are, as it were, the places of themselves as of all other things. All things are placed in time as to order of succession; and in space as to order of situation. It is from their essence or nature that they are places; and that the primary places of things should be moveable, is absurd. These are therefore the absolute places; and translations out of those places are the only absolute motions.\n\nBut because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from one another by the senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible measures of them. For, from the positions and distances of things from any body, considered as immoveable, we define all places; and then with respect to such places, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from some Newtonian of those places into others. And so, instead of absolute places and motions, we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in common affairs: but in philosophical disquisitions we ought to abstract from our senses, and consider things themselves distinct from what are only sensible measures of them. For it may be, that there is no body really at rest, to which the places and motions of others may be referred.\n\nBut we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from the other by their properties, causes, and effects. It is a property of rest, that bodies really at rest do rest in respect of each other. And therefore, as it is possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or perhaps far beyond them, there may be some body absolutely at rest, though it be impossible to know from the position of bodies to one another in our regions, whether any of these do keep the same position to that remote body; it follows, that absolute rest cannot be determined from the position of bodies in our regions.\n\nIt is a property of motion, that the parts which retain given positions to their wholes do partake of the motion of their wholes. For all parts of revolving different bodies endeavour to recede from the axis of motion; and the impetus of bodies moving forwards arises from the joint impetus of all the parts. Therefore if further rounding bodies are moved, those that are relatively at rest within them will partake of their motion. Upon which account the true and absolute motion of a body cannot be determined by the translation of it from those only which seem to rest; for the external bodies ought not only to appear at rest, but to be really at rest. For otherwise all included bodies, beside their translation from near the surrounding ones, partake likewise of their true motions; and though that translation was not made, they would not really be at rest, but only seem to be so. For the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the surrounded, as the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the shell does to the kernel; but if the shell moves, the kernel will also move, as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the shell.\n\nA property near akin to the preceding is, that if a place is moved, whatever is placed therein moves along with it; and therefore a body which is moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the motion of its place. Upon which account all motions from places in motion, are no other than parts of entire and absolute motions; and every entire motion is composed of the motion of the body out of its first place, and the motion of this place out of its place; and so on, until we come to some immoveable place, as in the above mentioned example of the sailor. Wherefore entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined than by immoveable places. Now, no other places are immoveable but those that from infinity to infinity do all retain the same given positions one to another; and upon this account must ever remain unmoved, and do thereby constitute what we call immoveable space.\n\nThe causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished one from the other, are the forces impressed\nNewtonian pressed upon bodies to generate motion. True motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force impressed upon the body moved; but relative motion may be generated or altered without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient only to impress some force on other bodies with which the former is compared, that by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in which the relative rest or motion of the other body did consist. Again, True motion suffers always some change from any force impressed upon the moving body; but relative motion does not necessarily undergo any changes by such force. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other bodies with which the comparison is made, that the relative position may be preserved; then that condition will be preserved, in which the relative motion consists. And therefore any relative motion may be changed when the true motion remains unaltered, and the relative may be preserved when the true motion suffers some change. Upon which account true motion does by no means consist in such relations.\n\nThe effects which distinguish absolute from relative motion are, the forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are no such forces in a circular motion purely relative: but, in a true and absolute circular motion, they are greater or less according to the quantity of the motion. If a vessel, hung by a long cord, is so often turned about that the cord is strongly twisted, then filled with water, and let go, it will be whirled about the contrary way; and while the cord is untwisting itself, the surface of the water will at first be plain, as before the vessel began to move; but the vessel, by gradually communicating its motion to the water, will make it begin sensibly to revolve, and recede by little and little from the middle, and ascend to the sides of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure; and the swifter the motion becomes, the higher will the water rise, till at last, performing its revolutions in the same times with the vessel, it becomes relatively at rest in it. This ascent of the water shows its endeavour to recede from the axis of its motion; and the true and absolute circular motion of the water, which is here directly contrary to the relative, discovers itself, and may be measured by this endeavour. At first, when the relative motion in the water was greatest, it produced no endeavour to recede from the axis; the water showed no tendency to the circumference, nor any ascent towards the sides of the vessel, but remained of a plane surface; and therefore its true circular motion had not yet begun. But afterwards, when the relative motion of the water had decreased, the ascent thereof towards the sides of the vessel proved its endeavour to recede from the axis; and this endeavour showed the real circular motion of the water perpetually increasing, till it had acquired its greatest quantity, when the water rested relatively in the vessel. And therefore this endeavour does not depend upon any translation of the water in respect of the ambient bodies; nor can true circular motion be defined by such translations. There is only one real circular motion of any one revolving body, corresponding to only one power of endeavouring to recede from its axis of motion, as its proper and adequate effect: but relative motions in one and the same body are innumerable, according to the various relations it bears to external bodies; and, like other relative motions, are altogether destitute of any real effect, otherwise than they may perhaps participate of that only true motion. And therefore, in the system which supposes that our heavens, revolving below the sphere of the fixed stars, carry the planets along with them, the several parts of those heavens and the planets, which are indeed relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet really move. For they change their position one to another, which never happens to bodies truly at rest; and being carried together with the heavens, participate of their motions, and, as parts of revolving wholes, endeavour to recede from the axis of their motion.\n\nWherefore relative quantities are not the quantities themselves whose names they bear, but those sensible measures of them, either accurate or inaccurate, which are commonly used instead of the measured quantities themselves. And then, if the meaning of words be determined by their use, by the names time, space, place, and motion, their measures are properly to be understood; and the expression will be unusual and purely mathematical, if the measured quantities themselves are meant.\n\nIt is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from those that are only apparent: because the parts of that immovable space in which those motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses. Yet we have some things to direct us in this intricate affair; and these arise partly from the apparent motions which are the difference of the true motions, partly from the forces which are the causes and effects of the true motions. For instance, if two globes, kept at a given distance one from the other by means of a cord that connects them, were revolved about their common centre of gravity; we might, from the tension of the cord, discover the endeavour of the globes to recede from the axis of motion, and from thence we might compute the quantity of their circular motions. And then, if any equal forces should be impressed at once on the alternate faces of the globes to augment or diminish their circular motions, from the increase or decrease of the tension of the cord we might infer the increment or decrement of their motions; and thence would be found on what faces those forces ought to be impressed, that the motions of the globes might be most augmented; that is, we might discover their hindermost faces, or those which follow in the circular motion. But the faces which follow being known, and consequently the opposite ones that precede, we should likewise know the determination of their motions. And thus we might find both the quantity and determination of this circular motion, even in an immense vacuum, where there was nothing external or sensible, with which the globes might be compared. But now, if in that space some remote bodies were placed that kept always a given position one to another, as the fixed stars do in our regions; we could not indeed determine from the relative translation of the globes among those bodies, whether the motion did belong to the globes or to the bodies. But if we observed the cord, and found that its tension was that very tension which the motions of the globes required, we might conclude the motion to be in the globes, and the bodies to\nNewtonian be at rest; and then, lastly, from the translation of the globes among the bodies, we should find the determination of their motions.\n\nHaving thus explained himself, Sir Isaac proposes to show how we are to collect the true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences; and vice versa, how, from the motion, either true or apparent, we may come to the knowledge of their causes and effects. In order to this, he lays down the following axioms or laws of motion.\n\n1. EVERY BODY PERSEVERES IN ITS STATE OF REST, OR OF UNIFORM MOTION IN A RIGHT LINE, UNLESS IT IS COMPelled TO CHANGE THAT STATE BY FORCES IMPRESSED UPON IT.\u2014Sir Isaac's proof of this axiom is as follows: \"Projectiles persevere in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. A top, whose parts, by their cohesion, are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions, both progressive and circular, for a much longer time.\"\u2014Notwithstanding this demonstration, however, the axiom hath been violently disputed. It hath been argued, that bodies continue in their state of motion because they are subjected to the continual impulse of an invisible and subtle fluid, which always pours in from behind, and of which all places are full. It hath been affirmed, that motion is as natural to this fluid as rest is to all other matter. It is said, moreover, that it is impossible we can know in what manner a body would be influenced by moving forces if it was entirely destitute of gravity. According to what we can observe, the momentum of a body, or its tendency to move, depends very much on its gravity. A heavy cannonball will fly to a much greater distance than a light one, though both are actuated by an equal force. It is by no means clear, therefore, that a body totally destitute of gravity would have any proper momentum of its own; and if it had no momentum, it could not continue its motion for the smallest space of time after the moving power was withdrawn. Some have imagined that matter was capable of beginning motion of itself, and consequently that the axiom was false; because we see plainly that matter in some cases hath a tendency to change from a state of motion to a state of rest, and from a state of rest to a state of motion. A paper appeared on this subject in the first volume of the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays; but the hypothesis never gained any ground.\n\n2. THE ALTERATION OF MOTION IS EVER PROPORTIONAL TO THE MOTIVE FORCE IMPRESSED; AND IS MADE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE RIGHT LINE IN WHICH THAT FORCE IS IMPRESSED.\u2014Thus, if any force generates a certain quantity of motion, a double force will generate a double quantity, whether that Newtonian force be impressed all at once, or in successive moments.\n\nTo this law no objection of consequence has ever been made. It is founded on this self-evident truth, that every effect must be proportional to its cause. Mr Young, who seems to be very ambitious of detecting the errors of Newton, finds fault indeed with the expressions in which the law is stated; but he owns, that if thus expressed, The alteration of motion is proportional to the actions or resistances which produce it, and is in the direction in which the actions or resistances are made, it would be unexceptionable.\n\n3. TO EVERY ACTION THERE ALWAYS IS OPPOSED AN EQUAL RE-ACTION: OR, THE MUTUAL ACTION OF TWO BODIES UPON EACH OTHER IS ALWAYS EQUAL, AND DIRECTED TO CONTRARY PARTS.\u2014This axiom is also disputed by many. In the above-mentioned paper in the Physical Essays, the author endeavours to make a distinction between re-action and resistance; and the same attempt has been made by Mr Young. \"When an action generates no motion (says he), it is certain that its effects have been destroyed by a contrary and equal action. When an action generates two contrary and equal motions, it is also evident that mutual actions were exerted, equal and contrary to each other. All cases where one of these conditions is not found, are exceptions to the truth of the law. If a finger presses against a stone, the stone, if it does not yield to the pressure, presses as much upon the finger; but if the stone yields, it reacts less than the finger acts; and if it should yield with all the momentum that the force of the pressure ought to generate, which it would do if it were not impeded by friction, or a medium, it would not react at all. So if the stone drawn by a horse, follows after the horse, it does not react so much as the horse acts; but only to much as the velocity of the stone is diminished by friction, and it is the reaction of friction only, not of the stone. The stone does not react, because it does not act; it resists, but resistance is not action.\n\n\"In the loss of motion from a striking body, equal to the gain in the body struck, there is a plain solution without requiring any re-action. The motion lost is identically that which is found in the other body; this supposition accounts for the whole phenomenon in the most simple manner. If it be not admitted, but the solution by re-action is insisted upon, it will be incumbent on the party to account for the whole effect of communication of motion; otherwise he will lie under the imputation of rejecting a solution which is simple, obvious, and perfect; for one complex, unnatural, and incomplete. However this may be determined, it will be allowed, that the circumstances mentioned, afford no ground for the inference, that action and re-action are equal, since appearances may be explained in another way\" (A).\n\n(A) If there be a perfect reciprocity betwixt an impinging body and a body at rest sustaining its impulse, may we not at our pleasure consider either body as the agent, and the other as the resistant? Let a moving body, A, pass from north to south, an equal body B at rest, which receives the stroke of A, act upon A from south to north, and A resist in a contrary direction, both inelastic: let the motion reciprocally communicated be called fix. Then B at rest communicates to A fix degrees of motion towards the north, and receives fix degrees towards the south. B having no other motion than the fix degrees it communicated, will, by its equal\nOthers grant that Sir Isaac's axiom is very true in respect to terrestrial substances; but they affirm, that, in these, both action and re-action are the effects of gravity. Substances void of gravity would have no momentum; and without this they could not act; they should be moved by the least force, and therefore could not resist or react. If therefore there is any fluid which is the cause of gravity, though such fluid could act upon terrestrial substances, yet these could not react upon it; because they have no force of their own, but depend entirely upon it for their momentum. In this manner, say they, we may conceive that the planets circulate, and all the operations of nature are carried on by means of a subtle fluid; which being perfectly active, and the rest of matter altogether passive, there is neither resistance nor loss of motion. See Motion.\n\nFrom the preceding axiom Sir Isaac draws the following corollaries.\n\n1. A body by two forces conjoined will describe the diagonal of a parallelogram in the same time that it would describe the sides by those forces apart.\n\n2. Hence we may explain the composition of any one direct force out of any two oblique ones, viz. by making the two oblique forces the sides of a parallelogram, and the direct one the diagonal.\n\n3. The quantity of motion, which is collected by taking the sum of the motions directed towards the same parts, and the difference of those that are directed to contrary parts, suffers no change from the action of bodies among themselves; because the motion which one body loses is communicated to another; and if we suppose friction and the resistance of the air to be absent, the motion of a number of bodies which mutually impelled one another would be perpetual, and its quantity always equal.\n\n4. The common centre of gravity of two or more Newtonian bodies does not alter its state of motion or rest by the actions of the bodies among themselves; and therefore the common centre of gravity of all bodies acting upon each other (excluding outward actions and impediments) is either at rest, or moves uniformly in a right line.\n\n5. The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line without any circular motion. The truth of this is evidently shown by the experiment of a ship; where all motions happen after the same manner, whether the ship is at rest, or proceeds uniformly forward in a straight line.\n\n6. If bodies, anyhow moved among themselves, are urged in the direction of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will all continue to move among themselves, after the same manner as if they had been urged by no such forces.\n\nThe whole of the mathematical part of the Newtonian philosophy depends on the following lemmas; of which the first is the principal.\n\nLEM. I. Quantities, and the ratios of quantities, which in any finite time converge continually to equality, and before that time approach nearer the one to the other than by any given difference, become ultimately equal. If you deny it; suppose them to be ultimately unequal, and let D be their ultimate difference. Therefore they cannot approach nearer to equality than by that given difference D; which is against the supposition.\n\nConcerning the meaning of this lemma philosophers are not agreed; and unhappily it is the very fundamental position on which the whole of the system rests. Many objections have been raised to it by people who supposed\n\nequal and contrary loss and gain, remain in equilibrium. Let the original motion of A have been twelve, then A having received a contrary action equal to six, six degrees of its motion will be destroyed or in equilibrium; consequently, a motive force as six will remain to A towards the south, and B will be in equilibrium, or at rest. A will then endeavour to move with six degrees, or half its original motion, and B will remain at rest as before. A and B being equal masses, by the laws of communication three degrees of motion will be communicated to B, or A with its six degrees will act with three, and B will react also with three. B then will act on A from south to north equal to three, while it is acted upon or resisted by A from north to south, equal also to three, and B will remain at rest as before; A will also have its six degrees of motion reduced to one half by the contrary action of B, and only three degrees of motion will remain to A, with which it will yet endeavour to move; and finding B still at rest, the same process will be repeated till the whole motion of A is reduced to an infinitely small quantity, B all the while remaining at rest, and there will be no communication of motion from A to B, which is contrary to experience.\n\nLet a body, A, whose mass is twelve, at rest, be impinged upon first by B, having a mass as twelve, and a velocity as four, making a momentum of 48; and secondly by C, whose mass is six, and velocity eight, making a momentum of 48 equal to B, the three bodies being inelastic. In the first case, A will become propelled of a momentum of 24, and 24 will remain to B; and, in the second case, A will become propelled of a momentum of 32, and 16 will remain to C, both bodies moving with equal velocities after the shock, in both cases, by the laws of percussion. It is required to know, if in both cases A resists equally, and if B and C act equally? if the actions and resistances are equal, how does A in one case destroy 24 parts of B's motion, and in the other case 32 parts of C's motion, by an equal resistance? And how does B communicate in one case 24 degrees of motion, and C 32, by equal actions? If the actions and resistances are unequal, it is asked how the same mass can resist differently to bodies impinging upon it with equal momenta, and how bodies propelled of equal momenta can exert different actions, it being admitted that bodies resist proportional to their masses, and that their power of overcoming resistance is proportional to their momenta?\n\nIt is incumbent on those who maintain the doctrine of universal re-action, to free it from these difficulties and apparent contradictions.\nNEW\n\nNewtonian supposed themselves capable of understanding it. They say, that it is impossible we can come to an end of any infinite series, and therefore that the word *ultimate* can in this case have no meaning. In some cases the lemma is evidently false. Thus, suppose there are two quantities of matter A and B, the one containing half a pound, and the other a third part of one. Let both be continually divided by 2; and though their ratio, or the proportion of the one to the other, doth not vary, yet the difference between them perpetually becomes less, as well as the quantities themselves, until both the difference and quantities themselves become less than any assignable quantity: yet the difference will never totally vanish, nor the quantities become equal, as is evident from the two following series.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\frac{1}{2} : \\frac{1}{4} : \\frac{1}{8} : \\frac{1}{16} : \\frac{1}{32} : \\frac{1}{64} : \\frac{1}{128} : \\frac{1}{256} : \\frac{1}{512} : \\ldots \\\\\n& \\text{Diff.} \\quad \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} ; \\quad \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{8} ; \\quad \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{16} ; \\quad \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus we see, that though the difference is continually diminishing, and that in a very large proportion, there is no hope of its vanishing, or the quantities becoming equal. In like manner, let us take the proportions or ratios of quantities, and we shall be equally unsuccessful. Suppose two quantities of matter, one containing 8 and the other 10 pounds; these quantities already have to each other the ratio of 8 to 10, or 4 to 5; but let us add 2 continually to each of them, and though the ratios continually come nearer to that of equality, it is in vain to hope for a perfect coincidence. Thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& 8 : 10 : 12 : 14 : 16 : 18 : 20 : 22 : 24 : \\ldots \\\\\n& \\text{Ratio} \\quad \\frac{4}{5} : \\frac{6}{7} : \\frac{8}{9} : \\frac{10}{11} : \\frac{12}{13} : \\frac{14}{15} : \\frac{16}{17} : \\frac{18}{19} : \\frac{20}{21} : \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFor this and his other lemmas Sir Isaac makes the following apology. \"These lemmas are premised, to avoid the tediousness of deducing perplexed demonstrations ad absurdum, according to the method of ancient geometers. For demonstrations are more contracted by the method of indivisibles: but because the hypothesis of indivisibles seems somewhat harsh, and therefore that method is reckoned less geometrical, I chose rather to reduce the demonstrations of the following propositions to the first and last sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent quantities, that is, to the limits of those sums and ratios; and so to premise, as short as I could, the demonstrations of those limits. For hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles; and now those principles being demonstrated, we may use them with more safety.\u2014Therefore, if hereafter I should happen to consider quantities as made of particles, or should use little curve lines for right ones; I would not be understood to mean indivisibles, but evanescent divisible quantities; not the sums and ratios of determinate parts, but always the limits of sums and ratios; and that the force of such demonstrations always depends on the method laid down in the foregoing lemmas.\n\n\"Perhaps it may be objected, that there is no ultimate proportion of evanescent quantities, because the proportion, before the quantities have vanished, is not the ultimate, and, when they are vanished, is none.\u2014But by the same argument it may be alleged, that a body arriving at a certain place, and there stopping, has no ultimate velocity; because the velocity before Newtonian the body comes to the place is not its ultimate velocity; when it is arrived, it has none. But the answer is easy: for by the ultimate velocity is meant that with which the body is moved, neither before it arrives at its place and the motion ceases, nor after; but at the very instant it arrives, that is, that velocity with which the body arrives at its last place, and with which the motion ceases. And in like manner, by the ultimate ratio of evanescent quantities is to be understood the ratio of the quantities, not before they vanish, nor afterwards, but with which they vanish. In like manner, the first ratio of nascent quantities is that with which they begin to be. And the first or last sum is that with which they begin and cease to be (or to be augmented and diminished). There is a limit which the velocity at the end of the motion may attain, but not exceed; and this is the ultimate velocity. And there is the like limit in all quantities and proportions that begin and cease to be. And, since such limits are certain and definite, to determine the same is a problem strictly geometrical. But whatever is geometrical we may be allowed to make use of in determining and demonstrating any other thing that is likewise geometrical.\n\n\"It may also be objected, that if the ultimate ratios of evanescent quantities are given, their ultimate magnitudes will be also given; and so all quantities will consist of indivisibles, which is contrary to what Euclid has demonstrated concerning incommensurables, in the tenth book of his Elements. But this objection is founded on a false supposition. For those ultimate ratios with which quantities vanish are not truly the ratios of ultimate quantities, but limits towards which the ratios of quantities decreasing continually approach.\"\n\nLEM. II. If in any figure AaE terminated by the right line Aa, AE, and the curve aE, CCLXIX. there be inscribed any number of parallelograms Fig. 1. A b, B c, C d, &c. comprehended under equal bases AB, BC, CD, &c. and the sides B b, C c, D d, &c. parallel to one side A a of the figure; and the parallelograms aK b l, b c m, c M d n, &c. are completed.\u2014Then if the breadth of those parallelograms be supposed to be diminished, and their number augmented in infinitum; the ultimate ratios which the inscribed figure AK b L c M d D, the circumscribed figure A a b c d e, and curvilinear figure A a b c d e, will have to one another, are ratios of equality.\u2014For the difference of the inscribed and circumscribed figures is the sum of the parallelograms K l, L m, M n, D o; that is (from the equality of all their bases), the rectangle under one of their bases K b, and the sum of their altitudes A a, that is, the rectangle AB / a.\u2014But this rectangle, because its breadth AB is supposed diminished in infinitum, becomes less than any given space. And therefore by Lem. I. the figures inscribed and circumscribed become ultimately equal the one to the other; and much more will the intermediate curvilinear figure be ultimately equal to either.\n\nLEM. III. The same ultimate ratios are also ratios of equality, when the breadths AB, BC, CD, &c. of the parallelograms are unequal, and are all diminished in infinitum.\u2014The demonstration of this differs but little from that of the former.\nIn his succeeding lemmas, Sir Isaac goes on to prove, in a manner similar to the above, that the ultimate ratios of the fine, chord, and tangent of arcs infinitely diminished, are ratios of equality, and therefore that in all our reasonings about these we may safely use the one for the other:\u2014that the ultimate form of evanescent triangles made by the arc, chord, and tangent, is that of similarity, and their ultimate ratio is that of equality; and hence, in reasonings about ultimate ratios, we may safely use these triangles for each other, whether made with the fine, the arc, or the tangent.\u2014He then shows some properties of the ordinates of curvilinear figures; and proves that the spaces which a body describes by any finite force urging it, whether that force is determinate and immutable, or is continually augmented or continually diminished, are, in the very beginning of the motion, one to the other in the duplicate ratio of the powers. And, lastly, Having added some demonstrations concerning the evanescence of angles of contact, he proceeds to lay down the mathematical part of his system, and which depends on the following theorems:\n\n**Theor. I.** The areas which revolving bodies describe by radii drawn to an immovable centre of force, lie in the same immovable planes, and are proportional to the times in which they are described.\u2014For, suppose the time to be divided into equal parts, and in the first part of that time, let the body by its innate force describe the right line AB (fig. 2); in the second part of that time, the same would, by Law 1, if not hindered, proceed directly to C along the line BC = AB; so that by the radii AS, BS, CS, drawn to the centre, the equal areas ASB, BSC, would be described. But, when the body is arrived at B, suppose the centripetal force acts at once with a great impulse, and turning aside the body from the right line BC, compels it afterwards to continue its motion along the right line BC. Draw CC parallel to BS, meeting BC in C; and at the end of the second part of the time, the body, by Cor. 1. of the laws, will be found in C, in the same plane with the triangle ASB. Join SC; and because SB and CC are parallel, the triangle SBC will be equal to the triangle SBC, and therefore also to the triangle SAB. By the like argument, if the centripetal force acts successively in C, D, E, &c., and makes the body in each single particle of time to describe the right lines CD, DE, EF, &c. they will all lie in the same plane; and the triangle SCD will be equal to the triangle SBC, and SDE to SCD, and SEF to SDE. And therefore, in equal times, equal areas are described in one immovable plane; and, by composition, any sums SADS, SAFS, of those areas are, one to the other, as the times in which they are described. Now, let the number of those triangles be augmented, and their size diminished in infinitum; and then, by the preceding lemmas, their ultimate perimeter ADF will be a curve line; and therefore the centripetal force by which the body is perpetually drawn back from the tangent of this curve will act continually; and any described areas SADS, SAFS, which are always proportional to the times of description, will, in this case also, be proportional to those times.\n\n**Cor. 1.** The velocity of a body attracted towards an immovable centre, in spaces void of resistance, is reciprocally as the perpendicular let fall from that centre on the right line which touches the orbit. For the velocities in these places, A, B, C, D, E, are as the bases AB, BC, DE, EF, of equal triangles; and these bases are reciprocally as the perpendiculars let fall upon them.\n\n**Cor. 2.** If the chords AB, BC, of two arcs, successively described in equal times by the same body, in spaces void of resistance, are completed into a parallelogram ABCV, and the diagonal BV of this parallelogram, in the position which it ultimately acquires when those arcs are diminished in infinitum, is produced both ways, it will pass through the centre of force.\n\n**Cor. 3.** If the chords AB, BC, and DE, EF, of arcs described in equal times, in spaces void of resistance, are completed into the parallelograms ABCV, DEFZ, the forces in B and E are one to the other in the ultimate ratio of the diagonals BV, EZ, when those arcs are diminished in infinitum. For the motions BC and EF of the body (by Cor. 1. of the laws), are compounded of the motions BC, BV and EF, EZ; but BV and EZ, which are equal to Cc and FF, in the demonstration of this proposition, were generated by the impulses of the centripetal force in B and E, and are therefore proportional to those impulses.\n\n**Cor. 4.** The forces by which bodies, in spaces void of resistance, are drawn back from rectilinear motions, and turned into curvilinear orbits, are one to another as the verified fines of arcs described in equal times; which verified fines tend to the centre of force, and bisect the chords when those arcs are diminished to infinity. For such verified fines are the halves of the diagonals mentioned in Cor. 3.\n\n**Cor. 5.** And therefore those forces are to the force of gravity, as the said verified fines to the verified fines perpendicular to the horizon of those parabolic arcs which projectiles describe in the same time.\n\n**Cor. 6.** And the same things do all hold good (by Cor. 5. of the laws) when the planes in which the bodies are moved, together with the centres of force, which are placed in those planes, are not at rest, but move uniformly forward in right lines.\n\n**Theor. II.** Every body that moves in any curve line described in a plane, and, by a radius drawn to a point either immovable or moving forward with an uniform rectilinear motion, describes about that point areas proportional to the times, is urged by a centripetal force directed to that point.\n\n**Case I.** For every body that moves in a curve line is (by Law 1.) turned aside from its rectilinear course by the action of some force that impels it; and that force by which the body is turned off from its rectilinear course, and made to describe in equal times the least equal triangles SAB, SBC, SCD, &c. about the immovable point S, (by Prop. 40. E. 1. and Law 2.) acts in the place B according to the direction of a line parallel to C; that is, in the direction of the line BS; and in the place C according to the direction of a line parallel to DD, that is, in the direction of the line CS, &c.; and therefore acts always in the direction of lines tending to the immovable point S. Q. E. D.\n\n**Case II.** And (by Cor. 5. of the laws) it is indifferent whether the superficies in which a body describes a curvilinear figure be quiescent, or moves together with the body, the figure described, and its point S, uniformly forward in right lines.\nCor. 1. In non-refilling spaces or mediums, if the areas are not proportional to the times, the forces are not directed to the point in which the radii meet; but deviate therefrom in consequtentia, or towards the parts to which the motion is directed, if the description of the areas is accelerated; but in antecedentia if retarded.\n\nCor. 2. And even in refilling mediums, if the description of the areas is accelerated, the directions of the forces deviate from the point in which the radii meet, towards the parts to which the motion tends.\n\nScholium.\n\nA body may be urged by a centripetal force compounded of several forces. In which case the meaning of the proposition is, that the force which results out of all tends to the point S. But if any force acts perpetually in the direction of lines perpendicular to the described surface, this force will make the body to deviate from the plane of its motion, but will neither augment nor diminish the quantity of the described surface; and is therefore not to be neglected in the composition of forces.\n\nTheor. III. Every body that, by a radius drawn to the centre of another body, howsoever moved, describes areas about that centre proportional to the times, is urged by a force compounded of the centripetal forces tending to that other body, and of all the accelerative force by which that other body is impelled.\u2014The demonstration of this is a natural consequence of the theorem immediately preceding.\n\nHence, if the one body L, by a radius drawn to the other body T, describes areas proportional to the times, and from the whole force by which the first body L is urged, (whether that force is simple, or, according to Cor. 2. of the laws, compounded of several forces), we subduct that whole accelerative force by which the other body is urged; the whole remaining force by which the first body is urged will tend to the other body T, as its centre.\n\nAnd vice versa, if the remaining force tends nearly to the other body T, those areas will be nearly proportional to the times.\n\nIf the body L, by a radius drawn to the other body T, describes areas, which, compared with the times, are very unequal, and that other body T be either at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line, the action of the centripetal force tending to that other body T is either none at all, or it is mixed and combined with very powerful actions of other forces; and the whole force compounded of them all, if they are many, is directed to another (immoveable or moveable) centre. The same thing obtains when the other body is accelerated by any other motion whatever; provided that centripetal force is taken which remains after subducing that whole force acting upon that other body T.\n\nScholium.\n\nBecause the equable description of areas indicates that a centre is reflected by that force with which the body is most affected, and by which it is drawn back from its rectilinear motion, and retained in its orbit, we may always be allowed to use the equable description of areas as an indication of a centre about which all circular motion is performed in free spaces.\n\nTheor. IV. The centripetal forces of bodies which by equable motions describe different circles, tend to the centres of the same circles; and are one to the other as the squares of the arcs described in equal times applied to the radii of circles.\u2014For these forces tend to the centres of the circles, (by Theor. 2. and Cor. 2. Theor. I.) and are to one another as the verified lines of the least arcs described in equal times, (by Cor. 4. Theor. I.) that is, as the squares of the same arcs applied to the diameters of the circles, by one of the lemmas; and therefore, since those arcs are as arcs described in any equal times, and the diameters are as the radii, the forces will be as the squares of any arcs described in the same time, applied to the radii of the circles.\n\nQ. E. D.\n\nCor. 1. Therefore, since those arcs are as the velocities of the bodies, the centripetal forces are in a ratio compounded of the duplicate ratio of the velocities directly, and of the simple ratio of the radii inversely.\n\nCor. 2. And since the periodic times are in a ratio compounded of the ratio of the radii directly, and the ratio of the velocities inversely; the centripetal forces are in a ratio compounded of the ratio of the radii directly, and the duplicate ratio of the periodic times inversely.\n\nCor. 3. Whence, if the periodic times are equal, and the velocities therefore as the radii, the centripetal forces will be equal among themselves; and the contrary.\n\nCor. 4. If the periodic times and the velocities are both in the subduplicate ratio of the radii, the centripetal forces will be equal among themselves; and the contrary.\n\nCor. 5. If the periodic times are as the radii, and therefore the velocities equal, the centripetal forces will be reciprocally as the radii; and the contrary.\n\nCor. 6. If the periodic times are in the sesquiplicate ratio of the radii, and therefore the velocities reciprocally in the subduplicate ratio of the radii, the centripetal forces will be in the duplicate ratio of the radii inversely; and the contrary.\n\nCor. 7. And universally, if the periodic time is as any power $R^n$ of the radius R, and therefore the velocity reciprocally as the power $R^{n-1}$ of the radius, the centripetal force will be reciprocally as the power $R^{2n-a}$ of the radius; and the contrary.\n\nCor. 8. The same things all hold concerning the times, the velocities, and forces, by which bodies describe the similar parts of any similar figures, that have their centres in a similar position within those figures, as appears by applying the demonstrations of the preceding cases to those. And the application is easy, by only substituting the equable description of areas in the place of equable motion, and using the distances of the bodies from the centres instead of the radii.\n\nCor. 9. From the same demonstration it likewise follows, that the arc which a body uniformly revolving in a circle by means of a given centripetal force describes in any time, is a mean proportional between the diameter of the circle, and the space which the same body, falling by the same given force, would descend through in the same given time.\nBy means of the preceding proposition and its corollaries (says Sir Isaac), we may discover the proportion of a centripetal force to any other known force, such as that of gravity. For if a body by means of its gravity revolves in a circle concentric to the earth, this gravity is the centripetal force of that body. But from the deflection of heavy bodies, the time of one entire revolution, as well as the arc described in any given time, is given (by Cor. 9. of this theorem). And by such propositions Mr Huygens, in his excellent book De Horologio Oscillatorio, has compared the force of gravity with the centrifugal forces of revolving bodies.\n\nThe preceding proposition may also be demonstrated in the following manner. In any circle suppose a polygon to be inscribed of any number of sides. And if a body, moved with a given velocity along the sides of the polygon, is reflected from the circle at the several angular points; the force with which, at every reflection it strikes the circle, will be as its velocity; and therefore the sum of the forces, in a given time, will be as that velocity and the number of reflections conjunctly; that is, (if the species of the polygon be given), as the length described in that given time, and increased or diminished in the ratio of the same length to the radius of the circle; that is, as the square of that length applied to the radius; and therefore, if the polygon, by having its sides diminished in infinitum, coincides with the circle, as the square of the arc described in a given time applied to the radius. This is the centrifugal force, with which the body impels the circle; and to which the contrary force, wherewith the circle continually repels the body towards the centre, is equal.\n\nOn these principles hangs the whole of Sir Isaac Newton's mathematical philosophy. He now shows how to find the centre to which the forces impelling any body are directed, having the velocity of the body given; and finds the centrifugal force to be always as the versed sine of the nacent arc directly, and as the square of the time inversely; or directly as the square of the velocity, and inversely as the chord of the nacent arc. From these premises he deduces the method of finding the centripetal force directed to any given point when the body revolves in a circle; and this whether the central point is near or at an immense distance; so that all the lines drawn from it may be taken for parallels. The same thing he shows with regard to bodies revolving in spirals, ellipses, hyperbolas, or parabolas.\u2014Having the figures of the orbits given, he shows also how to find the velocities and moving powers; and, in short, solves all the most difficult problems relating to the celestial bodies with an astonishing degree of mathematical skill. These problems and demonstrations are all contained in the first book of the Principia: but to give an account of them here would far exceed our limits; neither would many of them be intelligible, excepting to first-rate mathematicians.\n\nIn the second book, Sir Isaac treats of the properties of fluids, and their powers of resistance; and here he lays down such principles as entirely overthrow the doctrine of Des Cartes's vortices, which was the fashionable system in his time. In the third book, he begins particularly to treat of the natural phenomena, and apply them to the mathematical principles formerly demonstrated; and, as a necessary preliminary to this part, he lays down the following rules for reasoning in natural philosophy.\n\n1. We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their natural appearances.\n\n2. Therefore to the same natural effects we must always assign, as far as possible, the same causes.\n\n3. The qualities of bodies which admit neither intension nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.\n\n4. In experimental philosophy, we are to look upon propositions collected by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.\n\nThe phenomena first considered are, 1. That the satellites of Jupiter by radii drawn to the centre of their primary, describe areas proportional to the times of their description; and that their periodic times, the fixed stars being at rest, are in the sesquiplicate ratio of their distances from its centre. 2. The same thing is likewise observed of the phenomena of Saturn. 3. The five primary planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, with their several orbits encompass the sun. 4. The fixed stars being supposed at rest, the periodic times of the five primary planets, and of the earth, about the sun, are in the sesquiplicate proportion of their mean distances from the sun. 5. The primary planets, by radii drawn to the earth, describe areas not proportional to the times: but the areas which they describe by radii drawn to the sun are proportional to the times of description. 6. The moon, by a radius drawn to the centre of the earth, describes an area proportional to the time of description. All these phenomena are undeniable from astronomical observations, and are explained at large under the article Astronomy. The mathematical demonstrations are next applied by Sir Isaac Newton in the following propositions:\n\nProp. I. The forces by which the satellites of Jupiter are continually drawn off from rectilinear motions, and retained in their proper orbits, tend to the centre of that planet; and are reciprocally as the squares of the distances of those satellites from that centre. The former part of this proposition appears from Theor. 2. or 3. and the latter from Cor. 6. of Theor. 5.; and the same thing we are to understand of the satellites of Saturn.\n\nProp. II. The forces by which the primary planets are continually drawn off from rectilinear motions, and retained in their proper orbits, tend to the sun; and are reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the sun's centre. The former part of this proposition is manifest from Phenomenon 5. just mentioned, and from Theor. 2.; the latter from Phenomenon 4. and Cor. 6. of Theor. 4. But this part of the proposition is with great accuracy deducible from the quiescence of the aphelion points. For a very small aberration from the reciprocal duplicate proportion would produce a motion of the apsides, sensible in every single revolution, and in many of them enormously great.\n\nProp. III. The force by which the moon is retained in\nNewtonian in its orbit, tends towards the earth; and is reciprocally as the square of the distance of its place from the centre of the earth. The former part of this proposition is evident from Phenom. 5, and Theor. 2; the latter from Phenom. 6, and Theor. 2, or 3. It is also evident from the very slow motion of the moon's apogee; which, in every single revolution, amounting but to $3^\\circ 3'$ in consequentia, may be neglected: and this more fully appears from the next proposition.\n\nPROP. IV. The moon gravitates towards the earth, and by the force of gravity is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion, and retained in its orbit.\u2014The mean distance of the moon from the earth in the fyzigies in semidiameters of the latter, is about 60. Let us assume the mean distance of 60 semidiameters in the fyzigies; and suppose one revolution of the moon in respect of the fixed stars to be completed in $27^\\text{d} 7^\\text{h} 43'$, as astronomers have determined; and the circumference of the earth to amount to $123,249,600$ Paris feet. Now, if we imagine the moon, deprived of all motion, to be let go, so as to descend towards the earth with the impulse of all that force by which it is retained in its orbit, it will, in the space of one minute of time describe in its fall $15\\frac{1}{2}$ Paris feet. For the verified fine of that arc which the moon, in the space of one minute of time, describes by its mean motion at the distance of 60 semidiameters of the earth, is nearly $15\\frac{1}{2}$ Paris feet; or more accurately, $15$ feet $1$ inch and one line $\\frac{3}{8}$. Wherefore since that force, in approaching to the earth, increases in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance; and, upon that account, at the surface of the earth, is $60 \\times 60$ times greater than that at the moon; a body in our regions, falling with that force, ought, in the space of one minute of time, to describe $60 \\times 60 \\times 15\\frac{1}{2}$ Paris feet; and in the space of one second of time to describe $15\\frac{1}{2}$ of those feet; or, more accurately, $15$ feet $1$ inch, $1$ line $\\frac{3}{8}$. And with this very force we actually find that bodies here on earth do really descend.\n\n\u2014For a pendulum oscillating seconds in the latitude of Paris, will be three Paris feet and $8\\frac{1}{2}$-lines in length, as Mr Huygens has observed. And the space which a heavy body describes by falling one second of time is to half the length of the pendulum in the duplicate ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter; and is therefore $15$ Paris feet, $1$ inch $1$ line $\\frac{3}{8}$. And therefore the force by which the moon is retained in its orbit, becomes at the very surface of the earth, equal to the force of gravity which we observe in heavy bodies there. And therefore (by Rule 1. and 2.) the force by which the moon is retained in its orbit is that very same force which we commonly call gravity. For were gravity another force different from that, then bodies descending to the earth with the joint impulse of both forces would fall with a double velocity, and, in the space of one second of time, would describe $30\\frac{1}{2}$ Paris feet; altogether against experience.\n\nThe demonstration of this proposition may be more diffusely explained after the following manner: Suppose several moons to revolve about the earth, as in the system of Jupiter or Saturn, the periodic times of those moons would (by the argument of induction) observe the same law which Kepler found to obtain among the planets; and therefore their centripetal forces would be reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the centre of the earth, by Prop. I. Now, if Newtonian the lowest of these were very small, and were so near the earth as almost to touch the tops of the highest mountains, the centripetal force thereof, retaining it in its orbit, would be very nearly equal to the weights of any terrestrial bodies that should be found upon the tops of these mountains; as may be known from the foregoing calculation. Therefore, if the same little moon should be deserted by its centrifugal force that carries it through its orbit, it would descend to the earth; and that with the same velocity as heavy bodies do actually descend with upon the tops of those very mountains, because of the equality of forces that oblige them both to descend. And if the force by which that lowest moon would descend were different from that of gravity, and if that moon were to gravitate towards the earth, as we find terrestrial bodies do on the tops of mountains, it would then descend with twice the velocity, as being impelled by both these forces conspiring together. Therefore, since both these forces, that is, the gravity of heavy bodies, and the centripetal forces of the moons, respect the centre of the earth, and are similar and equal between themselves, they will (by Rule 1. and 2.) have the same cause. And therefore the force which retains the moon in its orbit, is that very force which we commonly call gravity; because otherwise, this little moon at the top of a mountain must either be without gravity, or fall twice as swiftly as heavy bodies use to do.\n\nHaving thus demonstrated that the moon is retained in its orbit by its gravitation towards the earth, it is easy to apply the same demonstration to the motions of the other secondary planets, and of the primary planets round the sun, and thus to show that gravitation prevails throughout the whole creation; after which, Sir Isaac proceeds to show from the same principles that the heavenly bodies gravitate towards each other, and contain different quantities of matter, or have different densities in proportion to their bulks.\n\nPROP. V. All bodies gravitate towards every planet; and the weights of bodies towards the same planet, at equal distances from its centre, are proportional to the quantities of matter they contain.\n\nIt has been confirmed by many experiments, that all sorts of heavy bodies (allowance being made for the inequality of retardation by some small resistance of the air,) descend to the earth from equal heights in equal times; and that equality of times we may distinguish to a great accuracy by the help of pendulums. Sir Isaac Newton tried the thing in gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, common salt, wood, water, and wheat. He provided two wooden boxes, round and equal, filled the one with wood, and suspended an equal weight of gold in the centre of oscillation of the other. The boxes hanging by equal threads of $11$ feet, made a couple of pendulums, perfectly equal in weight and figure, and equally receiving the resistance of the air. And placing the one by the other, he observed them to play together forwards and backwards, for a long time, with equal vibrations. And therefore the quantity of matter in the gold was to the quantity of matter in the wood, as the action of the motive force (or vis matrix) upon all the gold, to the action of the same upon all the wood; that is, as the weight\nNewtonian weight of the one to the weight of the other. And the like happened in the other bodies. By these experiments, in bodies of the same weight, he could manifestly have discovered a difference of matter less than the thousandth part of the whole, had any such been. But without all doubt, the nature of gravity towards the planets, is the same as towards the earth. For should we imagine our terrestrial bodies removed to the orb of the moon, and there, together with the moon, deprived of all motion, to be let go, so as to fall together towards the earth; it is certain, from what we have demonstrated before, that in equal times, they would describe equal spaces with the moon, and of consequence are to the moon in quantity of matter, as their weights to its weight. Moreover, since the satellites of Jupiter perform their revolutions in times which observe the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from Jupiter's centre, their accelerative gravities towards Jupiter will be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from Jupiter's centre; that is, equal at equal distances. And therefore, these satellites, if supposed to fall towards Jupiter from equal heights, would describe equal spaces in equal times, in like manner as heavy bodies do on our earth. And by the same argument if the circumfolar planets were supposed to be let fall at equal distances from the sun, they would, in their descent towards the sun, describe equal spaces in equal times. But forces, which equally accelerate unequal bodies, must be as those bodies: that is to say, the weights of the planets towards the sun must be as their quantities of matter. Further, That the weights of Jupiter and his satellites towards the sun are proportional to the several quantities of their matter, appears from the exceeding regular motions of the satellites. For if some of the bodies were more strongly attracted to the sun in proportion to their quantity of matter than others, the motions of the satellites would be disturbed by that inequality of attraction. If, at equal distances from the sun, any satellite, in proportion to the quantity of its matter, did gravitate towards the sun, with a force greater than Jupiter in proportion to his, according to any given proportion, suppose $d$ to $e$; then the distance between the centres of the sun and of the satellite's orbit would be always greater than the distance between the centres of the sun and of Jupiter nearly in the subduplicate of that proportion. And if the satellite gravitated towards the sun with a force less in the proportion of $e$ to $d$, the distance of the centre of the satellite's orbit from the sun would be less than the distance of the centre of Jupiter's from the sun in the subduplicate of the same proportion. Therefore, if, at equal distances from the sun, the accelerative gravity of any satellite towards the sun were greater or less than the accelerating gravity of Jupiter towards the sun but by $\\frac{1}{1000}$ part of the whole gravity; the distance of the centre of the satellite's orbit from the sun would be greater or less than the distance of Jupiter from the sun by $\\frac{1}{1000}$ part of the whole distance; that is, by a fifth part of the distance of the utmost satellite from the centre of Jupiter; an eccentricity of the orbit which would be very sensible. But the orbits of the satellites are concentric to Jupiter; therefore the accelerative gravities of Jupiter, and of all its satellites, towards the sun, are equal among themselves. And by the same argument, the weight of Saturn and of his fa-\n\ntellites towards the sun, at equal distances from the sun, Newtonian: are as their several quantities of matter; and the Philosphy, weights of the moon and of the earth towards the sun, are either none, or accurately proportional to the masses of matter which they contain.\n\nBut further, the weights of all the parts of every planet towards any other planet are one to another as the matter in the several parts. For if some parts gravitated more, others less, than in proportion to the quantity of their matter; then the whole planet, according to the sort of parts with which it most abounds, would gravitate more or less than in proportion to the quantity of matter in the whole. Nor is it of any moment whether these parts are external or internal. For if, as an influence, we should imagine the terrestrial bodies with us to be raised up to the orb of the moon, to be there compared with its body; if the weights of such bodies were to the weights of the external parts of the moon as the quantities of matter in the one and in the other respectively, but to the weights of the internal parts in a greater or less proportion; then likewise the weights of those bodies would be to the weight of the whole moon in a greater or less proportion; against what we have showed above.\n\nCor. 1. Hence the weights of bodies do not depend upon their forms and textures. For if the weights could be altered with the forms, they would be greater or less, according to the variety of forms in equal matter; altogether against experience.\n\nCor. 2. Universally, all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the earth; and the weights of all, at equal distances from the earth's centre, are as the quantities of matter which they severally contain. This is the quality of all bodies within the reach of our experiments; and therefore (by Rule 3.) to be affirmed of all bodies whatsoever. If ether, or any other body, were either altogether void of gravity, or were to gravitate less in proportion to its quantity of matter; then, because (according to Aristotle, Des Cartes, and others) there is no difference betwixt that and other bodies, but in mere form of matter, by a suddene change from form to form, it might be changed at last into a body of the same condition with those which gravitate most in proportion to their quantity of matter; and, on the other hand, the heaviest bodies, acquiring the first form of that body, might by degrees quite lose their gravity. And therefore the weights would depend upon the forms of bodies, and with those forms might be changed, contrary to what was proved in the preceding corollary.\n\nCor. 3. All spaces are not equally full. For if all spaces were equally full, then the specific gravity of the fluid which fills the region of the air, on account of the extreme density of the matter, would fall nothing short of the specific gravity of quicksilver or gold, or any other the most dense body; and therefore, neither gold, nor any other body, could descend in air. For bodies do not descend in fluids, unless they are specifically heavier than the fluids. And if the quantity of matter in a given space can by any rarefaction be diminished, what should hinder a diminution to infinity?\n\nCor. 4. If all the solid particles of all bodies are of the same density, nor can be rarefied without pores, a void space or vacuum must be granted. [By bodies\nPROB. VI. That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to the several quantities of matter which they contain.\n\nThat all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have proved before; as well as that the force of gravity towards every one of them, considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the centre of the planet. And thence it follows, that the gravity tending towards all the planets is proportional to the matter which they contain.\n\nMoreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any other planet B, and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole; and (by Law 3.) to every action corresponds an equal reaction: therefore the planet B will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts of the planet A; and its gravity towards any one part will be to the gravity towards the whole, as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole. Q. E. D.\n\nCOR. 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet, arises from, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its parts. Magnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this. For all attraction towards the whole arises from the attractions towards the several parts. The thing may be easily understood in gravity, if we consider a greater planet as formed of a number of lesser planets, meeting together in one globe. For hence it would appear that the force of the whole must arise from the forces of the component parts. If it be objected, that, according to this law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one towards another, whereas no such gravitation anywhere appears; it is answered, that, since the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation towards the whole earth, as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation towards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our senses. [The experiments with regard to the attraction of mountains, however, have now further elucidated this point.]\n\nCOR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any body, is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the particles.\n\nPROP. VII. In two spheres mutually gravitating each towards the other, if the matter, in places on all sides round about and equidistant from the centres, is similar; the weight of either sphere towards the other will be reciprocally as the square of the distance between their centres.\n\nFor the demonstration of this, see the Principia, Book I. Prop. lxv. and lxvi.\n\nCOR. 1. Hence we may find and compare together the weights of bodies towards different planets. For the weights of bodies revolving in circles about planets are as the diameters of the circles directly, and the squares of their periodic times reciprocally; and their weights at the surfaces of the planets, or at any other distances from their centres, are (by this prop.) greater or less, in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distances. Thus from the periodic times of Venus, revolving about the sun, in 224d. 16h.; of the utmost circumjovial satellite revolving about Jupiter, in 16d. 16h.; of the Huygenian satellite about Saturn in 15d. 22h.; and of the moon about the earth in 27d. 7h. 43m.; compared with the mean distance of Venus from the sun, and with the greatest heliocentric elongations of the outmost circumjovial satellite from Jupiter's centre, 8' 16\"; of the Huygenian satellite from the centre of Saturn, 3' 4\"; and of the moon from the earth, 10' 33\"; by computation our author found, that the weight of equal bodies, at equal distances from the centres of the sun, of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of the earth, towards the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, were one to another as \\( \\frac{1}{1000}, \\frac{997}{1000}, \\frac{791}{1000}, \\) and \\( \\frac{109}{1000} \\) respectively. Then, because as the distances are increased or diminished, the weights are diminished or increased in a duplicate ratio; the weights of equal bodies towards the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, at the distances 1000, 997, 791, and 109, from their centres, that is, at their superfluities, will be as 1000, 943, 529, and 435 respectively.\n\nCOR. 2. Hence likewise we discover the quantity of matter in the several planets. For their quantities of matter are as the forces of gravity at equal distances from their centres, that is, in the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, as \\( \\frac{1}{1000}, \\frac{997}{1000}, \\frac{791}{1000}, \\) and \\( \\frac{109}{1000} \\) respectively. If the parallax of the sun be taken greater or less than 10' 30\", the quantity of matter in the earth must be augmented or diminished in the triplicate of that proportion.\n\nCOR. 3. Hence also we find the densities of the planets. For (by Prop. lxxii. Book I.) the weights of equal and similar bodies towards similar spheres, are, at the surfaces of those spheres, as the diameters of the spheres. And therefore the densities of dissimilar spheres are as those weights applied to the diameters of the spheres. But the true diameters of the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, were one to another as 1000, 997, 791, and 109; and the weights towards the same, as 1000, 943, 529, and 435 respectively; and therefore their densities are as 1000, 943, 67, and 400. The density of the earth, which comes out by this computation, does not depend upon the parallax of the sun, but it is determined by the parallax of the moon, and therefore is here truly defined. The sun therefore is a little denser than Jupiter, and Jupiter than Saturn, and the earth four times denser than the sun; for the sun, by its great heat, is kept in a sort of a rarefied state. The moon also is denser than the earth.\n\nCOR. 4. The smaller the planets are, they are, ceteris paribus, of so much the greater density. For so the powers of gravity on their several surfaces come nearer to equality. They are likewise, ceteris paribus, of the greater density as they are nearer to the sun. So Jupiter is more dense than Saturn, and the earth than Jupiter. For the planets were placed at different distances from the sun, that, according to their degrees of density, they might enjoy a greater or less proportion of the sun's heat. Our water, if it were removed as far as the orb of Saturn, would be converted into ice, and in the orb of Mercury would quickly fly away in vapour. For the light of the sun, to which its heat is proportional, is seven times denser in the orb of Mercury than with us: and by the thermometer Sir Isaac found, that a sevenfold heat of our summer sun will make water boil. Nor are we to doubt,\nthat the matter of Mercury is adapted to its heat, and is therefore more dense than the matter of our earth; since, in a denser matter, the operations of nature require a stronger heat.\n\nIt is shown in the scholium of Prop. xxii. Book II. of the Principia, that, at the height of 200 miles above the earth, the air is more rare than it is at the superficies of the earth, in the ratio of \\(30\\) to \\(9,000,000,000,000,000\\), or as \\(75,000,000,000,000\\) to \\(1\\) nearly. And hence the planet Jupiter, revolving in a medium of the same density with that superior air, would not lose by the resistance of the medium the \\(100,000\\)th part of its motion in \\(100,000\\) years. In the spaces near the earth, the resistance is produced only by the air, exhalations, and vapours. When these are carefully exhausted by the air pump from under the receiver, heavy bodies fall within the receiver with perfect freedom, and without the least sensible resistance; gold itself, and the lightest down, let fall together, will descend with equal velocity; and though they fall through a space of four, six, and eight feet, they will come to the bottom at the same time; as appears from experiments that have often been made. And therefore the celestial regions being perfectly void of air and exhalations, the planets and comets meeting no sensible resistance in those spaces, will continue their motions through them for an immense space of time.\n\nNewton, Thomas, lord bishop of Bristol and dean of St Paul's London, was born on the first of January 1704. His father, John Newton, was a considerable brandy and cider merchant, who, by his industry and integrity, having acquired what he thought a competent fortune, left off trade several years before he died.\n\nHe received the first part of his education in the free school of Litchfield; a school which, the bishop observes with some kind of exultation, had at all times sent forth several persons of note and eminence; from Bishop Smaldridge and Mr Wollaston, to Dr Johnson and Mr Garrick.\n\nFrom Litchfield he was removed to Westminster school, in 1717, under the care of Dr Freind and Dr Nicoll.\n\nDuring the time he was at Westminster, there were, he observes, more young men who made a distinguished figure afterwards in the world, than perhaps at any other period, either before or since. He particularly mentions William Murray, the late earl of Mansfield, with whom he lived on terms of the highest friendship to the last.\n\nHe continued five years at Westminster school, five of which he passed in the college. He afterwards went to Cambridge, and entered at Trinity college. Here he constantly resided eight months at least in every year, till he had taken his Bachelor of Arts degree. Being chosen fellow of his college, he came afterwards to settle in London. As it had been his inclination from a child, and as he was also designed for holy orders, he had sufficient time to prepare himself, and composed some sermons, that he might have a stock in hand when he entered on the ministry. His title for orders was his fellowship; and he was ordained deacon in December 1729, and priest in the February following, by Bishop Gibbon.\n\nAt his first setting out in his office, he was curate at St George's, Hanover-square; and continued for several years assistant preacher to Dr Trebeck. His first preferment was that of reader and afternoon preacher at Grosvenor Chapel, in South Audley street.\n\nThis introduced him to the family of Lord Tyrconnel, to whose son he became tutor. He continued in this situation for many years, very much at his ease, and on terms of great intimacy and friendship with Lord and Lady Tyrconnel, \"without so much (says he) as an unkind word or a cool look intervening.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1744, he was, through the interest of the earl of Bath (who was his great friend and patron, and whose friendship and patronage were returned by grateful acknowledgements and the warmest encomiums), presented to the rectory of St Mary le Bow; so that he was 40 years old before he obtained any living.\n\nAt the commencement of 1745, he took his doctor's degree. In the spring of 1747 he was chosen lecturer of St George's, Hanover-square, by a most respectable vestry of noblemen and gentlemen of high distinction. In August following he married his first wife, the eldest daughter of Dr Trebeck; an unaffected, modest, decent young woman, with whom he lived very happy in mutual love and harmony for near seven years.\n\nIn 1749 he published his edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, (which (says he, very modestly) it is hoped hath not been ill received by the public, having, in 1775, gone through eight editions. After the Paradise Lost, it was judged (says he) proper that Dr Newton should also publish the Paradise Regained, and other poems of Milton; but these things he thought detained him from other more material studies, though he had the good fortune to gain by them more than Milton did by all his works put together. But his greatest gain (he says) was their first introducing him to the friendship and intimacy of two such men as Bishop Warburton and Dr Jortin, whose works will speak for them better than any private commendation.\n\nIn 1754 he lost his father at the age of 83; and within a few days his wife, at the age of 38. This was the severest trial he ever underwent, and almost overwhelmed him. At that time he was engaged in writing his Dissertations on the Prophesies; and happy it was for him: for in any affliction he never found a better or more effectual remedy than plunging deep into study, and fixing his thoughts as intensely as he possibly could upon other subjects. The first volume was published the following winter; but the other did not appear till three years afterwards; and as a reward for his past and an incitement to future labours, he was appointed, in the mean time, to preach Boyle's lecture. The bishop informs us, that 1250 copies of the Dissertations were taken at the first impression, and 1000 at every other edition: and \"though (says he) some things have been since published upon the same subjects, yet they still hold up their head above water, and having gone through five editions, are again prepared for another. Abroad, too, their reception hath not been unfavourable, if accounts from thence may be depended upon.\" They were translated into the German and Danish languages; and received the warmest encomiums from persons of learning and rank.\n\nIn the spring of 1757, he was made prebendary of Westminster, in the room of Dr Green, and promoted\nto the deanery of Salisbury. In October following, he was made sub-almoner to his majesty. This he owed to Bishop Gilbert. He married a second wife in September 1761. She was the widow of the Rev. Mr Hand, and daughter of John Lord Viscount Liffburn. In the same month he kissed his majesty's hand for his bishopric.\n\nIn the winter of 1764, Dr Stone, the primate of Ireland, died. Mr Grenville sent for Bishop Newton, and in the most obliging manner desired his acceptance of the primacy. Having maturely weighed the matter in his mind, he declined the offer.\n\nIn 1768 he was made dean of St Paul's. His ambition was now fully satisfied; and he firmly resolved never to ask for anything more.\n\nFrom this time to his death, ill health was almost his constant companion. It was wonderful that such a poor, weak, and slender thread as the bishop's life, should be spun out to such an amazing length as it really was. In the autumn of 1781 (usually the most favourable part of the year to him) he laboured under repeated illnesses: and on Saturday the 9th of February 1782, he began to find his breath much affected by the frosts. His complaints grew worse and worse till the Thursday following. He got up at five o'clock, and was placed in a chair by the fire; complained to his wife how much he had suffered in bed, and repeated to himself that portion of the Psalms, \"O my God, I cry unto thee in the day time,\" &c. &c. About six o'clock he was left by his apothecary in a quiet sleep. Between seven and eight he awoke, and appeared rather more easy, and took a little refreshment. He continued dozing till near nine, when he ordered his servant to come and dress him, and help him down stairs. As soon as he was dressed, he inquired the hour, and bid his servant open the shutter and look at the dial of St Paul's. The servant answered, it was upon the stroke of nine. The bishop made an effort to take out his watch, with an intent to set it; but sunk down in his chair, and expired without a sigh or the least visible emotion, his countenance still retaining the same placid appearance which was so peculiar to him when alive. Of his numerous works, his Dissertations on the Prophecies are by much the most valuable. His learning was undoubtedly very considerable; but he seldom exhibits evidence of a very vigorous mind. On one occasion, indeed, he appears to have thought with freedom; for we believe he was the first dignitary of the church of England who avowed his belief of the final restitution of all things to harmony and happiness.","sp":415,"ep":438},{"h":"NEWTYA","t":"a port little known, on the coast between Goa the capital of the Portuguese settlements in India, and the English settlement of Bombay.

It has under its jurisdiction only six cities of the third class.","sp":438,"ep":438},{"h":"NGO-KIA","t":"a Chinese drug, of which the composition will no doubt appear as singular as the numerous properties ascribed to it. In the province Chang-tong, near Ngo-hien, a city of the third class, is a well formed by nature, which is reckoned to be seventy feet in depth, and which has a communication, as the Chinese say, with some subterranean lake, or other large reservoir. The water drawn from it is exceedingly clear, and much heavier than common; and if it be mixed with muddy water, it purifies it and renders it limpid, by precipitating all its impurities to the bottom of the vessel. This water is employed in making the ngo-kia, which is nothing else but a kind of glue procured from the skin of a black ass.\n\nThe animal is killed and flayed, and the skin is steeped for five days in water drawn from this well. At the end of that time, it is taken out to be scraped and cleaned; it is afterwards cut into small pieces, which are boiled over a slow fire, in the same kind of water, until it is reduced to a jelly, which is strained, while warm, through a cloth, to free it from all the gross matter which could not be melted. When this glue is cool, and has acquired a consistence, it is formed into square cakes, upon which the Chinese imprint characters and coats of arms, or the signs of their shops.\n\nThis well is the only one of the kind in China; it is always shut, and sealed by the governor of the place with his own seal, until the customary day of making the emperor's glue. This operation generally lasts from the autumnal harvest till the month of March. During that time, the neighbouring people and merchants treat for the purchase of the glue with those who guard the well, and with the people who make it. The latter manufacture as much of it as they can, on their own account, with this difference, that it is not so pure, and that they are less scrupulous in examining whether the ass be fat, or of a very black colour: however, all the glue made here is as much esteemed at Peking as that which the mandarins who are on the spot transmit to court and to their friends.\n\nAs this drug is in the greatest request, and as the quantity of it made at Ngo-hien is not sufficient to supply\nNiagara supply the whole empire, there are not wanting people who counterfeit it elsewhere, and who manufacture a spurious kind from the skins of mules, horses, and camels, and sometimes even from old boots; it is, however, very easy to distinguish that which is genuine; it has neither a bad smell nor a disagreeable taste when applied to the mouth; it is brittle and friable, and always of a deep black colour, sometimes inclining to red. The qualities of the counterfeit kind are entirely different; both its taste and smell are disagreeable, and it is viscous and flabby even when made of the skin of a hog, which is that which imitates the true kind the best.\n\nThe Chinese attribute a great number of virtues to this drug. They assure us that it dissolves phlegm, facilitates the play and elasticity of the lungs, gives a free respiration to those who breathe with difficulty; that it comforts the breast, increases the blood, stops dysenteries, provokes urine, and strengthens children in the womb. Without warranting the truth of all these properties, it appears, at least, certain, by the testimony of the missionaries, that this drug is serviceable in all diseases of the lungs. It is taken with a decoction of simples, and sometimes in powder, but very seldom.","sp":438,"ep":439},{"h":"NIAGARA","t":"a fort of North America, which was taken from the French in 1759. According to the treaty of 1794, it was delivered up by Britain to the United States in 1796. It is situated on a small peninsula formed by the river Niagara as it flows into the lake Ontario. About six leagues from the fort is the greatest cataract in the world, known by the name of the Waterfall of Niagara. The river at this fall runs from SSE to NNW; and the rock of the fall crosses it not in a right line, but forms a kind of figure like a hollow semicircle or horse shoe. Above the fall, in the middle of the river, is an island about 800 or 1000 feet long; the lower end of which is just at the perpendicular edge of the fall. On both sides of this island runs all the water that comes from the lakes of Canada; viz. Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie, which have some large rivers that open themselves into them. Before the water comes to this island, it runs but slowly compared with its motion afterwards, when it grows the most rapid in the world, running with a surprising swiftness before it comes to the fall. It is perfectly white, and in many places is thrown high up into the air. The water that runs down on the west side is more rapid, in greater abundance, and whiter, than that on the east side; and seems almost to outfly an arrow in swiftness. When you are at the fall, and look up the river, you may see that the water is everywhere exceedingly steep, almost like the side of a hill; but when you come to look at the fall itself, it is impossible to express the amazement it occasions. The height of it, as measured by mathematical instruments, is found to be exactly 137 feet; and when the water is come to the bottom, it jumps back to a very great height in the air. The noise may be heard at the distance of 45 miles, but seldom further; nor can it be heard even at Fort Niagara, which is only six leagues distant, unless Lake Ontario is calm. At that fort it is observed, that when they hear the noise of the fall more loud than ordinary, they are sure that a north-east wind will follow; which is the more surprising, as the fort lies south-west from the fall. At times the fall makes a much greater noise than at others; and this is held for an infallible sign of approaching rain or other bad weather.\n\nFrom the place where the water falls there arises abundance of vapour like very thick smoke, inasmuch that when viewed at a distance you would think that the Indians had set the forests on fire. These vapours rise high in the air when it is calm, but are dispersed by the wind when it blows hard. If you go into this vapour or fog, or if the wind blows it on you, it is so penetrating, that in a few moments you will be as wet as if you had been under water. Some are of opinion that when birds come flying into this fog or smoke of the fall, they drop down and perish in the water; either because their wings are become wet, or that the noise of the fall affrightens them, and they know not where to go in the darkness; but others think that seldom or never any bird perishes there in that manner; because among the abundance of birds found dead below the fall, there are no other sorts than such as live and swim frequently in the water; as swans, geese, ducks, water hens, teal, and the like. And very often great flocks of them are seen going to destruction in this manner: they swim in the river above the fall, and so are carried down lower and lower by the water; and as water fowl commonly take great delight in being carried with the stream, they indulge themselves in enjoying this pleasure too long, till the swiftness of the water becomes so great, that it is no longer possible for them to rise, but they are driven down the precipice and perish. They are observed, when they draw nigh the fall, to endeavour with all their might to take wing and leave the water; but they cannot. In the months of September and October such abundant quantities of dead water fowl are found every morning below the fall, on the shore, that the garrison of the fort for a long time live chiefly upon them. Besides the fowl, they find also several sorts of dead fish, also deer, bears, and other animals which have tried to cross the water above the fall: the larger animals are generally found broken to pieces. Just below, a little way from the fall, the water is not rapid, but goes all in circles, and whirls like a boiling pot; which however does not hinder the Indians going upon it in small canoes &c. fishing; but a little further, and lower, the other smaller falls begin. When you are above the fall, and look down, your head begins to turn; even such as have been here numberless times, will seldom venture to look down, without at the same time keeping fast hold of some tree with one hand.\n\nIt was formerly thought impossible for anybody living to come at the island that is in the middle of the fall; but an accident that happened about 50 years ago made it appear otherwise. The history is this: Two Indians of the Six Nations went out from Niagara fort to hunt upon an island that is in the middle of the river, or strait, above the great fall, on which there used to be abundance of deer. They took some French brandy with them from the fort, which they tafted several times as they were going over the carrying place; and when they were in their canoe, they took now and then a dram, and so went along up the strait towards the island where they proposed\nNiagara to hunt; but growing sleepy, they laid themselves down in the canoe, which getting loose drove back with the stream, farther and farther down, till it came nigh that island that is in the middle of the fall. Here one of them, awakened by the noise of the fall, cries out to the other that they were gone: Yet they tried if possible to save life. This island was highest, and with much working they got on shore there. At first they were glad; but when they had considered every thing, they thought themselves hardly in a better state than if they had gone down the fall, since they had now no other choice, than either to throw themselves down the same, or perish with hunger. But hard necessity put them on invention. At the lower end of the island the rock is perpendicular, and no water is running there. The island has plenty of wood; they went to work then, and made a ladder or shrouds of the bark of the lind tree (which is very tough and strong) so long till they could with it reach the water below; one end of this bark ladder they tied fast to a great tree that grew at the side of the rock above the fall, and let the other end down to the water. So they went down along their new invented stairs, and when they came to the bottom in the middle of the fall they rested a little; and as the water next below the fall is not rapid, as before mentioned, they threw themselves out into it, thinking to swim on shore. We have said before, that one part of the fall is on one side of the island, the other on the other side. Hence it is, that the waters of the two cataracts running against each other, turn back against the rock that is just under the island. Therefore, hardly had the Indians begun to swim, before the waves of the eddy threw them back with violence against the rock from whence they came. They tried it several times, but at last grew weary; and by being often thrown against the rock they were much bruised, and the skin torn off their bodies in many places. So they were obliged to climb up stairs again to the island not knowing what to do. After some time they perceived Indians on the shore, to whom they cried out. These saw and pitied them, but gave them little hope or help: yet they made haste down to the fort, and told the commandant where two of their brothers were. He persuaded them to try all possible means of relieving the two poor Indians; and it was done in the following manner:\n\nThe water that runs on the east side of this island is shallow, especially a little above the island towards the eastern shore. The commandant caused poles to be made and pointed with iron; two Indians took upon them to walk to this island by the help of these poles, to save the other poor creatures, or perish themselves. They took leave of all their friends, as if they were going to death. Each had two such poles in his hands, to set to the bottom of the stream, to keep them steady; and in this manner reached the island; and having given poles to the two poor Indians there, they all returned safely to the main land. These two Indians (who in the above-mentioned manner were first brought to this island) were nine days on the island, and almost ready to starve to death. Now since the road to this island has been found, the Indians go there often to kill deer, which have tried to cross the river above the fall, and are driven upon it by the stream. On the west side of this island are some small islands or rocks, of no consequence. The east side of the river is almost perpendicular, the west side more sloping. In former times, a part of the rock at the fall which is on the west side of the island, hung over in such a manner, that the water which fell perpendicularly from it left a vacancy below, so that people could go under between the rock and the water; but the prominent part some years since broke off and fell down. The breath of the fall, as it runs in a semicircle, is reckoned to be about 300 feet. The island is in the middle of the fall, and from it the water on each side is almost the same breadth; the breadth of the island at its lower end is about 100 feet. Below the fall, in the holes of the rocks, are great plenty of eels, which the Indians and French catch with their hands without any other means. Every day when the sun shines, you see here from ten o'clock in the morning to two in the afternoon, below the fall, and under you, where you stand at the side of the fall, a glorious rainbow, and sometimes two, one within the other. The more vapours, the brighter and clearer is the rainbow. When the wind carries the vapours from that place, the rainbow is gone, but appears again as soon as new vapours come. From the fall to the landing above it, where the canoes from Lake Erie put ashore (or from the fall to the upper end of the carrying place), is half a mile. Lower the canoes dare not come, lest they should be obliged to try the fate of the two Indians, and perhaps with less success. They have often found below the fall pieces of human bodies, perhaps drunken Indians, that have unhappily come down to the fall. The French say, that they have often thrown whole great trees into the water above, to see them tumble down the fall; they went down with surprising swiftness, but could never be seen afterwards; whence it was thought there was a bottomless deep or abyss just under the fall. The rock of the fall consists of a gray limestone. For an interesting account of this celebrated fall, the reader is referred to Volney's Travels in America.\n\nHaving mentioned the Six Nations which live on the banks of the Niagara, we shall here add a few particulars relative to those nations which, as they seem not to be well understood even in America, are probably still less known in Europe. The information which we have to give was communicated to the Royal Society of London by Mr Richard McCauld surgeon to the 8th regiment of foot, who, writing from the best authority, informs us, that each nation is divided into three tribes, of which the principal are called the turtle tribe, the wolf tribe, and the bear tribe.\n\nEach tribe has two, three, or more chiefs, called sachems; and this distinction is always hereditary in the family, but descends along the female line; for instance, if a chief dies, one of his sister's sons, or one of his own brothers, will be appointed to succeed him. Among these no preference is given to proximity or primogeniture; but the sachem, during his lifetime, pitches upon one whom he supposes to have more abilities than the rest; and in this choice he frequently, though not always, consults the principal men of the tribe. If the successor happens to be a child, the offices of the post are performed by some\nNiagara, of his friends until he is of sufficient age to act himself.\n\nEach of these posts of sachem has a name which is peculiar to it, and which never changes, as it is always adopted by the successor; nor does the order of precedence of each of these names or titles ever vary. Nevertheless, any sachem, by abilities and activity, may acquire greater power and influence in the nation than those who rank before him in point of precedence; but this is merely temporary, and dies with him.\n\nEach tribe has one or two chief warriors; which dignity is also hereditary, and has a peculiar name attached to it.\n\nThese are the only titles of distinction which are fixed and permanent in the nation; for although any Indian may by superior talents, either as a counsellor or as a warrior, acquire influence in the nation, yet it is not in his power to transmit this to his family.\n\nThe Indians have also their great women as well as their great men, to whose opinions they pay great deference; and this distinction is also hereditary in families. They do not sit in council with the sachems, but have separate ones of their own.\u2014When war is declared, the sachems and great women generally give up the management of public affairs into the hands of the warriors. It may however happen, that a sachem may at the same be also a chief warrior.\n\nFriendships seem to have been instituted with a view towards strengthening the union between the several nations of the confederacy; and hence friends are called the friends of the Six Nations. An Indian has therefore generally one or more friends in each nation. Besides the attachment which subsists during the lifetime of the two friends, whenever one of them happens to be killed, it is incumbent on the survivor to replace him, by presenting to his family either a scalp, a prisoner, or a belt consisting of some thousands of wampum; and this ceremony is performed by every friend of the deceased.\n\nThe purpose and foundation of war parties, therefore, is in general to procure a prisoner or scalp to replace the friend or relation of the Indian who is the head of the party. An Indian who wishes to replace a friend or relation presents a belt to his acquaintance; and as many as choose to follow him accept this belt, and become his party. After this, it is of no consequence whether he goes on the expedition or remains at home (as it often happens that he is a child;) he is still considered as the head of the party. The belt he presented to his party is returned fixed to the scalp or prisoner, and passes along with them to the friends of the person he replaces. Hence it happens, that a war party, returning with more scalps or prisoners than the original intention of the party required, will often give one of these supernumerary scalps or prisoners to another war party whom they meet going out; upon which this party, having fulfilled the purpose of their expedition, will sometimes return without going to war.\n\nNIC\u00c6A, in Ancient Geography, the metropolis of Bithynia; situated on the lake Alcanius, in a large and fertile plain; in compass 16 stadia: first built by Antigonus, the son of Philip, and thence called Antigonea; afterwards completed by Ly\u00f6machus, who called it Nicaea, after his consort the daughter of Antipater.

This is the double view in which we mean to treat of music in this work.\n\nIt has been the case with music as with all the other arts invented by man: some facts were at first discovered by accident; soon afterwards reflection and observation investigated others: and from these facts, properly disposed and united, philosophers were not slow in forming a body of science, which afterwards increased by degrees.\n\nThe first theories of music were perhaps as ancient as the earliest age which we know to have been distinguished by philosophy, even as the age of Pythagoras; nor does history leave us any room to doubt, that from the period when that philosopher taught, the ancients cultivated music, both as an art and as a science, with great affluency. But there remains to us much uncertainty concerning the degree of perfection to which they brought it. Almost every question which has been propounded with respect to the music of the ancients has divided the learned; and probably may still continue to divide them, for want of monuments sufficient in their number, and incontestable in their nature, from whence we might be enabled to exhibit testimonies and discoveries instead of suppositions and conjectures. In the preceding history we have stated a few facts respecting the nature of ancient music, and the inventors of the several musical instruments; but it were to be wished, that, in order to elucidate, as much as possible, a point so momentous in the history of the sciences, some person of learning, equally skilled in the Greek language and in music, should exert himself to unite and The difficulties in the same work the most probable opinions story of established or propounded by the learned, upon a subject, difficult and curious. This philosophical history of ancient music is a work which might highly embellish the literature of our times.\n\nIn the mean time, till an author can be found sufficiently instructed in the arts and in history to undertake such a labour with success, we shall content ourselves with considering the present state of music, and limit our endeavours to the explication of those accessions which have accrued to the theory of music in these latter times.\n\nThere are two departments in music, melody * and harmony +. Melody is the art of arranging several sounds in succession one to another in a manner agreeable to the ear; harmony is the art of pleasing that organ by the union of several sounds which are heard at one and the same time. Melody has been known and felt through all ages; perhaps the same cannot be affirmed of harmony (E); we know not whether the ancients made any use of it or not, nor at what period it began to be practised.\n\nNot but that the ancients certainly employed in their music\n\n---\n\n(c) To deliver the elementary principles of music, theoretical and practical, in a manner which may prove at once entertaining and instructive, without protracting this article much beyond the limits prescribed in our plan, appears to us no easy task. We therefore hesitated for some time whether to try our own strength, or to follow some eminent author on the same subject. Of these the last seemed preferable. Amongst these authors, none appeared to us to have written anything so fit for our purpose as M. d'Alembert, whose treatise on music is the most methodical, perspicuous, concise, and elegant dissertation on that subject with which we are acquainted. As it was unknown to most English readers before a former edition of this work, it ought to have all the merit of an original. We have given a translation of it; and in the notes, we have added, from the works of succeeding authors, and from our own observation, such explanations as appeared necessary, to adapt the work to the present day.\n\n(d) In this passage, and in the definitions of melody and harmony, our author seems to have adopted the vulgar error, that the pleasures of music terminate in corporeal sense. He would have pronounced it absurd to affect the same thing of painting. Yet if the former be no more than a mere pleasure of corporeal sense, the latter must likewise be ranked in the same predicament. We acknowledge that corporeal sense is the vehicle of sound; but it is plain from our immediate feelings, that the results of sound arranged according to the principles of melody, or combined and disposed according to the laws of harmony, are the objects of a reflex or internal sense.\n\nFor a more satisfactory discussion of this matter, the reader may consult that elegant and judicious treatise on Musical Expression by Mr Avilion. In the mean time it may be necessary to add, that, in order to shun the appearance of affectation, we shall use the ordinary terms by which musical sensations, or the mediums by which they are conveyed, are generally denominated.\n\n(e) Though no certainty can be obtained what the ancients understood of harmony, nor in what manner and in what period they practised it; yet it is not without probability, that, both in speculation and practice, they were in possession of what we denominate counterpoint. Without supporting this, there are some passages in the Greek authors which can admit of no satisfactory interpretation. See the Origin and Progress of Language, vol. ii.\n\nBesides,\nPreliminary music those chords which were most perfect and simple; such as the octave, the fifth, and the third; but it seems doubtful whether they knew any of the other consonances or not, or even whether in practice they could deduce the same advantages from the simple chords which were known to them, that have afterwards accrued from experience and combinations.\n\nIf that harmony which we now practise owes its origin to the experience and reflection of the moderns, there is the highest probability that the first essays of this art, as of all the others, were feeble, and the progress of its efforts almost imperceptible; and, that, in the course of time, improving by small gradations, the successive labours of several geniuses have elevated it to that degree of perfection in which at present we find it.\n\nThe first inventor of harmony escapes our investigation, from the same causes which leave us ignorant of those who first invented each particular science; because the original inventors could only advance one step, a succeeding discoverer afterwards made a more sensible improvement, and the first imperfect essays in every kind were lost in the more extensive and striking views to which they led. Thus the arts which we now enjoy, are for the most part far from being due to any particular man, or to any nation exclusively: they are produced by the united and successive endeavours of mankind; they are the results of such continued and united reflections, as have been formed by all men at all periods and in all nations.\n\nIt might, however, be wished, that after having ascertained, with as much accuracy as possible, the state of ancient music by the small number of Greek authors which remain to us, the same application were immediately directed to investigate the first incontrovertible traces of harmony which appear in the succeeding ages, and to pursue those traces from period to period. The products of these researches would doubtless be very imperfect, because the books and monuments of the middle ages are by far too few to enlighten that gloomy and barbarous era; yet these discoveries would still be precious to a philosopher, who delights to observe the human mind in the gradual evolution of its powers, and the progress of its attainments.\n\nThe first compositions upon the laws of harmony which we know, are of no higher antiquity than two ages prior to our own; and they were followed by many others. But none of these essays was capable of satisfying the mind concerning the principles of harmony: they confined themselves almost entirely to the single occupation of collecting rules, without endeavouring to account for them; neither had their analogies one with another, nor their common source, been perceived; a blind and unenlightened experience was the only compass by which the artist could direct and regulate his course.\n\nBesides, we can discover some vestiges of harmony, however rude and imperfect, in the history of the Gothic ages, and amongst the most barbarous people. This they could not have derived from more cultivated countries, because it appears to be incorporated with their national music. The most rational account, therefore, which can be given, seems to be, that it was conveyed in a mechanical or traditionary manner through the Roman provinces from a more remote period of antiquity.\n\n(r) See M. Rameau's letter upon this subject, Merc. de Mai, 1752.\nOne end which we have proposed in this treatise, was not only to elucidate, but to simplify the discoveries of M. Rameau.\u2014For instance, besides the fundamental experiment mentioned above, that celebrated musician, to facilitate the explication of certain phenomena, had recourse to another experiment; that which shows that a sonorous body struck and put in vibration, forces its 12th and 17th major in descending to divide themselves and produce a tremulous sound. The chief use which M. Rameau made of this second experiment was to investigate the origin of the minor mode, and to account for some other rules established in harmony; but we have found means to deduce from the first experiment alone the formation of the minor mode, and, besides, to disengage that formation from all questions foreign to it.\n\nIn some other points also, (as, the origin of the chord of the sub-dominant*, and the explication of the seventh in certain cases) it is imagined that we have simplified, and perhaps in some measure extended, the principles of the celebrated artist.\n\nWe have likewise banished every consideration of geometrical, arithmetical, and harmonical proportions and progressions, which have been sought in the mixture and proportion of tones produced by a sonorous body; persuaded as we are, that M. Rameau was under no necessity of paying the least regard to these proportions, which we believe to be not only useless, but even, if we may venture to say so, fallacious when applied to the theory of music. In short, though the relations produced by the octave, the fifth, and the third, &c., were quite different from what they are; though in these chords we should neither remark any progression nor any law; though they should be incommensurable one with another; the protracted tone of a sonorous body, and the multiplied sounds which result from it, are a sufficient foundation for the whole harmonic system.\n\nBut though this work is intended to explain the theory of music, and to reduce it to a form more complete and more luminous than has hitherto been done, we ought to caution our readers against misapprehension either of the nature of our subject or of the purpose of our endeavours.\n\nWe must not here look for that striking evidence which is peculiar to geometrical discoveries alone, and which can be so rarely obtained in these mixed disquisitions, where natural philosophy is likewise concerned. Into the theory of musical phenomena there must always enter a particular kind of metaphysics, which these phenomena implicitly take for granted, and which brings along with it its natural obscurity. In this subject, therefore, it would be vain to expect what is called demonstration: it is much too reduced the principal facts to a consistent and connected system; to have deduced them from one simple experiment; and to have established upon this foundation the most common and essential rules of the musical art. But if the intimate and unalterable conviction which can only be produced by the strongest evidence is not here to be required, we must also doubt whether a clearer elucidation of our subject be possible.\n\nAfter this declaration, it will not excite surprise, that, amongst the facts deduced from our fundamental experiment, some should immediately appear to depend upon that experiment, and others to result from it in a way more remote and less direct. In disquisitions of natural philosophy, where we are scarcely allowed to use any other arguments than those which arise from analogy or congruity, it is natural that the analogy should be sometimes more and sometimes less sensible; and we will venture to pronounce that mind very unphilosophical, which cannot recognize and distinguish this gradation and the different circumstances on which it proceeds. It is not even surprising, that, in a subject where analogy alone can take place, this conductors should defer us all at once in our attempts to account for certain phenomena. This likewise happens in the subject which we now treat; nor do we conceal the fact, however mortifying, that there are certain points (though their number be but small) which appear still in some degree unaccountable from our principle. Such, for instance, is the procedure of the diatonic scale of the minor mode in descending, the formation of the chord commonly termed the sixth redundant\u2020 or superfluous, and some other facts of least importance, for which as yet we can scarcely offer any satisfactory account except from experience alone.\n\nThus, though the greatest number of the phenomena of music appear to be deducible in a simple and easy manner from the protracted tone of sonorous bodies, it ought not perhaps with too much temerity to be affirmed as yet, that this mixed and protracted tone is demonstratively the only original principle of harmony. But in the mean time it would not be least unjust Rameau's to reject this principle, because certain phenomena appear to be deduced from it with less success than others, has not as it is only necessary to conclude from this, either that yet accounts for these phenomena to this principle; or that harmony has perhaps some other unknown principle, more general than that which results from the protracted and perhaps compounded tone of sonorous bodies, and of which some other is only a branch; or, lastly, that we ought not perhaps may be necessary to attempt the reduction of the whole science of music to one and the same principle; which, however, is the natural effect of an impatience to frequent even among philosophers themselves, which induces them to take a part for the whole, and to judge of objects in their full extent by the greatest number of their appearances.\n\nIn those sciences which are called physo-mathematical (and amongst this number perhaps the science of founds may be placed), there are some phenomena which depend only upon one single principle and one single experiment: there are others which necessarily suppose a greater number both of experiments and principles, whose combination is indispensible in forming an exact and complete system; and music perhaps is in this last case. It is for this reason, that whilst\nPreliminary we beflow on M. Rameau all due praise, we should not at the same time neglect to stimulate the learned in their endeavours to carry them still to higher degrees of perfection, by adding, if it is possible, such improvements as may be wanting to consummate the science.\n\nWhatever the result of their efforts may be, the reputation of this intelligent artist has nothing to fear: he will still have the advantage of being the first who rendered music a science worthy of philosophical attention; of having made the practice of it more simple and easy; and of having taught musicians to employ in this subject the light of reason and analogy.\n\nWe would the more willingly persuade those who are skilled in theory and eminent in practice to extend and improve the views of him who before them pursued and pointed out the career, because many amongst them have already made laudable attempts, and have even been in some measure successful in diffusing new light through the theory of this enchanting art. It was with this view that the celebrated Tartini has presented us in 1754 with a treatise of harmony, founded on a principle different from that of M. Rameau. This principle is the result of a most beautiful experiment (c). If at once two different sounds are produced from two instruments of the same kind, these two sounds generate a third different from both the others. We have inferred in the Encyclop\u00e9die, under the article Fundamental, a detail of this experiment according to M. Martini; and we owe to the public an information, of which in composing this article we were its discoverer: M. Romien, a member of the Royal Society very originally at Montpelier, had presented to that society in the year 1753, before the work of M. Tartini had appeared, a memorial printed the same year, and where may be found the same experiment displayed at full length. In relating this fact, which it was necessary for us to do, it is by no means our intention to detract in any degree from the reputation of M. Tartini; we are persuaded that he owes this discovery to his own researches alone: but we think ourselves obliged in honour to give public testimony in favour of him who was the first in exhibiting this discovery.\n\nBut whatever be the case, it is in this experiment that M. Tartini attempts to find the origin of harmony: his book, however, is written in a manner so obscure, that it is impossible for us to form any judgment of it; and we are told that others distinguished for their knowledge of the science are of the same opinion. It were to be wished that the author would engage some man of letters, equally practised in music and skilled in the art of writing, to unfold these ideas which.\n\n(c) Had the utility of the preliminary discourse in which we are now engaged been less important and obvious than it really is, we should not have given ourselves the trouble of translating, or our readers that of perusing it. But it must be evident to every one, that the cautions here given, and the advices offered, are less applicable to students than to authors. The first question here decided is, Whether pure mathematics can be successfully applied to the theory of music? The author is justified in a contrary opinion. It may certainly be doubted with great justice, whether the solid contents of honourable bodies, and their degrees of cohesion or elasticity, can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy to render them the subjects of musical speculation, and to determine their effects with such precision as may render the conclusions deduced from them geometrically true. It is admitted, that sound is a secondary quality of matter, and that secondary qualities have no obvious connection which we can trace with the sensations produced by them. Experience, therefore, and not speculation, is the grand criterion of musical phenomena. For the effects of geometry in illustrating the theory of music (if any will fill be so credulous as to pay them much attention), the English reader may consult Smith's Harmonics, Malcolm's Dissertation on Music, and Pleydel's Treatise on the same subject inserted in a former edition of this work. Our author next treats of the famous discovery made by Signor Tartini, of which the reader may accept the following compendious account.\n\nIf two sounds be produced at the same time properly tuned and with due force, from their conjunction a third sound is generated, so much more distinctly to be perceived by delicate ears as the relation between the generating sounds is more simple; yet from this rule we must except the unison and octave. From the fifth is produced a sound unison with its lowest generator; from the fourth, one which is an octave lower than the highest of its generators; from the third major, one which is an octave lower than its lowest; and from the sixth minor (whose highest note forms an octave with the lowest in the third formerly mentioned) will be produced a sound lower by a double octave than the highest of the lesser sixth; from the third minor, one which is double the distance of a greater third from its lowest; but from the sixth major (whole highest note makes an octave to the lowest in the third minor) will be produced a sound only lower by double the quantity of a greater third than the highest; from the second major, a sound lower by a double octave than the lowest; from a second minor, a sound lower by triple the quantity of a third major than the highest; from that of a minor or diatonic or greater semitone, a sound lower by triple octave than the highest; from that of a minor or chromatic semitone, a sound lower by the quantity of a fifth four times multiplied than the lowest, &c., &c. But that these musical phenomena may be tried by experiments proper to ascertain them, two hautboys tuned with scrupulous exactness must be procured, whilst the musicians are placed at the distance of some paces one from the other, and the hearers in the middle. The violin will likewise give the same chords, but they will be less distinctly perceived, and the experiment more fallacious, because the vibrations of other strings may be supposed to enter into it.\n\nIf our English reader should be curious to examine these experiments and the deductions made from them in the theory of music, he will find them clearly explained and illustrated in a treatise called Principles and Powers of Harmony, printed at London in the year 1771.\nElements.\n\nPreliminary which he has not communicated with sufficient perspicuity, and from whence the art might perhaps derive considerable advantage if they were placed in a proper light. Of this we are so much the more persuaded, that even though this experiment should not be regarded by others in the same view with M. Tartini as the foundation of the musical art, it is nevertheless extremely probable that one might use it with the greatest advantage to enlighten and facilitate the practice of harmony.\n\nIn exhorting philosophers and artists to make new attempts for the advancement of the theory of music, we ought at the same time to caution them against mistaking the real end of their researches. Experience is the only foundation upon which they can proceed; it is alone by the observation of facts, by bringing them together in one view, by showing their dependency upon one, if possible, or at least upon a very small number of primary facts, that they can reach the end to which they so ardently aspire, the important end of establishing a theory of music, at once great, complete and luminous. The enlightened philosopher will not attempt the explanation of facts, because he knows how little mechanical such explanations are to be relied on. To estimate them according to their proper value, it is only necessary to consider the attempts of natural philosophers who have discovered the greatest skill in their science, to explain, for instance, the multiplicity of tones produced by sonorous bodies. Some having remarked (what is by no means difficult to conclude) that the universal vibration of a musical string is a mixture of several partial vibrations, infer, that a sonorous body ought to produce a multiplicity of tones, as it really does. But why should this multiplied sound only appear to contain three, and why these three preferable to others? Others pretend that there are particles in the air, which, by their different degrees of tension, being naturally susceptible of different oscillations, produce the multiplicity of sound in question. But what do we know of all this? And though it should even be granted, that there is such a diversity of tension in these aerial particles, how should this diversity prevent them from being all of them confounded in their vibrations by the motions of a sonorous body? What then should be the result, when the vibrations arrive at our ears, but a confused and inappreciable noise, where one could not distinguish any particular sound?\n\nIf philosophical musicians ought not to lose their preliminary time in searching for mechanical explications of the Difficult phenomena in music, explications which will always be found vague and unsatisfactory; much less is it their conclusion to exhaust their powers in vain attempts to rise above their sphere into a region still more remote adequate from the prospect of their faculties, and to lose themselves in a labyrinth of metaphysical speculations upon the causes of that pleasure which we feel from harmony. In vain would they accumulate hypotheses on hypothesis, to find a reason why some chords should please us more than others. The futility of these supposititious accounts must be obvious to every one who has the least penetration. Let us judge of the rest by the most probable which has till now been invented for that purpose. Some ascribe the different degrees of pleasure which we feel from chords, to the more or less frequent coincidence of vibrations; others to the relations which these vibrations have among themselves as they are more or less simple. But why should this coincidence of vibrations, that is to say, their simultaneous impulse on the same organs of sensation, and the accident of beginning frequently at the same time, prove so great a source of pleasure? Upon what is this gratuitous supposition founded? And though it should be granted, would it not follow, that the same chord should successively and rapidly affect us with contrary sensations, since the vibrations are alternately coincident and discrepant? On the other hand, how should the ear be so sensible to the simplicity of relations, whilst for the most part these relations are entirely unknown to him whose organs are notwithstanding sensibly affected with the charms of agreeable music? We may conceive without difficulty how the eye judges of relations; but how does the ear form similar judgements? Besides, why should certain chords which are extremely pleasing in themselves, such as the fifth, lose almost nothing of the pleasure which they give us, when they are altered, and of consequence when the simplicity of their relations are destroyed; whilst other chords, which are likewise extremely agreeable, such as the third, become harsh almost by the smallest alteration; nay, whilst the most perfect and the most agreeable of all chords, the octave, cannot suffer the most inconsiderable change? Let us in sincerity confess our ignorance concerning the genuine causes of these effects (H). The metaphysical\n\n(H) We have as great an aversion as our author to the explication of musical phenomena from mechanical principles; yet we fear the following observations, deduced from irresistible and universal experience, evidently show that the latter necessarily depend on the former. It is, for instance, universally allowed, that dissonances grate and concords please a musical ear: It is likewise no less unanimously agreed, that in proportion as a chord is perfect, the pleasure is increased; now the perfection of a chord consists in the regularity and frequency of coincident oscillations between two sonorous bodies impelled to vibrate: thus the third is a chord less perfect than the fifth, and the fifth than the octave. Of all these consonances, therefore, the octave is most pleasing to the ear; the fifth next, and the third last. In absolute discords, the vibrations are never coincident, and of consequence a perpetual pulsation or jarring is recognized between the protracted sounds, which exceedingly hurts the ear; but in proportion as the vibrations coincide, those pulsations are superseded, and a kindred formed betwixt the two continued sounds, which delights even the corporeal sense: that relation, therefore, without recognizing the aptitudes which produce it, must be the obvious cause of the pleasure which chords give to the ear. What we mean by coincident vibrations is, that while one sonorous body performs a given number of vibrations, another performs a different number in the same time; so that the vibrations of the quickest must sometimes be simultaneous with those of the slowest, as will plainly appear from the following\nPreliminary taphysical conjectures concerning the acoustic organs are probably in the same predicament with those which are formed concerning the organs of vision, if one may speak so, in which philosophers have even till now made such inconsiderable progress, and in all likelihood will not be surpassed by their successors.\n\nSince the theory of music, even to those who confine themselves within its limits, implies questions from which every wise musician will abstain; with much greater reason should they avoid idle excursions beyond the boundaries of that theory, and endeavours to investigate between music and the other sciences chimerical relations which have no foundation in nature. The singular opinions advanced upon this subject by some even of the most celebrated musicians, deserve not to be rescued from oblivion, nor refuted; and ought only to be regarded as a new proof how far men of genius may err, when they engage in subjects of which they are ignorant.\n\nThe rules which we have attempted to establish concerning the track to be followed in the theory of the musical art, may suffice to show our readers the end which we have proposed, and which we have endeavoured to attain in this Work. We have here (we repeat it), nothing to do with the mechanical principles of protracted and harmonic tones produced by sonorous bodies; principles which have hitherto been and perhaps may yet be long explored in vain: we have less to do with the metaphysical causes of the sensations impressed on the mind by harmony; causes which are still less discovered, and which, according to all appearances, will remain latent in perpetual obscurity. We are alone concerned to show how the principal laws of harmony may be deduced from one single experiment; for which, if we may speak so, preceding artists have been under a necessity of groping in the dark.\n\nWith an intention to render this work as generally useful as possible, we have endeavoured to adapt it to the capacity even of those who are absolutely uninstructed in music. To accomplish this design, it appeared necessary to pursue the following plan.\n\nTo begin with a short introduction, in which are defined the technical terms most frequently used in this treatise; such as chord, harmony, key, third, fifth, octave, &c.\n\nAfterwards to enter into the theory of harmony, which is explained according to M. Rameau, with all possible perspicuity. This is the subject of the First Part; which, as well as the introduction, presupposes no other knowledge of music than that of the names of the notes, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, which all the world knows (1).\n\nThe theory of harmony requires some arithmetical calculations, necessary for comparing sounds one with another. These calculations are short, simple, and may be comprehended by everyone; they demand no operation but what is explained, and which every school-boy may perform. Yet, that even the trouble of this may be spared to such as are not disposed to take it, these calculations are not inserted in the text, but in the notes, which the reader may omit, if he can take for granted the propositions contained in the text which will be found proved in the notes.\n\nThese calculations we have not endeavoured to multiply; we could even have wished to suppress them, if it had been possible: so much did it appear to us to be apprehended that our readers might be misled upon this subject, and might either believe, or suspect us of believing,\n\nfollowing deduction: Between the extremes of a third, the vibrations of the highest are as 5 to 4 of the lowest; those of the fifth as 3 to 2; those of the octave as 2 to 1. Thus it is obvious, that in proportion to the frequent coincidence of periodical vibrations, the compound sensation is more agreeable to the ear. Now, to inquire why that organ should be rather pleased with these than with the pulsation and tremulous motion of encountering vibrations which can never coalesce, would be to ask why the touch is rather pleased with polished than rough surfaces? or, why the eye is rather pleased with the waving line of Hogarth than with sharp angles and abrupt or irregular prominences? No alteration of which any chord is susceptible will hurt the ear unless it should violate or destroy the regular and periodical coincidence of vibrations. When alterations can be made without this disagreeable effect, they form a pleasing diversity; but still this fact corroborates our argument, that in proportion as any chord is perfect, it is impatient of the smallest alteration; for this reason, even in temperament, the octave endures no alteration at all, and the fifth as little as possible.\n\n(1) In our former editions, the French syllabic names of the notes ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, were retained, as being thought to convey the idea of the relative sounds more distinctly than the seven letters used in Britain. It is no doubt true, that by constantly using the syllables, and considering each as representing one certain sound in the scale, a finger will in time associate the idea of each sound with its proper syllable, so that he will habitually give ut the sound of the first or fundamental note, re that of a second, mi of a third, &c. but this requires a long time, and much application: and is, besides, useless in modulation or changes of the key, and in all instrumental music. Teachers of solfeggio as it is called, or singing by the syllables, in Britain, have long discarded, (if they ever used) the syllables ut, re, and si: and the prevalent, and we think, the soundest opinion is now, that a scholar will, by attending to the sounds themselves rather than to their names, soon learn their distinct characters and relations to the key, and to each other, and be able of course to assign to each its proper degree in the scale which he employs for the time, by whatever name the note representing that degree may be generally known. See Holden's Essay towards a Rational System of Music, Part I. chap. i. \u00a7 32, 33.\n\nWe have therefore, in our present edition, preferred to the French syllables the British nomenclature by the letters C, D, E, F, G, A, B, as being more simple, more familiar to British musicians, and equally applicable to instrumental as to vocal music.\nPreliminary believing all this arithmetic necessary to form an artist.\n\nCalculations may indeed facilitate the understanding of certain points in the theory, as of the relations between the different notes in the gammut and of the temperament; but the calculations necessary for treating of these points are so simple, and of so little importance, that nothing can require a less ostentatious display.\n\nLet us not imitate those musicians, who, believing themselves geometers, or those geometers who, believing themselves musicians, fill their writings with figures upon figures; imagining, perhaps, that this apparatus is necessary to the art. The propensity of adorning their works with a false air of science, can only impose upon ignorance, and render their treatises more obscure and less instructive.\n\nThis abuse of geometry in music may be condemned with so much more reason, that in this subject the foundations of those calculations are in some manner hypothetical, and can never arise to a degree of certainty above hypothesis. The relation of the octave as 1 to 2, that of the fifth as 2 to 3, that of the third major as 4 to 5, &c., are not perhaps the genuine relations established in nature; but only relations which approach them, and such as experience can discover. For are the results of experience any thing more but mere approaches to truth?\n\nBut happily these approximated relations are sufficient, though they should not be exactly agreeable to truth, for giving a satisfactory account of those phenomena which depend on the relations of sound; as in the difference between the notes in the gammut, of the alterations necessary in the fifth and third, of the different manner in which instruments are tuned, and other facts of the same kind. If the relations of the octave, of the fifth, and of the third, are not exactly such as we have supposed them, at least no experiments can prove that they are not so; and since these relations are signified by a simple expression, since they are besides sufficient for all the purposes of theory, it would be useless, and contrary to found philosophy, to invent other relations in order to form the basis of any system of music less easy and simple than that which we have delineated in this treatise.\n\nThe second part contains the most essential rules of composition*, or in other words the practice of harmony. These rules are founded on the principles laid down in the first part; yet those who wish to understand no more than is necessary for practice, without exploring the reasons why such practical rules are necessary, may limit the objects of their study to the introduction and the second part. They who have read the first part, will find at every rule contained in the second, a reference to that passage in the first where the reasons for establishing that rule are given.\n\nThat we may not present at once too great a number of objects and precepts, we have transferred to the Preliminary notes in the second part several rules and observations which are less frequently put in practice, which perhaps it may be proper to omit till the treatise is read on account a second time, when the reader is well acquainted with their essential and fundamental rules explained in it.\n\nThis second part presupposes no more than the first, to the notes any habit of fingering, nor even any knowledge of music; it only requires that one should know, not even the intonation, but merely the position of the notes in the clef F on the fourth line, and that of G upon the second; and even this knowledge may be acquired from the work itself; for in the beginning of the second part we explain the position of the clefs and of the notes. Nothing is necessary but to render it a little familiar, and any difficulty in it will disappear.\n\nIt would be wrong to expect here all the rules of All the composition, and especially those which direct the rules of composition of music in several parts, and which, being composition not less severe and indispensable, may be chiefly acquired by practice, by studying the most approved models, in an ele- by the affluence of a proper master, but above all by mentary, the cultivation of the ear and of the taste. This treatise is properly nothing else, if the expression may be allowed, but the rudiments of music, intended for explaining to beginners the fundamental principles, not the practical detail of composition. Those who wish to enter more deeply into this detail, will either find it in M. Rameau's treatise of harmony, or in the code of music which he published more lately (K), or lastly in the explication of the theory and practice of music by M. Bethizy (L); this last book appears to us clear and methodical (M).\n\nIs it necessary to add, that, in order to compose Nature the music in a proper taste, it is by no means enough to accidental have familiarized with much application the principles musical of explained in this treatise? Here can only be learned composition, the mechanism of the art; it is the province of nature alone to accomplish the rest. Without her affluence, it is no more possible to compose agreeable music by having read these elements, than to write verses in a proper manner with the Dictionary of Richelet. In one word, it is the elements of music alone, and not the principles of genius, that the reader may expect to find in this treatise.","sp":107,"ep":113},{"h":"REMARK","t":"Other rules Of the five fundamental rules which have now been substituted, given, instead of the three first, one may substitute the three following, which are consequences from them.\n\nRULE I.\n\nIf a note of the fundamental bass be a tonic, and rise by a fifth or a third to another note, that second note may be either a tonic (34. & 91.), see Examples Principles xix. and xx., (3u); a tonic dominant (124.), see Composition xxI. and xxII.; or a sub-dominant (124.), see xxIII. and xxIV.; or, to express the rule more simply, that second note may be any one, except a simple dominant.","sp":143,"ep":143},{"h":"REMARK","t":"228. We have omitted two cases, which may cause some uncertainty.\n\nThe first is that where the note of the continued bas is figured with a 6. We now present the reason of the difficulty.\n\nSuppose we should have the dominant D in the fundamental bas, the note which answers to it in the continued bas may be A carrying the figure 6 (see LXIV.); that is to say, the chord A C D F: now if we should have the subdominant F in the fundamental bas, this subdominant might produce in the continued bas the same note A figured with a 6. When therefore we find in the continued bas a note marked with a 6, it appears at first uncertain whether we should place in the fundamental bas the fifth below marked with a 7, or the third below marked with a 6.\n\n229. The second case is that in which the continued bas is figured with a 6. For instance, if there should be found F in the continued bas, we may be ignorant whether we ought to infer in the fundamental bas F marked with a 6, or D figured with a 7.\n\n230. This difficulty may be removed by leaving for solution an instant this uncertain note in suspense, and in examining the succeeding note of the fundamental bas; for if that note be in the present case a fifth above F, that is to say, if it be C, in this case, and in this alone, we may place F in the fundamental bas. It is a consequence of this rule, that in the fundamental bas every sub-dominant ought to rise by a fifth (195).\n\nCHAP. XII. What is meant by being in a Mode or Tone.\n\n231. In the first part of this treatise (chap. vi.) we have explained, how by the means of the note C, and determining of its two-fifths G and F, one in ascending, which is mode in called a tonic dominant, the other in descending, which we is called a sub-dominant, the scale C D E F A B C may are be found: the different sounds which form this scale compose\n\nthe same when the chords are differently inverted. By this means it would be impossible to mistake either with respect to the fundamental bas of a chord, or with respect to the note which forms its dissonance, or with respect to the nature and species of that discord.\n\n(5 A) We may only add, that here, and in the preceding articles of the text, we suppose, that the continued bas is figured in the manner of M. Rameau. For it is proper to observe, that there are not, perhaps, two musicians who characterize their chords with the same figures; which produces a great inconvenience to the person who plays the accompaniments: but here we do not treat of accompaniments. We prefer the continued bases of M. Rameau to all the others, as by them the fundamental bas will be most easily discovered.\n\nM. Rameau only marks the lesser sixth by a 6 without a line, when this lesser sixth does not result from the chord of the tonic dominant; in such a manner that the 6 renders it uncertain whether in the fundamental bas we ought to choose the third or the fifth below; but it will be easy to see whether the third or the fifth is signified by that figure. This may be distinguished, 1. In observing which of the two notes is excluded by the rules of the fundamental bas. 2. If the two notes may with equal propriety be placed in the fundamental bas, the preference must be determined by the tone or mode of the treble in that particular passage. In the following chapter we shall give rules for determining the mode (note 3 z).\n\nThere is a chord of which we have not spoken in this enumeration, and which is called the chord of the sixth redundant. This chord is composed of a note, of its third major, of its redundant fourth or tritone, and its redundant sixth, as F A B D X. It is marked with a 6. It appears difficult to find a fundamental bas for this chord; nor is it indeed much in use amongst us. (See the note upon the art. 115.)\n\nThis chord is called in England the chord of the extreme flat sixth. When accompanied by the third only, it is called the Italian sixth. When the fifth is substituted for the tritone, it has been called the German sixth.\nPart II.\n\nMUSIC\n\nPrinciples of Composition.\n\ncompose the major mode of C, because the third E above C is major. If therefore we would have a modulation in the major mode of C, no other sounds must enter into it than those which compose this scale; in such a manner that if, for instance, we should find F in this modulation, this F discloses to us that we are not in the mode of C, or at least that, if we have been in it, we are no longer so.\n\n232. In the same manner, if we form this scale in ascending A B C D E F G A, which is exactly similar to the scale C D E F G A B C of the major mode of C, this scale, in which the third from A to C is major, shall be in the major mode of A; and if we incline to be in the minor mode of A, we have only to substitute for C sharp C natural; so that the major third A C may become minor A C: we shall have then\n\nA B C D E F G A,\n\nwhich is (85.) the scale of the minor mode of A in ascending; and the scale of the minor mode of A in descending shall be (90.)\n\nA G F E C D B A,\n\nin which the G and F are no longer sharp. For it is a singularity peculiar to the minor mode, that its scale is not the same in rising as in descending (89.).\n\nHence it appears what sharps and flats should be placed at the clef upon F, C, and G; and on the contrary, in the minor mode of A, we place none, because at the clef the minor mode of A, in descending, has neither sharps nor flats.\n\n234. As the scale contains twelve sounds, each distant from the other by the interval of a semitone, it is obvious that each of these sounds can produce both a major and a minor mode, which constitute 24 modes in all.\n\nOf A.\n\nIn descending, A G F E D C B A.\nIn rising, A B C D E F G A.\n\nOf E.\n\nIn descending, E D C B A G F E.\nIn rising, E F G A B C D E.\n\nOf B.\n\nIn descending, B A G F E D C B.\nIn rising, B C D E F G A B C.\n\nOf F.\n\nIn descending, F E D C B A G E X.\nIn rising, F X G A B C D E F.\n\nOf C.\n\nIn descending, C X B A G F E D C X.\nIn rising, C X D E F G A B C X.\n\nOf G or A.\n\nIn descending, G X F E D C X B A X G X.\nIn rising, A X B X C X D X E X F X G X.\n\nOf D or E.\n\nIn descending, E D C B A G F E B.\nIn rising, E B F G A B C D E.\n\nOf A or B.\n\nIn descending, B A G F E D C B.\nIn rising, B D C E F G A B.\n\nOf\n\n(5 b) The major mode of F, of C, and of G, are not much practised.\n\nWhen a piece begins upon C, there ought to be seven sharps placed at the clef; but it is more convenient only to place five flats, and to suppose the key Db, which is almost the same thing with C. For this reason we substitute here the mode of Db, for that of C.\n\nIt is still much more necessary to substitute the mode of Ab for that of G; for the scale of the major mode of G is,\n\nG, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C,\n\nin which it appears that there are at the same time both a 'gh' and a 'g': it would then be necessary, even at the same time, that upon G there should and should not be a sharp at the clef; which is inconsistent. It is true that this inconvenience may be avoided by placing a sharp upon G at the clef; and by marking the note G with a natural through the course of the music wherever it ought to be natural; but this would become troublesome, above all if there should be occasion to transpose. In the article 236. we shall give an account of transposition.\n\nWe might likewise in this series, instead of G natural, which is the note immediately before the last, substitute F, that is to say, F twice sharp: which, however, is not absolutely the same found with G natural, especially upon instruments whose scales are fixed, or whose intervals are invariable. But in that case two sharps must be placed at the clef upon F, which would produce another inconvenience. But by substituting Ab for G, the trouble is eluded.\n\nThe double sharp, however, is incidentally used, when in a composition in the key of F there is an occasional modulation into the dominant of that key, and it is distinguished by the character X or XX.\n235. These then are all the modes, as well major as minor. Those which are crowded with sharps and flats are little practised, as being extremely difficult in execution.\n\n(5c) We have already seen, that in each mode, the principal note is called a tonic; that the fifth above that note is called a tonic dominant, or the dominant of the mode, or simply a dominant; that the fifth below the tonic, or, what is the same thing, the fourth above that tonic, is called a sub-dominant; and in short, that the note which forms a semitone below the tonic, and which is a third major from the dominant, is called a sensible note. The other notes have likewise in every mode particular names which it is advantageous to know. Thus a note which is a tone immediately above the tonic, as D in the mode of C, and B in that of A is termed a super-tonic; the following note, which is a third major or minor from the tonic, according as the chord is major or minor, such as E in the major mode of C, and C in the minor mode of A, is called a mediant; and the note which is a tone above the dominant, such as A, in the mode of C, and F in that of A, is called a super-dominant.\n\n(5d) Though our author's account of this delicate operation in music will be found extremely just and compendious; though it proceeds upon simple principles, and comprehends every possible contingency; yet as the manner of thinking upon which it depends may be less familiar to English readers, if not profoundly skilled in music, it has been thought proper to give a more familiar, though less comprehensive, explanation of the manner in which transposition may be executed.\n\nIt will easily occur to every reader, that if each of the intervals through the whole diatonic series were equal, in a mathematical sense, it would be absolutely indifferent upon what note any air were begun, if within the compass of the gamut; because the same equal intervals must always have the same effects. But since, besides the natural semitones, there is another distinction of diatonic intervals into greater and lesser tones; and since these vary their positions in the series of an octave, according as the note from whence you begin is placed, that note is consequently the best key for any tune whose natural series is most exactly correspondent with the intervals which that melody or harmony requires. But in instruments whose scales are fixed, notwithstanding the temperament and other expedients of the same kind, such a series is far from being easily found, and is indeed in common practice almost totally neglected. All that can frequently be done is, to take care that the ear may not be sensibly shocked. This, however, would be the case, if, in transposing any tune, the situation of the semitones, whether natural or artificial, were not exactly correspondent in the series to which your air must be transposed, with their positions in the scale from which you transpose it. Suppose, for instance, your air should begin upon C, requiring the natural diatonic series through the whole gamut, in which the distance between E and F, as also that between B and C, is only a semitone. Again, suppose it necessary for your voice, or the instrument on which you play, that the same air should be transposed to G, a fifth above its former key; then because in the first series the intervals between the third and the fourth, seventh and eighth notes, are no more than semitones, the same intervals must take the same place in the octave to which you transpose. Now, from G, the note with which you propose to begin, the three tones immediately succeeding are full; but the fourth C is only a semitone; it may therefore be kept in its place. But from F, the seventh note above, to G, the eighth, the interval is a full tone, which must consequently be redressed by raising the F a semitone higher. Thus the situations of the semitonic intervals in both octaves will be correspondent; and thus, by conforming the positions of the semitones in the octave to which you transpose, with those in the octave in which the original key of the tune is contained, you will perform your operation with as much success as the nature of fixed scales can admit.\n\nThe order to be observed in these alterations of the intervals, is deduced from the relation which the fifth ascending and descending bear to the fundamental (art. 34, 35); and therefore the farther we depart from the natural fundamental C by a series of fifths ascending or descending, the alterations, and consequently the number of sharps or flats indicating them, will be the greater.\n\nThus if G, which is the perfect fifth ascending from C, therefore the note most nearly allied to C (art. 39, 40),\nPart II.\n\nMUSIC\n\nB, G must be changed into C, and E into A. Thus, by transposition, the air has the same melody as if it were in the major mode of C, or in the minor mode of A. The major mode then of G, and the minor of E, are by transposition reduced to those of C major, and of A minor. It is the same case with all the other modes (\u00a7 e).\n\nAll the modes reducible to the major of C and the minor of A.\n\nChap. XIII. To find the Fundamental Basis of a given Modulation.\n\n238. As we have reduced to a very small number the rules of the fundamental basis, and those which in the treble ought to be observed with relation to this basis, given air not difficult, and why.\n\nbe taken for a fundamental, F, which is the seventh of the scale of G, must be made sharp, that it may be a whole tone from the fifth E, and only a semitone from the key note G, according to the laws of the diatonic scale (art. 77.). See Ex. xciv. 1. 2.\n\nAgain, if D, the perfect fifth ascending from G, and the second in the series of progressive fifths ascending from C, be used as a fundamental, C, which is the seventh of the scale of D, must, to render it the feasible or leading note (art. 77.), be made sharp in addition to F; so that in the scale of D, there are two sharps, F and C. See Ex. xciv. (3.).\n\nIf A, the perfect fifth above D, and the third in the series of fifths ascending from C, be the fundamental, the seventh G must, in addition to F and C, be made sharp, for the same reason (4.); and so on, in the scale of E, which is next in order, F, C, G, and D, must be sharp (5.): in that of B, the sharps must be F, C, G, D and A (6.).\n\nThe perfect fifth above B is F\u266f, and in that scale F, C, G, D, A, and E, must be sharp (7.). And in the next scale C\u266d all the notes of the system are sharp (8.).\n\nThis, for the reasons mentioned in the note (\u00a7 b), is the last scale to which we can properly go by the progressions of fifths ascending.\n\nReturning to the natural scale of C, if, instead of assuming G, the perfect fifth above, for a fundamental, we take F, the perfect fifth below; B, which is the fourth note above F, and forms a tritone or sharp fourth to it, must, to become a perfect fourth, according to the laws of the diatonic scale, (art. 6c.) be made flat (12.).\n\nProceeding with the series of fifths descending, if Eb, which is the perfect fifth below F, be taken for a fundamental; E, which, in its natural state, is the tritone or sharp fourth to B\u266d, must, to become the diatonic fourth (art. 6c.), also be rendered flat (11.).\n\nIf Eb, which is the perfect fifth below B\u266d, and the third in the series of fifths descending from C, be made the fundamental, A, the sharp fourth, must, to become the diatonic fourth, be made flat, and the flats marked at the cleft are B, E and A (10.).\n\nTo form the next scale in the series of fifths descending, which is that of A flat, D must be flattened; and B, E, A, and D, are marked flat at the cleft (9.).\n\nThe next scale, that of D flat, is formed by flattening G, and adding its flat to the others at the cleft (8.).\n\nThis is the scale recommended to be used rather than that of C\u266f. (See note \u00a7 b.)\n\nWe do not proceed farther with the series of fifths descending, since the next scale, that of G\u266d, would just or very nearly exhibit the sounds already represented by the scale of F\u266f (7.). This scale is, however, sometimes written in the key of G flat, and we even meet with the scale of its fifth below, C flat, and, with an occasional modulation from that key into its fifth below, F flat, where B being necessarily twice flattened, is distinguished by this character \u266d, or \u266f\u266d, called a double flat.\n\nWe have thus seen, first, that each of the notes of the diatonic scale of C, and each of the semitones into which the whole tones of that scale are divided, may be taken for the fundamental note of a diatonic scale, called the scale of that note. Secondly, that the notes of the natural scale are more or less altered, as the note assumed for a fundamental is more or less distant from C, in a progression of fifths ascending or descending. Thirdly, that in the progression by fifths ascending, the notes are altered by sharps, and in the progression by fifths descending, the alterations are by flats. Fourthly, that in the alteration by sharps, the last sharp is always on the seventh or feasible note of the scale; and where there are more than one, is always on the fifth above the sharp immediately preceding; and in the alteration by flats, the last flat is always on the fourth of the scale; and where there are more than one, is always on the fifth below the flat immediately preceding.\n\nThe signatures of sharps and flats at the clefs, belonging to the twelve major scales, are also used for their relative minor scales. The occasional elevation and depression of the sixths and sevenths of the minor scales, are denoted by occasional sharps or flats placed before these notes.\n\n(\u00a7 e) Many musicians, and amongst others the ancient musicians of France, as Lulli, Campra, &c., place one flat less in the minor mode: so that in the minor mode of D, they place neither sharp nor flat at the cleft; in the minor mode of G, one flat only; in the minor mode of C, two flats, &c.\n\nThis practice in itself is sufficiently indifferent, and scarcely merits the trouble of a dispute. Yet the method which we have here described, according to M. Rameau, has the advantage of reducing all the modes to two; and besides it is founded upon this simple and very general rule, That in the major mode, we must place as many sharps or flats at the cleft, as are contained in the diatonic scale of that mode in ascending; and in the minor mode, as many as are contained in that same scale in descending.\nMusical Composition\n\nIt should no longer be difficult to find the fundamental bass of a given modulation, nay, frequently to find several; for every fundamental bass will be legitimate, when it is formed according to the rules which we have given (chap. vi.) and that, besides this, the dissonances which the modulation may form with this bass, will both be prepared, if it is necessary that they should be so, and always resolved.\n\n239. It is of the greatest utility in searching for the fundamental bass, to know what is the tone or mode of the melody to which that bass should correspond. But it is difficult in this matter to assign general rules, and such as are absolutely without exception, in which nothing may be left that appears indifferent or discretionary; because sometimes we seem to have the free choice of referring a particular melody either to one mode or another. For example, this melody G C may belong to all the modes, as well major as minor, in which G and C are found together; and each of these two sounds may even be considered as belonging to a different mode.\n\n240. We may sometimes, as it should seem, operate without the knowledge of the mode, for two reasons:\n\n1. Because, since the same sound belongs to several different modes, the mode is sometimes considerably undetermined; above all, in the middle of a piece, and during the time of one or two bars.\n\n2. Without giving ourselves much trouble about the mode, it is often sufficient to preserve us from deviating in composition, if we observe in the simplest manner the rules above prescribed (chap. vi.) for the procedure of the fundamental bass.\n\n241. In the mean time, it is above all things necessary to know in what mode we operate at the beginning of the piece, because it is indissoluble that the fundamental bass should begin in the same mode, and that the treble and bass should likewise end in it; nay, that they should even terminate in its fundamental note, which in the mode of C is C, and A in that of A, &c. Besides, in those passages of the modulation where there is a cadence, it is generally necessary that the mode of the fundamental bass should be the same with that of the part to which it corresponds.\n\n242. To know upon what mode or in what key a piece commences, our inquiry may be entirely reduced to distinguish the major mode of C from the minor of A. For we have already seen (art. 236. and 237.), that all the modes may be reduced to these two, at least in the beginning of the piece. We shall now therefore give a detail of the different means by which these two modes may be distinguished.\n\n1. From the principal and characteristic sounds of the mode, which are C E G in the one, and A C E in the other; so that if a piece should, for instance, begin thus, A C E A, it may be almost constantly concluded, that the tone or mode is in A minor, although the notes A C E belong to the mode of C.\n\n2. From the sensible note, which is B in the one, and G in the other; so that if G appears in the first bars of a piece, we may be certain that we are in the mode of A.\n\n3. From the adjuncts of the mode, that is to say, the modes of its two-fifths, which for C are F and G, and D and E for A. For example, if after having begun a melody by some of the notes which are common to the modes of C and of A (as E D E F E D C B C), we should afterwards find the mode of G, which we ascertain by the F, or that of F which we ascertain by the Bb or C#, we may conclude that we have begun in the mode of C; but if we find the mode of D, or that of E, which we ascertain by Bb, C#, or D#, we conclude from thence that we have begun in the mode of A.\n\n4. A mode is not usually changed, especially in the beginning of a piece, unless in order to pass into one or other of the modes most relative to it, which are the mode of its fifth above, and that of its third below, if it be minor. Thus, for instance, the modes which are most intimately relative to the major mode of C, are the major mode of G, and that of A minor. From the mode of C we commonly pass either into the one or the other of these modes; so that we may sometimes judge of the principal mode in which we are, by the relative mode which follows it, or which goes before it, when these relative modes are decisively marked. Besides these two relative modes, there are likewise two others into which the principal mode may pass, but less frequently, viz. the mode of its fifth below, and that of its third above, as F and E for the mode of C (5 g).\n\n5. The modes may still be likewise distinguished by the cadences of the melody. These cadences ought to occur at the end of every two, or at most of every four bars, as in the fundamental bass: now the note of the fundamental bass which is most suitable to these cadences,\n\n(5 f) We often say, that we are upon a particular key or scale, instead of saying that we are in a particular mode. The following expressions therefore are synonymous; such a piece is in C major, or in the mode of C major, or in the key of C major, or in the scale of C major.\n\n(5 g) It is certain that the minor mode of E has an extremely natural connection with the mode of C, as has been proven (art. 92.) both by arguments and by examples. It has likewise appeared in the note upon the art. 93., that the minor mode of D may be joined to the major mode of C: and thus in a particular sense, this mode may be considered as relative to the mode of C, but it is still less so than the major modes of G and F, or than those of A and E minor; because we cannot immediately, and without licence, pass in a fundamental bass from the perfect minor chord of C to the perfect minor chord of D; and if you pass immediately from the major mode of C to the minor mode of D in a fundamental bass, it is by passing, for instance, from the tonic C, or from E G C, to the tonic dominant of D, carrying the chord A C E G, in which there are two sounds, E G, which are found in the preceding chord, (Ex. xcvi.) or otherwise from C E G C to G Bb D E, a chord of the sub-dominant in the minor mode of D, which chord has likewise two sounds, G and E, in common with that which went immediately before it. See Ex. xcvi.\ncloves*, is always easy to be found. For the sounds which occur in the treble, M. Rameau may be consulted, p. 54. of his Nouveau Syst\u00e8me de Musique th\u00e9orique et pratique (5H).\n\nWhen the mode is ascertained, by the different means which we have pointed out, the fundamental bas will cost little pains. For in each mode there are three fundamental sounds.\n\n1. The tonic of the mode, or its principal sound, which carries always the perfect chord major or minor, according as the mode itself is major or minor.\n\nMajor mode of C, C E G 'c'.\n\nMinor mode of A, A C E A.\n\n2. The tonic dominant, which is a fifth above the tonic, and which, whether in the major or minor mode, always carries a chord of the seventh, composed of a third major followed by two thirds minor.\n\nTonic dominant.\n\nMajor mode of C, G B D 'f'.\n\nMinor mode of A, E G B 'd'.\n\n3. The sub-dominant, which is a fifth below the tonic, and which carries a chord composed of a third, fifth, and sixth major, the third being either greater or lesser, according as the mode is major or minor.\n\nSub-dominant.\n\nMajor mode of C, F A C 'd'.\n\nMinor mode of A, D F A B.\n\nThese three sounds, the tonic, the tonic dominant, and the sub-dominant, contain in their chords all the notes which enter into the scale of the mode; so that when a melody is given, it may almost always be found which of these three sounds should be placed in the fundamental bas, under any particular note of the upper part. Yet it sometimes happens that not one of these notes can be used. For example, let it be supposed that we are in the mode of C, and that we find in the melody these two notes A B in succession; if we confine ourselves to place in the fundamental bas one of the three sounds C G F, we shall find nothing for the sounds A and B but this fundamental bas F G; now such a succession as F to G is prohibited by the fifth rule for the fundamental bas according to which every sub-dominant, as F, should rise by a fifth; so that F can only be followed by C in the fundamental bas, and not by G.\n\nTo remedy this, the chord of the sub-dominant F A C 'd' must be inverted into a fundamental chord of the seventh, in this manner, D F A 'c', which has been called the double employment (art. 105.) because it is a secondary manner of employing the chord of the sub-dominant. By these means we give to the modulation A B this fundamental bas D G; which procedure is agreeable to rules. See Ex. xcvi.\n\nHere then are four chords, C E G 'c', G B D 'f', F A C 'd', D F A 'c', which may be employed in the major mode of C. We shall find in like manner, for the minor mode of A, four chords.\n\nA C 'e' a', E G B 'd',\nD F A B, B D 'f' a'.\n\nAnd in this mode we sometimes change the last of these chords into B D 'f' a', substituting the 'f' for 'f'. For instance, if we have this melody in the minor mode of A, E F G A, we would cause the first note E to carry the perfect chord A C E A; the second note F to carry the chord of the seventh B D F A; the third note G, the chord of the tonic dominant E G B D, and the last the perfect chord A C E A. See Ex. xcviii.\n\nOn the contrary, if this melody is given always in the minor mode, A A G A, the second A being syncopated, it might have the same bas as the modulation E F G A, with this difference alone, that F might be substituted for F in the chord B D F A, the better to mark out the minor mode. See Exam. xcix.\n\nBesides these chords which we have just mentioned, and which may be regarded as the principal chords of the mode, there are still a great many others; for example, the series of dominants,\n\nC A D G C F B E A D G C,\n\nwhich are terminated equally in the tonic C, either entirely belong, or at least may be reckoned as belonging (5I) to the mode of C; because none of these dominants are tonic dominants, except G, which is the tonic dominant of the mode of C; and besides, because the chord of each of these dominants forms no other\n\n(5H) All these different manners of distinguishing the modes ought, if we may speak so, to give mutual light and assistance one to the other. But it often happens, that one of these signs alone is not sufficient to determine the mode, and may even lead to error. For example, if a piece of music begins with these three notes, E C G, we must not with too much precipitation conclude from thence that we are in the major mode of C, although these three sounds, E C G, be the principal and characteristical sounds in the major mode of C: we may be in the minor mode of E, especially if the note E should be long.\n\n(5I) I have said, that they may be reckoned as belonging to this mode, for two reasons: 1. Because, properly speaking, there are only three chords which essentially and primitively belong to the mode of C, viz. C carrying the perfect chord, F carrying that of the sub-dominant, and G that of the tonic dominant, to which we may join the chord of the seventh, D F A C (art. 105.): but we here regard as extended the series of dominants in question, as belonging to the mode of C, because it preserves in the ear the impression of that mode. 2. In a series of dominants, there are a great many of them which likewise belong to other modes; for instance, the simple dominant A belongs naturally to the mode of G, the simple dominant B to that of A, &c. Thus it is only improperly, and by way of extension, as I have already said, that we regard here these dominants as belonging to the mode of C.\nother sounds than such as belong to the scale of C. See Ex. c.\n\nBut if we were to form this fundamental bass,\n\n\\[ \\text{C A D G Bb C} \\]\n\nconsidering the last C as a tonic dominant in this manner, C E G Bb; the mode would then be changed at the second C, and we should enter into the mode of F, because the chord C E G Bb indicates the tonic dominant of the mode of F; besides, it is evident that the mode is changed, because Bb does not belong to the scale of C. See Ex. c1.\n\nIn the same manner, were we to form this fundamental bass\n\n\\[ \\text{C A D G C} \\]\n\nconsidering the last C as a sub-dominant in this manner, C E G A; this last C would indicate the mode of G, of which C is the sub-dominant. See Ex. cii.\n\nIn like manner, still, if in the first series of dominants, we caused the first D to carry the third major, in this manner, D F X A c', this D having become a tonic dominant, would signify to us the major mode of G, and the G which should follow it, carrying the chord B D f', would relapse into the mode of C, from whence we had departed. See Ex. ciii.\n\nFinally, in the same manner, if in this series of dominants, we should cause B to carry F X in this manner, B D F X A, this F would show that we had departed from the mode C, to enter into that of G. See Ex. civ.\n\nHence it is easy to form this rule for discovering the changes of mode in the fundamental bass.\n\n1. When we find a tonic in the fundamental bass, we are in the mode of that tonic; and the mode is major or minor, according as the perfect chord is major or minor.\n\n2. When we find a sub-dominant, we are in the mode of the fifth above that sub-dominant; and the mode is major or minor, according as the third in the chord of the sub-dominant is major or minor.\n\n3. When we find a tonic dominant, we are in the mode of the fifth below that tonic dominant. As the tonic dominant carries always the third major, it cannot be ascertained from this dominant alone, whether the mode be major or minor; but it is only necessary to examine the following note, which must be the tonic of the mode in which he is; by the third of this tonic it will be discovered whether the mode be major or minor.\n\n243. Every change of the mode supposes a cadence; and when the mode changes in the fundamental bass, it is almost always either after the tonic of the mode in which we have been, or after the tonic dominant of that mode, considered then as a tonic by favour of a close which ought necessarily to be found in that place; Whence it happens that cadences in a melody for the most part preface a change of mode which ought to follow them.\n\n244. All these rules, joined with the table of modes which we have given (art. 234.), will serve to discover in what mode we are in the middle of a piece, especially in the most essential passages, as cadences (5 k).\n\nCHAP. XIV. Of the Chromatic and Enharmonic.\n\n245. We call that melody chromatic which is composed of several notes in succession, whether rising or what descending by semitones. See cv. and cvi.\n\n246. When an air is chromatic in descending, the most natural and ordinary fundamental bass is a concatenated series of tonic dominants; all of which follow one another in descending by a fifth, or which is the same thing, in rising by a fourth. See Ex. cv. fundamental basses (5 l).\n\n247. What.\n\n(5 k) Two modes are so much more intimately relative, as they contain a greater number of sounds common to both; for example, the minor mode of C and the major of G, or the major mode of C and the minor of A; on the contrary, two modes are less intimately relative as the number of sounds which they contain as common to both is smaller; for instance, the major mode of C and the minor of B, &c.\n\nWhen the composer, led away by the current of the modulation, that is to say, by the manner in which the fundamental bass is constituted, into a mode remote from that in which the piece was begun, he ought to continue in it but for a short time, because the ear is always impatient to return to the former mode.\n\n(5 l) We may likewise give to a chromatic melody in descending, a fundamental bass, into which may enter chords of the seventh and of the diminished seventh, which may succeed one another by the intervals of a false fifth and a fifth redundant: thus in the Example cvii., where the continued bass descends chromatically, it may easily be seen that the fundamental bass carries successively the chords of the seventh and of the seventh diminished, and that in this bass there is a false fifth from D to G X, and a fifth redundant from G X to C.\n\nThe reason of this licence is, as it appears to us, because the chord of the diminished seventh may be considered as representing (art. 221.) the chord of the tonic dominant; in such a manner that this fundamental bass\n\n\\[ \\text{A D G X C F X B E A} \\]\n\n(see Example cviii.) may be considered as representing (art. 116.) that which is written below,\n\n\\[ \\text{A D E C F X B E A} \\]\n\nNow this last fundamental bass is formed according to the common rules, unless that there is a broken cadence from D to E, and an interrupted cadence from E to C, which are licenses (art. 213 and 214.).\nMusic.\n\nPlate CCCLIV.\n\nFig. 1.

When the air is chromatic in ascending, one may form a fundamental bass by a series of tones and of tonic dominants, which succeed one another alternately by the interval of a third in descending, and of a fourth in ascending. (See Ex. cvi.) There are many other ways of forming a chromatic air, whether in rising or descending; but these details in an elementary essay are by no means necessary.\n\n248. The enharmonic is very rarely put in practice; and we have explained its formation in the first book, to which we refer our readers.\n\nSee Design.\n\nChap. XV. Of Design, Imitation, and Fugue.\n\nDesign, what.\n\n249. In music, the name of design, or subject, is generally given to a particular air or melody, which the composer intends should prevail through the piece; whether it is intended to express the meaning of words to which it may be set, or merely inspired by the impulse of taste and fancy. In this last case, design is distinguished into imitation and fugue.\n\nSee Imitation.\n\nImitation, what.\n\n250. Imitation consists in causing to be repeated the melody of one or of several measures in one single part, or in the whole harmony, and in any of the various modes that may be chosen. When all the parts absolutely repeat the same air or melody, and beginning one after the other, this is called a canon (5 m).\n\nFugue consists in alternately repeating that air in the treble, and in the bass, or even in all the parts, if there are more than two.\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\n\n(5 m) Compositions in strict canon, where one part begins with a certain subject, and the other parts are bound to repeat the very same subject, or the reply, as it is called, in the unison, fifth, fourth, or octave, depend on the following rules, which are nothing more than a summary of the system explained by our author:\n\n1. The chords to be employed are the tonic, and its two adjuncts; the subdominant, susceptible of an added sixth, and the dominant, susceptible of an added seventh.\n\n2. The subject must begin in the harmony of the tonic, and as the fundamental progression from the dominant to the subdominant is not permitted (art. 33-36.), the subdominant must follow the tonic, and the dominant the subdominant, thus,\n\n\\[ C, \\frac{6}{5} F, \\frac{7}{6} G, C, \\frac{6}{5} F, \\frac{7}{6} G, C, \\&c. \\]\n\n3. As the diatonic scale consists of two tetrachords, of which the first is also the second tetrachord of the mode of the sub-dominant, and the second the first tetrachord of the dominant; so, in canon, when the reply is meant to be in the mode of the dominant, the subject must be in the first tetrachord of the tonic, by which means the corresponding first tetrachord of the dominant being the second tetrachord of the tonic, the whole piece is true in that mode. On the other hand, if the reply is to be in the mode of the sub-dominant, the subject must be in the second tetrachord of the tonic, the corresponding tetrachord of the sub-dominant being the first tetrachord of the tonic, and the mode of the tonic being thus preserved.\n\n4. For the same reason, where the reply is in the dominant, the subject is only allowed to modulate into the mode of the sub-dominant, and the reply of course into that of the tonic. And where the reply is in the dominant, the subject is to modulate only into the mode of the sub-dominant, the reply following of course into that of the tonic. Were the contrary modulation permitted, the reply would depart too far from the mode of the tonic.\n\nLastly, when the reply is to be in the mode of the dominant it must commence in the measure bearing that harmony; and in the same way, the reply in the sub-dominant must begin in the measure which bears the harmony of the sub-dominant.\n\nIf these rules be observed, and due attention paid to the preparation and resolution of dissonances, composition in strict canon, in any number of parts, will be found to be by no means difficult. See Ex. cix. and cx.\n\n(5 n) Yet there may be two fifths in succession, provided the parts move in contrary directions, or, in other words, if the progress of one part be ascending, and the other descending; but in this case they are not properly two fifths, they are a fifth and a twelfth; for example, if one of the parts in descending should found F D, and the other 'c a' in rising, C is the fifth of F, and 'a' the twelfth of D.","sp":150,"ep":175},{"h":"REMARK II","t":"197. We must avoid, as much as we can, syncopations in the fundamental bass; that the ear may accurately distinguish the primarily accented part of a measure, by means of a harmony different from that which it had before perceived in the last unaccented part of the bass by the preceding measure. Nevertheless, syncopation may be sometimes admitted in the fundamental bass, but it is by a license (3y).\n\n(3t) In this chord it is necessary that the C and F should be sharp at the same time; for the chord D F A C#, in which C would be sharp without the F, is excluded by art. 179.\n\n(3u) When the bass rises or descends from one tonic to another by the interval of a third, the mode is commonly changed; that is to say, from a major it becomes a minor. For instance, if we ascend from the tonic C to the tonic E, the major mode of C, C E G C, will be changed into the minor mode of E, E G B E. We must never ascend from one tonic to another, when there is no sound common to both their modes: for example, we cannot rise from the mode of C, C E G C, to the minor mode of Eb, Eb Gb Bb Eb (91.).\n\n(3x) Thus all the intervals, viz. the third, the fifth, and second, may be admitted in the fundamental bass, except that of a second in descending. The rules now given for the fundamental bass are not, however, without exception, as approved compositions in music will certainly discover; but these exceptions being in reality licences, and for the most part in opposition to the great principle of connection, which prescribes that there should be at least one note in common between a preceding and a subsequent chord, it does not seem necessary to enter into a minute detail of these licences in an elementary work, where the first and most essential rules of the art alone ought to be expected.\n\n(3y) There are notes which may be found several times in the fundamental bass in succession with a different\nCHAP. VII. Of the Rules which ought to be observed in the Treble with relation to the Fundamental Bafs.\n\n198. The treble is nothing else but a modulation above the fundamental bafs, and whole notes are found in the chords of that bafs which corresponds with it (189.) Thus in Ex. xvi. the scale C D E F G A B C, is a treble with respect to the fundamental bafs C G C F C D G C.\n\n199. We are about to give the rules for the treble; but first we think it necessary to make the two following remarks.\n\n1. It is obvious, that many notes of the treble may answer to one and the same note in the fundamental bafs, when these notes belong to the chord of the same note in the fundamental bafs. For example, this modulation C E G E C, may have for its fundamental bafs the note C alone, because the chord of that note comprehends the sounds C, E, G, which are found in the treble.\n\n2. In like manner, a single note in the treble may, for the same reason, answer to several notes in the bafs. For instance, G alone may answer to these three notes in the bafs, C G C (32).\n\nRULE I. For the TREBLE.\n\n200. If the note which forms the seventh in a chord of the simple dominant, is found in the treble, the note which precedes it must be the very same. This is what we call a disjunct prepared (122). For instance, let us suppose that the note of the fundamental bafs shall be D, bearing the chord of the simple dominant D F A C; and that this C, which (art. 18. and 118.) is the dissonance, should be found in the treble; it is necessary that the note which goes before it in the treble should likewise be a C.\n\n201. According to the rules which we have given for the fundamental bafs, C will always be found in the chord of that note in the fundamental bafs which precedes the simple dominant D. See XLVIII., XLIX., L. In the first example the dissonance is C, in the second G, and in the third E; and these notes are already in the preceding chord (4A).","sp":143,"ep":144},{"h":"RULE II","t":"If a note of the fundamental bass be a tonic, and descend by a fifth or a third upon another note, this second note may be either a tonic (34. & 91.) see Exam. xxv. and xxvi.; or a tonic dominant, or a simple dominant, yet in such a manner that the rule of art. 192. may be observed (124.), see xxvii. xxviii. xxix. and xxx.; or a sub-dominant (124.), see xxxi. and xxxii.\n\nThe succession of the bass C Eb G C, FACE, is excluded by art. 192.","sp":143,"ep":143},{"h":"RULE II","t":"202. If a note of the fundamental bafs be a tonic dominant, or a simple dominant, and if the dissonance be found in the treble, this dissonance in the same treble ought to descend diatonically. But if the note of the bafs be a sub-dominant, it ought to rise diatonically. This dissonance, which rises or descends diatonically, is what we have called a dissonance saved or resolved (129, 130.) See LII., LIII., LIV.\n\n203. According to the rules for the fundamental bafs which we have given, the note upon which the dissonance\n\nferent harmony. For instance, the tonic C, after having carried the chord C E G C, may be followed by another C which carries the chord of the seventh, provided that this chord be the chord of the tonic dominant C E G Bb. In the same manner, the tonic C may be followed by the same tonic C, which may be rendered a sub-dominant, by causing it to carry the chord C E G A.\n\nA dominant, whether tonic or simple, sometimes descends or rises to another by the interval of a tritone or false fifth. For example, the dominant F carrying the chord F A C E, may be followed by another dominant B carrying the chord B D F A. This is a licence in which the musician indulges himself, that he may not be obliged to depart from the scale in which he is; for instance, from the scale of C to which F and B belong. If one should descend from F to Bb by the interval of a just fifth, he would then depart from that scale, because Bb is no part of it.\n\n(32) There are often in the treble several notes which may, if we choose, carry no chord, and be regarded merely as notes of passage, serving only to connect between themselves the notes that do carry chords, and to form a more agreeable modulation. These notes of passage are commonly quavers. See Example XLVII. (Plate CCCLVIII.), in which this modulation C D E F G, may be regarded as equivalent to this other, C E G, as D and F are no more than notes of passage. So that the bafs of this modulation may be simply C G.\n\nWhen the notes are of equal duration, and arranged in a diatonic order, the notes which are accented ought each of them to carry chords. Those which are unaccented, are mere notes of passage. Sometimes, however, the unaccented note may be made to carry harmony; but the duration of this note is then commonly increased by a point placed after it, which proportionally diminishes the continuance of the accented note, and makes it pass more swiftly.\n\nWhen the notes do not move diatonically, they ought generally all of them to enter into the chord which is placed in the lower part correspondent with these notes.\n\n(4A) There is, however, one case in which the seventh of a simple dominant may be found in a modulation without being prepared. It is when, having already employed that dominant in the fundamental bafs, its seventh is afterwards heard in the modulation, while the dominant is still retained. For instance, let us imagine this modulation,\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{c|c}\nC & D C B C \\\\\n\\hline\nD & GC G\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nand this fundamental bafs,\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{c|c}\nC & D C B C \\\\\n\\hline\nD & GC G\n\\end{array} \\]\n\n(see example LI.); the D of the fundamental bafs answers to the two notes D C of the treble. The dissonance C has no need of preparation, because the note D of the fundamental bafs having already been employed for the D which precedes C, the dissonance C is afterwards presented, below which the chord D may be preserved, or D F A C.\nPart II.","sp":144,"ep":145},{"h":"RULE II","t":"211. Every note carrying the chord of the tritone should descend diatonically upon the subsequent note. Thus in the same example LXVI. F, which carries the chord of the tritone figured with a 4t, descends diatonically upon E (art. 202.)","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"RULE III","t":"If a note in the fundamental bass be a tonic, and rise by a second to another note, that note ought to be a tonic dominant, or a simple dominant (101. & 102.).

The transition from a tonic dominant to a perfect and tonic is called an absolute repose, or a perfect cadence imperfect (73.); and the transition from a sub-dominant to a cadences, tonic is called an imperfect or irregular cadence (73.) how ever the tonic falls upon the accented part of the bar. See employed.\n\nXLIII. XLIV. XLV. XLVI.","sp":143,"ep":143},{"h":"RULE III","t":"212. The chord of the second is commonly put in practice upon notes which are syncopated in descending order, because this order is the most agreeable of all. We must therefore endeavour to preserve it as much as possible. It is for this reason that the continued bass in Example LXV. is much more in the taste of singing, and more agreeable, than the fundamental bass which answers to it.\n\n(4 t) The continued bass being a kind of treble with relation to the fundamental bass, it ought to observe the same rules with respect to that bass as the treble. Thus a note, for instance D, carrying a chord of the seventh DFAC, to which the chord of the sub-dominant F A C D corresponds in the fundamental bass, ought to rise diatonically upon E, (art. 129. No. 1. and art. 202.)\n\n(4 k) When there is a rebele in the treble, the note of the continued bass ought to be the same with that of the fundamental bass, (see Example LXXIII.) In the places which are found in the treble at D and C (measures second and fourth), the notes in the fundamental and continued bass are the same, viz. G for the first cadence, and C for the second. This rule ought above all to be observed in cadences which terminate a piece or a modulation.\n\nIt is necessary, as much as possible, to prevent coincidences of the same notes in the treble and continued bass, unless the motion of the continued bass should be contrary to that of the treble. For example, in the first note of the second measure in Example LXXIX. D is found at the same time in the continued bass and in the treble; but the treble rises from C to D, and from D to E, whilst the bass descends from E to D, and from D to C.\n\nTwo octaves, or two fifths, in succession, must likewise be avoided. For instance, in the treble sounds G E, the bass must be prevented from sounding G E, C A, or D B; because in the first case there are two octaves in succession, E against E, and G against G; and because in the second case there are two fifths in succession, C against E, and A against G, or D against G, and B against E. This rule, as well as the preceding, is founded upon this principle, that the continued bass ought not to be a copy of the treble, but to form a different melody.\n\nEvery time that several notes of the continued bass answer to one note alone of the fundamental, the composer satisfies himself with figuring the first of them. Nay he does not even figure it if it be a tonic; and he draws above the others a line, continued from the note upon which the chord is formed. See Example LXX. (Plate CCCLIX.), where the fundamental bass C gives the continued bass C E G E; the two E's ought in this bass to carry the chord 6, and G the chord 3; but as these chords are comprehended in the perfect chord C E G C, which is the first of the continued bass, we place nothing above C, only we draw a line over C E G E.\n\nIn like manner, in the second measure of the same example, the notes F and D of the continued bass, arising from the note G alone of the fundamental bass which carries the chord G B D F, we think it sufficient to figure F only, and to draw a line above F and D because the same harmony is used with both.\n\nIt should be remarked, that this F ought naturally to descend to E; but this note is considered as subsisting so long as the chord subsists; and when the chord changes, we ought necessarily to find the E, as may be seen by that example.\n\nIn general, whilst the same chord subsists in passing through different notes, the chord is reckoned the same as if the first note of the chord had subsisted; in such a manner, that, if the first note of the chord is, for instance, the sensible note, we ought to find the tonic when the chord changes. See Example LXXI. where this continued bass, C B D B G C, is reckoned the same with this C, B C. (Example LXXII.)\n\nIf a single note of the continued bass answers to several notes of the fundamental bass, it is figured with the different chords which agree to it. For example, the note G in a continued bass may answer to this fundamental bass C G C, (see Example LXXIII.) in this case, we may regard the note G as divided into three parts, of which the first carries the chord 6, the second the chord 7, and the third the chord 3.\n\nWe shall repeat here, with respect to the rules of the continued bass, what we have formerly said concerning the rules of the fundamental bass in the note upon the third rule, art. 193. The rules of the continued bass have exceptions, which practice and the perusal of good authors will teach. There are likewise several other rules which might require a considerable detail, and which will be found in the Treatise of Harmony, by M. Rameau, and\nOf Supposition.\n\n215. When a dominant is preceded by a tonic in the fundamental bass, we add sometimes, in the continued bass to the chord of that dominant, a new note which is a third or a fifth below; and the chord which results from it in this continued bass is called a chord by supposition.\n\nFor example, let us suppose, that in the fundamental bass we have a dominant G carrying the chord of the seventh G B D F; let us add to this chord the note C, which is a fifth below this dominant, and we shall have the total chord C G B D F, or C D F G, which is called a chord by supposition (4 m).\n\n216. Chords by supposition are of different kinds. For instance, the chord of the tonic dominant G B D F gives,\n\n1. By adding the fifth C, the chord C G B D F, called a chord of the seventh redundant, and composed of chords of a fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh. It is figured what, and with a \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\); see LXXVI. (4 n). This chord is not how figured, but upon the tonic. They sometimes leave out the sensible note, for reasons which we shall give in the note (4 o), upon the art. 219; it is then reduced to C F G D, and marked with \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\).\n\n2. By adding the third E, we shall have the chord E G B D F, called a chord of the ninth, and composed of a third, fifth, seventh, and ninth. And it is figured with a \\( \\frac{9}{8} \\). This third may be added to every third of the dominant. See LXXVII.\n\n3. If\n\nand elsewhere. These rules, which are proper for a complete dissertation, did not appear indispensably necessary in an elementary essay on music, such as the present. The books which we have quoted at the end of our preliminary discourse will more particularly instruct the reader concerning this practical detail.\n\n(4 l) One may sometimes, but very rarely, cause several tonics in succession to follow one another in ascending or descending diatonically, as C E G C, D F A D, Bb D F Bb; but, besides that this succession is harsh, it is necessary, in order to render it practicable, that the fifth below the first tonic should be found in the chord of the tonic following, as here F, a fifth below the first tonic C, is found in the chord D F A D, and in the chord Bb D F Bb (37, and note T).\n\n(4 m) Though supposition be a kind of license, yet it is in some measure founded on the experiment related in the note (s), where you may see that every principal or fundamental sound causes its twelfth and seventeenth major in descending to vibrate, whilst the twelfth and the seventeenth major ascending refund; which seems to authorize us in certain cases to join with the fundamental harmony this twelfth and seventeenth in descending; or, which is the same thing, the fifth or the third beneath the fundamental sound.\n\nEven without having recourse to this experiment, we may remark, that the note added beneath the fundamental sound, causes that very fundamental sound to be heard. For instance, C added beneath G, causes G to refund. Thus G is found in some measure to be implied at C.\n\nIf the third added beneath the fundamental sound be minor, for example, if to the chord G B D F, we add the third E, the supposition is then no longer founded on the experiment, which only gives the seventeenth major, or, what is the same thing, the third major beneath the fundamental sound. In this case the addition of the third minor must be considered as an extension of the rule, which in reality has no foundation in the chords emitted by a sonorous body, but is authorized by the sanction of the ear and by practical experiment.\n\n(4 n) Many musicians figure this chord with a \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\); M. Rameau supposes this \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\), and merely marks it to be the seventh redundant by a \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) or \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). But it may be said, how shall we distinguish this chord from the seventh major, which, as it would seem, ought to be marked with a \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)? M. Rameau answers, that there is no danger of mistake, because in the seventh major, as the seventh ought to be prepared, it is found in the preceding chord; and thus the sharp subsiding already in the preceding chord, it would be useless to repeat it.\n\nThus D G, according to M. Rameau, would indicate D F \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) A C, G B D F \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\). If we would change F \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) of the second chord into F \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\), it would then be necessary to write D G. In notes such as C, whose natural seventh is major, the figure \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) preceded or followed by a sharp will sufficiently serve to distinguish the chord of the seventh redundant C G B D F, from the simple chord of the seventh C E G B, which is marked with a \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) alone.\n\nAll this appears just and well founded.\n\n(4 o) Supposition introduces into a chord differences which were not in it before. For instance, if to the chord E G B D, we should add the note of supposition C descending by a third, it is plain that, besides the difference between E and D which was in the original chord, we have two new dissonances, C B, and C D; that is to say, the seventh and the ninth. These dissonances, like the others, ought to be prepared and resolved. They are prepared by being syncopated, and resolved by descending diatonically upon one of the consonances of the subsequent chord. The sensible note alone can be resolved in ascending; but it is even necessary that this sensible note should be in the chord of the tonic dominant. As to the dissonances which are found in the primitive chord, they should always follow the common rules. (See art. 202.)\n3. If to a chord of the simple dominant, as D F A C, we should add the fifth G, we would have the chord G D F A C, called a chord of the eleventh, and which is figured with a \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\). (See LXXXVIII.)\n\n**Observe.**\n\n217. When the dominant is not a tonic dominant, we often take away some notes from the chord. For example, let us suppose that there is in the fundamental bass this simple dominant E, carrying the chord E G B D; if there should be added the third C beneath, we shall have this chord of the continued bass C E G B D; but we suppress the seventh B, for reasons which shall be explained in the note upon art. 210. In this state the chord is simply composed of a third, fifth, and ninth, and is marked with a 9. See LXXXIX. (4 p).\n\n218. In the chord of the simple dominant, as D F A C, when the fifth G is added, we frequently obliterate the sounds F and A, that too great a number of dissonances may be avoided, which reduces the chord to G C D. This last is composed only of the fourth and the fifth. It is called a chord of the fourth, and it is figured with a 4 (4 Q). (See LXXX.)\n\n219. Sometimes we only remove the note A, and then the chord ought to be figured with \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) (4 R).\n\n220. Finally, in the minor mode, for example, in that of A, where the chord of the tonic dominant (109), is E G B D; if we add to this chord the third C below, we shall have E G B D, called the chord of the fifth redundant, and composed of a third, a fifth redundant, a seventh, and a ninth. It is figured as in LXXXI. (4 S)\n\n\u00a7 3. Of the Chord of the Diminished Seventh.\n\n221. In the minor mode, for instance, in that of A, E a fifth from A is the tonic dominant (109), and carries the chord E G B D, in which G is the sensible note. For this chord we sometimes substitute G B D F, Principles (116), all composed of minor thirds; and which has for its fundamental found the sensible note G. This chord is called a chord of the flat or diminished seventh, and is figured with a \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) in the fundamental bass, (see LXXXIV.); but it is always considered as representing the chord of the tonic dominant.\n\n222. This chord by inversion produces in the continued bass the following chords:\n\n1. The chord B D F G, composed of a third, false bass by this fifth, and sixth major. They call it the chord of the what, and sixth sensible and false fifth; and it is figured as in Exam. LXXXV. (Plate CCCLX).\n\n2. The chord D F G B, composed of a third, a tritone, and a sixth. It is called the chord of the tritone and third minor; and marked as in LXXXVI.\n\n3. The chord F G B D, composed of a second redundant, a tritone, and a sixth. It is called the chord of the second redundant, and figured as in LXXXVII. (4 T).\n\n223. Besides, since the chord G B D F represents the chord E G B D, it follows, that if we operate by supposition upon the first of these chords, it must be which they performed as one would perform it upon E G B D produce, that is to say, that it will be necessary to add to the what, and chord G B D F, the notes C or A, which are the third or fifth below E, and which will produce,\n\n1. By adding C, the chord C G B D F, composed of a fifth redundant, a seventh, a ninth, and eleventh, which is the octave of the fourth. It is called a chord of the fifth redundant and fourth, and marked as in LXXXVIII.\n\n2. By adding A, we shall have the chord A G B D F, composed of a seventh redundant, a ninth, an eleventh, and a thirteenth minor, which is the octave of the sixth minor. It is called the chord of the seventh redundant and fifth minor, and marked as in LXXXIX. It is of all chords the most harsh, and the most rarely practised (4 U).\n\n(4 P) Several musicians call this last chord the chord of the ninth; and that which, with M. Rameau, we have simply called a chord of the ninth, they term a chord of the ninth and seventh. This last chord they mark with a \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\); but the denomination and figure used by M. Rameau are more simple, and can lead to no error; because the chord of the ninth always includes the seventh, except in the cases of which we have already spoken.\n\n(4 Q) In England it is figured \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n(4 R) We often remove some dissonances from chords of supposition, either to soften the harshness of the chord, or to remove discords which cannot be prepared nor resolved. For instance, let us suppose, that in the continued bass the note C is preceded by the sensible note B carrying the chord of the false fifth, and that we should choose to form upon this note C the chord C E G B D, we must obliterate the seventh B, because in retaining it we should destroy the effect of the sensible note B, which ought to rise to C.\n\nIn the same manner, if to the harmony of a tonic dominant G B D F, one should add the note by supposition C, it is usual to retrench from this chord the sensible note B; because, as the D ought to descend diatonically to C, and the B to rise to it, the effect of the one would destroy that of the other. This above all takes place in the suspension, concerning which we shall presently treat.\n\n(4 S) Supposition produces what we call suspension; and which is almost the same thing. Suspension consists in retaining as many as possible of the sounds in a preceding chord, that they may be heard in the chord which succeeds. For instance, in Example LXXXII. the C bearing \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) is a supposition; but in Example LXXXIII. it is a suspension, because it suspends or retards the perfect chord C E G C which the ear expects after the tonic dominant G B D F.\n\n(4 T) The chord of the diminished seventh, and the three derived from it, are termed chords of substitution. They are in general harsh, and proper for imitating melancholy objects.\n\n(4 U) As the chord of the diminished seventh G B D F, and the chord of the tonic dominant E G B D, only differ...\n224. Sometimes in a treble, the dissonance which ought to have been resolved by descending diatonically upon the succeeding note, instead of descending, on the contrary rises diatonically; but in that case, the note upon which it ought to have descended must be found in some of the other parts. This license ought to be rarely practised.\n\nIn like manner, in a continued bass, the dissonance in a chord of the sub-dominant inverted, as A in the chord A C E G, inverted from C E G A, may sometimes descend diatonically instead of rising as it ought to do, art. 129. N\u00b0 2.; but in that case the note ought to be repeated in another part, that the dissonance may be there resolved in ascending.\n\n225. Sometimes likewise, to render a continued bass more agreeable by causing it to proceed diatonically, we place between two sounds of that bass a note which belongs to the chord of neither. See Example xcii., in which the fundamental bass G C produces the continued bass G A B G C, where A is added on account of the diatonic modulation. This A has a line drawn above it, to show its resolution by passing under the chord G B D F.\n\nIn the same manner, (see xciii.) this fundamental bass C F may produce the continued bass C D E C F,\n\nVol. XIV. Part II.\n\nwhere the note D, which is added, passes under the chord C E G C.\n\n226. As the continued bass alone appears in practical compositions, it becomes necessary to know how to find the fundamental bass when the continued bass is figured. This problem may be easily solved by the following rules.\n\n227. 1. Every note which has no figure in the continued bass, ought to be the same, and without a figure in the fundamental bass; it is either a tonic, or reckoned such (4 x).\n\n2. Every note which in the continued bass carries a 6, ought in the fundamental bass to give its third below not figured *, or its fifth below marked with a 7.* See Figured. We shall distinguish these two cases below. See l.vi. and the note (4 y).\n\n3. Every note carrying a 2 gives in the fundamental bass its fifth below not figured. See l.vii.\n\n4. Every note figured with a 7, or a 4, is the same in both basses, and with the same figure (4 y).\n\n5. Every note figured with a 2 gives in the fundamental bass the diatonic note above figured with a 7. See l.xiv. (4 z).\n\n6. Every note marked with a 4 gives in the fundamental bass its third above, figured with a 6. For example, this continued bass A B C gives this fundamental bass C G C; but in this case it is necessary that the note figured with a 6 should rise by a fifth, as we see here C rise to G.\n\n(4 z) A note figured with a 2, gives likewise sometimes in the fundamental bass its fourth above, figured with a 6; but it is necessary in that case that the note figured with a 6, may even here rise to a fifth. (See note 4 y.)\n\nThese variations in the fundamental bass, as well in the chord concerning which we now treat, as in the chord figured with a 7, and in two others which shall afterwards be mentioned (art. 228 and 229), are caused by a deficiency in the signs proper for the chord of the sub-dominant, and for the different arrangements by which it is inverted.\n\nM. l'Abb\u00e9 Ronsier, to redress this deficiency, had invented a new manner of figuring the continued bass. His method is most simple for those who know the fundamental bass. It consists in expressing each chord by only signifying the fundamental sound with that letter of the scale by which it is denominated, to which is joined a 7 or 4, or a 6, in order to mark all the discords. Thus the fundamental chord of the seventh D F A C is expressed by a D; and the same chord, when it is inverted from that of the sub-dominant F A C D, is characterized by F; the chord of the second C D F A, inverted from the dominant D F A C, is likewise represented by D; and the same chord C D F A, inverted from that of the sub-dominant F A C D, is signified by F; the case is\nmental bas the diatonic note above, figured with a 7. (See LVI.)\n\n7. Every note figured with a g gives its third below figured with a 7. (See LVIII.)\n\n8. Every note marked with a 6 gives the fifth below marked with a 7; (see IX.) and it is plain by art. 187. that in the chord of the seventh, of which we treat in these three last articles, the third ought to be major, and the seventh minor, this chord of the seventh being the chord of the tonic dominant. (See art. 102.)\n\n9. Every note marked with a 9 gives its third above figured with a 7. (See LXXVII. and LXXXIX.)\n\n10. Every note marked with a 5 gives the fifth above figured with a 7. (See LXXXVIII.)\n\n11. Every note marked with a 5, or with a +5, gives the third above figured with a 5. (See LXXXI.)\n\n12. Every note marked with a 5 gives a fifth above figured with a 7, or with a 5. (See LXXXVI.) It is the same case with the notes marked 4, 3, or 2: which shows a retrenchment, either in the complete chord of the eleventh, or in that of the seventh redundant.\n\n13. Every note marked with a 4 gives a fifth above figured with a 7, or a 5. (See LXXX.)\n\n14. Every note marked with a 5 gives the third minor below, figured with a 7. (See LXXXV.)\n\n15. Every note marked with a 5 gives the tritone above figured with a 7. (See LXXXVI.)\n\n16. Every note marked with a 5 gives the second redundant above, figured with a 7. (See LXXXVII.)\n\n17. Every note marked with a 5 gives the fifth redundant above, figured with a 7. (See LXXXVIII.)\n\n18. Every note marked with a 5 gives the seventh redundant above, figured with a 7. (See LXXXIX.) (5 A).","sp":146,"ep":150},{"h":"RULE IV","t":"194. Every simple or tonic dominant ought to descend by a fifth. In the first case, that is to say, when the dominant is simple, the note which follows can only be a dominant; in the second it may be any one; or, in other words, it may either be a tonic, a tonic dominant, a simple dominant, or a sub-dominant. It is necessary, however, that the conditions prescribed in the second rule should be observed, if it be a simple dominant.\n\nThis last reflection is necessary, as will presently be seen. For, let us assume the succession of the two chords A C E G, D F A C (see Exam. xvii.), this succession is by no means legitimate, though in the first dominant descends by a fifth; because the C which forms the dissonance in the second chord, and which belongs to a simple dominant, is not in the preceding chord. But the succession will be admissible, if, without meddling with the second chord, we take away the sharp carried by the C in the first; or if, without meddling with the first chord, we render C and F sharp in the second (3t); or, if we simply render the D of the second chord a tonic dominant, in causing it to carry F instead of F# (119, and 122).\n\nIt is likewise by the same rule that we ought to reject the succession of the two following chords,\n\nD F A C, G B D F#;\n\n(see Exam. xviii.).\n\nRULE V.\n\n195.

As the water is a\nresisting medium, and the bulk of the ship very con-\nsiderable, it thence follows that there is always a great\nresistance on her fore-part; and when this resistance\nbecomes sufficient to balance the moving force of the\nwind upon the sails, the ship attains her utmost degree\nof velocity, and her motion is no longer accelerated.\nThis velocity is different according to the different\nstrength of the wind; but the stronger the wind, the\ngreater resistance is made to the ship's passage through\nthe water; and hence, though the wind should blow\never so strong, there is also a limit to the velocity of the\nship; for the sails and ropes can bear but a certain force\nof air; and when the resistance on the fore-part becomes\nmore than equivalent to their strength, the velocity can\nbe no longer increased, and the rigging gives way.\n\nThe direction of a ship's motion depends on the po-\nsition of her sails with regard to the wind, combined\nwith the action of the rudder. The most natural di-\nrection of the ship is, when she runs directly before the\nwind, the sails are then disposed, so as to be at right\nangles thereto. But this is not always the case, both\non account of the variable nature of the winds, and the\nsituation of the intended port, or of intermediate head-\nlands or islands. When the wind therefore happens\nnot to be favourable, the sails are placed so as to make\nan oblique angle both with the direction of the ship and\nwith the wind; and the sails, together with the rudder,\nmust be managed in such a manner, that the direction\nof the ship may make an acute angle with that of the\nwind; and the ship making boards on different tacks,\nwill by this means arrive at the intended port.\n\nThe reason of the ship's motion in this case is, that\nthe water resists the tide more than the fore-part, and\nthat in the same proportion as her length exceeds her breadth. This proportion is so considerable, that\nthe ship continually flies off where the resistance is least,\nand that sometimes with great swiftness. In this way\nof sailing, however, there is a great limitation: for if\nthe angle made by the keel with the direction of the\nwind be too acute, the ship cannot be kept in that\nposition; neither is it possible for a large ship to make\na more acute angle with the wind than about 6\npoints; though small sloops, it is said, may make an\nangle of about 5 points with it. In all these cases,\nhowever, the velocity of the ship is greatly retarded;\nand that not only on account of the obliquity of her mo-\ntion, but by reason of what is called her lee-way. This\nis occasioned by the yielding of the water on the lee-\nside of the ship, by which means the vessel acquires a\ncompound motion, partly in the direction of the wind,\nand partly in that which is necessary for attaining the\ndesired port.\n\nIt is perhaps impossible to lay down any mathema-\ntical principles on which the lee-way of a ship could\nbe properly calculated; only we may see in general\nthat it depends on the strength of the wind, the roughness of the sea, and the velocity of the ship.\nWhen the wind is not very strong, the resistance of\nthe water on the lee-side bears a very great proportion\nto that of the current of air; and therefore it will\nyield but very little; however, supposing the ship to remain\nremain in the same place, it is evident, that the water having once begun to yield, will continue to do so for some time, even though no additional force was applied to it; but as the wind continually applies the same force as at first, the lee-way of the ship must go on constantly increasing till the resistance of the water on the lee-side balances the force applied on the other, when it will become uniform, as both the motion of a ship failing before the wind. If the ship changes her place with any degree of velocity, then every time she moves her own length, a new quantity of water is to be put in motion, which hath not yet received any momentum, and which of consequence will make a greater resistance than it can do when the ship remains in the same place. In proportion to the swiftness of the ship, then, the lee-way will be the less: but if the wind is very strong, the velocity of the ship bears but a small proportion to that of the current of air; and the same effects must follow as though the ship moved slowly, and the wind was gentle; that is, the ship must make a great deal of lee-way.\u2014The same thing happens when the sea rises high, whether the wind is strong or not; for then the whole water of the ocean, as far as the swell reaches, has acquired a motion in a certain direction, and that to a very considerable depth. The mountainous waves will not fail to carry the ship very much out of her course; and this deviation will certainly be according to their velocity and magnitude. In all cases of a rough sea, therefore, a great deal of lee-way is made.\u2014Another circumstance also makes a variation in the quantity of the lee-way; namely, the lightness or heaviness of the ship; it being evident, that when the ship sinks deep in the water, a much greater quantity of that element is to be put in motion before she can make any lee-way, than when she swims on the surface. As therefore it is impossible to calculate all these things with mathematical exactness, it is plain that the real course of a ship is exceedingly difficult to be found, and frequent errors must be made, which can only be corrected by celestial observations.\n\nIn many places of the ocean there are currents, or places where the water, instead of remaining at rest, runs with a very considerable velocity for a great way in some particular direction, and which will certainly carry the ship greatly out of her course. This occasions an error of the same nature with the lee-way; and therefore, whenever a current is perceived, its direction and velocity ought to be determined, and the proper allowances made.\n\nAnother source of error in reckoning the course of a ship proceeds from the variation of the compass. There are few parts of the world where the needle points exactly north; and in those where the variation is known, it is subject to very considerable alterations. By these means the course of the ship is mistaken; for as the sailors have no other standard to direct them than the compass, if the needle, instead of pointing due north, should point north-east, a prodigious error would be occasioned during the course of the voyage, and the ship would not come near the port to which she was bound. To avoid errors of this kind, the only method is, to observe the sun's amplitude and azimuth as frequently as possible, by which the variation of the compass will be perceived, and the proper allowances can then be made for errors in the course which this may have occasioned.\n\nErrors will arise in the reckoning of a ship, especially when she sails in high latitudes, from the spheroidal figure of the earth; for as the polar diameter of our globe is found to be considerably shorter than the equatorial one, it thence follows, that the farther we remove from the equator, the longer are the degrees of latitude. Of consequence, if a navigator aligns any certain number of miles for the length of a degree of latitude near the equator, he must vary that measure as he approaches towards the poles, otherwise he will imagine that he hath not sailed so far as he actually hath done. It would therefore be necessary to have a table containing the length of a degree of latitude in every different parallel from the equator to either pole; as without this troublesome calculation must be made at every time the navigator makes a reckoning of his course. Such a table, however, hath not yet appeared; neither indeed does it seem to be an easy matter to make it, on account of the difficulty of measuring the length even of one or two degrees of latitude in different parts of the world. Sir Isaac Newton first discovered this spheroidal figure of the earth; and showed, from experiments on pendulums, that the polar diameter was to the equatorial one as 229 to 230. This proportion, however, hath not been admitted by succeeding calculators. The French mathematicians, who measured a degree on the meridian in Lapland, made the proportion between the equatorial and polar diameters to be as 1 to 0.9891. Those who measured a degree at Quito in Peru, made the proportion 1 to 0.99024, or 266 to 265. M. Bouguer makes the proportion to be as 179 to 178; and M. Buffon, in one part of his theory of the earth, makes the equatorial diameter exceed the polar one by $\\frac{1}{75}$ of the whole. According to M. du Sejour, this proportion is as 321 to 320; and M. de la Place, in his Memoir upon the Figure of Spheroids, has deduced the same proportion. From these variations it appears that the point is not exactly determined, and consequently that any corrections which can be made with regard to the spheroidal figure of the earth must be very uncertain.\n\nIt is of consequence to navigators in a long voyage to take the nearest way to their port; but this is scarcely possible to be done. The shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere is measured by an arch of a great circle intercepted between them; and therefore it is advisable to direct the ship along a great circle of the earth's surface. But this is a matter of considerable difficulty, because there are no fixed marks by which it can be readily known whether the ship sails in the direction of a great circle or not. For this reason the sailors commonly choose to direct their course by the rhumbs, or the bearing of the place by the compasses. These bearings do not point out the shortest distance between places; because, on a globe, the rhumbs are spirals, and not arches of great circles. However, when the places lie directly under the equator, or exactly under the same meridian, the rhumb then coincides with the arch of a great circle, and of consequence shows the nearest way. The sailing on the arch of a great circle is called great circle sailing; and the cases of it depend all on the solution of problems in spherical trigonometry.","sp":272,"ep":273},{"h":"TV","t":"such that the arch TV is exactly equal to the departure; and in this case, the difference of longitude would be easily obtained. For TV is to MN as the fine PT to the fine PM; that is, as the cosine of latitude is to the radius.\n\nThe latitude of the parallel TV is not, however, easily determined with accuracy; various methods have, therefore, been taken in order to obtain it nearly, with as little trouble as possible: first, by taking the arithmetical mean of the two latitudes for that of the mean parallel; secondly, by using the arithmetical mean of the cosines of the latitudes; thirdly, by using the geometrical mean of the cosines of the latitudes; and lastly, by employing the parallel deduced from the mean of the meridional parts of the two latitudes. The first of these methods is that which is generally used.\n\nIn order to illustrate the computations in middle latitude sailing, let the triangle ABC (fig. 17.) represent a figure in plane sailing, wherein AB is the difference of latitude, AC the distance, BC the departure, and the angle BAC the course. Also, let the triangle DBC be a figure in parallel sailing, in which DC is the difference of longitude, BC the meridian distance, and the angle DCB the middle latitude. In these triangles there is, therefore, one side BC common to both; and that triangle is to be first resolved in which two parts are given, and then the unknown parts of the other triangle will be easily obtained.\n\n**Prob.

CD equal to the difference of longitude 39\u00b0;\u2014then the middle latitude BCD being measured, will be found equal to 59\u00b0 15': hence the latitude come to is 57\u00b0 34', and difference of latitude 158\u00b0. Now make AB equal to 158, and join AC, which applied to the scale, will measure 271 miles. Also the course BAC being measured on chords will be found equal 54\u00b0 7\u00bd'.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nTo find the middle latitude.\n\nAs the departure - - - - - - - - - - 220 - - - - - - - - - - 2.34242\nis to the diff. of longitude - - - - - - - - - - 396 - - - - - - - - - - 2.59769\nso is radius - - - - - - - - - - 10.00000\n\nTo the secant of mid. lat. - - - - - - - - - - 56\u00b0 15' - - - - - - - - - - 10.25527\n\nDouble, mid. lat. - - - - - - - - - - 112\u00b0 30'\nLatitude left - - - - - - - - - - 54\u00b0 56'\nLatitude come to - - - - - - - - - - 57\u00b0 34'\nDiff. of latitude - - - - - - - - - - 2\u00b0 38' = 158 miles\nTo find the course.\n\nAs the difference of latitude \\(158\\) is to the departure \\(220\\), so is radius \\(10.00000\\).\n\nTo the tangent of the course \\(54^\\circ 19'\\) is radius \\(10.00000\\), so is the difference of latitude \\(158\\).\n\nTo find the distance.\n\nAs radius \\(10.00000\\) is to the secant of the course \\(54^\\circ 19'\\), so is the difference of latitude \\(158\\).\n\nTo the distance \\(270.9\\) is \\(2.43276\\).\n\nBy Inspection.\n\nAs the difference of longitude and departure exceed the limits of the tables, let, therefore, their halves be taken; these are \\(198\\) and \\(110\\) respectively. Now these are found to agree exactly in the page marked \\(5\\) points at the bottom. Whence the middle latitude is \\(56^\\circ 15'\\), and difference of latitude \\(158\\) miles.\n\nAgain, the difference of latitude \\(158\\) and departure \\(220\\) will be found to agree nearly above \\(54^\\circ\\) the course, and the distance on the same line is \\(271\\) miles.\n\nBy Gunter's Scale.\n\nThe extent from the difference of longitude \\(396\\) to the departure \\(220\\) on numbers, will reach from \\(90^\\circ\\) to \\(33^\\circ 45'\\), the complement of the middle latitude on lines; and hence the difference of latitude is \\(158\\) miles.

Required the latitude failed from, and that come to?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nWith the course and distance construct the triangle ABC (fig. 25.), and make DC equal to \\(448\\) the given difference of longitude. Now the middle latitude BCD will measure \\(48^\\circ 58'\\), and the difference of latitude \\(AB\\) \\(324\\) miles: hence the latitude left is \\(51^\\circ 40'\\), and that come to \\(46^\\circ 16'\\).\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nTo find the difference of latitude.\n\nAs radius \\(10.00000\\) is to the cosine of the course \\(34\\) pts., so is the distance \\(438\\).\n\nTo the difference of latitude \\(324.5\\) is \\(2.51126\\).\n\nTo find the middle latitude.\n\nAs the difference of longitude \\(448\\) is to the distance \\(438\\), so is the sine of the course \\(34\\) pts., \\(9.82708\\).\n\nTo the cosine of mid. latitude \\(48^\\circ 58'\\) half difference of latitude \\(242\\) is \\(9.81727\\).\n\nLatitude failed from \\(51^\\circ 40'\\)\n\nLatitude come to \\(46^\\circ 16'\\)\n\nBy Inspection.\n\nTo the course \\(34\\) points, and half the distance \\(219\\) miles, the departure is \\(147.0\\), and difference of latitude \\(162.2\\); which doubled is \\(324.4\\). Again, to half the difference of longitude \\(224\\) in a distance column, the difference of latitude is \\(149.9\\) above \\(48^\\circ\\), and \\(146.9\\) over \\(49^\\circ\\).\n\nNow, as \\(30 : 29 :: 65 : 58'\\).\n\nHence the middle latitude is \\(48^\\circ 58'\\); the latitude failed from is therefore \\(51^\\circ 40'\\), and latitude come to \\(46^\\circ 16'\\).\n\nBy Gunter's Scale.\n\nThe extent from \\(8\\) points to \\(44\\) points, the complement of the course on line rhumbs, will reach from the distance \\(438\\) miles to the difference of latitude \\(324.5\\) on numbers. And the extent from the difference of longitude \\(448\\), to the distance \\(438\\) on numbers, will reach from the course \\(45^\\circ\\) to the complement of the middle latitude \\(41^\\circ 2'\\) on lines. Hence the latitude left is \\(51^\\circ 40'\\), and that come to \\(46^\\circ 16'\\).\n\nProb. X. To determine the difference of longitude made good upon compound courses, by middle latitude failing.\n\nRule I. With the several courses and distances find the difference of latitude and departure made good, and the ship's present latitude, as in traverse failing.\n\nNow enter the traverse table with the given middle latitude, and the departure in a latitude column, the corresponding distance will be the difference of longitude, of the same name with the departure.\n\nExample.

Of Mercator's Sailing.**\n\nIt was observed in Middle Latitude Sailing, that the difference of longitude made upon an oblique rhumb could not be exactly determined by using the middle latitude. In Mercator's sailing, the difference of longitude is very easily found, and the several problems of sailing resolved with the utmost accuracy, by the assistance of Mercator's chart or equivalent tables.\n\nIn Mercator's chart, the meridians are straight lines parallel to each other; and the degrees of latitude, which at the equator are equal to those of longitude, increase with the distance of the parallel from the equator. The parts of the meridian thus increased are called meridional parts. A table of these parts was first constructed by Mr. Edward Wright, by the continual addition of the secants of each minute of latitude.\n\nFor by parallel sailing,\n\n\\[ R : \\text{cof. of lat.} :: \\text{part of equat.} : \\text{similar part of parallel.} \\]\nAnd because the equator and meridian on the globe are equal; therefore,\n\n\\[ R : \\text{cof. lat.} :: \\text{part of meridian} : \\text{similar part of parallel}. \\]\n\nOr sec. lat. \\( R :: \\text{part of merid.} : \\text{similar part of parallel}. \\)\n\nHence, \\( \\frac{\\text{fecant latitude}}{\\text{part of meridian}} = \\frac{\\text{R}}{\\text{part of parallel}}. \\)\n\nBut in Mercator's chart the parallels of latitude are equal, and radius is a constant quantity. If therefore, the latitude be assumed successively equal to \\( '1', '2', '3', \\ldots \\) &c. and the corresponding parts of the enlarged meridian be represented by \\( a, b, c, \\ldots \\); then,\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\text{fecant } 1'}{\\text{part of mer. } a} = \\frac{\\text{fecant } 2'}{\\text{part of mer. } b} = \\frac{\\text{fecant } 3'}{\\text{part of mer. } c}, \\ldots \\]\n\nHence fecant \\( 1' : \\text{part of mer. } a :: \\text{fecant } 2' : \\text{part of mer. } b :: \\text{fecant } 3' : \\text{part of mer. } c, \\ldots \\).\n\nTherefore by 12th V. Euclid,\n\n\\[ \\text{Secant } 1' : \\text{part of mer. } a :: \\text{fecant } 1' + \\text{fecant } 2' + \\text{fecant } 3', \\ldots : \\text{parts of } a + b + c, \\ldots \\]\n\nThat is, the meridional parts of any given latitude are equal to the sum of the secants of the minutes in that latitude (E).\n\nSince \\( CD : LK :: R : \\text{fecant } LD, \\) fig. 15.\n\nAnd in the triangle CED,\n\n\\[ ED : CD :: R : \\text{tangent } CED; \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( ED : LK :: R^2 : \\text{fecant } LD \\times \\text{tangent } CED \\)\n\nHence \\( LK = \\frac{ED \\times \\text{fecant } LD}{R^2} \\times \\text{tangent } CED = \\frac{ED \\times \\text{fecant } LD}{R} \\times \\frac{\\text{tangent } CED}{R}. \\)\n\nBut \\( \\frac{ED \\times \\text{fecant } LD}{R} \\) is the enlarged portion of the meridian answering to \\( ED. \\) Now the sum of all the quantities \\( \\frac{ED \\times \\text{fecant } LD}{R} \\) corresponding to the sum of all the \\( ED's \\) contained in AS, will be the meridional parts answering to the difference of latitude AS; and MN is the sum of all the corresponding portions of the equator LK.\n\nWhence \\( MN = \\text{mer. diff. of lat. } \\times \\text{tangent } \\frac{CED}{R}. \\)\n\nThat is, the difference of longitude is equal to the meridional difference of latitude multiplied by the tangent of the course, and divided by the radius.\n\nThis equation answers to a right-angled rectilineal triangle, having an angle equal to the course; the adjacent side equal to the meridional difference of latitude, and the opposite side the difference of longitude. This triangle is, therefore, similar to a triangle constructed, with the course and difference of latitude, according to the principles of plane sailing, and the homologous sides will be proportional. Hence, if, in fig. 26. the angle A represents the course, AB the difference of latitude, and if AD be made equal to the meridional difference of latitude; then DE, drawn perpendicular to AD, meeting the distance produced to E, will be the difference of longitude.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe, that the meridional difference of latitude is found by the same rules as the proper difference of latitude; that is, if the given latitudes be of the same name, the difference of the corresponding meridional parts will be the meridional difference of latitude; but if the latitudes are of a contrary denomination, the sum of these parts will be the meridional difference of latitude.\n\n**Prob. I.** Given the latitudes and longitudes of two places, to find the course and distance between them.\n\nEx. Required the course and distance between Cape Finisterre, in latitude 42\u00b0 52' N., longitude 9\u00b0 17' W., and Port Praya in the island of St. Jago, in latitude 14\u00b0 54' N., and longitude 23\u00b0 29' W?\n\nLat.

Now these are found to agree nearest under 24\u00b0; and to 167.8, one-tenth of the proper difference of latitude, the distance is about 183 miles, which multiplied by 10 is 1830 miles.\n\n**By Gunter's Scale.**\n\nThe extent 1948, the meridional difference of latitude, to 852, the difference of longitude on the line of numbers, will reach from 45\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 37'; the course on\n\n(e) This is not strictly true; for instead of taking the sum of the fecants of every minute in the distance of the given parallel from the equator, the sum of the fecants of every point of latitude should be taken.\nPractice.\n\nNavigation.\n\nExample.

Again, to course 3 points, and 146.5 half the mer. difference of latitude, the departure is 97.9, which doubled is 195.8, the difference of longitude.\n\nBy Gunter's Scale.\n\nThe extent from 8 points to the complement of the course 5 points, on fine rhumbs, will reach from the distance 267 to the difference of latitude 222 on numbers; and the extent from 4 points to 3 points on tangent rhumbs, will reach from the meridional difference of latitude 293 to the difference of longitude 196 on numbers.\n\nProb.

VIII. Given one latitude, course, and difference of longitude: to find the other latitude and distance.\n\nExample. A ship from Tercera, in latitude 38\u00b0 45' N., longitude 27\u00b0 6' W., sailed on a direct course, which, when corrected, was N 32\u00b0 E., and is found by observation to be in longitude 18\u00b0 24' W. Required the latitude come to, and distance sailed?\n**Navigation**\n\n**By Construction.**\n\nMake the right-angled triangle ADE (fig. 33.) having the angle A equal to the course 32\u00b0, and the side DE equal to the difference of longitude 522; then AD will measure 835, which added to the meridional parts of the latitude left, will give those of the latitude come to 48\u00b0 46\u2032; hence, the difference of latitude is 601: make AB equal thereto, to which let BC be drawn perpendicular; then AC applied to the scale will measure 708 miles.\n\n**By Calculation.**\n\nTo find the meridional difference of latitude.\n\nAs radius 10.00000  \nis to the cotangent of the course 32\u00b0 0\u2032 10.20421  \nso is the difference of longitude 522 2.71707\n\nto the mer. difference of latitude 8352 2.92188\n\nLatitude of Tercera 38\u00b0 45\u2032 N Mer. parts 256\nMer. diff. of lat. 835\n\nLatitude come to - 48\u00b0 46\u2032 N Mer. parts 3361\n\nDifference of latitude 10\u00b0 = 601 miles.\n\nTo find the distance.\n\nAs radius 10.00000  \nis to the secant of the course 32\u00b0 0\u2032 10.07158  \nso is the difference of latitude 601 2.77887\n\nto the distance - 707.7 2.85045\n\n**By Inspection.**\n\nTo course 32\u00b0, and opposite to 130\u00b0, one fourth of the given difference of longitude in a departure column, the difference of latitude is 208.8, which multiplied by 4 is 835, the meridional difference of latitude; hence the latitude in is 48\u00b0 46\u2032 N, and difference of latitude 601.\n\nAgain, to the same course, and opposite to 200, one third of the difference of latitude, the distance is 236, which multiplied by 3 gives 708 miles.\n\n**By Gunter's Scale.**\n\nThe extent from the course 32\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 on tangents, will reach from the difference of longitude 522 to the meridional difference of latitude 835 on numbers.\u2014And the extent from the complement of the course 58\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 on fines, will reach from the difference of latitude 601, to the distance 708 miles on numbers.\n\n**Prob. IX. To find the difference of longitude made good upon compound courses.**\n\n**Rule.** With the several courses and distances, complete the Traverse Table, and find the difference of latitude, departure, and course made good, and the latitude come to as in Traverse Sailing. Find also the meridional difference of latitude.\n\nNow to the course and meridional difference of latitude, in a latitude column, the corresponding departure will be the difference of longitude, which applied to the longitude left will give the ship's present longitude.\n\n---\n\n**Example.** A ship from port St Julian, in latitude 49\u00b0 10\u2032 S, longitude 68\u00b0 44\u2032 W, sailed as follows; ESE 53 miles, SEbS 74 miles, E by N 68 m.

Now with the latitude left, and the several differences of latitude, find the successive latitudes, which are to be placed in the first of the annexed columns; in the second, the meridional parts corresponding to each latitude is to be put; and in the third, the meridional differences of latitude.\n\nThen to each course, and corresponding meridional difference of latitude, find the difference of longitude, by Prob. IV. which place in the fourth or fifth columns, according as the coast is easterly or westerly, and the difference between the sums of these columns will be the difference of longitude made good upon the whole, of the same name with the greater.\n\n**Remarks.**\n\n1. When the course is north or south, there is no difference of longitude.\n2. When the course is east or west, the difference of longitude cannot be found by Mercator's Sailing; in this case the following rule is to be used.\n\nTo the nearest degree to the given latitude taken as a course, find the distance answering to the departure in a latitude column: this distance will be the difference of longitude.\n\nEx.\n**Practice.**\n\n**Navigation.**\n\nEx. 1.

Given one latitude, distance, and difference of longitude; to find the course, and other latitude.\n\nRULE. To the arithmetical complement of the logarithm of the distance, add the logarithm of the difference of longitude in minutes, and the log. cosine of the given latitude, the sum rejecting radius will be the log. sine of the approximate course.\n\nTo the given latitude taken as a course in the traverse table, and half the difference of longitude in a distance column, the corresponding departure will be the first correction of the course, which is subtractive if the given latitude is the least of the two; otherwise additive.\n\nIn Table A, under the complement of the course, and opposite to the first correction in the tide column, is the second correction. In the same table find the number answering to the course at the top, and difference of longitude in the tide column; and such part of this number being taken as is found in table B opposite to the given latitude, will be the third corrections. Now these two corrections, subtracted from the course corrected by the first correction, will give the true course.\n\nNow the course and distance being known, the difference of latitude is found as formerly.\n\n| Arc. | 1\u00b0 | 2\u00b0 | 3\u00b0 | 4\u00b0 | 5\u00b0 | 6\u00b0 | 7\u00b0 | 8\u00b0 | 9\u00b0 |\n|------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| 1\u00b0   | 3' | 1' | 1' | 1' | 1' | 1' | 1' | 1' | 1' |\n| 2    | 12 | 6  | 4  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1  | 1  |\n| 3    | 27 | 13 | 8  | 6  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 1  |\n| 4    | 47 | 23 | 14 | 10 | 7  | 5  | 3  | 1  | 1  |\n| 5    | 74 | 36 | 23 | 16 | 11 | 8  | 5  | 2  | 1  |\n| 6    | 107| 52 | 33 | 22 | 16 | 11 | 7  | 3  | 1  |\n| 7    | 145| 72 | 44 | 30 | 21 | 15 | 9  | 4  | 1  |\n| 8    | 190| 92 | 58 | 40 | 28 | 19 | 12 | 6  | 1  |\n\nExample.

And he then adds\u2014The solution hereof would be very acceptable, if not to the public, at least to the author of this tract, being likely to open some further light into the mysteries of geometry.\n\nSince that time, this problem has been solved in an indirect manner, by several writers on navigation, and others\u2014Mr Bouguer, in his Nouveau Trait\u00e9 de Navigation; Mr Robertson, in the second volume of his Elements of Navigation; Mr Emeron, in his Theory of Navigation, which accompanies his Mathematical Principles of Geography; Mr Israel Lyons, in the Nautical Almanack for 1772; and Monseigneur Bezout, in his Trait\u00e9 de Navigation; and lately, Baron Maclaurin, with the assistance of Mr Attwood, has given the first direct solution of this problem. For a comparison of the various solutions which have hitherto been made of this problem, the reader is referred to that by Dr MacKay, in the fourth and fifth volumes of Baron Maclaurin's Scriptores Logarithmici.\n\nIt was intended in this place to have given rules, to make allowance for the spheroidal figure of the earth; but as the ratio of the polar to the equatorial semi-axis is not as yet determined with sufficient accuracy, neither is it known if both hemispheres be similar figures; therefore these rules would be grounded on assumption only, and might probably err more from the truth.\n**NAVIGATION**\n\n**By Calculation.**\n\nIn the triangle BIF are given BI and BF equal to 39 miles, and 26 miles respectively; and the angle BFI equal to 7 points: To find the side FI, and angle FBI.\n\nTo find the angle BIF.\n\nAs the distance BI - 39 - 1.59106  \nis to the distance BF - 26 - 1.41497  \nso is the fine of BFI - 78\u00b0 45' - 9.99157\n\nto the fine of BIF - 40 50 - 9.81548  \nSum - 119 35\n\nAngle FBI - 60 25  \nEBF - 33 45\n\nDifference, or EBI - 26 40\n\nBearing of Jersey from Brehaut N 63\u00b0 20' E.\n\nTo find the distance FI.\n\nAs the fine of BFI - 78\u00b0 45' - 9.99157  \nis to the fine of FBI - 63\u00b0 25' - 9.99934  \nso is the distance BI - 39 miles - 1.59106\n\nto the distance FI - 34 58 - 1.53883\n\n**Ex. 3.** At noon Dungeness bore per compass NW, distance 5 leagues; and having run NW by W 7 knots an hour, at 5 P.M. we were up with Beachyhead.

From the points A and C, with distances equal to 82 and 100 miles respectively, describe arches intersecting each other in M, which will therefore be the place of meeting.\u2014Now the angle ABM, the ship's course from the southernmost port, will measure N82\u00b0E; and the other ship's course, or angle BAM, will be 67\u00b03', or ESE.

IX. Of Windward Sailing.\n\nWindward sailing is, when a ship by reason of a contrary wind is obliged to sail on different tacks in order to gain her intended port; and the object of this sailing is to find the proper course and distance to be run on each tack.\n\nEx. 1. A ship is bound to a port 48 miles directly to the windward, the wind being SSW, which it is intended to reach on two boards; and the ship can lie within five points of the wind. Required the course and distance on each tack?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nDraw the SSW line CB (fig. 39.) equal to 48 miles. Make the angles ACB, ABC, each equal to 6 points. Hence the first course will be W, and the second SE; also the distance CA, or AB, applied to the scale will measure 62\u00bd miles, the distance to be sailed on each board.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nFrom A draw AD perpendicular to BC; then in the triangle ADC are given CD, equal to 24 miles; and the angle ACD, equal to 6 points, to find the distance AC.\n\nAs radius | 10.00000\nis to the secant of C | 6 points | 10.41716\nso is CD | 24 miles | 1.38021\n\nto CA | 62.7 | 1.79737\n\nEx. 2. The wind at NW, a ship bound to a port 64 miles to the windward, proposes to reach it on three boards; two on the starboard, and one on the larboard tack, and each within 5 points of the wind. Required the course and distance on each tack?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nDraw the NW line CA (fig. 40.) equal to 64 miles; from C draw CB WBs, and from A draw AD parallel thereto, and in an opposite direction; bisect AC in E, and draw BED parallel to the NE rhumb, meeting CB, AD in the points B and D; then CB = AD applied to the scale will measure 36\u00bd miles, and BD = 2CB = 72\u00bd miles.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nFrom B draw BF perpendicular to AC; then in the triangle BFC are given the angle BCF equal to 5 points, and CF equal to one fourth of CA = 16 m. to find CB.\n\nAs radius | 10.00000\nis to the secant of BCF | 5 points | 10.25526\nso is CF | 16 m. | 1.20412\n\nto CB | 36.25 | 1.55938\n\nEx. 3. A ship which can lie within 5\u00bd points of the wind, is bound to a port 36 miles to the windward, the wind being NEbN, which it is intended to reach on four boards, the first being on the larboard tack. Required the course and distance on each tack?\n\nBy Construction.\n\nDraw the NEbN line CA (fig. 41.) equal to 36 miles, and bisect it in B; from C and B draw lines parallel to the ENE rhumb; and from A and B draw lines parallel to the SSEbE point, meeting the former in the points D and E. Now the distances AD, BD, BE, and CE, are equal; and any one of them applied to the scale will measure 19.1 miles.\n\nBy Calculation.\n\nFrom E draw EF perpendicular to AC; and in the triangle CFE are given CF = 9 m. and the angle FCE = 5\u00bd points, to find CE.","sp":284,"ep":299}]
