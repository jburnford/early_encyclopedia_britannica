It is of importance to keep in mind, that this pressure is always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the surface. It is a proposition founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> and uncontradicted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> actions of bodies on each other are always exerted in a direction perpendicular to the touching surfaces. Thus, it is observed, that when a billiard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> A is struck by another B, moving in any direction whatever, the ball A always moves off in the direction perpendicular to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> which touches the two balls in the point of mutual contact, or point of impulse. This inductive proposition is supported by every argument which can be drawn from what we know concerning the forces which connect the particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> together, and are the immediate causes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion.

But for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> we are much more indebted to the poets, who have given us faithful transcripts of nature, than to the philosophers who have wished to entertain us with their own theories, or to those laborious men of erudition, who have dreaded as much to examine the source of an ancient report as the friends of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULYSSES\">Ulysses</a> to approach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Cimmerian darkness.

The reader must not here suppose that we allude to Polydore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> (B). We have in our eye persons now alive, with whom we have conversed on the subject, and who (terrified at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> to which some philosophers have carried the doctrine of instincts, and others the reasoning powers of the mind) have contended, with the utmost earnestness, that we know nothing\u2014not even the functions of our animal nature\u2014but by tradition or written revelation.\n\nHaving now seen the source of the opinion concerning the future existence of the soul, and pointed out the philosophical phenomena by which mankind were led to embrace it, we come next to review the arguments by which the philosophers attempted to confirm it.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> believed, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, that annihilation was never the end, and that nonentity was rash's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> never the beginning of any thing that is. His general transmigration doctrine upon this subject was shortly expressed in very few words, Omnia mutantur, nihil interit. He afterwards learned from Egyptian priests that the soul migrates into new bodies; and being, it seems, a person of a most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> and astonishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, he found there was some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in the story: for after musing, he began to remember that he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUPHORBUS\">Euphorbus</a>, the son of Pantheus, that was slain by Menelaus in the Trojan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and upon a jaunt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>, recollected the shield which he had worn at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the siege, in one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNO\">Juno</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGOS\">Argos</a>! That none might question the truth of his assertion, his followers presently removed all doubts by the famous argument, the IPSE DIXIT of Egyptian origin.\n\nAs Pythagoras taught that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> souls are frequently thrust into brute shapes, and, as some imagined, by trine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRE_EXISTENCE\">pre-existence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>; it occurred to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, that all bodies, even the human, are a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>; and that, in consequence of this confinement, the soul was subjected to the rage of desire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, and to all the wretched miseries of a jail. To explain this mystery, he supposed that desires and appetites belong to a soul that is purely animal residing in the body. But he was perplexed with another difficulty; for as he thought highly of the goodness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, he could not imagine how he should imprison us without a crime. He supposed, therefore, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with the present body the soul had existed in one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, which it still retains; but that even in this ethereal body it had felt something of impure desire; and happening to indulge the vicious appetite, had contracted some stains of pollution, for which it was confined in its present body as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of correction to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> and improve its morals.\n\nTo prove this ideal pre-existence of the soul, Plato availed himself of an opinion that was general in his proving time, that coincided with the doctrines of Pythagoras, and that was partly founded on a sort of reasoning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. He thought that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> and intelligence are coeternal (see Platonism); that there are various orders of souls; that those of both the man and the brute are parts or emanations (c) of the anima mundi, or soul of the world; that all are ultimately parts or emanations of Deity itself; and that all their faculties are\n\n---\n\n(b) This writer allots part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> to show, \"Quis primum instituerit artem meretriciam,\" as being in his opinion, a traditional practice.

Happening to peep into the region of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, he was somewhat surprized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which we derive from reflection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a>; and supposing that they could not have entered by the senses, he naturally, though not very justly, concluded, that we must have received them in some state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>.\n\nAs, according to him, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> was eternal, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which composed the body, and as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> was only temporary and accidental, he might have been satisfied that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the soul was not to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their separation. But, somehow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other, satisfied he was not. He had recourse to a new argument. As the soul, he said, was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principle, and a self-moving, it did not depend for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> on another; and therefore would always continue to exist, though the body were reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> out of which it was formed. See Metaphysics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> III, chap. iv.\n\nWhether Plato had borrowed any of his doctrines from the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGI\">magi</a>, we pretend not to say. We only observe a striking similarity, in some respects, between his and theirs. In Plato's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and stars, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> beings, and a sort of divinities that originally had sprung from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> fountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and our earthly bodies a sort of dungeons in which our miserable souls are benighted and debauched by desires, appetites, and passions. In the magian philosophy, the Supreme Being was called Ormazd; was the god of light, or was light itself, and represented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITHRAS\">Mithras</a>, a subordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, and the same with the sun. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a> of very great power was Arimanus, the god of darkness, who presided over matter, and was the origin of all evil (see Polytheism). The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOSTICS\">Gnostics</a>, who derived their tenets from this source, believed, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> and Plato, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of subordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENII\">genii</a>; and said, that Demiurgus, the god of matter and the soul or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of this world, had contrived the bodies of men and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>; and in the former particularly, as in so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISONS\">prisons</a>, had confined a number of celestial spirits, that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> them to the low desires of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, he might seduce them from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to the God of light, and render them more submissive to himself. From these prisons the Supreme Being was continually making attempts to rescue them; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was frequently sending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> messengers to enlighten and instruct them, and to render them capable of returning to the regions of light and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, to which they had belonged (E).\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOICS\">Stoics</a> attempted to simplify this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, which appears anciently to have pervaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, and which would seem to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than variously modified by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>, Pythagoras, Plato, and others of the more northerly and western nations. None of them allowed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> out of nothing; and the shaping and modelling of matter into forms was variously explained, according as they happened to be most addicted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, to morals, or to physics. Some ascribed these operations to ancient Time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">Chaos</a>, and Darkness, and explained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> changes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> by the genealogies of these deities; some observing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>, or at least a sort of agreement and discordance among bodies, were inclined to ascribe them to Friendship and Hatred, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> and Antipathy; some observing, that while one body rose another descended, made Levity and Gravity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> agents; and some taking notice that living bodies sprung from corruption, were\n\n(d) The general doctrine, as delivered here in these verses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, is the same with that not only of Pythagoras, but of the Stoics.\n\n(e) Plato made the stars the native residence of inferior souls; and when these were thoroughly purified below, returned them home again: and therefore, says Virgil, alluding to his doctrine,\n\nSome have taught\nThat bees have portions of ethereal thought,\nEndued with particles of heav'nly fires;\nFor God the whole created mass inspires:\nThro' heav'n and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>'s depth, he throws\nHis influence round, and kindles as he goes.\nHence flocks, and herds, and men, and beasts, and fowls,\nWith breath are quicken'd, and attract their souls:\nHence take the forms his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> did ordain,\nAnd into him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> resolve again.\nNo room is left for death, they mount the sky,\nAnd to their own congenial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> fly.\n\nDryden.\nwere disposed to confer the same powers on Moisture and Heat.\n\nThe physical hypotheses were what had most charms for the Stoics. From their system immaterial beings were openly excluded; all things were regulated by physical laws or inexorable fate; and all things originated in the \u03a4\u03bf \u0395\u03bd or the First One, which was probably suggested by the Moses of Pythagoras. This \u03a4\u03bf \u0395\u03bd appears to have been a materia prima devoid of all the qualities of body. In their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> it was an \u0391\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd or first principle, not subject to change. When it was invested with the properties of body, it then became a \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd or an element; and then, so far as respected its qualities, especially its forms, it was subject to changes almost perpetual. The gods themselves and the souls of men were in this system only modifications of matter (r). <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> was composed of their four elements, Fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">Air</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a>, and Earth; and upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>, every part returned to the element from which it had come, as the water of a vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> unites with the ocean when the vessel is broken. This system, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, cannot possibly admit of any separate consciousnesses of existence (g). The same may be said of the systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOCRITUS\">Democritus</a> and Epicurus, and all those who undertook to explain things upon physical principles (h).\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> merit of the physical systems appears to be this: Absurd as they were, it would seem from the whimsical and the almost childish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> of Lucretius, that they had a tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> mankind from extravagant hypotheses to something that was similar to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>.\n\nWhat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> thought of the separate existence of the soul after death is not very certain. The soul he calls an \u0395\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the reader can divine the meaning of the word, he perhaps can divine the meaning of the Stagyrite, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> then be a better diviner than we. At other times he says, that the soul is something divine; that it resembles the element of the stars; that it is something of a fiery nature; that it is the vicegerent of God in the body; and that the acuteness of the senses, the powers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, with the various kinds of appetites and passions, depend entirely on the qualities of the blood (i).\n\nAnother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of very old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> was that of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Mr Hunter. According to him, the living principle resides in the blood. This opinion, which is mentioned by Moles, was adopted by Critias and others of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>. Harvey likewise embraced it. But Mr Hunter, who always wished to be thought an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, inclines to stand at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the opinion, and supports it by experiments similar to those of the famed Taliacotius in mending noses. Should any of our readers wish to extract the soul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> from such an opinion, we must refer them to the many resources of ingenuity, sophistry, and logic.\n\nAmong the Jews, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of a future and separate existence for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time was deemed no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> article of their creed. Some thought that the soul was a spark in the moving of the heart; some imagined that it was the breath, and that upon the dissolution of the body it naturally vanished into soft air. The Sadducees denied the existence of either angel or spirit. Many believed the doctrine of ghosts, and were accustomed to invoke them at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. It is hence that we hear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPHETS\">prophets</a> complaining that they were seeking from the living God unto dead men. Some imagined that there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRE_EXISTENCE\">pre-existence</a> of souls; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> man, asked our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>, whether the man or his parents had sinned that he was born blind? Others inclined to a revolution of soul and body, and thought that our Saviour was either Elias or one of the old prophets returned; and a great many new-modelled their opinion of the soul's immortality according to certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in Scripture. The inspired mother of Samuel had said, \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> killeth and maketh alive; he bringeth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the grave, and bringeth up.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAIAH\">Isaiah</a> had exclaimed, \"Thy dead shall live; together with my dead body shall they arise: Awake, and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> out the dead.\" Daniel had declared, that many of them that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in the dust of the earth shall awake to everlasting life, and come to shame and everlasting contempt. In the vision of the valley of dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a> had seen that \"at the word of the Lord\" the bones came together, bone to his bone, the sinews and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> came upon them, and the skin covered them above, and the breath came into the bodies, and they lived and stood upon their feet. And a passage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOB\">Job</a> led them to suppose, that at some distant and future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> a particular time, which was called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> or the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, was appointed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> for the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a> of all those who are sleeping in their graves. \"I know (says Job) my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\"\n\nWhether these passages were fairly interpreted agreeably to their true and original meaning, it is not here our business to inquire. It is sufficient for us to observe, that from them many of the Jews inferred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of a general resurrection (k). In this persuasion, Martha, speaking of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Lazarus, says to our Lord, \"I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" This resurrection appears to\n\n---\n\n(f) The \u0391\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd of the Stoics appears to be the same with the Li of the Chinese.\n(g) Yet without regarding the inconsistency, many of the Stoics believed, that the soul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> separate long after death; though all in general seemed to deny a future state of rewards and punishments.\n(h) In his Physical Cosmogony, Plato differed but little from the Stoics; but he had another sort of cosmogony, in which all things appear to have sprung from, and to be almost wholly composed of metaphysical entities, as ideas of forms, numbers, and mathematical figures. These kinds of notions were common both to him and Pythagoras; and were originally borrowed from Egypt, where calculation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> were half deified. See PLATONISM.\n(i) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> Harvey has collected these different opinions of the Stagyrite in Exercit. 52. De Generatione Animalium.\n(k) At present some are for allowing only those of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> to share in the benefits of this resurrection;\nto have been a general opinion among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>; for although it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of the Sadducees that there was no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, yet the Pharisees, we are told, confessed both. And this assertion is plainly confirmed by St Paul himself when his countrymen accused him before Felix. \"I confess unto thee (says this eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>), that after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> hereby so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and in the prophets, and having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and unjust.\"\n\nThis resurrection of the dead to judgment, though not perhaps in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> in which the old Pharisees conceived it, is now generally and almost universally (i.) maintained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> (m). Yet the Christians differ considerably with respect to the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> soul. Some imagine, that this spirit is naturally mortal, and that it is propagated along with the body from the loins of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>. In support of this opinion, it has been observed that a great number of insects and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> transfer their lives to their posterity, and die soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of propagation; that after this act the vital principle is in the most vigorous of plants and animals always found to be much exhausted; and that Tertullian a father of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, in attempting some experiments of the kind, became subject to a momentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> a portion of his soul going out of him (s).\n\nThese imagine that immortality was only conditionally promised to man; that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> forfeited this immortality by his disobedience; and that Christ has restored us to the hopes of it again by his sufferings and death: for as in Adam we have all died, so in Christ, they say, we shall all be made alive; and that now the sting is taken from death, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> over our souls from the grave.\n\nOthers have conceived the human soul as naturally immortal, and as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> death and the grave at defiance. Adam, they say, died only in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; and only from the consequences of this figure, which means sin, has our Lord saved us. In this sense Adam died on the very day in which he had sinned; or he died literally in 1000 years, which with the Lord are as one day. To these arguments their opponents reply, What then is the victory over death and the grave? You must still have recourse to a new figure, and betake yourselves to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> death; though, after all, where is your grave? To this it is answered, that the soul of itself is naturally immortal, and that it depends not either for its existence or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of its faculties upon the body; that the properties of matter, as figure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, can produce nothing that is like to perception, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, and consciousness. This is true, rejoins their opponents; but besides these few properties of matter, which are only the objects of that philosophy which has lately and properly been termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>, the chemical philosophy has discovered other properties of matter; has found that matter is of various kinds; that it very often does not act mechanically; that it acquires many new properties by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>; and that no man, till farther experiment and observation, should venture to assert how far the soul is or is not dependent on its present organized system. The others, proceeding on their hypothesis, maintain that the soul, as being immaterial, is not divisible; and though the body of a frog may live without the head for a whole day; though the body of a tortoise may live without the head for a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; though a human limb may for some minutes after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPUTATION\">amputation</a> continue to perform a vital motion, independent of a brain, a stomach, or a heart:\n\nVol. XVII. Part II.\n\n* See Pla\u2014which resists <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, and serves as a seed for the next body*. What that bone is, is of no great moment, as any bone, we believe, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SKELETON\">skeleton</a> will answer the purpose equally well. With respect to the manner of this resurrection, the learned Hody has quoted several opinions of the Jews, and, among others, that of the Chaldee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">paraphrase</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTICLES\">Canticles</a>, asserting that the prophet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> had said, \"When the dead shall revive, it shall come to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> that the Mount of Olives shall be cleft, and all the dead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a> shall come out from thence; and the just too that died in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> shall come through the way of the caverns under the earth, and shall come forth out of the Mount of Olives.\" He has likewise quoted Saunderson's Voyage to the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, in which, we are told that many of the Jews, by their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, are to rise up in the valley of Jehoshaphat; and that is the rowling or deviation of the caverns, those at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> must scrape their way thither with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>.\n\n(l) The feet of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUAKERS\">Quakers</a> explain it figuratively.\n\n(m) The last quoted author\u2020 (Resurrection of the same Body, asserted from the traditions of the Heathens, the ancient Jews, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> Church) has endeavoured to show that this doctrine, in the same sense as we understand it, has been asserted by the ancient Magi, and by the present heathen Gurus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELICS\">relics</a> of the ancient Magi; by some of the ancient Arabians; by some of the Banians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; by the present inhabitants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Ceylon, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>, of Transiana; by some amongst the Chinese; by the Arderians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>; and by the ancient Prussians. The proofs which he brings, it must be confessed, are not however always very satisfactory. It appears, even from his own account, that some of these had derived their notions from certain Christians, Mahometans, or Jews. But the reader may judge of the great accuracy of his ideas from his bringing old Pythagoras and the Stoics, and even Democritus and Epicurus, in support of the same or a similar opinion.\n\n(n) In illo ipso voluptatis ultime \u00e6stu quo genitalis virus expellitur, nonne aliquid de anima quoque sentimus exire, utque adeo marcescimus et devigescimus cum lucis detritione.\nand though the parts of a plant, a polype, or a worm, may survive their separation and become living wholes*, yet the soul, they observe, is not to be compared with the vital principles of plants and animals, nor ought to be divided on reasons so slender as those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>.\n\nEven granting, they say, that the soul were not naturally immortal of itself; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of God, which is not remarkable for its equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of rewards and punishments in the present world, is bound to make some amends in the next. And to this again their opponents answer, as to the equal distribution of justice in a future world, of that we are assured on much better grounds than any of yours: our Lord has declared it in express terms; and whether the soul be immortal or not, we can easily believe what he said is true, as we know him whom we have trusted.\n\nThese, with Plato, suppose, that the soul is here as in prison; though how or at what time it should first have come into this dungeon they have not determined. They have only agreed, that upon its enlargement all its faculties are to receive an increase of power; and having already equipped it so exquisitely with consciousness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and perception in and of itself, and put it into complete a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> for happiness and misery in a separate state,* their hypothesis does not require them to admit the least occasion for a resurrection; which accordingly is said to have been an article of Baxter's creed (o).\n\nA third opinion, which extends likewise to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of plant and animal, is, that all souls were created at once with bodies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>; that these bodies, occupying only a very small space, were packed up in their first progenitors, and there left to be afterwards evolved and clothed with matter of a groser kind by acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> and consequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-NUTRITION\">nutrition</a>. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> we are referred to the small animals seen through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, and likewise to those which are supposed to escape even microscopic observation; but, above all, to the eggs of insects, which, though scarcely perceptible, yet contain in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBRYO\">embryo</a> a future caterpillar and all its coats, and within these a future butterfly with its legs and wings. These philosophers can perhaps account for the general taint of original sin in some other way than has hitherto been done. We have only to add, that on their scheme the resurrection is not a matter that seems to be indifferent.\n\nThe next thing that falls to be considered is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the dead. From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> enough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of ideas, an opinion had very early prevailed, that the spirit continued near to the body; and the offerings therefore intended for the dead were by most nations presented at the grave; and that on which the departed spirit is supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> is always placed near the grave in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>.\n\nFrom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> and the natural tendency of the fancy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> and to summon up spectres when the world around us is involved in darkness, it has also been imagined, that these spirits delight in the night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of death (p), or have been prohibited from enjoying the exhilarating beams of day. And hence we are told,\n\nThat in the dismal regions of the dead\nTh' infernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> once rais'd his horrid head;\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">Leap</a>'d from his throne, left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> should lay\nHis dark dominions open to the day,\nAnd pour in light.\n\nThe nations, therefore, who have fancied a general receptacle for the dead, have thus been induced to place it in the well (q), where the night begins and the day ends. That part of the world which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of his father's dominions, fell to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTO\">Pluto</a> the infernal god, and where, according to Laestadius, Satan holds the empire of darkness, the Friendly Islanders have placed the westward of a certain island which they call Te Ie jee; some tribes of American Indians, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> beyond the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, somewhere to the westward of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> at the boundaries of the ocean,\n\nWhere in a lonely land and gloomy cells\nThe dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells;\nThe sun ne'er views th' uncomfortable seats\nWhen radiant he advances nor retreats.\nUnhappy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>! whom endless night invades,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">Clouds</a> the dull air, and wraps them round in shades.\n\nAnother opinion entertained by the Greeks and some other nations was, that the place of departed spirits is under the earth. This opinion is frequently mentioned in Homer, in Virgil, and alluded to by the Jewish prophets. As for the prophets, we know the circumstance from which they borrowed it: it was borrowed from those subterraneous vaults where their chiefs were buried, and which have been described by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> travellers. In the sides of these caverns there is ranged a great number of cells; and in these cells the mighty lay in a fort of state, with their weapons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and their swords at their head. To these kinds of Egyptian cemeteries Ezekiel alludes, when he says, \"that they shall not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, who are gone down to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a> with their weapons of war, and they have laid their swords under their head.\" And Isaiah, when thus speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, \"Thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, every one in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>.\"\n\n(o) An Historical View of the Controversy concerning an Intermediate State, and the Separate Existence of the Soul.\n\n(p) Some Turkish ghosts are an exception, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> lamps or candles in their tombs, when their friends choose to supply them with these luxuries.\n\n(q) The well and darkness are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> in Homer. \u03a9 \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be, \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f41\u03c1\u1fb7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2. (Odys.) \"Oh my friend! which is the west, or which is the east, the place of darkness, or that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, we cannot learn.\"\nMany of the ancient fathers of the church asserted only, that the dead are now in abditis receptaculis, or in certain hidden and concealed places.\n\nOrpheus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>, and some others of the fathers, with the ancient Caledonian bard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>, and the learned Dodwell among the moderns, imagined that the soul, when it left the body, went into the air, and resided somewhere between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the earth and the moon.\n\nThose who believed in a transmigration caused the soul at death only to enter a new body, and kept the departed always with the living. This creed has been found in India, in Egypt, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, and in all those countries where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> has been much used. In this species of writing, the same picture is on fancied analogy transferred by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a> to signify either a god or a man, a brute or a plant; and in those countries where it was practised, men had usually their names from animals, and were represented by their figure in writing (R). From this last stage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, a transmigration was easily supposed; and hence we hear of the gods of Egypt wandering about like so many vagrants in brute shapes, and of princes being translated into stars, because a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a> in hieroglyphic, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> in figurative language. And, in like manner, we see, from the specimen of this character which is still preserved on celestial globes, how the heavens at first came to be filled with bears, scorpions, and dragons, and with a variety of other animals.\n\nThe opinions concerning the state of the dead are still more numerous than those concerning the place where they reside. Rude nations have generally thought that the future state is similar to the present; that plants, animals, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> things there, have their shades; and that these contribute as much to the pleasures and conveniences of the dead as their realities do to the living; that husbands have their wives (S), lovers their mistresses, warriors their battles, huntmen their sport; and that all their passions, amusements, and business, are the same as formerly. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, that the dead may not appear unprovided in the next world, like the ancient Gauls, some tribes of India, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> with them in the same grave their wives, their arms, their favourite animals, and their necessary utensils.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians, who believed in transmigration, supposed that the soul was after death obliged to animate every species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> and quadruped, of reptile and insect, and was not to return to a human form till after a period of 3500 years. Others have confined their transmigrations to particular animals, as the soul of man to the human form, and the soul of the brute to the bodies of the species to which it belonged. Some have changed the brute into man, and man into the brute, that man might suffer injuries similar to what he had inflicted, and the brute retaliate what he had suffered. Others have confounded the human soul in plants and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a> of Antemmony mentions an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> who supposed that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> might be in fishes.\n\nThe notions of Homer were probably those of many of Accadu's time. But these notions were dismal indeed. When to Homer, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULYSSES\">Ulysses</a> visited the shades, many of the ghosts seemed to retain the mangled and ghastly appearance which they had at death; and, what is worse, seemed to be all starving with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, innumerable multitudes, with loud shrieks, flocking to the fleas of his slain victim as to a most sumptuous and delicious banquet.\n\nFor scarcely had the purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> flow'd,\nAnd all the caverns smok'd with streaming blood,\nWhen, lo! appear'd along the dusky coasts\nThin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a> shoals of visionary ghosts;\nFair pensive youths, and soft enamour'd maids,\nAnd wither'd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELDERS\">elders</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and wrinkl'd shades.\nGhastly with wounds, the forms of warriors slain,\nStalk'd with majestic port, a martial train.\nThese, and a thousand more, swarm'd o'er the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>,\nAnd all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DIRE\">dire</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> shriek'd around.\nUlysses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, as ghost by ghost arose,\nAll wailing with unutterable woes.\n\nAlone, apart, in discontented mood,\nA gloomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, the fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AJAX\">Ajax</a> flood;\nFor ever sad, with proud disdain he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>'d,\nAnd the lost arms for ever flung his mind.\n\nUpon Ulysses saying to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a>,\n\nAlive, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>'d thee with our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> gods;\nAnd, dead, thou rent'st a king in these abodes;\n\nThe shade reply'd:\n\nTalk not of ruling in this dolorous gloom,\nNor think vain words (he cry'd) can ease my doom;\nRather I choose laboriously to bear\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of woes, and breathe the vital air,\nA slave to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> hind that toils for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>,\nThan live a scepter'd monarch of the dead.\n\nIn this gloomy region no one is rewarded for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, nor is punished for his crimes, unless committed, like those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SISYPHUS\">Sisyphus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TANTALUS\">Tantalus</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IXION\">Ixion</a>, against the gods. All indeed are clasped into groups, from a certain analogy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, fate, and disposition; but all appear to be equally unhappy, having their whole heart and affections concentrated in a world to which they are fated never to return.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELYSIUM\">Elysium</a> of Homer is allotted only for the relations and descendants of the gods; and Menelaus goes to this country of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> (T), not as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>\n\n---\n\n(R) A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who resided at Penobscot during the late American war, assured us that the Indians, when desired to subscribe a written agreement, drew always the picture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> or animal whose name they bore. But for fuller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> on this subject, see Clavigero's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Mexico.\n\n(S) The question which the Sadducees put to our Saviour about the wife of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> brothers, is a proof that the Pharisees thought there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> and giving in marriage in the future state, and that it was somewhat similar to the present.\n\n(T) Homer sends the ghost of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> to the shades, while Hercules himself is quaffing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECTAR\">nectar</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBE\">Hebe</a> in\nof superior merit, but because he had married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Jove.\n\nEven long after a future state had become the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of rewards and punishments, these for the most part were distributed, not according to moral, but physical distinctions. With the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, the soul was condemned to many calamities for a number of years, if the body was not honoured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNERAL_RITES\">funeral <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>. Among the Scandinavians, a natural death was attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a>, while a violent death, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, gave a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to sit in the halls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODIN\">Odin</a>, and to quaff beer from the skulls of enemies. Among the Tlascalans, it was only the great that were permitted to animate birds and the nobler <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>; the lower ranks were transformed into weasels, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, beetles, and such mean animals. Among the Mexicans, those who were drowned, who died of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, tumors, or wounds, or such like diseases, went along with the children that had been sacrificed to the god of water, and in a cool and delightful place were allowed to indulge in delicious repasts and varieties of pleasures: those who died of other diseases, were sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> or centre of the earth, and were under the dominion of the gods of darkness. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> who died in battle, or in captivity among their enemies, and the women who died in labour, went to the house of the sun, who was considered as the prince of glory. In his mansions they led a life of endless delight. Every day the soldiers, on the first appearance of his rays, hailed his birth with rejoicings and with dancings, and the music of instruments and voices. At his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> they met with the women, and in like festivity accompanied him to his setting. After four years of this glorious life, they went to animate clouds, and birds of beautiful feathers and of sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a>; but always at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to rise again, if they pleased, to heaven, or descend to the earth, to warble their songs, and to suck <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>.\"\n\nThese sentiments of a future state, conceived in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and a rude period, could not long prevail among an enlightened and civilized people. When the times of rapine and violence therefore began to cease; when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> regulated by certain laws began to be established; when martial prowess was less requisite, and the qualities of the heart had begun to give an importance to the character, the future state was also modelled on a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. In the \u00c6neid of Virgil, an author of a highly cultivated mind, and of polished manners, it becomes a place of the most impartial and unerring justice; every one now receives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> suited to the actions of his past life, and a god is made to preside in judgement;\n\nWho hears and judges each committed crime,\nInquires into the manner, place and time.\n\nThe conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,\nLoth to confess, unable to conceal,\nFrom the first moment of his vital breath,\nTo the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of unrepenting death.\n\nThe spirits of the dead no longer mingle together as in the less enlightened period of Homer; the vicious are dismissed to a place of torments, the virtuous sent to regions of bliss: indifferent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> are confined to a limbus*; and those who are too virtuous for hell, but too much polluted with the stains of vice to enter heaven without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, are for some time detained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATORY\">purgatory</a>.\n\nFor there are various penances enjoined,\nAnd none are hung to bleach upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>;\nSome plunged in waters, others purged in fires,\nTill all the dregs are drain'd, and rust expires;\nTill nothing's left of their habitual stains,\nBut the pure ether of the soul remains.\n\nWhen thus purified, they become fitted to receive the rewards of their past virtues, and now enter into those regions of happiness and joy.\n\nWith ether vefted, and a purple sky,\nThe blissful feats of happy souls below,\nStars of their own, and their own funs they know;\nWhere patriots live, who, for their country's good,\nIn fighting fields were prodigal of blood,\nPriests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,\nAnd poets worthy their inspiring god;\nAnd searching wits, of more mechanic parts,\nWho grac'd their age with new-invented arts:\nThose who to worth their bounty did extend;\nAnd those who knew that bounty to command.\n\nThose good men are engaged in various amusements, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of each. Orpheus is still playing on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a>, and the warriors are still delighted with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>, their horses, and their arms.\n\nThe place of torment is at some distance.\n\nA gaping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>, which to the centre lies,\nAnd twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies;\nFrom hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains\nOf founding lashes, and of dragging chains.\nHere, those who brother's better claim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a>,\nExpel their parents, and usurp the throne;\nDefraud their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIENTS\">clients</a>, and, to lucre sold,\nSit brooding on unprofitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>.\nWho dare not give, and even refuse to lend,\nTo their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.\nVain is the throng of these; nor let the train\nOf lustful youths for foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a> slain.\n\n* Clarke's Hist. of Mexico, vol. i. p. 136.\n\nHis heaven.\n\nHis hell.\n\nin the skies. One soul of the hero is therefore repining with the ghosts of mortals in the regions below, while the other is enjoying all the happiness of the gods above. (See Odyssey, book ii. near the end). Philosophers since have improved on this hint of the poet; and men have now got rational, animal, and vegetable souls, to which sometimes a fourth one is added, as properly belonging to matter in general. Homer intimates, that Menelaus was to be translated to Elysium without tasting death. This Elysium is the habitation of men, and not of ghosts, and is described as being similar to the seat of the gods. Compare Odyssey iv. l. 563. and Odyssey vi. l. 43. in the Greek.\nHosts of defeters, who their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> sold,\nAnd basely broke their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> for bribes of gold:\nAll these within the dungeon's depth remain,\nDespairing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>, and expecting pain.\n\nThe souls of babes, of unhappy lovers, and some others, seem to be placed in a paradise of fools residing in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> distinct from Elysian Tartarus and Purgatory.\n\nIt is curious to observe, how much these ideas of a future state differ from the vague and simple conjectures of rude nations; and yet from their simple and rude conjectures, we can easily trace the successive changes in the writings of Homer, Plato, and Virgil; and may easily show, that those laws which different nations have prescribed for their dead, have always borne the strongest analogy to their state of improvement, their system of opinions, and their moral attainments. Some nations, as those of India, have fancied a number of heavens and hells, corresponding to some of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> shades in virtue and vice; and have filled each of these places respectively with all the scenes of happiness and misery, which friendship and hatred, admiration, contempt, or rancour, could suggest. But having already observed the progress of the human mind in forming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and leading ideas of a future state, we mean not to descend to the modifications which may have occurred to particular nations, sects, or individuals.\n\nThe belief of Christians respecting futurity demands our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as being founded on a different principle, namely, on express revelations from heaven. From many express declarations in Scripture, all Christians seem to agree, that there is a heaven appointed for the good and a hell for the wicked. In this heaven the saints dwell in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of God and the uninterrupted splendors of day. Those who have been wise shine as the firmament, and those who have converted many to righteousness as the stars. Their bodies are glorious, immortal, incorruptible, not subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, to pain, or to death. Their minds are strangers to sorrow, to crying, to disappointment; all their desires are presently satisfied; while they are calling, they are answered; while they are speaking, they are heard. Their mental faculties are also enlarged; they no more see things obscurely, and as through a cloud, but continually beholding new wonders and beauties in creation, are constantly exclaiming, \"Holy, holy, holy! is the Lord of Hosts, worthy is he to receive glory, and honour, and thanksgiving; and to him be ascribed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and power, and might; for great and marvellous are his works, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a> is filled with his glory.\"\n\nTheir notions of hell differ considerably. Some understanding the Scriptures literally, have plunged the wicked into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>; have made this gulf darker than night; have filled it with ravenous and malignant spirits, that are worse than furies; and have described it as full of sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> forever. This frightful gulf has by some been placed in the bowels of the earth; by some in the sun; by some in the moon; and by some in a comet: but as the Scriptures have determined nothing on the subject, all such conjectures are idle and groundless.\n\nOthers imagine, that the fire and sulphur are here to be taken in a figurative sense. These suppose the torments of hell to be troubles of mind and memories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>; and support their opinion by observing, that matter cannot act upon spirit; forgetting, perhaps, that at the resurrection the spirit is to be clothed with a body, and, at any rate, that it is not for man vainly to prescribe bounds to Omnipotence.\n\nWhat seems to have tortured the genius of divines of the middle state, much more than heaven or hell, is a middle state. On this subject there being little revealed in Scripture, many have thought it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> upon them to supply the defect; which they seem to have done in different ways. From the Scriptures speaking frequently of the dead as sleeping in their graves, those who imagine that the powers of the mind are dependent on the body, suppose that they sleep till the resurrection, when they are to be awakened by the trump of God, reunited to their bodies, have their faculties restored, and their sentence awarded.\n\nThis opinion they support by what St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> says in the Acts, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> is not ascended into heaven; and that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> could not possibly be speaking of himself when he said, \"Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, i.e. the place of the dead.\" They observe, that the victory of Christ over death and the grave seems to imply, that our souls are subject to their power; that accordingly the Scripture speaks frequently of the soul's dwelling near to, or of its being redeemed from, and of its descending into, the grave; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PSALMIST\">Psalmist</a>, however, declares plainly, that when the breath of man goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, and that very day his thoughts perish. And should any one choose to consult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTES\">Ecclesiastes</a>, he will find, that the living know that they shall die, but that the dead know not anything; that their love, and their hatred, and their envy, are perished; and that there is no work, nor device, nor wisdom, nor knowledge, in the grave, whether they are gone.\n\nThose who believe that the soul is not for the exercise of its faculties dependent on the body, are upon its feet; to others, a separation at death obliged to dispose of it some other way. In establishing their theory, they usually begin with attempting to prove, from Scripture or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, both its active and separate existence; but with proofs from tradition we intend not to meddle. Their arguments from Scripture being of more value, deserve our serious consideration; and are nearly as follow.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, they say, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>, are still living, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEHOVAH\">Jehovah</a> is their God, and he, it is allowed, is not the God of the dead, but of the living. But their opponents reply, That this is the argument which our Saviour brought from the writings of Moses to prove a future resurrection of the dead; and that any person who looks into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a>, will see it was not meant of a middle state. From the dead living unto God, our Saviour infers nothing more than that they shall live at the resurrection; and that these gentlemen would do well in future to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between simply living and living unto God: For though Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, be living unto God, our Saviour has assured us that Abraham is dead, and the prophets dead.\n\nA second argument is that glimpse which St Paul had of paradise about 14 years before he had written his Second Epistle to the Corinthians. To this argument their opponents reply, That as St Paul could not tell whether, on that occasion, he was out of the body or in the body, it is more than probable that the whole\nwas a vision; and, at any rate, it is no proof of a separate existence.\n\nA third argument is, St Paul's wishing to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. But, say their opponents, St Paul desired not to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon: and as some of those who maintain a separate existence, bring Scripture to prove that the body * continues united to Christ till the resurrection; in that case, St Paul, if he wished to be present with the Lord, should have rather remained with his body than left it.\n\nA fourth argument is, the appearance of Moses and Elias upon the mount of transfiguration. To which their opponents reply, that these saints appeared in their bodies; that Elias was never divested of his body; and that the account which we have of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> of Moses, has led some of the ablest critics and soundest divines to conclude, that he was likewise translated to heaven without suffering death. At any rate, say they, he might have been raised from the dead for the very purpose of being present at the transfiguration, as the bodies of other saints certainly were, to bear testimony to our Lord's resurrection and victory over the grave.\n\nA fifth argument is, what our Saviour said to the thief, \"Verily I say unto thee, today thou shalt be with me in paradise.\" The objection usually made here is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is evidently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a>, and that the sense depends entirely on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCTUATION\">punctuation</a>; for if the point be placed after today, the meaning will be \"Verily, even now, I tell thee, thou shalt be with me in paradise.\" But the import of paradise in this place, say the opponents, is likewise doubtful. We learn from St Peter's explanation of the 16th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PSALM\">Psalm</a>, that our Saviour's soul was not to be left in hell; and we know that on the day of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRUCIFIXION\">crucifixion</a> he went not to heaven; for after he had risen from the place of the dead, he forbade one of the women to touch him, as he had not yet ascended to the Father. Hell, therefore, and paradise, continue they, seem to be in this passage the very same thing, the place of the dead; and our Saviour's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>, they add, was not to go to heaven at that time, but to show his victory over death and the grave, to whose power all mankind had become subject by the disobedience of their first parents.\n\nWithout pretending to enter into the merits of this dispute, the ingenious Burnet, in his Theory of the Earth, endeavours to prove, upon the authority of the ancient fathers, that paradise lies between the earth and the moon; and the learned Dodwell, on the same authority, has made it the common receptacle of souls till the resurrection; but has not told us whether or not they are to be accountable for the actions of this separate existence at the latter day, or are only to be judged according to the deeds that were done in their bodies.\n\nThis notion of a common receptacle has displeased many. The state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURGATION\">purgation</a>, obscurely hinted in the doctrines of Pythagoras, and openly avowed by Plato and Virgil, has been adopted by the Roman divines, who support their opinion on certain obscure passages of Resurrection Scripture, which are always of a yielding and a waxen nature, may easily be twisted to any hypothesis, and like general lovers espouse rather from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> than merit.\n\nIt has displeased others, because they are anxious that the righteous should have a foretaste of their joys, and hope that the wicked of their torments, immediately after death, but of which they infer to be certainly the case from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARABLE\">parable</a> of the rich man and Lazarus (u). But to this it is objected, that the rich man supposed to be in hell, the place of torments, and that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> ought not to take place on their own hypothesis till after the sentence at the resurrection.\n\nAnother argument used for the intermediate state is the vision of St John in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-APOCALYPSE\">Apocalypse</a>. In this vision the Evangelist saw under the altar the souls of those that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. Their opponents doubt whether these visible souls were immaterial, as St John heard them cry with a loud <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and saw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> robes given unto every one of them. If they had bodies, that circumstance might chance to prove a resurrection immediately after death, and so supercede the general resurrection at the last day.\n\nWhile such conclusions as are here drawn from the parable and vision, say the opposers of an intermediate consciousness of existence, imply that the dead are already raised, and are now receiving the respective rewards of their virtues and their crimes; those who maintain an intermediate separate existence, who speak of the body as a prison, and of the soul as receiving an increase of power when freed from the body, are certainly not more than consistent with themselves, when they think that this soul would derive an advantage from its after union with either a new system of matter or the old one, however much altered. Baxter, they say, who saw the inconsistency, was disposed to reason somewhat like Aeneas,\n\nO, Father! can it be that souls sublime Return to visit our terrestrial clime? Or that the generous mind, released at death, Should covet lazy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> and mortal breath?\n\nIn no one instance, they continue, have Christians perhaps more apparently than in this argument wrestled the scriptures to their own hurt; by thus rashly attempting to accommodate the sacred doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> to a preconceived philosophical hypothesis, they have laid themselves open to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of deists, and have been obliged, for the sake of consistency, either to deny or to speak slightingly of the resurrection; which is certainly the surest foundation of their hope; seeing St Paul hath assured us, that if there be no resurrection of the dead, then they which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished, and those who survive may eat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>, and act as they please, for tomorrow they die; and die, too, never to live again.\n\nThough this reproof may be rather severe, we are forry\n\n(u) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WHITBY\">Whitby</a> shows that this parable was conformable to the notions of the Jews at that time; and even the Mahometans, who believe in the resurrection of the dead, suppose likewise a state of rewards and punishments in the grave.\nRefusen- forry to observe that there seems to have been some-\ntimes too much reason for it. A certain divine, whose\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> was eminent, and whose memory we respect, hav-\ning written \"An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> towards the proof of a sepa-\nrate State of Souls between Death and the Resurrec-\ntion, and the Commencement of the Rewards of Vir-\ntue and Vice immediately after death,\" has taken this\nmotto, \"Because sentence against an evil work is not\nexecuted speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men\nis fully set in them to do evil.\" The doctrine, he\nsays, of the resurrection of the body and the consequent\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of heaven and of hell, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of\ndivine force, but it is renounced by the enemies of our\nholy Christianity; and should we give up the recom-\npense of separate souls, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> denies the resur-\nrection of the body, I fear, between both we should sadly\nenfeeble and expose the cause of virtue, and leave it too\nnaked and defenceless.\"\n\nThis author, who wishes much that the punishment\nof crimes should follow immediately after death, is of\nopinion, that if heaven intended to check vice and im-\npurity in the world, it has acted unwisely, if it really has\ndeferred the punishment of the wicked to so late a pe-\nriod as the resurrection. \"For such, he observes, is the\nweakness and folly of our natures, that men will not be\nso much influenced and alarmed by distant prospects,\nnor so solicitous to prepare for an event which they\nsuppose to be so very far off, as they would for the same\nevent, if it commences as soon as ever this mortal life\nexpires. The vicious man will indulge his sensualities,\nand lie down to sleep in death with this comfort, I\nshall take my rest here for 100 or 1000 years, and per-\nhaps in all that space my offences may be forgotten; or\nlet the worst come that can come, I shall have a long\nsweet nap before my sorrows begin: and thus the force\nof divine terrors is greatly enervated by this delay of\npunishment.\"\n\nThus far our author, who thinks that his hypothe-\nsis, if not true, is at least expedient, and that from mo-\ntives of expediency it ought to be inculcated as a doc-\ntrine of Scripture: but how far his reasons can be\nhere justified we mean not to determine; we shall leave\nthat to be settled by others, reminding them only that\nthe distance of future rewards and punishments is not\ngreater on the supposition of the sleep of the soul than\non the contrary hypothesis. Every man who has but\ndipped into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of metaphysics knows, and no man\never knew better than he who is believed to have been\nthe author of the work before us, that time unperceived\npasses away as if in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>; and that if the soul be in\na state void of consciousness between death and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\nsurrection, the man who has lain in his grave a thou-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> years will appear to himself to have died in one\nmoment and been raised in the next. We would like-\nwise recommend to those who may henceforth be incli-\nned to inculcate any thing as a doctrine of scripture\nmerely on account of its supposed expediency, always\nto remember that God is above, that they are below,\nthat he is omniscient, that they are of yesterday and\nknow little, that their words therefore should be wary\nand few, and that they should always speak with re-\nspect of whatever concerns the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">Sovereign</a> of the universe,\nor relates to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> either in the natural or mo-\nral world. For wilt thou, says the Highest, disannul\nmy judgement? Wilt thou condemn me that thou may-\nest be righteous? shall he that contendeth with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AL\">Al</a>-\nmighty instruct him? He that reproveth God let him\nanswer it.\n\nIf, in stating these opposite opinions, we may seem to\nhave favoured what has been called the sleep of the soul,\nit is not from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, for there are\nparticular texts of Scripture which appear to us to mili-\ntate against it. We are satisfied, however, that it is a\nvery harmless opinion, neither injurious to the rest of the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the Christian faith nor to virtuous practice;\nand that those who have poured forth torrents of obloquy\nupon such as may have held it in simplicity and godly\nfervour, have either mistaken the doctrine which they\ncondemned, or been possessed by a spirit less mild than\nthat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> (x).\n\nWhatever be the fate of the middle state, the resur-\nrection stands on a different basis. It is repeatedly af-\nfirmed in Scripture; and those grounds on which we be-\nlieve it are authenticated facts, which the afflication,\nthe ingenuity, and the hatred of sceptics, have number-\nless times attempted in vain to disprove. These facts\nwe are now to consider, referring our readers for the\ncharacter of the witnesses, the authenticity of the gospel-\nhistory, and the possibility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, to the parts of\nthis work where these subjects are treated (See MIRACLE,","sp":419,"ep":427},{"h":"END OF THE SEVENTEENTH VOLUME","t":"DIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES OF VOL.

One piece of machinery I greatly admired; a green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> of five feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> was hoisted up by a pulley to the height of 50 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 60 feet from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> was so constructed as then suddenly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> out, and make way for 20 or 30 strings of lanterns enclosed in the box to descend from it, unfolding themselves from one another by degrees, so as at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> to form a collection of at least 500, each having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a beautifully coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> brightly within it. This deviation and development of lanterns (which appeared to me to be composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>) were several times repeated, and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> exhibited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. On each side was a correspondence of smaller boxes, which opened in like manner as the others, and let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of fire, with divisions and compartments of various forms and dimensions, round and square, hexagons, octagons, and lozenges, which shone like the brightest burnished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and flashed like prismatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, with every impulse of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. The diversity of colours indeed with which the Chinese have the secret of cloathing fire seems one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> merits of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PYROTECHNY\">pyrotechny</a>. The whole concluded with a volcano, or general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> and discharge of fans and flares, squibs, bouncers, crackers, rockets, and grenades, which involved the gardens for above an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> after in a cloud of intolerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>.\"\n\nTill of late the French and Italian makers of fire-works...\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">Apparatus</a>, works much excelled our British artists, and even now, though the practice of the art is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> understood among us, its principles are almost entirely unknown; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> English work of any respectability has appeared on the subject. In France, the art has been more fortunate, and several men of eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> abilities have concurred to make it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. It will be sufficient, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this, to mention the names of Ozanam and Montucla. The following works are recommended by the latter, as containing the best account of this amusing art; viz.\n\n*Trait\u00e9 des Feux d'Artifice* (Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works), by M. Frezier, a new edition of which appeared in 1745.\n\n*Trait\u00e9 des Feux d'Artifice pour le Spectacle et pour la Guerre*, (Treatise on Artificial Fire-Works, employed in Exhibitions and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">War</a>), by M. Perrinet d'Orval.\n\n*M\u00e9moires d'Artificier*, (Artificial Fire-Work-Maker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">Manual</a>), published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> in 1757, by Father d'Incarville.\n\nIndeed most of the written <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> which we possess on the making of fire-works, is derived from the French; and many of their productions still retain French names, such as *gerbes*, *ballons*, *marroons*, *tourbillons*, *faucifrons*, &c.\n\nWe shall divide this article into two chapters; in the first of which we shall consider the apparatus required for forming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> or shells of artificial fire-works, and the materials employed in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> we shall describe the different kinds of fire-works and the most approved methods of constructing them.\n\n**Chap. I. Of the Apparatus and Materials employed in making Fire-Works.**\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. Of Apparatus.**\n\nThe apparatus used in making fire-works consists chiefly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> wooden cylinders, called *formers*, for rolling the cases on; similar cylinders either of wood or metal for ramming down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> for holding the cases while filling, a machine for choking or contracting the cavity of the cases, another for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> the materials, and a particular apparatus for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a> some cases after they are filled.\n\nWe shall begin with describing the moulds, as on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of these depends that of the formers and rammers.\n\nAs the performance of rockets depends much on their moulds, it is requisite to give a description of them and their proportions: They are made and proportioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of their orifice, which is divided into equal parts. Fig. 1 represents a mould made by its diameter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a>: its height from C to D is six diameters and two-thirds; from D to E is the height of the foot, which is one diameter and two-thirds; F the *choak* or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, whose height is one diameter and one-third; it must be made out of the same piece as the foot, and fit tight in the mould; G is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> that goes through the cylinder to keep the foot fast; H the nipple, which is half a diameter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and two-thirds thick, and of the same piece of metal as the *piercer* I, whose height is three diameters and a half, and at the bottom it is one-third of the diameter thick, from thence tapering to one-sixth of the diameter. The Apparatus, piercer is an iron pin rising from the nipple, and intended to preserve a vacancy in the centre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>.\n\nThe best way to fix the piercer in the cylinder, is to make that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> below the nipple long enough to go quite through the foot, and rivet it at bottom. Fig. 2. is a former or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> for the cases, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> from the handle is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> diameters and a half, and its diameter two thirds of the bore. Fig. 3. is a part attached to the former, which is of the same thickness, and one diameter and two thirds long; the small part, which fits into the hole in the end of the roller when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is pinching is one-sixth, and one half of the mould's diameter thick. Fig. 4. the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRIFT\">drift</a> or rammer, which must be six diameters from the handle; and this, as well as all other rammers, must be a little thinner than the former, to prevent the sacking of the paper when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> in the charge. In the end of this rammer is a hole to fit over the piercer: the line K marked on this is two diameters and one-third from the handle; so that, when filling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCKET\">rocket</a>, this line appears at top of the case: you must then take the second rammer, (fig. 5.) which from the handle is four diameters, and the hole for the piercer is one diameter and a half long. Fig. 6. is the short and solid drift which is used when the case has been filled as high as the top of the piercer.\n\nRammers must have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> of brails at the bottom, to keep the wood from spreading or splitting, and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> must be given to all moulds, from one ounce to six pounds. We mentioned nothing concerning the handles of the rammers; however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> their diameters be equal to the bore of the mould, and two diameters long, it will be a very good proportion: but the shorter they can be used, the better; for the longer the drift, the less will be the pressure on the composition by the blow given with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALLET\">mallet</a>.\n\nThe following are the dimensions for rocket moulds, when the rockets are rammed solid.\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">Weight</a> of Rockets | Length of the moulds without their feet | Interior diameter of the moulds | Height of the nipples |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| lb. oz.           | Inches                                 | Inches                        | Inches               |\n| 6                 | 34.7                                   | 3.5                           | 1.5                  |\n| 4                 | 38.6                                   | 2.9                           | 1.4                  |\n| 2                 | 13.35                                  | 2.1                           | 1.0                  |\n| 1                 | 12.25                                  | 1.7                           | 0.85                 |\n| 0.8               | 12.125                                 | 1.333                         | 0.6                  |\n| 0.4               | 7.75                                   | 1.125                         | 0.5                  |\n| 0.2               | 6.2                                    | 0.9                           | 0.45                 |\n| 0.1               | 4.9                                    | 0.7                           | 0.33                 |\n| 0.1/2             | 3.9                                    | 0.55                          | 0.25                 |\n| 6 drams           | 3.5                                    | 0.5                           | 0.225                |\n| 4 drams           | 2.2                                    | 0.3                           | 0.2                  |\n\nN. B. The diameter of the nipple must always be equal to that of the former.\n\nWe shall now show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of finding the diameters or calibres of rockets, according to their weight; but we must first observe, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> rocket, is that\nApparatus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> capable of admitting a leaden bullet of a pound weight, and fo of the reft. The calibre for the different sizes may be found in the two following tables, one of which is calculated for rockets of a pound weight and under; and the other for those from a pound to 50 pounds.\n\n### <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> I. Of the Calibre of Moulds of a pound weight and below.\n\n| Ounces | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">Lines</a>. | Drams | Lines. |\n|--------|-------|-------|-------|\n| 16     | 19\u00bd   | 14    | 7\u00bd    |\n| 12     | 17    | 12    | 7     |\n| 8      | 15    | 10    | 6\u00bd    |\n| 7      | 14\u00bd   | 8     | 6     |\n| 6      | 14\u00bc   | 6     | 5\u00bd    |\n| 5      | 13    | 4     | 4\u00bd    |\n| 4      | 12\u00bd   | 2     | 3\u00bd    |\n| 3      | 11\u00bd   |       |       |\n| 2      | 9\u00bd    |       |       |\n| 1      | 6\u00bd    |       |       |\n\nThe use of this table will be understood merely by inspection; for it is evident that the mould for a rocket of 12 ounces ought to be 17 lines in diameter; one of eight ounces, 15 lines; one of 10 drams, 6\u00bd lines; and fo of the reft.\n\nOn the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, if the diameter of the rocket be given, it will be easy to find the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> corresponding to that calibre. For example, if the diameter be 13 lines, it will be immediately seen, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of lines, that it corresponds to a ball of five ounces.\n\n### II.

Then say, as 100 is to 19\u00bd, so is 288 to a fourth term, which will be the number of lines of the calibre required; or multiply the number found, that is 288, by 19\u00bd, and from the produce 5616, cut off the two last figures; the required calibre, therefore, will be 56,16 lines, or four inches eight lines.\n\nOn the other hand, the calibre being given in lines, the weight of the ball may be found with equal ease. If the calibre, for example, be 28 lines, say as 19\u00bd is to 28, so is 100 to a fourth term, which will be 143.5, or nearly 144. But in the above table, opposite to 144 in the second column, will be found the number 3 in the first; which shows that a rocket, the diameter or calibre of which is 28 lines, is a rocket of a three pounds ball.\n\nFig. 7 represents a mould, in which the cases are driven solid; L the nipple, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRADS\">brads</a> point at top, (flat at top, and of the same length as the neck of the case), which, when the case is filling, serves to stop the neck, and prevent the composition from falling out, as without this point it would; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> would get into the vacancy in the cases charge, and at the time of firing cause the case to be burnt. These moulds are made of any length or diameter, according as the cases are required; but the diameter of the rollers must be equal to half the bore, and the rammers made quite solid. The nipple and cylinders must bear the same proportion as those for rockets.\n\nThe rolling and formation of cases is so intimately connected with the construction of moulds and formers, that we shall introduce what we have to say on that subject into the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>.\n\nSky-rocket cases are to be made 6\u00bd of their exterior diameter long; and all other cases that are to be filled in moulds must be as long as the moulds, within half its interior diameter.\n\nRocket cases, from the smallest to four or five pounds, are generally made of the strongest sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARTRIDGE\">cartridge</a> rolling paper, and rolled dry; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sort are made of pasted pasteboard. As it is very difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> the ends of the cases quite even, the best way will be to keep a pattern of the paper for the different sorts of cases; which pattern should be somewhat longer than the case it is designed for, and on it marked the number of sheets required, which will prevent any paper being cut to waste. Having cut the papers of a proper size, and the last sheet for each case with a slope at one end, so that when the cases are rolled it may form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> line round the outside, and that this slope may always be the same, let the pattern be so cut for a guide. Before you begin to roll, fold down one end of the first sheet, so far that the fold will go two or three times round the former; then, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> edge, lay the former with its handle off the table; and when you have rolled on the paper within two or three turns, lay the next sheet on that part which is loose, and roll it all on.\n\nHaving thus done, you must have a smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, about 20 inches long, and equal in breadth to the length of the case. In the middle of this board must be a handle placed lengthwise. Under this board lay the case, and let one end of the board <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the table; then press hard on it, and push it forwards, which will roll the paper very tight; do this three or four times before you roll on any more paper. This must be repeated with every other sheet of paper, till the case is thick enough;\nApparatus, enough; but if the rolling board be drawn backwards, Materials, it will loosen the paper: you are to observe, when you roll on the last sheet, that the point of the flope be placed at the end of the roller. Having rolled your cafe to fit the mould, push in the small end of the former F, about one diameter from the end of the cafe, and put in the end-piece within a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the former; then give the pinching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> one turn round the cafe, between the former and the end-piece; at first pull gently, and keep moving the cafe, which will make the neck smooth, and without large wrinkles. When the cafes are hard to choke, let each sheet of paper (except the first and last, in that part where the neck is formed) be a little moistened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>: immediately after you have struck the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> stroke, bind the neck of the cafe round with small twine, which must not be tied in a knot, but fastened with two or three hitches.\n\nHaving thus pinched and tied the cafe so as not to give way, put it into the mould without its foot, and with a mallet drive the former hard on the end-piece, which will force the neck <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and smooth. This done, cut the cafe to its proper length, allowing from the neck to the edge of the mouth half a diameter, which is equal to the height of the nipple; then take out the former, and drive the cafe over the piercer with the long rammer, and the vent will be of a proper size. Wheel-cales must be driven on a nipple with a point to close the neck, and make the vent of the size required; which, in most cafes, is generally one-fourth of their interior diameter. As it is very often difficult, when the cafes are rolled, to draw the roller out, you may make a hole through the handle, and put in it a small iron pin, by which you may easily turn the former round and pull it out. Fig. 8 shows the method of pinching cafes; P a treddle, which, when pressed hard with the foot, will draw the cord tight, and force the neck as close as you please; Q a small wheel or pulley, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> round it for the cord to run in.\n\nCafes for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> and fixed pieces are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> rolled wet; and when they are required to contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> length of charge, the method of making those cafes is this: The paper must be cut as usual, only the last sheet must not be cut with a flope: Having the paper ready, paste each sheet on one side; then fold down the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> as before directed: but be careful that the paste does not touch the upper part of the fold; for if the roller be wetted, it will tear the paper in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it out. In pasting the last sheet, observe not to wet the last turn or two in that part where it is to be pinched; for if that part be damp, the pinching cord will stick to it, and tear the paper; therefore, when you choke those cafes, roll a bit of dry paper once round the cafe, before you put on the pinching cord; but this bit of paper must be taken off after the cafe is choked. The rolling board, and all other methods, according to the former directions for the rolling and pinching of cafes, must be used to these as well as all other cafes.\n\nTourbillon cafes are generally made about eight diameters long; but if very large, seven will be sufficient: tourbillons will answer very well from four ounces to two pounds; but when larger there is no certainty. The cafes are best rolled wet with paste, and the last sheet must have a straight edge, so that the cafe may be all of a thickness: when the cafes have been rolled in the manner of wheel cafes, pinch them at one end quite close; then with the rammer drive the ends down flat, Apparatus, and afterwards ram in about one-third of a diameter of dried clay. The diameter of the former for these cafes must be the same as of that for sky-rockets.\n\nN.B. Tourbillons are to be rammed in moulds without a nipple, or in a mould without its foot.\n\nFor balloons, first prepare an oval former turned Balloon cafes of smooth wood; over which, pasting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of paste, or paper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> or cartridge paper, let it lie till the paste has set. Quite soaked through; this done, rub the former with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> or grease, to prevent the paper from sticking to it; then lay the paper on in small slips, till you have made it one-third of the thickness of the intended shell. This being done, set it to dry; and when dry, cut it round the middle, and the two halves will easily come off; but observe, when you cut, to leave about one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> uncut, which will make the halves join much better than if they had been quite separated. When there are some ready to join, place the halves evenly together, paste a flap of paper round the opening to hold them together, and let that dry; then lay on paper all over as before, everywhere equal, excepting that end which goes downwards in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, which may be a little thicker than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>; for that part which receives the impulse from the powder in the chamber of the mortar requires the greatest strength. When the shell is thoroughly dry, burn a round hole at top, with square iron, large enough for the fuze: this method will do for balloons from four inches two-fifths, to eight inches diameter; but if they are larger, or required to be thrown a great height, let the first shell be turned of elm, instead of being made of paper.\n\nFor a balloon of four inches two fifths, let the former be three inches one-eighth diameter, and five inches and a half long. For a balloon of five inches and a half, the diameter of the former must be four inches, and eight inches long. For a balloon of eight inches, let the diameter of the former be five inches and fifteen-sixteenths, and eleven inches seven-eighths long. For a ten-inch balloon, let the former be seven inches three-sixteenths diameter, and fourteen inches and a half long. The thickness of a shell for a balloon of four inches two-fifths, must be one-half inch. For a balloon of five inches and a half, let the thickness of the paper be five-eighths of an inch. For an eight-inch balloon, seven-eighths of an inch. And for a ten-inch balloon, let the shell be one inch one-eighth thick.\n\nShells that are designed for stars only, may be made quite round, and the thinner they are at the opening, the better; for if they are too strong, the stars are apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> at the bursting of the shell: when making the shell, use a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of calibre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>, or a round gage, so that the paper may not be laid thicker in one place than another; and also to know when the shell is of a proper thickness. Balloons must always be made to go easy into the mortars.\n\nPort-fire cafes must be made very thin, and rolled on cafes for formers, from two inches to six-eighths of an inch diameter, and port-fires, from two to six inches long: they are pinched close at one end, and left open at the other. When they are to be filled, put in but little composition at a time, and ram it lightly, so as not to break the cafe: three or four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a> of paper, with the last round patted, will be strong enough for these cafes.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> portfires are intended for the purpose of firing.\nApparatus, ing the works, their fire being very slow, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the flame so intense, that, if applied to rockets, leaders, &c., it will fire them immediately. Fortresses may be made of any length, but are seldom made more than 21 inches long; the interior diameter of portfire moulds should be 10-16ths of an inch, and the diameter of the former half an inch. The cases must be rolled wet with paste, and one end pinched, or folded down. The moulds should be made of brads, and such as will take in two pieces lengthwise; when the case is in the two sides, they are held together by brads rings, or hoops, which are made to fit over the outside. The bore of the mould must not be made quite through, so that there will be no occasion for a foot. These portfires, when used, are held in copper lockets, fixed on the end of a long stick; these lockets are made like port-crayons, only with a screw instead of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>.\n\nThere have been many methods contrived for grinding the ingredients for fire-works to a powder, such as large mortars and pestles made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EBONY\">ebony</a> and other hard wood, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a> with brads barrels; but none have proved so effectual and speedy, as that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>-ing-table, represented in fig. 9, made of elm, with a rim round its edge four or five inches high; and at the narrow end A, furnished with a slider that runs in a groove, and forms part of the rim; so that when you have taken out of the table as much powder as you can with the copper shovel (fig. 10), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> all clean out at the slider A. When about to meal a quantity of powder, observe not to put too much in the table at once; but when you have put in a good proportion, take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">muller</a> (fig. 11.) and rub it till all the grains are broken; then fit it in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> sieve that has a receiver and top to it, such as is used by apothecaries, and that which does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the sieve, must be returned again to the table, and ground till it is fine enough to go through the sieve. Sulphur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> are ground in the same manner, only the muller must be made of ebony; for these ingredients being harder than powder, would stick in the grain of elm, and be difficult to grind. As sulphur is apt to stick and clod to the table, it will be best to keep one for that purpose, by which means you will always have your brimstone clean and well ground.\n\nFig. 12 represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of an apparatus, or lathe, for boring rockets. A the large wheel, which turns the small one B, that works the rammer C; these rammers are of different sizes according to the rockets; they must be of the same diameter as the top of the intended bore, and continue that thickness a little longer than the depth of the bore required, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> must be like that of an augre; the thick end of each rammer must be made square, and all of the same size, so as to fit into one socket, into which they are fastened by a screw D. E the guide for the rammer, which is made to move backwards and forwards; so that, after the rammer has been marked three diameters and a half of the rocket from the point, let the guide, allowing for the thickness of the fronts of the rocket boxes, and the neck and mouth of the rocket; so that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the large box is close to the guide, the rammer may not go too far up the charge. F, boxes for holding the rockets, which are made so as to fit one within; their sides must be equal in thickness to the difference of the diameters of the rockets, and their interior diameters equal to the exterior diameters of the rockets. To prevent the rocket from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round while boring, a piece of wood must be placed against the end of the box in the inside, and pressed against the tail of the rocket. This will also hinder the rammer from forcing the rocket backwards. G, a rocket in the box. H, a box that slides under the rocket-boxes to receive the borings for the rockets, which fall through holes made on purpose in the boxes; these holes must be just under the mouth of the rocket, one in each box, and all to correspond with each other.\n\nFig. 13. is a front view of the large rocket-box. I, Fig. 13. an iron plate, in which are holes of different sizes, through which the rammer passes; this plate is fastened with a screw in the centre, so that when the rammer is changed, the plate is turned round, but the hole you are going to use must always be at the bottom; the fronts of the other boxes must have holes in them to correspond with those in the plate. K, the lower part of the large box; which is made to fit the inside of the lathe, that all the boxes may move quite steadily.\n\nFig. 14. is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of the lathe. L, the guide for the rammer, which is set by the screw at bottom.\n\nFig. 15. A view of the front of the guide facing the rammer. M, an iron plate, of the same dimensions as that on the front of the box, and placed in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and also to turn on a screw in the centre. N, the rocket-box which slides backwards and forwards; when a rocket is fixed in the box, it is to be pulled forwards against the rammer; and when the scoop of the rammer appears to be full, draw the box back, and knock out the composition; this must be done till the rocket is bored, or it will be in danger of taking fire; and if the boring be done in a hurry, wet the end of the rammer now and then with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> to keep it cool.\n\nHaving bored a number of rockets, you must have taps of different sorts according to the rockets. These taps are a little longer than the bore; but when used they must be marked 3\u00bd diameters from the point, allowing for the thickness of the rocket's neck; then, holding the rocket in one hand, tap it with the other. One of these taps is represented by fig. 16. They are made in the same proportion as the fixed piercers, and are hollowed their whole length.\n\nThere are hand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> for boring, which answer very well, though not so expeditious as the lathes. But chime for they are not so expensive, and they may be worked by boring one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; whereas the lathe will require three. Fig. 17. represents the machine. O, the rocket boxes, which are to be fixed, and not to slide as those in the lathe. PQ are guides for the rammers, that are made to slide together, as the rammer moves forward; the rammers for these machines must be made of a proper length, allowing for the thickness of the front of the boxes, and the length of the mouth and neck of the case; on the square end of these rammers must be a round shoulder of iron, to turn against the outside of the guide Q, by which means the guides are forced forwards. R, the stock which turns the rammer, and which, while turning, must be pressed towards the rocket by the body of the man who works it; all the rammers are to be made to fit one stock.\n\nSect.\nThe charges or compositions with which the cases for the charges of fire-works have been described are to be filled, consisting chiefly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, or of a powder composed of the same materials in various proportions, and some other combustible substances, intended either to give the composition a stronger impelling force, or to increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and splendour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and composition of gunpowder have been fully explained under the article Gunpowder, it is unnecessary to consider them in this place; but as the makers of fire-works commonly employ considerable quantities of the substances of which gunpowder is composed, it may be proper to give some directions for obtaining these in the greatest purity. We may also notice, that gunpowder, in its ordinary state, is called corn powder; while, when ground down, as directed in No. 15, it is denominated meal powder.\n\nThe ingredient on which the force of the compositions chiefly depends, is nitre, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>; but as this substance, in its usual state, is very impure, being much contaminated with earthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and as pure nitre is now become very expensive, it is of consequence to know how the nitre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> may be purified.\n\nNitre, like most other saline bodies, is much more soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water, than in water of the ordinary temperature. If, therefore, the nitre of commerce be dissolved in a small quantity of boiling water, and the solution be properly drained, the liquor, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, will afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a> that are very pure. The following is the most convenient method of proceeding. Dissolve the nitre in boiling water, in the proportion of about an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>, or Scotch chalice, to each pound of nitre; and that the solution may be more easily effected, let the nitre be reduced to powder, and let the vessel containing the nitre and water be kept at the boiling heat till all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> is dissolved. Then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> the liquor while hot through thick blotting paper, placed in a clean funnel, and set by the filtered liquor in a shallow vessel, in some cold place, till crystals are formed. These must be removed from the liquor, and dried with a gentle heat; and if the remaining liquor be slowly evaporated over the fire, in an earthen unglazed vessel, till a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> appears on the top, and then set by to crystallize as before, an additional quantity of pure nitre will be procured; and thus, by repeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> and crystallizations, the whole of the salt will be obtained.\n\nNitre may be obtained in great purity from damaged gunpowder, which may often be bought at a cheap rate. The damaged powder must be ground with a small quantity of hot water, in a large wooden or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> mortar, or it may be boiled over a gentle fire, with as much water as will cover it. When the water seems to have dissolved as much of the nitre as it will retain, it is to be poured off from the sediment, and filtered or strained through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> bag, then heated again, and, while hot, filtered through blotting paper, and let by to crystallize, as in the former case. Fresh quantities of hot water are to be successively added to the sediment, and strained as before, till the whole of the nitre is obtained.\n\nNitre may be speedily reduced to a fine powder, by dissolving it in a little more than its own weight of boiling water, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KETTLE\">kettle</a> with a round bottom, keeping the solution over a gentle fire, and continually stirring it with a wooden spatula till all the water is evaporated, and the remaining powder is pretty well dried. Care must be taken, however, not to suffer it to remain too long, or expose it to too great a heat, otherwise it will be melted into a firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAKE\">cake</a>. The drying may be completed by suffering it to lie for a sufficient time on paper before the fire.\n\nSulphur or brimstone, may be employed in three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. 1. As it is brought from the neighbourhood of volcanoes, or what is called sulphur vivum. 2. Roll brimstone, which is sold by most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROCERS\">grocers</a>, and is employed for making matches; and, 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">Flowers</a> of sulphur, or sublimed sulphur. The first of these is the cheapest, and answers very well for coarse fire-works; the second is considered as the strongest, and is most used; but the third is the purest sulphur, and will answer best for the nicer and more delicate fire-works. It also has the advantage of being in a state of fine powder, whereas the two former require to be ground or milled, as directed in No. 15.\n\nCharcoal may, in general, be procured at the shops of founders and hardware dealers; but when this is not the case, it may easily be prepared by putting a quantity of small pieces of wood into a large earthen crucible or iron pot, and covering them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and placing the crucible or the pot in the middle of a strong fire, where it must be kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot for an hour or two, in proportion to the quantity of wood. Charcoal should be chosen soft and light, and such as may easily be reduced to powder. It should be kept in a dry place, but is always best when fresh burned.\n\nSeveral other ingredients are employed in the composition of fire-works, such as camphor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> (fulphuret of antimony), rapsings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, ful ammoniac, verdigris, common pitch, and Greek pitch, all of which are used on different occasions, to produce a change of colour in the fire; filings of iron and copper, for giving a sparkling appearance to the flame, and tails of benjamin (benzoic acid) to produce an agreeable odour.\n\nIron filings answer very well for ordinary fire-works; but they do not produce such a brilliant appearance as powdered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-iron. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of this latter is an improvement of the Chinese, and its use is now very general.\n\nCast-iron being of so hard a nature as not to be cut by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, we are obliged to reduce it into grains, though this is rather difficult to perform; but if we consider what beautiful sparks this iron yields, no pains should be spared to granulate such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a>: to do this, procure at an iron-foundery some thin pieces of iron, such as generally run over the mould at the time of casting: then have a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> made of cast-iron, and an iron square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a> about four lb. weight; then, having covered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> with cloth or something to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the beatings, lay the thin pieces of iron on the block, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> them with the hammer till reduced into small grains; which afterwards sift with a very fine sieve, to separate the fine dust, which is sometimes used in small cases of brilliant fire, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> dust; and when you have got out all the dust, sift what remains with a sieve.\nApparatus, sieve a little larger, and so on with sieves of different materials, sizes, till the iron passes through about the bigness of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>: the iron, thus beaten and fitted, is to be put separately, according to its fineness, into wooden boxes or oiled paper, to keep it from rusting. When used, observe the difference of its size, in proportion to the cases for which the charge is intended; for the coarsest is proper only for very large gerbes of six or eight pounds.\n\nWhen these pieces of iron cannot be procured, an old cast-iron pot may be employed; but care must be taken that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> be perfectly freed from rust. This pulverized cast iron is sometimes called iron sand, and is denominated, according to its fineness, sand of the first, second, third, &c. order, that of the first order being the finest.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that fire-works may be required to be kept a long time, or sent abroad; neither of which could be done with brilliant fires, if made with filings unprepared, for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>; that the saltpetre being of a damp nature, it causes the iron to rust; the consequence of which is, that when the works are fired, there will appear but very few brilliant sparks, but instead of them a number of red and drothy sparks; and besides, the charge will be so much weakened, that if this were to take place in wheels, the fire would scarcely be strong enough to force them round. But to prevent such accidents, the filings may be thus prepared: Melt in a glazed earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> some brimstone over a slow fire, and when melted throw in some filings; which keep stirring till they are covered with brimstone: this must be done while it is on the fire; then take it off, and stir it very quickly till cold, when it must be rolled on a board with a wooden roller, till broken as fine as corn powder; after which sift it from it as much of the brimstone as possible. There is another method of preparing filings, so as to keep two or three months in winter; this may be done by rubbing them between strong brown paper, which before has been moistened with linseed oil.\n\nN. B. If the brimstone should take fire, it may be extinguished, by covering the pan close at top: it does not signify what quantity of brimstone is used, provided there is enough to give each grain of iron a coat; but as much as will cover the bottom of a pan of about one foot diameter, will do for five or six pounds of filings or cast-iron for gerbes.\n\nBefore we enumerate the various compositions generally employed in filling cases for rockets, wheels, &c., we shall describe two compositions that are much valued for the brilliancy of their appearance. One of these is called Chinese fire, and is either red or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>. The following tables shew the proportions of the different ingredients for each of these compositions; as they are adapted to rockets (in the construction of which the Chinese fire is much employed) of from 12 to 36 lbs.\n\n### Composition of Red Chinese Fire\n\n| Calibres | Saltpetre | Sulphur | Charcoal | Sand of the first order |\n|----------|-----------|---------|----------|------------------------|\n| Pounds   | Pounds    | Ounces  | Ounces   | Oz. Dr.                |\n| 12 to 15 | 1         | .3      | 4        | 7                      |\n| 18 to 21 | 1         | 3       | 5        | 7                      |\n| 24 to 36 | 1         | 4       | 6        | 8                      |\n\nThe other composition is called spur fire, because the sparks yielded by it have a starry appearance like the rowel of a spur.\n\n**Spur-fire.**\u2014This fire is the most beautiful and curious of any yet known; and was invented by the Chinese, but now is in greater perfection in England than in China. As it requires great trouble to make it to perfection, it will be necessary that beginners should have full instructions; therefore care should be taken that all the ingredients are of the best, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> is not damp and clouded, that the saltpetre and brimstone are thoroughly refined. This composition is generally rammed in one or two ounce cases about five or six inches long, but not drove very hard; and the cases must have their concave stroke struck very smooth, and the choak, or vent not quite so large as the usual proportion: this charge, when driven and kept a few months, will be much better than when rammed; and will not spoil, if kept dry, in many years.\n\nAs the beauty of this composition cannot be seen at so great a distance as brilliant fire, it has a better effect in a room than in the open air, and may be fired in a chamber without any danger: it is of so innocent a nature, that, though with an improper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a>, it may be called a cold fire; and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> is the fire produced from this composition, that, if well made, the sparks will not burn a handkerchief when held in the midst of them; you may hold them in your hand while burning, with as much safety as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>; and if you put your hand within a foot of the mouth of the case, you will feel the sparks like drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>.\u2014When any of these spur-fires are fired singly, they are called artificial flower pots; but some of them placed round a transparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> of paper, and fired in a large room, make a very pretty appearance.\n\nThe composition consists of saltpetre, four pounds eight ounces; sulphur two pounds, and lamp-black one pound eight ounces; or, saltpetre one pound, sulphur half a pound, and lamp-black four quarts.\u2014This composition is very difficult to mix. The saltpetre and brimstone must be first fitted together, and then put into a marble mortar, and the lamp-black with them, which you work down by degrees with a wooden pestle, till all the ingredients appear of one colour, which will be something grayish, but very near black: then drive a little into a case for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, and fire it in a dark place; and if the sparks, which are called flares, or pinks, come out in clutters, and afterwards spread well without any other sparks, it is a sign of its being good, otherwise not; for if any drothy sparks appear, and the stars not full, it is then not mixed enough; but if the pinks are very small, and soon break, it is a sign that it has been rubbed too much.\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a>, when rubbed too much, will be too fierce, and hardly show any stars; and, on the contrary, when not mixed enough, will be too weak, and throw out an obscure smoke, and lumps of dross, without any stars.\n\nThe following compositions are those commonly employed in ordinary fireworks.\n\n**Rockets of four ounces.**\u2014Mealed powder 1 lb. 4 oz. saltpetre 4 oz. and charcoal 2 oz.\n\n**Rockets of eight ounces.**\u2014I.

When you would make stars of either of these compositions, you must wet them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-water, or weak spirits, in which has been dissolved some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-arabic, or gum-tragacanth, that the whole may have the consistence of a pretty thick liquid; having thus done, take 1 oz. of lint, and stir it about in the composition till it becomes dry enough to roll into stars.\n\nStars of a yellowish colour.\u2014Take 4 oz. of gum-tragacanth or gum-arabic, pounded and sifted through a fine sieve, camphor dissolved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a> 2 oz., saltpetre 1 lb., sulphur half a lb., coarse powder of glaas 4 oz., white amber 1 oz., and a half, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a> 2 oz. Being well incorporated, make them into stars after the common method.\n\nStars of another kind.\u2014Take 4 oz. of camphor, and melt it in half a pint of spirit of wine over a slow fire; then add to it \u00bd lb. of gum-arabic that has been dissolved; with this liquor mix 1 lb. of saltpetre, 6 oz. of sulphur, and 5 oz. of meal-powder; and after you have stirred them well together, roll them into stars proportionable to the rockets for which you intend them.\n\nAs variety of fires adds greatly to a collection of colours produced by different effect of each ingredient. For which reason, we shall here explain the colours they produce of themselves; and likewise how to make them retain the same when mixed with other bodies: as for example, sulphur gives a blue, camphor a white or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> colour, saltpetre a clear white-yellow, amber a colour inclining to yellow, sal-ammoniac a green, antimony a reddish, rosin a copper colour, and Greek-pitch a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a>, or between red and yellow. All these ingredients are such as flow themselves in a flame, viz.\n\nWhite flame.\u2014Saltpetre, sulphur, meal-powder, and camphor; the saltpetre must be the chief part.\n\nBlue flame.\u2014Meal-powder, saltpetre, and sulphur viva; sulphur must be the chief; or meal-powder, saltpetre, brimstone, spirit of wine, and oil of spike; but let the powder be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> part.\n\nFlame inclining to red.\u2014Saltpetre, sulphur, antimony, and Greek-pitch; saltpetre the chief.\n\nBy the above method may be made various colours of fire, as the practitioner pleases; for, by making a few trials, he may cause any ingredient to be predominant in colour.\n\nThe set colours of fire produced by sparks are divided into four sorts, viz. the black, white, grey, and red. The black charges are composed of two ingredients, which are meal-powder and charcoal; the white of three, viz. saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal; the grey of four, viz. meal-powder, saltpetre, brimstone, and charcoal; and the red of three, viz. meal-powder, charcoal, and saw-duft.\n\nThere are, besides these four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> or set charges, two others, which are distinguished by the names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> and brilliant charges; the compound being made of many ingredients, such as meal-powder, saltpetre, brimstone, charcoal, saw-duft, sea-coal, antimony, glaas-duft, brafs-duft, fleel-filings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a>-iron, tanner's duft, &c. or any thing that will yield sparks; all which must be managed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. The brilliant fires are composed of meal-powder, saltpetre, brimstone, and fleel-duft; or with meal-powder and fleel-filings only.\n\nThe beauty of fire-works depends much on the composition being well mixed; therefore great care must be taken in this part of the work, particularly for the fusions.\nApparatus, so well), first put the different ingredients together; then work them with your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, till you think they are pretty well incorporated: after which put them into a lawn sieve with a receiver and top to it; and if, after it is sifted, any remains that will not pass through the sieve, grind it again till fine enough; and if it be twice sifted, it will not be amiss; but the compositions for wheels and common works are not so material, and need not be so fine. But in all fixed works, from which the fire is to play regularly, the ingredients must be very fine, and great care taken in mixing them well together; and in all compositions in which are iron filings, the hands must not touch; nor will any works which have iron or steel in their charge keep long in damp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, unless properly prepared, according to the former directions.\n\nCotton quick's match is generally made of such cotton as is put in candles, of several sizes, from one to fix threads thick, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> for which it is designed; which pipe must be large enough for the match, when made, to be pushed in easily without breaking. Having doubled the cotton into as many threads as is proper, coil it very lightly into a flat-bottomed copper or earthen pan; then put in the saltpetre and the liquor, and boil them about 20 minutes; after which cool it again into another pan, as in fig. , and pour on it what liquor remains; then put in some meal powder, and press it down with the hand till it is quite wet; afterwards place the pan before the wooden frame (fig. 18.) which must be suspended by a point in the centre of each end; and place yourself before the pan, tying the upper end of the cotton to the end of one of the sides of the frame.\n\nWhen every thing is ready, an assistant must turn the frame round, while the cotton passes through the hand, holding it very lightly, and at the same time keeping the hand full of the wet powder; but if the powder should be too wet to stick to the cotton, more must be added, so as to keep a continual supply till the match is all wound up; it may be wound as close on the frame as you please, so that it may not stick together; when the frame is full, take it off the points, and fit dry meal-powder on both sides the match, till it seem quite dry: in winter the match will be a fortnight before it is fit for use; when it is thoroughly dry, cut it along the outside of one of the sides of the frame, and tie it up in skins for use.\n\nN. B. The match must be wound tight on the frames.\n\nThe ingredients for the match, are, cotton 1 lb. 12 oz. saltpetre 1 lb. spirit of wine 2 quarts, water 3 quarts, filings 3 gills, and meal-powder 10 lb. To dissolve 4 oz. of filings, take 3 pints of water.\n\nDissolve, in spirit of wine or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, a little saltpetre; then take some purple or blue paper, and wet it with this liquor, and when dry it will be fit for use; when this paper is to be pasted on any fire-works, take care that the paste does not touch that part which is to burn. The method of using this paper is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> it into slips, long enough to go once round the mouth of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, cracker, &c. When these slips are nailed on, leave a little above the mouth of the case not pasted; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> the case with meal-powder, and twist the paper to a point.\n\nWe are indebted to the Chinese for the contrivance of a paste which may be employed for representing animals and other objects in fire. To prepare this paste, Apparatus, take sulphur reduced to a very fine powder, or flowers of sulphur, and having formed it into a paste with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>, cover with it the figure you are desirous of representing on fire: it is here to be observed, that the figure must first be coated over with clay, to prevent it from being burnt.\n\nWhen the figure has been covered with this paste, beprinkle it while still moist with pulverized gunpowder; and when the whole is perfectly dry, arrange some small matches on the principal parts of it, that the fire may be speedily communicated to it on all sides.\n\nThe same paste may be employed on figures of clay, to form devices and various designs. Thus, for example, festoons, garlands, and other ornaments, the flowers of which might be imitated by fire of different colours, could be formed on the frieze of a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>. The Chinese imitate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> exceedingly well, by mixing pounded sulphur with the pulp of the jujube, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a> paste.\n\nIt is usual to paint the frames or stands of large fire-works of some dark colour, but this renders them very preserving combustible. It would be better to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> them with the following composition, which will both give them a proper colour, and render them less combustible. Take equal parts of brick-dust, coal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, and iron-filings, and mix them with a double size while hot. With this wash over the frames, &c. and when dry repeat the washing.\n\nCHAP. II. Of the principal varieties of Fire-Works, and the most approved Methods of constructing them.\n\nArtificial fire-works differ from each other very much in point of simplicity of construction. Some fire-works require very little dexterity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>; and are either employed as appendages to works of greater importance, or, if used by themselves, are confined to the sports of schoolboys. Of this nature are squibs, serpents, crackers, flares, sparks, marrows, saucelions, pin-wheels, leaders, and gerbies or Roman candles. Others are very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> in their structure, require considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and ingenuity, and form the amusement of fashionable circles on occasion of public rejoicings or private festivity: Such are rockets of various kinds, wheels, fans, globes, balloons, pyramids, &c. We shall first describe the more simple kinds, and then give an account of the method of constructing those of a more complex nature.\n\nSECT. I. Of Simple Fire-works.\n\nAs in the subsequent directions for fire-works, we shall have frequent occasion to mention <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> commonly called leaders, by which the several parts of a compound fire-work are connected with each other, it will be proper to show how these are constructed. Leaders consist of small tubes of paper of different lengths, according to the distance to which they must extend; and these tubes are filled with a combustible composition that will not burn too fast.\n\nThe best paper for leaders is that called elephant; which is cut into long slips 2 or 3 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, so that they may go 3 or 4 times round the former, but not more; when they are very thick, they are too strong.\nfor the paper which fastens them to the works, and will sometimes fly off without leading the fire. The formers for these leaders are made from 2 to 6-16ths of an inch diameter; but 4-16ths is the size generally used. The formers are made of smooth brals wire: when used, rub them over with grease, or keep them wet with paste, to prevent their sticking to the paper, which must be pasted all over. In rolling pipes, make use of a rolling-board, but use it lightly: having rolled a pipe, draw out the former with one hand, holding the pipe as light as possible with the other; for if it presses against the former, it will stick and tear the paper.\n\nN.B. Make the leaders of different lengths, or in clothing works many will be wasted. Leaders for marron batteries must be made of strong cartridge paper.\n\nJoining and placing leaders is a very essential part of fire-works, as it is on the leaders that the performance of all complex works depend; for which reason the method of conducting pipes of communication shall be here explained in as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> a manner as possible. Your works being ready to be clothed, proceed thus: Cut your pipes of a sufficient length to reach from one cafe to the other; then put in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUICK_MATCH\">quick-match</a>, which must always be made to go in very easy: when the match is in, cut it off within about an inch of the end of the pipe, and let it project as much at the other end; then fasten the pipe to the mouth of each cafe with a pin, and put the loose ends of the match into the mouths of the cafes, with a little meal-powder: this done to all the cafes, paste over the mouth of each two or three bits of paper. The preceding method is used for large cafes, and the following for small, and for illuminations: First thread a long pipe; then lay it on the tops of the cafes, and cut a bit off the under side, over the mouth of each cafe, so that the match may appear: then pin the pipe to every other cafe; but before you put on the pipes, put a little meal powder in the mouth of each cafe. If the cafes thus clothed are port-fires on illuminated works, cover the mouth of each cafe with a single paper; but if they are choked cafes, situated so that a number of sparks from other works may fall on them before they are fired, secure them with three or four papers, which must be pasted on very smooth, that there may be no creases for the sparks to lodge in, which often set fire to the works before their time. Avoid as much as possible placing the leaders too near, or one across the other so as to touch, as it may happen that the flash of one will fire the other; therefore if your works should be formed that the leaders must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> or touch, be sure to make them very strong, and secure at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, and at every opening.\n\nWhen a great length of pipe is required, it must be made by joining several pipes in this manner: Having put on one length of match as many pipes as it will hold, paste paper over every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>; but, if a still greater length is required, more pipes must be joined, by cutting about an inch off one side of each pipe near the end, and laying the quick-match together, and tying them fast with small twine; after which, cover the joining with pasted paper.\n\nOne of the simplest fire-works is what is called a serpent, which consists of a cylindrical paper cafe, about 4 or 5 inches long, and not made very thick. AC, fig. 19, represents the usual form of the serpent, except that in general they have not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> in the middle, represented in this figure. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> serpent has been given to this fire-work, either from the hissing noise which it makes when fired, or from the zigzag or undulating direction in which it moves, when properly constructed. The cafe or cartridge is rolled round a cylindrical stick, rather larger than a goose quill, and provided at one end with a narrow appendage, such as that used for rockets, fig. 3, by means of which it is choaked at one end. This cafe is filled about half way with some of the compositions described for making small rockets, see No. 30, rammed moderately hard in the proper mould, and then it is either choaked in the middle, or some obstrucding body, such as a small piece of paper, is introduced, and the remainder of the cafe is filled with grained or corn powder. Lastly, this other extremity is well secured with twine, and commonly dipped into melted pitch; a little moistened meal powder is introduced into the extremity next the choak, and a piece of touch paper being properly fastened on this end, the serpent is complete.\n\nCrackers are composed of a pretty long paper cafe, filled with the proper composition, as will be described immediately, and folded up in such a manner as, when fired, to make successive reports at short intervals. To construct these crackers, cut some cartridge paper into pieces 3/4 inches broad, and one foot long; one edge of each fold down length-wise about 1/4 of an inch broad; then fold the double edge down 1/4 of an inch, and turn the single edge back half over the double fold; then open it, and lay all along the channel, which is formed by the folding of the paper, some meal-powder; then fold it over and over till all the paper is doubled up, rubbing it down every turn; this done, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> it backwards and forwards, 2 inches and a half, or thereabouts, at a time, as oft as the paper will allow; then hold all these folds flat and close, and with a small pinching cord give one turn round the middle of the cracker, and pinch it close; then bind it with a packthread as tight as possible; then, in the place where it was pinched, prime one end of it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> it with touch-paper. When these crackers are fired, they will give a report at every turn of the paper: if you would have a great number of reports, the paper must be cut longer, or join them after they are made; but if they are made very long before they are pinched, you must have a piece of wood with a groove in it, deep enough to let in half the cracker; this will hold it straight while it is pinching. Fig. 20, represents a cracker complete.\n\nStars are small balls, prepared of a composition which emits a brilliant, radiating light, and are much employed in the construction of rockets, Roman candles, and similar fire-works. They are made of various sizes, but generally about as large as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a> bullet. Compositions for stars have been described in No. 31 and 34. The ingredients must be thoroughly incorporated, and in forming the ball, unless the paste is sufficiently glutinous, it must be wrapped up in a piece of paper, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> rag, tied closely round with pack thread, and a hole must be pierced through its middle for the insertion of a piece of match. These stars, when lighted, will exhibit a most beautiful appearance; for the fire, as it illus from the two ends of the hole in the middle, will extend to...\nVarieties a great distance, and thus make the fiery ball appear of Construction much larger.\n\n**Strong flares.** First take some thin paper, and cut it into pieces of one inch and a half square, or thereabouts; then on each piece lay as much dry star composition as the paper will easily contain; then twist up the paper as tight as possible; when done, rub some paste on your hands, and roll the flares between them; then set them to dry: the flares being thus made, get some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> or fine tow, and roll a little of it over each flare; then paste the hand and roll the flares as before, and set them again to dry; when they are quite dry, with a piercer make a hole through the middle of each, into which run a cotton quick-match, long enough to hold 10 or 12 flares at 3 or 4 inches distance: but any number of stars may be strung together by joining the match.\n\n**Tailed flares.** These are called tailed flares, because there are a great number of sparks issuing from them, which represent a tail like that of a comet. Of these there are two sorts; which are rolled, and driven: when rolled, they must be moistened with a liquor made of half a pint of spirit of wine and half a gill of thin fixe, of this as much as will wet the composition enough to make it roll easy; when they are rolled, sift meal-powder over them, and set them to dry.\n\nWhen tailed flares are driven, the composition must be moistened with spirit of wine only, and not made so wet as for rolling: 1 and 2 oz. cafes, rolled dry, are best for this purpose; and when they are filled, unroll the cafe within 3 or 4 rounds of the charge, and all that are unrolled cut off; then paste down the loose edge: 2 or 3 days after the cafes are filled, cut them in pieces 5 or 6 8ths of an inch in length: then melt some wax, and dip one end of each piece into it, so as to cover the composition: the other end must be rubbed with meal-powder wetted with spirit of wine.\n\n**Driven flares.** Cafes for driven flares are rolled with paste, but are made of paper very thin. Before they are filled, damp the composition with spirit of wine that has had some camphor dissolved in it: ram them indifferently hard, so that the cafe be not broken or sacked; to prevent which, they should fit tight in the mould. They are driven in cafes of several sizes, from 8 drams to four oz. When they are filled in half ounce cafes, cut them in pieces of three fourths of an inch long; if 1 oz. cafes, cut them in pieces of 1 inch; if 2 oz. cafes, cut them in pieces of 1 and one fourth inch long; and if 4 oz. cafes, cut them in pieces of 1 inch and a half long: having cut the flares of a proper size, prime both ends with wet meal-powder. These flares are seldom put in rockets, they being chiefly intended for air balloons, and driven in cafes, to prevent the composition from being broken by the force of the blowing powder in the shell.\n\n**Rolling flares** are commonly made about the size of a musket ball; though they are rolled of several sizes, from the bigness of a pistol ball to 1 inch diameter; and sometimes very small, but are then called sparks. Great care must be taken in making flares, first, that the several ingredients are reduced to a fine powder; secondly, that the composition may be well worked and mixed. Before beginning to roll, take about a pound of composition, and wet it with the following liquid, enough to make it stick together and roll easy: Spirit of wine 1 quart, in which dissolve one fourth of an ounce of saltpetre. If a great quantity of composition be wetted at once, the spirit will evaporate, and leave it dry, before it is rolled into flares: having rolled up one proportion, shake the flares in meal-powder, and set them to dry, which they will do in 3 or 4 days; but if they should be wanted for immediate use, dry them in an earthen pan over a slow heat, or in an oven. It is very difficult to make the flares all of an equal size when the composition is taken up promiscuously with the fingers; but by the following method they may be made very exactly. When the mixture is moistened properly, roll it on a flat smooth stone and cut it into square pieces, making each square large enough for the flares intended. There is another method used by some to make flares, which is by rolling the composition in long pieces, and then cutting off the flare, so that each flare will be of a cylindrical form: but this method is not so good as the former; for, to make the composition roll this way, it must be made very wet, which makes the flares heavy, as well as weakens them. All flares must be kept as much from air as possible, otherwise they will grow weak and bad.\n\nSparks differ from flares, only in their size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, as they are made smaller than flares, and are sooner extinguished. The following is the most approved method of making them. Having put into an earthen vessel an ounce of mealed gunpowder, 3 oz. of powdered saltpetre, and 4 oz. of camphor, reduced to powder by rubbing it in a mortar with a little spirit of wine; pour over this mixture some weak gum water, or some weak brandy, in which some gum dragant has been dissolved, till the composition acquires the consistence of thick soup. Then take some lint or caddice, which has been boiled in brandy, vinegar, or with saltpetre, and afterwards dried and unravelled, and throw into the composition as much of it as is necessary to absorb the whole, taking care to stir it well. This matter is to be formed into small balls of about the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>, which being dried in the air, are to be sprinkled with meal gunpowder, that they may more readily take fire.\n\nAnother method of making sparks is, to take some saw dust of any wood that burns readily, such as fir, and boil it in water that has been saturated with saltpetre. When it has been boiled for some time, the vessel is to be removed from the fire, and the solution of nitre poured off, so as to leave the saw dust at the bottom. The saw dust thus impregnated with nitre, is then to be poured on a table, and, while moist, to be sprinkled with powdered sulphur, to which a little bruised gunpowder has been added; and when the whole is well mixed, and of a proper consistence, sparks are to be made of it as before.\n\nMarrows are small boxes made either of paper or pasteboard, and of a roundish or cubical form, so prepared as when fired to make a loud and sudden report. They are usually employed, either as appendages to other fire-works, or a great many of them are arranged, as to explode successively at certain intervals.\n\nFormers for marrows are from three fourths of an inch to one and a half diameter; but the paper for the cafes twice the diameter of the former broad, and long enough to go three times round. When you have rolled a cafe, paste down the edge and tie one end close; then with the former drive it down to take away the wrin-\nVarieties kles, and make it flat at bottom; then fill the case with corn-powder one diameter and one fourth high, and fold down the rest of the case tight on the powder. The maroon being thus made, wax some strong pack-thread with flue-makers wax: this thread wind up in a ball, then unwind two or three yards of it, and that part which is near the ball make fast to a hook; then take a maroon, and stand as far from the hook as the pack-thread will reach, and wind it lengthwise round the maroon as close as possible, till it will hold no more that way; then turn it, and wind the pack-thread on the short way, then lengthwise again, and so on till the paper is all covered; then make fast the end of the pack-thread, and beat down both ends of the maroon to bring it in shape. The method of firing maroons is by making a hole at one end with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AWL\">awl</a>, and putting in a piece of quick-match; then taking a piece of strong paper, in which wrap up the maroon with two leaders, which must be put down to the vent, and the paper tied tight round them with small twine: these leaders are bent on each side, and their loose ends tied to the other maroons, and are nailed in the middle to the rail of the stand, as in fig. 21. The use of winding the pack-thread in a ball is, that it may be let out as wanted, according to the quantity the maroon may require; and that it may not be tied in knots, which would spoil the maroon. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> maroons are, by the French, called Sautefons, as they are supposed to resemble a fusilade.\n\nBatteries of Maroons.\u2014These, if well managed, will keep time to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, or a slow piece of music. Maroon batteries are made of several stands, with a number of cross rails for the maroons; which are regulated by leaders, by cutting them of different lengths, and nailing them tight, or loose, according to the time of the music. In maroon batteries you must use the large and small maroons, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a> for the pipes must have flat heads.\n\nThe proper maroon boxes are made of strong pasteboard, cut as represented in fig. 22., so as to fold up in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a>, one side of which is to be left unenclosed till the box be filled. The cavity being filled with gun-powder, strong paper is to be pasted over the box in various directions, and the whole is to be wrapped round with strong pack thread dipt in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>. Lastly, a hole is to be made in the corner of the box, and a piece of match introduced, by which it may be fired.\n\nSometimes it is required to render maroons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a>, or to prepare them in such a way, that they shall emit a brilliant light before they burst. To effect this, they are to be covered on the outside with one of the compositions directed for stars, and then rolled in bruised gunpowder.\n\nFor Pin-Wheels.\u2014First roll some paper pipes, about 14 inches long each; these pipes must not be made thick of paper, two or three rounds of elephant paper being sufficient. When the pipes are thoroughly dried, you must have a tin tube 12 inches long, to fit easy into the pipes; at one end of this tube fix a small conical cup, called a funnel; then bend one end of one of the pipes, and put the funnel in at the other as far as it will reach, and fill the cup with composition; then draw out the funnel by a little at a time, shaking it up and down, and it will fill the pipe as it comes out.\n\nHaving filled some pipes, have some small circular blocks made about one inch diameter and half an inch high: round one of these blocks wind and paste a pipe, and to the end of this pipe join another; which must be done by twisting the end of one pipe to a point, and pasting it into the end of the other with a little paste: in this manner join four or five pipes, winding them one upon the other so as to form a spiral line. Having wound on your pipes, paste two slips of paper across them to hold them together: besides these slips of paper, the pipes must be pasted together.\n\nThere is another method of making these wheels, viz. by winding on the pipes without paste, and sticking them together with sealing-wax at every half turn; so that when they are fired, the end will fall loose every time the fire pastes the wax, by which means the circle of fire will be considerably increased. The formers for these pipes are made from one and a half to 4-16ths of an inch diameter; and the composition for them is as follows: Meal-powder 8 oz. saltpetre 2 oz. and sulphur 1 oz.: among these ingredients may be mixed a little steel-filings or the dust of cast iron: this composition should be very dry, and not made too fine, or it will stick in the funnel. These wheels may be fitted on a large pin, and held in the hand with safety.\n\nThere is a pleasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> frequently added to shower of rockets, called a shower of fire, rain, or rain fall, and it is called gold or silver rain, according as its colour is more or less intense. It consists of several small cases filled with a brilliant composition, such as the following variety of Chinese fire, viz. meal powder 1 pound, flower of sulphur 2 oz. and iron sand of the first order, 5 oz.\n\nGold and silver rain compositions are rammed in cases that are pinched quite close at one end: if rolled dry, 4 or 5 rounds of paper will be strong enough; but if they are pasted, 3 rounds will do; and the thin fort of cartridge-paper is best for those small cases, in rolling which you must not turn down the inside edge as in other cases, for a double edge would be too thick for so small a bore. The moulds for rain-falls should be made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, and turned very smooth in the inside; or the cases, which are so very thin, would tear in coming out; for the charge must be rammed in tight; and the better the case fits the mould, the more driving it will bear. These moulds have no nipple, but instead of it they are made flat. As it would be very tedious and troublesome to shake the composition out of such small ladies as are used for these cases, it will be necessary to have a funnel made of thin tin, to fit on the top of the case, by the help of which they may be filled very fast. For single rain-falls for 4 oz. rockets, let the diameter of the former be 2-16ths of an inch, and the length of the case 2 inches; for 8 oz. rockets, 4-16ths and 2 diameters of the rocket long; for 1 lb. rockets, 5-16ths, and 2 diameters of the rocket long; for 2 lb. rockets, 5-16ths, and 3 inches and a half long; for 4 lb. rockets, 6-16ths, and 4 inches and a half long; and for 6-pounders, 7-16ths diameter, and 5 inches long.\n\nOf double rain-falls there are two sorts. For example, some appear first like a star, and then the rain; and some appear first like rain, and then like a star. When you would have stars first, you must fill the cases, within half an inch of the top, with rain-composition, and the remainder with star-composition; but when you intend\nVarieties tend the rain should be first, drive the case half an inch of star-composition, and the rest with rain. By this method may be made many changes of fire; for in large rockets you may make them first burn as stars, then rain, and again as stars; or they may first show rain, then stars, and finish with a report; but when thus managed, cut open the first rammed end, after they are filled and bounced, at which place prime them. The star-composition for this purpose must be a little stronger than for rolled stars.\n\nGerbes consist of a strong case of thick paper or pasteboard, filled with a brilliant composition, and generally with stars or balls placed at small distances, so that the composition and the balls are introduced alternately. Immediately below each ball is placed a little grained powder. These last gerbes are sometimes called Roman candles. When fired, they first throw up a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a> of flame, which in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> resembles a water-spout, whence the name. Gerbes are either employed singly, or batteries are formed of them, and frequently those filled with brilliant fire without balls, are placed in rows along the front of the frames of large compound fire-works. They are sometimes made perfectly cylindrical; at others they have a contracted part at the top called the neck.\n\nFig. 23. represents a wooden former; fig. 24. a gerbe complete, with its foot or stand. The cases for gerbes are made very strong, on account of the strength of the composition; which, when fired, comes out with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>; therefore, to prevent their bursting, the paper should be pasted, and the cases made as thick at the top as at the bottom. They should also have very long necks, for this reason; first, that the particles of iron will have more time to be heated, by meeting with greater resistance in getting out, than with a short neck, which would be burnt too wide before the charge be consumed, and spoil the effect; secondly, that with long necks the stars will be thrown to a great height, and will not fall before they are spent, or spread too much; but, when made to perfection, will rise and spread in such a manner as to form exactly a wheat sheaf.\n\nIn ramming of gerbes, there will be no need of a mould, the cases being sufficiently strong to support themselves. But you must be careful, before you begin to ram, to have a piece of wood made to fit in the neck; for if this be not done, the composition will fall into the neck, and leave a vacancy in the case, which will cause the case to burst as soon as the fire arrives at the vacancy. You must likewise observe, that the first ladleful of charge, or second, if proper, be of some weak composition. When the case is filled, take out the piece of wood, and fill the neck with some flow charge. Gerbes are generally made about six diameters long, from the bottom to the top of the neck; their bore must be one-fifth narrower at top than at bottom. The neck S is one-sixth diameter and three-fourths long. T, a wooden foot or stand, on which the gerbe is fixed. This may be made with a chock or cylinder four or five inches long to fit the inside of the case, or with a hole in it to put in the gerbe; both these methods will answer the same purpose. Gerbes produce a most brilliant fire, and are very beautiful when a number of them are fixed in the front of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> or a collection of fire-works.\n\nN.B. Gerbes are made by their diameters, and their cases at bottom one-fourth thick. The method of finding the interior diameter of a gerbe is this: Supposing the exterior diameter of the case, when made, to be five inches, then, by taking two-fourths for the sides of the case, there will remain 2\u00bd inches for the bore, which will be a very good size. These gerbes should be rammed very hard.\n\nSmall Gerbes, or white Fountains,\n\nMay be made of four ounces, eight ounces, or one pound cases, pasted and made very strong, of any length; but before they are filled, drive in clay one diameter of their orifice high; and when the case is filled, bore a vent through the centre of the clay to the composition; the common proportion will do for the vent, which must be primed with a flow charge. These cases, without the clay, may be filled with Chinese fire.\n\nSect. II. Of Compound Fire-works.\n\nAmong the most pleasing compound fire-works are Rockets, which are of various kinds. Some are made to ascend to a great height in the air, where they burst, and throw out the contents of the head with which they are provided. These are called sky-rockets. Others are so constructed as to run with great velocity along a line, and are called line-rockets. Some are arranged at the extremities of the spokes of a wheel, and are denominated wheel-rockets; while a fourth variety have their cases made water tight, and are filled with a very strong composition, so as to admit of their burning below water. These last are called water-rockets. Sky-rockets are tied to a stick, which renders their ascent into the air more equable and steady.\n\nFig. 25. represents a rocket complete without its sky-rock flick. Its length from the neck is five diameters one-eighth; the cases should always be cut to this length after Fig. 25. they are filled. M is the head, which is two diameters high, and one diameter one-sixth and a half in breadth; N the cone or cap, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height must be one diameter one-third. Fig. 26. the collar to which Fig. 26. the head is fixed: this is turned out of fir or any light wood, and its exterior diameter must be equal to the interior diameter of the head; one-sixth will be sufficient for its thickness, and round the outside edge must be a groove; the interior diameter of the collar must not be quite so wide as the exterior diameter of the rocket; when this is to be glued on the rocket, two or three rounds of paper must be cut off the case, which will make a shoulder for it to rest upon. Fig. 27. a former for the head: two or three rounds of paper well pasted will be enough for the head, which, when rolled, put the collar on that part of the former marked O, which must fit the inside of it; then, with the pinching cord pinch the bottom of the head into the groove, and tie it with small twine. Fig. 28. a former for the cone. Fig. 28. To make the caps, cut the paper in round pieces, equal in diameter to twice the length of the cone to be made; which pieces being cut into halves, will make two caps each, without wasting any paper; having formed the caps, paste over each of them a thin white paper, which must be a little longer than the cone, so as to project about half an inch below the bottom: this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of paper, being notched and pasted, serves to fasten the cap to the head.\nWhen you load the heads of the rockets with stars, rains, serpents, crackers, or any thing else, according to fancy, remember always to put one ladleful of meal-powder into each head, which will be enough to burst the head, and disperse the stars, or whatever it contains; when the heads are loaded with any cases, let their mouths be placed downwards; and, after the heads are filled, paste on the top of them a piece of paper before putting on the caps. As the size of the stars often differs, it would be needless to give an exact number for each rocket; but this rule may be observed, that the heads may be nearly filled with whatever they are to contain.\n\nDimensions and Poise of Rocket-sticks.\n\n| Weight of the Rocket | Length of the stick | Thickness at top | Breadth at top | Square at bottom | Poise from the point of the cone |\n|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|\n| lb oz.               | Ft. in.            | Inches          | Inches        | Inches          | Ft. in.                        |\n| 6 0                  | 14 0               | 1,5             | 1,85          | 2,75            | 4 1,5                          |\n| 4 0                  | 12 10              | 1,25            | 1,40          | 0,625           | 3 9                            |\n| 2 0                  | 9 4                | 1,125           | 1             | 0,525           | 2 9                            |\n| 1 0                  | 8 2                | 0,725           | 0,80          | 0,375           | 2 1                            |\n| 8                    | 6 6                | 0,5             | 0,70          | 0,25            | 1 10,5                         |\n| 4                    | 5 3                | 0,375           | 0,55          | 0,33            | 1 8,5                          |\n| 2                    | 4 1                | 0,3             | 0,45          | 0,15            | 1 3                            |\n| 1                    | 3 6                | 0,25            | 0,35          | 0,10            | 1 0                            |\n| \u00bd                    | 2 4                | 0,125           | 0,20          | 0,16            | 8 0                            |\n| \u00bc                    | 1 10\u00bd              | 0,1             | 0,15          | 0,5             | 5 0,5                          |\n\nThe last column on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, in the above table, expresses the distance from the top of the cone, where the stick, when tied on, should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> the rocket, so as to stand in an equilibrium on one's finger, or the edge of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>. The best wood for the sticks is dry fir, and they are thus made: When you have cut and planed the stick according to the dimensions given in the table, cut, on one of the flat sides at the top, a groove the length of the rocket, and as broad as the stick will allow; then on the opposite flat side, cut two notches for the cord, which ties on the rocket, to lie in; one of these notches must be near the top of the stick, and the other facing the neck of the rockets; the distance between these notches may easily be known, for the top of the stick should always touch the head of the rocket. When the rockets and sticks are ready, lay the rockets in the grooves in the sticks, and tie them on. Those who, merely for curiosity, may choose to make rockets of different sizes from those expressed in the table of dimensions, may find the length of their sticks, by making them for rockets, from half an ounce to one pound, 60 diameters of the rocket long; and for rockets above one pound 50 or 52 diameters will be a good length; their thickness at top may be about half a diameter, and their breadth a very little more; their square at bottom is generally equal to half the thickness at top. But although the dimensions of the sticks be very nicely observed, we can depend only on their balance; for, without a proper counterpoise, the rockets, instead of mounting perpendicularly, will take an oblique direction, and fall to the ground before they are burnt out.\n\nRockets rammed over a piercer must not have too much composition put into them at a time as when rammed solid; for the piercer, taking up great part of the bore of the case, would cause the rammer to rise too high; so that the pressure of it would not be so great on the composition, nor would it be rammed everywhere method of equal. To prevent this, observe the following rule: ramming That for those rockets which are rammed over a piercer, let the ladle hold as much composition as, when drove, will raise the drift one-half the interior diameter of the case, and for those rammed solid to contain as much as will raise it one-half the exterior diameter of the case; ladles are generally made to go easy in the case, and the length of the scoop about one and a half of its own diameter.\n\nThe charge of rockets must always be rammed one diameter above the piercer, and on it must be rammed one-third of a diameter of clay; through the middle of which bore a small hole to the composition, that, when the charge is burnt to the top, it may communicate its fire, through the hole, to the stars in the head. Great care must be taken to strike with the mallet, and with an equal force, the same number of strokes to each ladleful of charge; otherwise the rockets will not rise with an uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, nor will the composition burn equally and regularly; for which reason they cannot carry a proper tail; for it will break before the rocket has got half way up, instead of reaching from the ground to the top, where the rocket breaks and disperses the stars, rains, or whatever is contained in the head. When ramming, keep the drift constantly turning or moving; and when you use the hollow rammers, knock out of them the composition now and then, or the piercer will split them. To a rocket of four ounces, give to each ladleful of charge, 16 strokes; to a rocket of one pound, 28; to a two pounder, 36; to a four pounder, 42; and to a six pounder, 56; but rockets of a larger fort cannot be rammed well by hand, but must be rammed with a machine made in the same manner as those for driving piles.\n\nThe method of ramming wheel cases, or any other fort, in which the charge is rammed solid, is much the same as in sky-rockets; for the same proportion may be observed in the ladle, and the same number of strokes given, according to their diameters, all cases being distinguished by their diameters. In this manner, a case whose bore is equal to a rocket of four ounces, is called a four ounce case, and that which is equal to an eight ounce rocket an eight ounce case, and so on, according to the different rockets.\n\nHaving taught the method of ramming cases in moulds, we shall here lay something concerning those filled without moulds; which method, for strong paffed cases, will do extremely well, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the expense of making so many moulds. The reader must here observe, when filling any cases, to place the mould on a perpendicular block of wood, and not on any place that is hollow; for we have found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that when cases were rammed on driving benches, which were formerly used, the works frequently miscarried, on account of the hollow resillance of the benches, which often jarred and loosened the change in the cases; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> never happens when the driving blocks are used.\n\nWhen cases are to be filled without moulds, proceed thus: Have some nipples made of brass or iron,\nVarieties of several sizes, in proportion to the cases, and to screw or fix in the top of the driving block; when you have fixed in a nipple, make, at about one inch and a half from it, a square hole in the block, fix inches deep and one inch diameter; then have a piece of wood, fix inches longer than the case intended to be filled, and two inches square; on one side of it cut a groove almost the length of the case, whose breadth and depth must be sufficient to cover near one-half of the case; then cut the other end to fit the hole in the block, but take care to cut it so that the groove may be of a proper distance from the nipple; this half mould being made and fixed tight in the block, cut, in another piece of wood nearly of the same length as the case, a groove of the same dimensions as that in the fixed piece; then put the case on the nipple, and with a cord tie it and the two half moulds together, and the case will be ready for filling.\n\nThe dimensions of the above-described half-moulds are proportionable for cases of eight ounces, but notice must be taken, that they differ in size in proportion to the cases.\n\nThe best wood for mallets is dry beech. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> uses a mallet of moderate size, in proportion to the rocket, according to his judgement, and if the rocket succeeds, he may depend on the rest, by using the same mallet; yet it will be necessary that cases of different sorts be driven with mallets of different sizes.\n\nThe following proportion of the mallets for rockets of any size, from one oz. to six lb., may be observed; but as rockets are seldom made less than one oz. or larger than six lb., we shall leave the management of them to the curious; but all cases under one oz. may be rammed with an ounce rocket mallet. The mallets will strike more solid, by having their handles turned out of the same piece with the head, and made in a cylindrical form. Let their dimensions be worked by the diameters of the rockets: for example; let the thickness of the head be three diameters, and its length four, and the length of the handle five diameters, whole thickness must be in proportion to the hand.\n\nAs the cause which occasions the ascent of a rocket into the air is the same as that which makes a musket <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> when fired, it will be proper, before explaining the ascent of rockets, to show how the recoil of fire-arms is produced. When the powder is suddenly inflamed in the chamber, or at the bottom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>, it necessarily exercises an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> two ways at the same time; that is to say, against the breech of the piece, and against the bullet or wadding, which is placed above it. Besides this, it acts also against the sides of the chamber which it occupies; and as they oppose a resistance almost insurmountable, the whole effort of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid, produced by the inflammation, is exerted in the two directions above mentioned. But the resistance opposed by the bullet, being much less than that opposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the barrel or cannon, the bullet is forced out with great velocity. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, however, that the body of the piece itself should not experience a movement backwards; for if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> is suddenly let loose, between two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> obstacles, it will impel them both, and communicate to them velocities in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of their masses; the piece, therefore, must acquire a velocity backwards nearly in the inverse ratio of its mass to that of the bullet. We make use of the term nearly, because there are various circumstances which give to this ratio certain modifications; but it is always true that the body of the piece is driven backwards, and that if it weighs with its carriage a thousand times more than the bullet, it acquires a velocity which is a thousand times less, and which is soon annihilated by the friction of the wheels against the ground, &c.\n\nThe cause of the ascent of a rocket is nearly the same. At the moment when the powder begins to inflame, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> produces a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> of elastic fluid, which acts in every direction; that is, against the air which opposes its escape from the cartridge, and against the upper part of the rocket; but the resistance of the air is more considerable than the weight of the rocket, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> rapidity with which the elastic fluid issues through the neck of the rocket to throw itself downwards, and therefore the rocket ascends by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the one of these forces above the other.\n\nThis however would not be the case, unless the rocket were pierced to a certain depth. A sufficient quantity of elastic fluid would not be produced; for the composition would inflame only in circular coats of a diameter equal to that of the rocket; and experience shows that this is not sufficient. Recourse then is had to the very ingenious idea of piercing the rocket with a conical hole, which makes the composition burn in conical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> which have much greater surface, and therefore produce a much greater quantity of inflamed matter and fluid. This expedient was certainly not the work of a moment.*\n\nWhen sky-rockets are fixed one on the top of another, they are called towering rockets, on account of their mounting so very high. Towering rockets are rocket made after this manner: Fix on a pound-rocket a head without a collar; then take a four ounce rocket, which may be headed or bounced, and rub the mouth of it with meal-powder wetted with spirit of wine: this done, put it in the head of the large rocket with its mouth downwards; but before it is put in, stick a bit of quick-match in the hole of the clay of the pound-rocket, which match should be long enough to go a little way up the bore of the small rocket, to fire it when the large rocket is burnt out. As the four ounce rocket is too small to fill the head of the other, roll round it as much tow as will make it stand upright in the centre of the head: the rocket being thus fixed, paste a single paper round the opening of the top of the head of the large rocket. The large rocket must have only half a diameter of charge rammed above the piercer; for, if filled to the usual height, it would turn before the small one takes fire, and entirely destroy the intended effect: when one rocket is headed with another, there will be no occasion for any blowing powder; for the force with which it goes off will be sufficient to disengage it from the head of the first fired rocket. The sticks for these rockets must be a little longer than for those headed with flars, rings, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADUCEUS\">Caduceus</a> rockets are such as, in rising, form two spiral lines, by reason of their being placed obliquely, one opposite to the other; and their counterpoise in their centre, which causes them to rise in a vertical direction. Rockets for this purpose must have their ends choked close, without either head or bounce, for a weight at top would be a great obstruction to their mounting. No caduceus rockets ascend so high as single, because of their...\ntheir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a> motion, and likewise the resistance of air, which is much greater than two rockets of the same size would meet with if fired singly.\n\nFig. 30. shews the method of fixing these rockets; the sticks for this purpose must have all their sides equal, and the sides should be equal to the breadth of a stick proper for a sky-rocket of the same weight as those you intend to use, and made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> downwards as usual, long enough to balance them, one length of a rocket from the cross stick; which must be placed from the large stick six diameters of one of the rockets, and its length seven diameters; so that each rocket, when tied on, may form with the large stick an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 60 degrees. In tying on the rockets, place their heads on the opposite sides of the cross stick, and their ends on the opposite sides of the long stick; then carry a leader from the mouth of one into that of the other. When these rockets are to be fired, suspend them between two hooks or nails, then burn the leader through the middle, and both will take fire at the same time. Rockets of one lb. are a good size for this use.\n\nHonorary rockets are the same as sky-rockets, except that they carry no head nor report, but are closed at top, on which is fixed a cone; then on the case, close to the top of the stick is tied on a two ounce case, about five or six inches long, filled with a strong charge, and pinched close at both ends; then in the reverse sides, at each end, bore a hole in the same manner as in tourbillons, to be presently described; from each hole carry a leader into the top of the rocket. When the rocket is fired, and arrived to its proper height, it will give fire to the case at top; which will cause both rocket and stick to spin very fast in their return, and represent a worm of fire descending to the ground.\n\nThere is another method of placing the small case, which is by letting the stick rise a little above the top of the rocket, and tying the case to it, so as to rest on the rocket; these rockets have no cones.\n\nA third method by which they are managed is this: In the top of a rocket fix a piece of wood, in which drive a small iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>; then make a hole in the middle of the small case, through which put the spindle; then fix on the top of it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>, to keep the case from falling off; when this is done, the case will turn very fast, without the rocket; but this method does not answer so well as either of the former.\n\nFig. 31. is the honorary rocket complete. The best sized rockets for this purpose are those of one lb.\n\nHaving some rockets made, and headed according to fancy, and tied on their sticks; get some sheet tin, and cut it into round pieces about three or four inches diameter; then on the stick of each rocket, under the mouth of the case, fix one of these pieces of tin 16 inches from the rocket's neck, and support it by a wooden bracket, as strong as possible: the use of this is, that when the rocket is ascending the fire may play with great force on the tin, which will divide the tail in such a manner that it will form an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> as it mounts, and will have a very good effect when well managed; if there is a short piece of port-fire, of a strong charge, tied to the end of the stick, it will make a great addition; but this must be lighted before the rocket is fired.\n\nTake six, or any number of sky-rockets, of any size; then cut some strong packthread into pieces of three or four yards long, and tie each end of these pieces to a rocket in this manner: Having tied one end of the Varieties packthread round the body of one rocket, and the other end to another, take a second piece of packthread and make one end of it fast to one of the rockets already tied, and the other end to a third rocket, so that all the rockets, except the two on the outside, will be fastened to two pieces of packthread: the length of thread from one rocket to the other may be what the maker pleases; but the rockets must be all of a size, and their heads filled with the same weight of stars, rains, &c.\n\nHaving thus done, fix in the mouth of each rocket a leader of the same length; and when about to fire them, hang them almost close; then tie the ends of the leaders together, and prime them: this prime being fired, all the rockets will mount at the same time, and divide as far as the strings will allow; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> they will keep, provided they are all rammed alike, and well made. They are sometimes called chained rockets.\n\nSignal rockets are made of several kinds, according to the different signals intended to be given; but in artificial fire works, two sorts are only used, which are one with reports and the other without; but those for the use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> are headed with stars, serpents, &c.\u2014Rockets which are to be bounced must have their cases made one and a half or two diameters longer than the common proportion; and after they are filled, drive in a double quantity of clay, then bounce and pinch them after the usual manner, and fix on each a cap.\n\nSignal sky-rockets without bounces, are only sky-rockets closed and capped: these are very light, therefore do not require such heavy sticks as those with loaded heads; for which reason the rocket may be cut from the stick, or else be made thinner.\n\nSignal rockets with reports are fired in small flights; and often both these, and those without reports, are used for a signal to begin firing a collection of works.\n\nTwo, three, or six sky-rockets, fixed on one stick, and fired together, make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and beautiful appearance; for the tails of all will seem but as one of an immense size, and the breaking of so many heads at once, same stick, will resemble the bursting of an air-balloon. The management of this device requires a skilful hand; but if the following instructions be well observed, even by those who have not made a great progress in this art, there will be no doubt of the rockets having the desired effect.\n\nRockets for this purpose must be made with the greatest exactness, all rammed by the same hand, in the same mould, and filled with the same proportion of composition; and after they are filled and headed, must all be of the same weight. The stick must also be well made (and proportioned) to the following directions: first, supposing the rockets to be half pounders, whose sticks are six feet six inches long, then if two, three, or six of these are to be fixed on one stick, let the length of it be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet nine inches: then cut the top of it into as many sides as there are rockets, and let the length of each side be equal to the length of one of the rockets without its head; and in each side cut a groove (as usual); then from the grooves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> it round, down to the bottom, where its thickness must be equal to half the top of the round part. As their thickness cannot be exactly ascertained, we shall give a rule which generally answers\nVarieties for any number of rockets above two: the rule is this; that the stick at top must be thick enough, when the grooves are cut, for all the rockets to lie, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> each other, though as near as possible.\n\nWhen only two rockets are to be fixed on one stick, let the length of the stick be the half given proportion, but shaped after the common method, and the breadth and thickness double the usual dimensions. The point of poise must be in the usual place (let the number of rockets be what they will): if sticks made by the above directions should be too heavy, plane them thinner; and if too light, make them thicker; but always make them of the same length.\n\nWhen more than two rockets are tied on one stick, there will be some danger of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> up without the stick, unless the following precaution is taken: For cases being placed on all sides, there can be no notches for the cord which ties on the rockets to lie in; therefore, instead of notches, drive a small nail in each side of the stick, between the necks of the cases; and let the cord, which goes round their necks, be brought close under the nails; by this means the rockets will be as secure as when tied on singly. The rockets being thus fixed, carry a quick-match, without a pipe, from the mouth of one rocket to the other; this match being lighted will give fire to all at once.\n\nThough the directions already given may be sufficient for these rockets, we shall here add an improvement on a very essential part of this device, which is, that of hanging the rockets to be fired; for before the following method was contrived, many attempts proved unsuccessful. Instead, therefore, of the old and common manner of hanging them on nails or hooks, make use of the following contrivance: Have a ring made of strong iron wire large enough for the stick to go in as far as the mouths of the rockets; then have another ring supported by a small iron, at some distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> or stand to which it is fixed: then have another ring fit to receive and guide the small end of the stick. Rockets thus suspended will have nothing to obstruct their fire; but when they are hung on nails or hooks, in such a manner that some of their mouths are against or upon a rail, there can be no certainty of their rising in a vertical direction.\n\nTo fire rockets without sticks, you must have a stand, of a block of wood, a foot diameter, and make the bottom flat, so that it may stand steady: in the centre of the top of this block draw a circle two inches and a half diameter, and divide the circumference of it into three equal parts; then take three pieces of thick iron wire, each about three feet long, and drive them into the block, one at each point made on the circle; when these wires are driven in deep enough to hold them fast and upright, so that the distance from one to the other is the same at top as at bottom, the stand is complete.\n\nThe stand being thus made, prepare the rockets thus: Take some common sky-rockets of any size, and head them as you please; then get some balls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and tie to each a small wire two or two feet and a half long, and the other end of each wire tie to the neck of a rocket. These balls answer the purpose of sticks when made of a proper weight, which is about two-thirds the weight of the rocket; but when they are of a proper size, they will balance the rocket in the same manner as a stick, at the usual point of poise. To fire these, hang them, one at a time, between the tops of the wires, letting their heads rest on the point of the wires, and the balls hang down between them: if the wires should be too wide for the rockets, press them together till they fit; and if too close, force them open; the wires for this purpose must be softened, so as not to have any spring, or they will not keep their position when pressed close or opened.\n\nCases for scrolls should be made four or five inches in length, and their interior diameters three-eighths of an inch: one end of these cases must be pinched quite close before beginning to fill; and when filled close, the other end: then in the opposite sides make a small hole at each end, to the composition, as in tourbillons; and prime them with wet meal-powder. You may put in the head of a rocket as many of these cases as it will contain: being fired they turn very quick in the air, and form a scroll or spiral line. They are generally filled with a strong charge, as that of serpents or brilliant fire.\n\nRockets that pass under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of swarmers, are those from two ounces downwards. These rockets are fired sometimes in flights, and in large waterworks, &c. Swarmers of one and two ounces are bored, and made in the same manner as large rockets, except that, when headed, their heads must be put on without a collar: the number of strokes for driving one ounce must be eight, and for two ounces twelve.\n\nAll rockets under one ounce are not bored, but must be filled to the usual height with composition, which generally consists of fine meal-powder four ounces, and charcoal or steel-dust two drams: the number of strokes for ramming these small swarmers is not material, provided they are rammed truly, and moderately hard. The necks of unbored rockets must be in the same proportion as in common cases.\n\nCare must be taken, in placing the rockets, when they are to be fired, to give them a vertical direction at their points first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> out; which may be managed thus: Have two rails of wood, of any length, supported at each end by a perpendicular leg, so that the rails may be horizontal, and let the distance from one to the other be almost equal to the length of the sticks of the rockets intended to be fired; then in the front of the top rail drive square hooks at eight inches distance, with their points turning sidewise, so that when the rockets are hung on them, the points will be before the sticks and keep them from falling or being blown off by the wind; in the front of the rail at bottom must be staples, driven perpendicular under the hooks at top; through these staples put the small ends of the rocket sticks. Rockets are fired by applying a lighted port-fire to their mouths.\n\nN.B. When sky-rockets are made to perfection, and fired, they will stand two or three seconds on the hook before they rise, and then mount up briskly, with a steady motion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> a large tail from the ground all the way up, and just as they turn, break, and disperse the stars.\n\nGirandole chests are generally composed of four sides of equal dimensions; but may be made of any diameter-chests for ten, according to the number of rockets designed to be flights of fired; their height must be in proportion to the rockets, but must always be a little higher than the rockets with their sticks. When the sides are joined, fix in the top\nas far down the chest as the length of one of the rockets with its cap on. In this top, make as many square or round holes to receive the rocket sticks as there are to be rockets; but let the distance between them be sufficient for the rockets to stand without touching one another; then from one hole to another cut a groove large enough for a quick match to lie in: the top being thus fixed, put in the bottom, at about one foot and a half distance from the bottom of the chest; in this bottom must be as many holes as in the top, and all to correspond: but these holes need not be so large as those in the top.\n\nTo prepare the chest, a quick match must be laid in all the grooves, from hole to hole: then take some sky-rockets, and rub them in the mouth with wet meal-powder, and put a bit of match up the cavity of each; which match must be long enough to hang a little below the mouth of the rocket. The rockets and chest being prepared according to the above directions, put the sticks of the rockets through the holes in the top and bottom of the chest, so that their mouths may rest on the quick-match in the grooves: by which all the rockets will be fired at once; for by giving fire to any part of the match, it will communicate to all the rockets in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>. As it would be rather troublesome to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the sticks from the top to the proper holes in the bottom, it will be necessary to have a small door in one of the sides, through which, when opened, you may see how to place the sticks. Flights of rockets being seldom let off at the beginning of any fire-works, they are in danger of being fired by the sparks from wheels, &c.; therefore, to preserve them, a cover should be made to fit on the chest, and the door in the side kept shut.\n\nLine-rockets are made and rammed as the sky-rockets, but have no heads, and the cases must be cut close to the clay; they are sometimes made with six or seven changes, but in general not more than four or five. The method of managing these rockets is the following: First, have a piece of light wood, the length of one of the rockets turned round about two inches and a half diameter, with a hole through the middle lengthwise, large enough for the line to go easily through; if four changes are intended, have four grooves cut in the swivel, one opposite the other, in which to lay the rockets.\n\nThe mouths of the rockets being rubbed with wet meal-powder, lay them in the grooves head to tail, and tie them fast; from the tail of the first rocket carry a leader to the mouth of the second, and from the second to the third, and so on to as many as there are on the swivel, making every leader very secure; but in fixing these pipes, take care that the quick-match does not enter the bores of the rockets: the rockets being fixed on the swivel and ready to be fired, have a line 100 yards long, stretched and fixed up tight, at any height from the ground; but be sure to place it horizontally: this length of line will do for half-pound rockets; but if larger, the line must be longer. Before you put up the line, put one end of it through the swivel; and when you fire the line rocket, let the mouth of that rocket which is first fired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> that end of the line where you stand; then the first rocket will carry the rest to the other end of the line, and the second will bring them back; and so they will run out and in according to the number of rockets: at each end of the line there must be a piece of flat wood for the rocket Varieties of Construction to strike against, or its force will cut the line. Let the line be well foamed, and the hole in the swivel very smooth.\n\nTo line rockets may be fixed a great variety of figures, such as flying dragons, Mercuries, ships, &c.; or coronations they may be made to run on the line like a wheel; for line which is done in this manner. Have a flat swivel made very exactly, and on it tie two rockets obliquely one on each side, which will make it turn round as it goes, and form a circle of fire; the charge for these rockets should be a little weaker than common. If you would show two dragons fighting, get two swivels made square, and on each tie three rockets together on the under side; then have two flying dragons made of tin, and fix one of them on the top of each swivel, so as to stand upright; in the mouth of each dragon put a small case of common fire, and another at the end of the tail; put two or three port-fires, of a strong charge, on one side of their bodies, to blow them. This done, put them on the line, one at each end; but let there be a swivel in the middle of the line to keep the dragons from striking together: before firing the rockets, light the cases on the dragons; and if care be taken in firing both at the same time, they will meet in the middle of the line, and seem to fight. Then they will run back and return with great violence, which will have a very pleasing effect. The line for these rockets must be very long, or they will strike too hard together.\n\nCases for Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLYERS\">flyers</a> may be made of different sizes, from one to eight ounces: they must be made thick Chinese of paper, and eight interior diameters long; they are rolled in the same manner as tourbillons, with a straight puffed edge, and pinched close at one end. The method of filling them is, the case being put in a mould, whose cylinder, or foot, must be flat at top without a nipple, fill it within half a diameter of the middle; then ram in half a diameter of clay, on that as much composition as before, on which drive half a diameter of clay; then pinch the case close, and drive it down flat: after this is done, bore a hole exactly through the centre of the clay in the middle; then in the opposite sides, at both ends, make a vent; and in that side intended to be fired first make a small hole to the composition near the clay in the middle, from which carry a quick-match, covered with a single paper, to the vent at the other end; then, when the charge is burnt on one side, it will, by means of the quick-match, communicate to the charge on the other (which may be of a different sort). The flyers being thus made, put an iron pin, that must be fixed in the work on which they are to be fired, and on which they are to run, through the hole in the middle; on the end of this pin must be a nut to keep the flyer from running off. If they are to turn back again after they are burnt, make both the vents at the ends on the same side, which will alter its course the contrary way.\n\nTable rockets are designed merely to show the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of driving, and the judgment of a fire-worker; they having no other effect, when fired, than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> round in the same place where they begin, till they are burnt out, and showing nothing more than an horizontal circle of fire.\n\nThe method of making these rockets is,\u2014Have a cone turned out of hard wood two inches and a half in diameter, and as much high; round the base of it drive a\nVarieties line; on this line fix four spokes, each two inches long, so as to stand one opposite the other; then fill four nine-inch one pound cases with any strong composition, within two inches of the top; these cases are made like tourbillons, and must be rammed with the greatest exactness.\n\nThe rockets being filled, fix their open ends on the short spokes; then in the side of each case bore a hole near the clay; all these holes, or vents, must be so made that the fire of each case may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> the same way; from these vents carry leaders to the top of the cone, and tie them together. When the rockets are to be fired, let them on a smooth table, and light the leaders in the middle, and all the cases will fire together (see fig. 32.) and spin on the point of the cone.\n\nThese rockets may be made to rise like tourbillons, by making the cases shorter, and boring four holes in the under side of each at equal distances: this being done they are called double tourbillons.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>. All the vents in the under side of the cases must be lighted at once; and the sharp point of the cone cut off, at which place make it spherical.\n\nFireworks called aerial globes or bombs consist of a spherical case made of strong paper, or of wood, prepared as will be immediately described, and thrown from a mortar commonly made of pateboard, with a copper chamber to contain the charge, such as AB, fig. 33. This small mortar must be made of light wood, or of paper pasted together, and rolled up in the form of a cylinder, or truncated cone, the bottom excepted; which, as already said, must be of wood. The chamber for the powder AC must be pierced obliquely, with a small gimlet, as seen at BC; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> B corresponding to the aperture of the metal mortar, in which this paper mortar must be placed when the globe is fired, the fire applied to the latter may be communicated to the powder which is at the bottom of the chamber AC, immediately below the globe. By these means the globe will catch fire and make an agreeable noise as it rises into the air; but it would not succeed so well if any vacancy were left between the powder and the globe.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFILE\">profile</a> or perpendicular section of such a globe is represented by the right-angled parallelogram ABCD, fig. 34.; the breadth of which AB is nearly equal to the height <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a>. The thickness of the wood towards the two sides L, M, is equal to about the twelfth part of the diameter of the globe; and the thickness E, F, of the cover, is double the preceding, or equal to a sixth part of the diameter. The height GK, or HI of the chamber GHIK, where the match is applied, and which is terminated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> LGKM, is equal to the fourth part of the breadth AB, and its breadth GH is equal to the fifth part of AR.\n\nWe must here observe, that it is dangerous to put wooden covers, such as EF, on aerial balloons or globes, for these covers may be so heavy as to wound those on whom they happen to fall. It will be sufficient to place turf or hay above the globe, in order that the powder may experience some resistance.\n\nThe globe must be filled with several pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a> or common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>, equal in length to the interior height of the globe, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with a slow composition, made of three ounces of pounded gunpowder, an ounce of sulphur moistened with a small quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETROLEUM\">petroleum</a> oil, and two ounces of charcoal; and in order that these reeds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANES\">canes</a> may catch fire sooner, and with more facility, they must be charged at the lower ends, which rest on the bottom of the globe, with pulverized gunpowder moistened in the same manner with petroleum oil, or well belfrinkled with brandy, and then dried.\n\nThe bottom of the globe ought to be covered with a little gunpowder half pulverized and half grained; which, when set on fire by means of a match applied to the end of the chamber GH, will set fire to the lower part of the reed. But care must have been taken to fill the chamber with a composition similar to that in the reeds, or with another slow composition made of eight ounces of gunpowder, four ounces of saltpetre, two ounces of sulphur, and one ounce of charcoal: the whole must be well pounded and mixed.\n\nInstead of reeds, the globe may be charged with running rockets, or paper petards, and a quantity of fiery stars or sparks mixed with the pulverized gunpowder, placed without any order above these petards, which must be choaked at unequal heights, that they may perform their effect at different times.\n\nThese globes may be constructed in various other ways, which it would be tedious here to enumerate. We shall only observe, that when loaded they must be well covered at the top; they must be wrapped up in a piece of cloth dipped in glue, and a piece of woollen cloth must be tied round them, so as to cover the hole which contains the match.\n\nFuzes for air balloons are sometimes turned out of dry beech, with a cup at top to hold the quick-match, or other firing material; but if made with pasted paper, they will do as well: the diameter of the form for fuzes for cochorn balloons must be half an inch; for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> fuze, five-eighths of an inch; for an eight inch fuze, three-fourths of an inch; and for a ten inch fuze, seven-eighths of an inch. Having rolled the cases, pinch and tie them almost close at one end: then drive them down, and let them dry. Before beginning to fill them, mark on the outside of the case the length of the charge required, allowing for the thickness of the bottom; and when the composition is rammed in, take two pieces of quick-match about six inches long, and lay one end of each on the charge, and then a little meal-powder, which ram down hard; the loose ends of the match double up into the top of the fuze, and cover it with a paper cap to keep it dry. When the shells are put into the mortars, uncap the fuzes, and pull out the loose ends of the match, and let them hang on the sides of the balloons. The use of the match is, to receive the fire from the powder in the chamber of the mortar, in order to light the fuze: the shell being put in the mortar with the fuze uppermost, and exactly in the centre, sprinkle over it a little meal-powder, and it will be ready to be fired. Fuzes made of wood must be longer than those of paper, and not bored quite through, but left solid about half an inch at bottom; and when used saw them off to a proper length, measuring the charge from the cup at top.\n\nTo make Tourbillons.\u2014Having filled some cases with Tourbillons in about one diameter and a half, drive in a ladleful of lons clay; then pinch the ends close, and drive them down with a mallet. When done, find the centre of gravity of each case; where the nail and stick are tied which should...\nVarieties should be half an inch broad at the middle, and run a little narrower to the ends; these sticks must have their ends turned upwards, so that the cafes may turn horizontally on their centres; at the opposite sides of the cafes, at each end, bore a hole close to the clay with a gimlet, the size of the neck of a common cafe of the same nature; from these holes draw a line round the cafe, and at the under part of the cafe bore a hole with the same gimlet, within half a diameter of each line towards the centre; then from one hole to the other draw a right line. Divide this line into three equal parts; and at X and Y (fig. 35) bore a hole; then from these holes to the other two lead a quick-match, over which paste a thin paper. Fig. 36 represents a tourbillon as it should lie to be fired, with a leader from one side hole A to the other B. When tourbillons are fired lay them on a smooth table, with their sticks downwards, and burn the leader through the middle with a portfire. They should spin three or four seconds on the table before they rise, which is about the time the composition will be burning from the side holes to those at bottom.\n\nTo tourbillons may be fixed reports in this manner: In the centre of the cafe at top make a small hole, and in the middle of the report make another; then place them together, and tie on the report, and with a single paper secure it from fire; this done, the tourbillon is completed. By this method you may fix on tourbillons small cones of stars, rains, &c., but be careful not to load them too much. One eighth of an inch will be enough for the thickness of the sticks, and their length equal to that of the cafes.\n\nMortars to throw aigrettes are generally made of pasteboard, of the same thickness as balloon mortars, and two diameters and a half long in the inside from the top of the foot: the foot must be made of elm without a chamber, but flat at top, and in the same proportion as those for balloon mortars; these mortars must also be bound round with a cord; sometimes eight or nine of these mortars, of about three or four inches diameter, are bound all together, so as to appear but one; but when they are made for this purpose, the bottom of the foot must be of the same diameter as the mortars, and only half a diameter high. The mortars being bound well together, fix them on a heavy solid block of wood. To load these mortars, first put on the inside bottom of each a piece of paper, and on it spread one ounce and a half of meal and corn powder mixed; then tie the serpents up in parcels with quickmatch, and put them in the mortar with their mouths downwards; but take care the parcels do not fit too tight in the mortars, and that all the serpents have been well primed with powder wetted with spirit of wine. On the top of the serpents in each mortar lay some paper or tow; then carry a leader from one mortar to the other all round, and then from all the outside mortars into that in the middle; these leaders must be put between the cafes and the sides of the mortar, down to the powder at bottom: in the centre of the middle mortar fix a fire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, or brilliant fountain, which must be open at bottom, and long enough to project out of the mouth of the mortar; then paste paper on the tops of all the mortars.\n\nMortars thus prepared are called a nef of serpents, as represented by fig. 37. When these mortars are to be fired, light the fire-pump C, which when consumed will communicate to all the mortars at once by means of the leaders. For mortars of 8, 9, or 10 inches diameter, the serpents should be made in one and two ounce cafes six or seven inches long, and fired by a leader brought out of the mouth of the mortar, and turned down the outside, and the end of it covered with paper, to prevent the sparks of the other works from setting it on fire. For a six-inch mortar, let the quantity of powder for firing be two ounces; for an eight-inch, two ounces and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>; and for a ten-inch, three ounces and three quarters. Care must be taken in these, as well as small mortars, not to put the serpents in too tight, for fear of bursting the mortars. These mortars may be loaded with flares, crackers, &c.\n\nIf the mortars, when loaded, are sent to any distance, or liable to be much moved, the firing powder should be secured from getting amongst the serpents, which would endanger the mortars, as well as hurt their performance. To prevent this, load the mortars thus: First put in the firing powder, and spread it equally about; then cut a round piece of blue touch-paper, equal to the exterior diameter of the mortar, and draw on it a circle equal to the interior diameter of the mortar, and notch it all round as far as that circle: then paste that part which is notched, and put it down the mortar close to the powder, and stick the pasted edge to the mortar: this will keep the powder always smooth at bottom, so that it may be moved or carried anywhere without receiving damage. The large single mortars are called pots des aigrettes.\n\nPots des Brins are formed of pasteboard, and must be rolled pretty thick. They are usually made three or four inches diameter, and four diameters long; and pinched with a neck at one end, like common cafes. A number of these are placed on a plank thus: Having fixed on a plank two rows of wooden pegs, cut in the bottom of the plank a groove the whole length under each row of pegs; then, through the centre of each peg, bore a hole down to the groove at bottom, and on every peg fix and glue a pot, whose mouth must fit tight on the peg; through all the holes run a quick match, one end of which must go into the pot, and the other into the groove, which must have a match laid in it from end to end, and covered with paper, so that when lighted at one end it may discharge the whole almost instantaneously: in all the pots put about one ounce of meal and corn powder; then in some put flares, and in others rains, snakes, serpents, crackers, &c., when they are all loaded, paste paper over their mouths. Two or three hundred of these pots being fired together make a very pretty show, by affording so great a variety of fires. Fig. 38. is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of pots des brins, with a leader A, by which they are fired.\n\nPots des Saucifions are generally fired out of large pots des mortars without chambers, the same as those for aigrettes, saucifions, only somewhat stronger. Saucifions are made of one and two ounce cafes, five or six inches long, and choked in the same manner as serpents. Half the number which the mortar contains must be driven one diameter and a half with composition, and the other half two diameters, so that when fired they may give two volleys of reports. But if the mortars are very strong, and will bear a sufficient charge to throw the saucifions very high, you may make three volleys of reports, by dividing the number of cafes into three parts, and making a difference\nVarieties difference in the height of the charge. After they are filled, pinch and tie them at top of the charge almost close; only leaving a small vent to communicate the fire to the upper part of the case, which must be filled with corn-powder very near the top; then pinch the end quite close, and tie it: after this is done, bind the case very tight with waxed packthread, from the choke at top of the composition to the end of the case; this will make the case very strong in that part, and cause the report to be very loud. Saucifions should be rolled a little thicker of paper than the common proportion. When they are to be put in the mortar, they must be primed in their mouths, and fired by a case of brilliant fire fixed in their centre.\n\nThe charge for these mortars should be one-sixth or one-eighth more than for pots des cigrettes of the same diameter.\n\nThere are different sorts of vertical wheels; some having their fells of a circular form, others of an hexagonal, octagonal, or decagonal form, or of any number of sides, according to the length of the cases you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> for the wheel: the spokes being fixed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NAVE\">nave</a>, nail slips of tin, with their edges turned up, so as to form grooves for the cases to lie in, from the end of one spoke to that of another; then tie the cases in the grooves head to tail, in the same manner as those on the horizontal water-wheel, so that the cases successively taking fire from one another, will keep the wheel in an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. Two of these wheels are very often fired together, one on each side of a building; and both lighted at the same time, and all the cases filled alike, to make them keep time together; as they will, if made by the following directions: In all the cases of both wheels, except the first, on each wheel drive two or three ladlesful of slow fire, in any part of the cases; but be careful to ram the same quantity in each case, and in the end of one of the cases, on each wheel, you may ram one ladlesful of dead-fire composition, which must be very lightly driven; you may also make many changes of fire by this method.\n\nLet the hole in the nave of the wheel be lined with bricks, and made to turn on a smooth iron spindle. On the end of this spindle let there be a nut, to screw off and on; when you have put the wheel on the spindle, screw on the nut, which will keep the wheel from flying off. Let the mouth of the first case be a little raised. See fig. 39. Vertical wheels are made from ten inches to three feet diameter, and the size of the cases must differ accordingly; four-ounce cases will do for wheels of 14 or 16 inches diameter, which is the proportion generally used. The best wood for wheels of all forts is a light and dry beech.\n\nHorizontal wheels are best when their fells are made circular; in the middle of the top of the nave must be a pintle, turned out of the same piece as the nave, two inches long, and equal in diameter to the bore of one of the cases of the wheel: there must be a hole bored up the centre of the nave, within half an inch of the top of the pintle. The wheel being made, nail at the end of each spoke (of which there should be six or eight) a piece of wood, with a groove cut in it to receive the case. Fix these pieces in such a manner that half the cases may incline upwards and half downwards, and that, when they are tied on, their heads and tails may come very nearly together; from the tail of one case to the mouth of the other carry a leader, which should be secured with palmed paper. Besides these pipes, it will be necessary to put a little meal-powder within the pasted paper, to blow off the pipe, that there may be no obstruction to the fire from the cases. By means of these pipes the cases will successively take fire, burning one upwards and the other downwards. On the pintle fix a case of the same fort as those on the wheel; this case must be fired by a leader from the mouth of the last case on the wheel, which case must play downwards: instead of a common case in the middle, you may put a case of Chinese fire, long enough to burn as long as two or three of the cases on the wheel.\n\nHorizontal wheels are often fired two at a time, and made to keep time like vertical wheels, only they are made without any flow or dead fire; 10 or 12 inches will be enough for the diameter of wheels with five spokes. Fig. 40 represents a wheel on fire, with the first case burning.\n\nSpiral wheels, are only double horizontal wheels, and spiral made thus: The nave must be about six inches long, and rather thicker than the single fort; instead of the pintle at top, make a hole for the case to be fixed in, and two sets of spokes, one set near the top of the nave, and the other near the bottom. At the end of each spoke cut a groove wherein you tie the cases, there being no fell; the spokes should not be more than two inches and a half long from the naves, so that the wheel may not be more than eight or nine inches diameter; the cases are placed in such a manner, that those at top play down, and those at bottom play up, but let the third or fourth case play horizontally. The case in the middle may begin with any of the others: six spokes will be enough for each set, so that the wheel may consist of 12 cases, besides that on the top: the cases fix inches each.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLURAL\">Plural</a> wheels are made to turn horizontally, and to plural consist of three sets of spokes, placed fix at top, at bottom, and four in the middle, which last must be a little shorter than the rest: let the diameter of the wheel be 10 inches; the cases must be tied on the ends of the spokes in grooves cut on purpose, or in pieces of wood nailed on the ends of the spokes, with grooves cut in them as usual: in clothing these wheels, make the upper set of cases play obliquely downwards, the bottom set obliquely upwards, and the middle set horizontally. In placing the leaders, they must be managed so that the cases may burn thus, viz. first up, then down, then horizontal, and so on with the rest. But another change may be made, by driving in the end of the eighth case two or three ladlesful of slow fire, to burn till the wheel has stopped its course; then let the other cases be fixed the contrary way, which will make the wheel run back again: for the case at top you may put a small gerbe; and let the cases on the spokes be short, and filled with a strong brilliant charge.\n\nIlluminated spiral wheel.\u2014First have a circular horizontal wheel made two feet diameter, with a hole quite through the nave; then take three thin pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, three feet long each, and three-fourths of an inch broad each: one end of each of these pieces nail to the fell of the wheel, at an equal distance from one another, and the other end nail to a block with a hole in its bottom, which must be perpendicular to that in the block of the wheel, but not so large. The wheel being thus made,\nhave a hoop planed down very thin and flat; then nail one end of it into the fell of the wheel, and wind it round the three sticks in a spiral line from the wheel to the block at top: on the top of this block fix a case of Chinese fire; on the wheel you may place any number of cases, which must incline downwards, and burn two at a time. If the wheel should consist of ten cases, you may let the illuminations and Chinese fire begin with the second cases. The spindle for this wheel must be a little longer than the cone, and made very smooth at top, on which the upper block is to turn, and the whole weight of the wheel to rest. See fig. 41.\n\nDouble spiral wheel.\u2014For this wheel the block, or nave, must be as long as the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, or spiral lines, but must be made very thin, and as light as possible. In this block must be fixed several spokes, which must diminish in length, from the wheel to the top, so as not to exceed the surface of a cone of the same height. To the ends of these spokes nail the worms, which must cross each other several times: clothe these worms with illuminations, the same as those on the single wheels; but the horizontal wheel you may clothe as you like. At top of the worm place a case of spur-fire, or an amber light, see fig. 42. This figure is shown without leaders, to prevent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> of lines.\n\nBalloon wheels are made to turn horizontally; they must be made two feet diameter, without any spokes; and very strong, with any number of sides. On the top of a wheel range and fix in pots, three inches diameter and seven inches high each, as many of these as there are cases on the wheel; near the bottom of each pot make a small vent; into each of these vents carry a leader from the tail of each case; load some of the pots with stars, and some with serpents, crackers, &c. As the wheels turn, the pots will successively be fired, and throw into the air a great variety of fires.\n\nFor fruitoni wheels first have a nave made nine inches long and three in diameter; near the bottom of this nave fix eight spokes, with a hole in the end of each, large enough to receive a two or four ounce case: each of these spokes may be 14 inches long from the block. Near the top of this block fix eight more of the same spokes, exactly over the others, but not so long by two inches. As this wheel is to run horizontally, all the cases in the spokes must play obliquely upwards, and all those in the spokes at bottom obliquely downwards. This being done, have a small horizontal wheel made with eight spokes, each five inches long from the block: on the top of this wheel place a case of brilliant fire: all the cases on this wheel must play in an oblique direction downwards, and burn two at a time, and those on the large wheel four at a time; that is, two of those in the top set of spokes, and two of those in the bottom set of spokes.\n\nThe four first cases on the large wheel, and the two first on the small, must be fired at the same time, and the brilliant fire at top at the beginning of the last cases. The cases of the wheels may be filled with a gray charge. When these wheels are completed, you must have a strong iron spindle, made four feet six inches long, and fixed perpendicularly on the top of a stand: on this put the large wheel, whose nave must have a hole quite through from the bottom to the top. This hole must be large enough to turn easily round the bottom of the spindle, at which place there must be a shoulder, to keep the wheel from touching the stand: at the top of the spindle put the small wheel, and join it to a large one with a leader, in order that they may be fired both together.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CASCADES\">Cascades</a> of fire are made of any size; but one made according to the dimensions of that shown in fig. 43, will be large enough for eight-ounce cases. Let the distance from A to B be three feet; from B to C two feet six inches; and from C to D two feet; and let the cross piece at A be four feet long: then from each end of this piece draw a line to D; then make the other cross pieces so long as to come within those lines. The top piece D may be of any length, so as to hold the cases, at a little distance from each other; all the cross pieces are fixed horizontally, and supported by brackets; the bottom cross piece should be about one foot six inches broad in the middle, the second one foot, the third nine inches, and the top piece four inches: the cases may be made of any length, but must be filled with a brilliant charge. On the edges of the cross pieces must be nailed bits of wood, with a groove cut in each piece, large enough for a case to lie in. These bits of wood are fixed so as to incline downwards, and that the fire from one tier of cases may play over that of the other. All the cases being tied fast on, carry leaders from one to the other; and let there be a pipe hung from the mouth of one of the cases, covered at the end with a single paper, which you burn to fire the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASCADE\">cascade</a>.\n\nThe Fire Tree.\u2014To make a fire tree, as shown by fig. 44, you must first have a piece of wood six feet long, and three inches square; then at E, nine inches from the top, make a hole in the front, and in each side; or, instead of holes, you may fix short pegs, to fit the inside of the cases. At F, nine inches from E, fix three more pegs; at G, one foot nine inches from F, fix three pegs; at H, nine inches from G, fix three pegs; at I, nine inches from H, fix three pegs, inclining downwards; but all the other pegs must incline upwards, that the cases may have the same inclination as is seen in the figure: then at top place a four-inch mortar, loaded with stars, rains, or crackers. In the middle of this mortar place a case filled with any sort of charge, but let it be fired with the other cases: a brilliant charge will do for all the cases; but the mortar may be made of any diameter, and the tree of any size; and on it any number of cases, provided they are placed in the manner described.\n\nChinese Fountains.\u2014To make a Chinese fountain, you must have a perpendicular piece of wood seven feet long and two inches and a half square. Sixteen inches from the top, fix on the front a cross piece one inch thick, and two and a half broad, with the broad side upwards; below this, fix three more pieces of the same width and thickness, at fifteen inches from each other; let the bottom rail be five feet long, and the others of such a length as to allow the fire-pumps to stand in the middle of the intervals of each other. The pyramid being thus made, fix in the holes made in the bottom rail five fire-pumps, at equal distances; on the second rail, place four pumps; on the third, three; on the fourth, two; and on the top of the post, one; but place them all to incline a little forwards, that, when they throw out the stars, they may not strike against the\nVarieties of Constructions.\n\nHaving fixed your fire-pumps, clothe them with leaders, so that they may all be fired together. See fig. 45.\n\nOf Illuminated Globes with Horizontal Wheels.\u2014The illuminated hoops for these globes may be made of wood, tin, or iron wire, about two feet in diameter. For a single globe, take two hoops, and tie them together, one within the other, at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>; then have a horizontal wheel made, whose diameter must be a little wider than the globe, and its nave fix inches long; on the top of which the globe is fixed, so as to stand three or four inches from the wheel: on this wheel you may put any number of cafes, filled with what charge you please; but let two of them burn at a time: they may be placed horizontally, or to incline downwards, just as you choose. Now, when the wheel is clothed, fix on the hoops as many illuminations as will stand within two inches and a half of each other: fasten these on the hoops with small iron binding wires; and when they are all on, put on the pipes of communication, which must be so managed as to light them all with the second or third cafe on the wheel. The spindle on which the globe is to run must go through the block of the wheel, up to the inside of the top of the globe; where must be fixed a bit of brass, or iron, with a hole in it to receive the point of the spindle, on which the whole weight of the wheel is to bear, as in fig. 46, which represents a globe on its spindle. By this method may be made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, which is done by having the hoops bent in the form of a crown. Sometimes globes and crowns are managed so as to stand still, and the wheel only to turn round; but when you would have the globe or crown to stand still, and the wheel to run by itself, the block of the wheel must not be so long, nor the spindle any longer than just to raise the globe a little above the wheels; and the wheel cafes and illumination must be kept together.\n\nThe Dodecahedron.\u2014So called because it nearly represents a twelve-sided figure, is made thus: First have a ball turned out of some hard wood, 14 inches diameter: divide its surface into 14 equal parts, from which bore holes one inch and a half diameter, perpendicular to the centre, so that they may all meet in the middle; then let there be turned in the inside of each hole a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> screw; and to all the holes but one must be made a round spoke five feet long, with four inches of the screw at one end to fit the holes; then in the screw-end of all the spokes bore a hole, five inches up, which must be bored slanting, so as to come out at one side, a little above the screw; from which cut a small groove along the spoke, within six inches of the other end, where make another hole through to the other side of the spoke. In this end fix a spindle, on which put a small wheel of three or four sides, each side fix or seven inches long; these sides must have grooves cut in them, large enough to receive a two or four ounce cafe. When these wheels are clothed, put them on the spindles, and at the end of each spindle put a nut to keep the wheel from falling off. The wheels being thus fixed, carry a pipe from the mouth of the first cafe on each wheel, through the hole in the side of the spoke, and from thence along the groove, and through the other hole, so as to hang out at the screw-end about an inch. The spokes being all prepared in this manner, you must have a post, on which you intend to fire the work, with an iron screw in the top of it, to fit one of the holes in the ball: on the screw fix the ball; then in the top hole of the ball put a little meal-powder, and some loose quick-match: then screw in all the spokes; and in one side of the ball bore a hole, in which put a leader, and secure it at the end; and the work will be ready to be fired. By the leader the powder and match in the centre is fired, which will light the match at the ends of the spokes all at once, whereby all the wheels will be lighted at once. There may be an addition to this piece, by fixing a small globe on each wheel, or one on the top wheel only. A gray charge will be proper for the wheel cafes.\n\nThe Yew Tree of brilliant Fire is represented by fig. 47, as it appears when burning. First, let A be an upright piece of wood, four feet long, two inches broad, and one thick: at top of the piece, on the flat side, fix a hoop 14 inches diameter; and round its edge and front place illuminations, and in the centre a five-pointed star; then at E, which is one foot and a half from the edge of the hoop, place two cafes of brilliant fire, one on each side; these cafes should be one foot long each: below these fix two more cafes of the same size, and at such a distance that their mouths may almost meet them at top: then close to the ends of these fix two more of the same cafes; they must stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to them at E. The cafes being thus fixed, clothe them with leaders; so that they, with the illuminations and flares at top, may all take fire together.\n\nStars with Points for regulated Pieces, &c.\u2014These Stars with flares are made of different sizes, according to the work points, for which they are intended; they are made with cafes from one ounce to one pound, but in general with four ounce-cafes, four or five inches long: the cafe must be rolled with patte, and twice as thick as that of a rocket of the same bore. Having rolled a cafe, pinch one end of it quite close: then drive in half a diameter of clay; and when the cafe is dry, fill it with composition two or three inches to the length of the cafes with which it is to burn: at top of the charge drive some clay; as the ends of these cafes are seldom pinched, they would be liable to take fire. Having filled a cafe, divide the circumference of it at the pinched end close to the clay into five equal parts; then bore five holes with a gimlet, about the size of the neck of a common four-ounce cafe, into the composition: from one hole to the other carry a quick-match, and secure it with paper: this paper must be put on in the manner of that on the end of wheel-cafes, so that the hollow part, which projects from the end of the cafe, may serve to receive a leader from any other work, to give fire to the points of the flares. These stars may be made with any number of points.\n\nFixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a> with a transparent Face.\u2014To make a sun Fixed sun of the best kind, there should be two rows of cafes, as in fig. 48, which will show a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and make the transparent rays strong and full. The frame or sun-wheel, must be made thus: Have a circular flat nave made very strong, 12 inches diameter: to this fix six strong flat spokes, A,B,C,D,E,F. On the front of these fix a circular fell, five feet diameter; within which fix another fell, the length of one of the sun-cafes less in diameter; within this fix a third fell, whose diameter must be less than the second by the length of one cafe and one-third. The wheel being made, divide the falls into so many equal parts.\nparts as there are to be cafes (which may be done from 24 to 44): at each division fix a flat iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a>; these staples must be made to fit the cafes, to hold them fast on the wheel; let the staples be so placed, that one row of cafes may lie in the middle of the intervals of the other.\n\nIn the centre of the block of the fun drive a spindle, on which put a small hexagonal wheel, whose cafes must be filled with the same charge as the cafes of the fun: two cafes of this wheel must burn at a time, and begin with them on the fells. Having fixed on all the cafes, carry pipes of communication from one to the other, as you see in the figure, and from one side of the fun to the wheel in the middle, and from thence to the other side of the fun. These leaders will hold the wheel steady while the fun is fixing up, and will also be a sure method of lighting both cafes of the wheel together. A fun thus made is called a brilliant fun, because the wood work is entirely covered with fire from the wheel in the middle, so that there appears nothing but sparks of brilliant fire: but if you would have a transparent face in the centre, you must have one made of pateboard of any size. The method of making a face is, by cutting out the eyes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>, and mouth, for the sparks of the wheel to appear through; but instead of this face, you may have one painted on oiled paper, or Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, strained tight on a hoop; which hoop must be supported by three or four pieces of wire at six inches distance from the wheel in the centre, so that the light of it may illuminate the face. By this method may be shown in the front of a fun, Vivat Rex, cut in pateboard, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> painted on silk; but, for a small collection, a fun with a single glory, and a wheel in front, will be most suitable. Half pound cafes, filled ten inches with composition, will be a good size for a fun of five feet diameter; but, if larger, the cafes must be greater in proportion.\n\nThree Vertical Wheels illuminated, which turn on their own Naves upon a horizontal Table.\u2014A plan of this is shown by fig. 49. Let D be a fir table three feet in diameter: this table must be fixed horizontally on the top of a post; on this post must be a perpendicular iron spindle, which must come through the centre of the table: then let A, B, C, be three spokes joined to a triangular flat piece of wood, in the middle of which make a hole to fit easily over the spindle: let E, F, G, be pieces of wood, four or five inches long each, and two inches square, fixed on the under sides of the spokes; in these pieces make holes lengthwise to receive the thin part of the blocks of the wheels, which, when in, are prevented from coming out by a small iron pin being run through the end of each. K, L, M, are three vertical octagonal wheels, 18 inches diameter each: the blocks of these wheels must be long enough for three or four inches to rest on the table; round which part drive a number of sharp points of wire, which must not project out of the blocks more than 1-16th of an inch: the use of these points is, that, when the blocks run round, they will stick in the table, and help the wheels forward: if the naves are made of strong wood, one inch will be enough for the diameter of the thin part, which should be made to turn easily in the holes of the pieces E, F, G. On the front of the wheels make four or five circles of strong wire, or flat hoops, and tie on them as many illuminations as they will hold at two inches distant from each other: instead of circles, you may make spiral lines, clothed with illuminations, at the same distance from each other as those on the hoops. When illuminations are fixed on a spiral line in the front of a wheel, they must be placed a little on the flant, the contrary way from that in which the wheel runs; the cafes for these wheels may be filled with any coloured charge, but must burn only one at a time.\n\nThe wheels being thus prepared, you must have a globe, crown, or spiral wheel, to put on the spindle in the middle of the table: this spindle should be just long enough to raise the wheel of the globe, crown, or spiral wheel, so high that its fire may play over the three vertical wheels: by this means their fires will not be confused, nor will the wheels receive any damage from the fire of each other. In clothing this work, let the leaders be so managed, that all the wheels may light together, and the illuminations after two cafes of each wheel are burned.\n\nIlluminated works are much admired by the Italians, and indeed are a great addition to a collection of works: chandelier in a grand exhibition an illuminated piece should be fired after every two or three wheels, or fixed pieces of common and brilliant fires; and likewise illuminated works may be made cheap, quick, and easy.\n\nTo make an illuminated chandelier, you must first have one made of thin wood (see fig. 50). The chandelier being made, bore in the front of the branches, and in the body, and also in the crown at top, as many holes for illuminations as they will contain at three inches distance from each other; in these holes put illuminations filled with white, blue, or brilliant charge. Having fixed in the port-fires, clothe them with leaders, so that the chandelier and crown may light together. The small circles on this figure represent the mouths of the illuminations, which must project straight from the front.\n\nTo make a flaming star with brilliant wheels, you must first have made a circular piece of strong wood about one foot with inch thick and two feet diameter: round this block fix brilliant eight points, two feet six inches long each; four of these wheels points must be straight and four flaming; these points being joined on very strong, and even with the surface of the block, nail tin or pateboard on their edges, from the block to the end of each, where they must be joined: this tin must project in front eight inches, and be joined where they meet at the block; round the front of the block fix four pieces of thick iron wire, eight inches long each, equally distant from each other: this being done, cut a piece of pateboard round, two feet diameter, and draw on it a star, as may be seen in fig. 51. Cut out this star, and on the back of it paste oiled paper; then paint each point half red and half yellow, lengthwise; but the body of the star must be left open, wherein must run a brilliant wheel, made thus: Have a light block turned nine inches long: at each end of it fix six spokes; at the end of each spoke put a two ounce cafe of brilliant fire: the length of these cafes must be in proportion to the wheel, and the diameter of the wheel when the cafes are on must be a little less than the diameter of the body of the small star: the cafes on the spokes in front must have their mouths incline outwards, and those on the inside spokes must be placed so as to form a vertical circle of fire. When you place the leaders, carry the first pipe from the tail of one of the cafes.\nVarieties cases in front to the mouth of one of the inside cases, of Construction, and from the tail of that to another in front, and so on to all the cases. The wheel being made, put it on a spindle, in the centre of the star; this spindle must have a shoulder at bottom, to keep the wheel at a little distance from the block. The wheel must be kept on the spindle by a nut at the end; having fixed on the wheel, fasten the transparent star to the four pieces of wire; when you fire it, you will only see a common horizontal wheel; but when the first case is burnt out, it will fire one of the vertical cases, which will blow the transparent star, and fill the large flames and points with fire; then it will again appear like a common wheel, and so on for 12 charges.\n\nA regulated piece, if well executed, is as curious as any in fire-works; it consists of fixed and moveable pieces on one spindle, representing various figures, which take fire successively one from another, without any affluence after lighting the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUTATION\">mutation</a>. See fig. 53.\n\nI. Names of the mutations, with the colour of fire and size of the case belonging to each.\n\nFirst mutation is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEXAGON\">hexagon</a> vertical wheel, illuminated in front with small portfires tied on the spokes; this wheel must be clothed with two ounce cases, filled with black charge; the length of these cases is determined by the size of the wheel, but must burn firmly.\n\nSecond mutation is a fixed piece, called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> glory, by reason of the cases being filled with spur-fire. The cases must stand perpendicular to the block on which they are fixed, so that, when burning, they may represent a glory of fire. This mutation is generally composed of five or seven two ounce cases.\n\nThird mutation is moveable; and is only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCTAGON\">octagon</a> vertical wheel, clothed with four ounce cases, filled with brilliant charge; two of these cases must burn at a time. In this wheel you may make changes of fire.\n\nFourth mutation is a fixed gun of brilliant fire, consisting of 12 four ounce cases; the necks of these cases must be a little larger than those of four ounce wheel-cases. In this mutation may be made a change of fire, by filling the cases half with brilliant charge, and half with grey.\n\nFifth mutation is a fixed piece, called the porcupine's quill. This piece consists of 12 spokes, standing perpendicular to the block in which they are fixed; on each of these spokes, near the end, must be placed a four ounce case of brilliant fire. All these cases must incline either to the right or left, so that they may all play one way.\n\nSixth mutation is a standing piece, called the crofs-fire. This mutation consists of eight spokes fixed in a block; near the end of each of these spokes must be tied two four ounce cases of white charge, one across the other, so that the fires from the cases on one spoke may intersect the fire from the cases on the other.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">Seventh</a> mutation is a fixed wheel, with two circular fells, on which are placed 16 eight-ounce cases of brilliant fire, in the form of a star. This piece is called a fixed star of wild-fire.\n\nEighth mutation.\u2014This is a beautiful piece, called a brilliant star-piece. It consists of six spokes, which are strengthened by two fells of a hexagon form, at some distance from each other; at the end of each spoke, in the front, is fixed a brilliant star of five points; and on each side of every star is placed a four-ounce case of Varieties black or gray charge; these cases must be placed with their mouths sidewise, so that their fires may cross each other.\n\nNinth mutation is a wheel-piece. This is composed of six long spokes, with a hexagon vertical wheel at the end of each; these wheels run on spindles in the front of the spokes; all the wheels are lighted together; two ounce cases will do for these wheels, and may be filled with any coloured charge.\n\nII. Proportions of the mutations, with the method of conveying the fire from one to the other, and the distance at which they stand one from the other on the spindle.\n\nFirst mutation must be a hexagon vertical wheel, 14 inches diameter; on one side of the block, whose diameter is two inches and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, is fixed a tin barrel A (see fig. 53, No. 1). This barrel must be a little less in diameter than the nave; let the length of the barrel and block be six inches. Having fixed the cases on the wheel, carry a leader from the tail of the last case into the tin barrel through a hole made on purpose, two inches from the block; at the end of this leader let there be about one inch or two of loose match, but take care to secure well the hole wherein the pipe is put, to prevent any sparks falling in, which would light the second mutation before its time, and confuse the whole.\n\nSecond mutation is thus made: Have a nave turned two inches and a half diameter, and three long; then let half an inch of that end which faces the first wheel be turned so as to fit easily into the tin barrel of the first mutation, which must turn round it without touching. On the other end of the block fix a tin barrel B, No. 2. This barrel must be six inches long, and only half an inch of it to fit on the block. Round the nave fix five spokes, one inch and a half long each; the diameter of the spokes must be equal to a two ounce former. On these spokes put five seven inch two ounce cases of spur-fire, and carry leaders from the mouth of one to the other, that they may all light together. Then from the mouth of one of the cases carry a leader through a hole bored flatwise in the nave, from between the spokes, to the front of the block near the spindle hole: the end of this leader must project out of the hole into the barrel of the first mutation, so that when the pipe which comes from the end of the last case on the first wheel flashes, it may take fire, and light the second mutation. To communicate the fire to the third mutation, bore a hole near the bottom of one of the five cases to the composition, and from thence carry a leader into a hole made in the middle of the barrel B: this hole must be covered with pasted paper.\n\nThird mutation may be either an octagon or hexagon wheel, 20 inches diameter; let the nave be three inches and a quarter diameter, and three and a half in length; one inch and a half of the front of the nave must be made to fit in the barrel B. On the other end of the block fix a tin barrel C, No. 3. This barrel must be six inches and a half in length, one inch of which must fit over the block. The cases of this wheel must burn two at a time; and from the mouths of the first two cases carry a leader, through holes in the nave, into the barrel of the second mutation, after the usual manner: but besides these leaders let a pipe go across the wheel from the first case to the other; then from the tail of one of\nVarieties of Constructions.\n\nThe last cases carry a pipe into a hole in the middle of the barrel C; at the end of this pipe let there be some loose quick-match.\n\nFourth and fifth mutations.\u2014These may be described under one head, as their naves are made of one piece, which from E to F is 14 inches; E, a block four inches diameter, with 10 or 12 short spokes, on which are fixed 11 inch eight ounce cases: let the front of this block be made to fit easily in the barrel C, and clothe the cases so that they may all light together; and let a pipe be carried through a hole in the block into the barrel C, in order to receive the fire from the leader brought from the last case on the wheel. G is the nave of the 5th mutation; whose diameter must be four inches and a half: in this nave fix 10 or 12 spokes, one foot and a half in length each; these spokes must stand seven inches distant from the spokes of the 4th mutation; and at the end of each spoke tie a four ounce case, as No. 5. All these cases are to be lighted together, by a leader brought from the end of one of the cases on No. 4. Let F and H be of the same piece of wood as E and G, but as much thinner as possible, to make the work light.\n\nSixth and seventh mutations.\u2014The blocks of these two mutations are turned out of one piece of wood, whose length from F to P is 15 inches. L, a block five inches diameter, in which are fixed eight spokes, each two feet four inches long; at the end of each spoke tie two four ounce cases, as in No. 6. All these cases must be fired at the same time, by a pipe brought from the end of one of the cases on the 5th mutation. Let the distance between the spokes at L, and those in the 5th mutation, be seven inches. M, the nave of the 7th mutation, whose diameter must be five inches and a half: in this nave fix eight spokes, and on the front of them two circular fells, one of four feet eight inches diameter, and one of three feet 11 diameter; on these fells tie 16 eight ounce or pound cases, as in No. 7, and carry leaders from one to the other, so that they may be all fired together. This mutation must be fired by a leader brought from the tail of one of the cases on the 6th mutation.\n\nEighth and ninth mutations.\u2014The blocks of these may be turned out of one piece, whose length from P to D must be 12 inches. O, the block of the 8th mutation, which must be six inches diameter; and in it must be fixed six spokes, each three feet in length, strengthened by a hexagon fell within three or four inches of the ends of the spokes: close to the end of each spoke, in the front, fix a five-pointed brilliant star; then seven inches below each star tie two 10 inch eight ounce cases, so that the upper ends of the cases may rest on the fells, and their ends on the spokes. Each of these cases must be placed parallel to the opposite fell (see No. 8.) NNN, &c., are the cases, and kkk, &c., the stars.\n\nThe 9th mutation is thus made: Let D be a block seven inches diameter. In this block must be screwed six spokes, six feet long each, with holes and grooves for leaders, as those in the dodecahedron; at the end of each spoke, in the front, fix a spindle for a hexagon vertical wheel, 10 inches diameter, as in No. 9. When these wheels are on, carry a leader from each into the block, so that they may all meet; then lead a pipe from the end of one of the cases of the 8th mutation, through a hole bored in the block D, to meet the leaders from the vertical wheels, so that they may all be fired together.\n\nThe spindles for larger pieces are required to be made very strong, and as exact as possible; for a piece of nine mutations, let the spindle be at the large end one inch diameter, and continue that thickness as far as the 7th mutation; and thence to the 5th, let its diameter be three-fourths of an inch; from the fifth to the fourth, five-eighths of an inch; from the fourth to the second half an inch; and from the second to the end three eighths of an inch. At the small end must be a nut to keep on the first wheel, and at the thick end must be a large nut, as shown by the figure; so that the screw part of the spindle being put through a post, and a nut screwed on tight, the spindle will be held fast and steady: but you are to observe, that that part of the spindle on which the moveable pieces are to run, be made long enough for the wheels to run easily without sticking; the fixed pieces being made on different blocks, the leaders must be joined after they are fixed on the spindle. The best method of preventing the fixed mutations from moving on the spindle, is to make that part of the spindle which goes through them square; but as it would be difficult to make square holes through such long blocks as are sometimes required, it will be best to make them thus: Bore a hole a little larger than the diameter of the spindle; and at each end of the block, over the hole, fasten a piece of brass with a square hole in it to fit the spindle.\n\nTo make a horizontal wheel change to a vertical wheel with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAN\">fan</a> in front.\u2014The sudden change of this piece changed is very pleasing; and gives great surprize to those who are not acquainted with the contrivance. A wheel for this purpose should be about three feet diameter, and its fell circular; on which tie 16 half pound cases filled with brilliant charge: two of these cases must burn at a time; and on each end of the nave must be a tin barrel of the same construction as those on the regulated piece. The wheel being completed, prepare the post or stand thus: First have a stand made of any height, about three or four inches square; then saw off from the top a piece two feet long; this piece join again at the place where it was cut, with a hinge on one side, so that it may lift up and down in the front of the stand; then fix on the top of the bottom part of the stand, on each side, a bracket; and these brackets must project at right angles with the stand, one foot from the front, for the short piece to rest on. These brackets must be placed a little above the joint of the post, so that when the upper stand falls, it may lie between them at right angles with the bottom stand; which may be done by fixing a piece of wood, one foot long, between the brackets, and even with the top of the bottom stand; then, as the brackets rise above the bottom stand, they will form a channel for the short post to lie in, and keep it steady without straining the hinge. On the side of the short post, opposite the hinge, nail a piece of wood, of such a length, that, when the post is perpendicular, it may reach about one foot and a half down the long post; to which being tied, it will hold the short stand upright. The stand being thus prepared, in the top of it fix a spindle 10 inches long: on this spindle put the wheel; then fix on a brilliant fan with a flingle glory; the diameter of this fan must be six inches less than that of the wheel. When you fire this piece, light the wheel first, and let it run horizontally till four cases are consumed: then from the end of the fourth case carry a leader into the tin barrel that turns over the end of the stand: this leader must be met by another brought through the top\nVarieties of the post, from a case filled with a strong port-fire charge, and tied to the bottom post, with its mouth facing the packthread which holds up the stand; so that when this case is lighted, it will burn the packthread, and let the wheel fall forward, by which means it will become vertical: then from the last case of the wheel, carry a leader into the barrel next the sun, which will begin as soon as the wheel is burnt out.\n\nGrand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUTE\">volute</a> illuminated with a projected wheel in front.\u2014First have two hoops made of strong iron wire, one of six feet diameter, and one of four feet two inches; these hoops must be joined to ferolls A, A, &c., as in fig. 54. These ferolls must be made of the same fort of wire as the hoops; on these ferolls tie, with iron-binding wire, as many illuminating port-fires as they will hold, at two inches distance; clothe these port-fires with leaders, so that they may all take fire together.\u2014Then let C be a circular wheel of four spokes, three feet six inches diameter; and on its fell tie as many four ounce cases, head to tail, as will complete the circle, only allowing a sufficient distance between the cases, that the fire may pass free; which may be done by cutting the upper part of the end of each case a little slanting: on each spoke fix a four ounce case, about three inches from the fell of the wheel: these cases are to burn one at a time, and the first of them to begin with those on the fell, of which four are to burn at a time; so that the wheel will last no longer than one-fourth of the cases on the fell, which in number should be 16 or 20. On the front of the wheel form a spiral line with strong wire, on which tie port-fires, placing them on a flint, with their mouths to face the same way as the cases on the wheel: all these port-fires must be fired with the second cases of the wheel. Let D, D, &c., be spokes of wood, all made to screw into a block in the centre; each of these spokes may be in length about four feet six inches; in the top of each fix a spindle, and on each spindle put a spiral wheel of eight spokes, such as E, E, E, &c. The blocks of these wheels must have a hole at top for the centre case, and the spindle must have nuts screwed on their ends; which nuts should fit in the holes at top of the blocks, so that all the wheels must be put on before you fix in the centre cases: as some of these wheels, from their situation, will not bear on the nut, it will be necessary to have smooth shoulders made on the spindles for the blocks to run on. The cases of these wheels are to burn double; and the method of firing them, is by carrying a leader from each down the spokes into the block in the centre, as in the dodecahedron, but the centre case of each wheel must begin with the two last cases as usual. It is to be observed, that the large circular wheel in front must have a tin barrel on its block, into which a pipe must be carried from one of the second cases on the wheel; this pipe being met by another from the large block, in which the eight spokes are screwed, will fire all the spiral wheels and the illuminating port-fires at the same time. The cases of the projected wheel may be filled with a white charge, and those of the spiral wheels with a gray charge.\n\nLet fig. 55. be a smooth circular board five feet diameter: out of the middle of it cut a circular piece 12 or 14 inches diameter; and over the vacancy put white Persian silk, on which paint a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>'s face; then let I, I, &c., be stars, each four or five inches diameter, cut out with five points, and covered with oiled silk: on the front of the large circular board draw a seven-pointed star, as large as the circle will allow; then on the lines which form this star, bore holes, wherein fix pointed stars. When this case is to be fired, it must be fixed upon the front of a post, on a spindle, with a wheel of brilliant fire behind the face of the moon; so that, while the wheel burns, the moon and stars will appear transparent: and when the wheel has burnt out, they will disappear, and the large star in front, which is formed of pointed stars, will begin, being lighted by a pipe of communication from the last case of the vertical wheel, behind the moon; this pipe must be managed in the same manner as those in regulated pieces.\n\nDouble cone-wheel illuminated.\u2014This piece is represented by fig. 56. Let A be a strong decagonal or ten-sided wheel, two feet six inches diameter; then on each side of it fix a cone B and C: these cones are to consist of a number of hoops, supported by three or four pieces of wood, in the manner of the spiral wheels. Let the height of each cone be three feet six inches; and on all the hoops tie port-fires horizontally, with their mouths outwards, and clothe the wheel with eight-ounce cases, all to play horizontally, two at a time: the cones may be fired with the first or second cases. The spindle for this piece must go through both the cones, and rise three feet above the point of the cone at top; so that its length will be 10 feet four inches from the top of the post H, in which it is fixed, allowing four inches for the thickness of the block of the wheel. The whole weight of the wheel and cones must bear on a shoulder in the spindle, on which the block of the wheel must turn.\u2014Near the top of the spindle must be a hole in the front, into which screw a small spindle, after the cones are on: then on this small spindle fix a fun D, composed of fifteen nine inch four-ounce cases of brilliant fire; which cases must not be placed on a fell, but only stuck into a block of six inches diameter: then in the front of this fun must be a circular vertical wheel, 16 inches diameter; on the front of this wheel form with iron-wire a spiral line, and clothe it with illuminations after the usual method. As this wheel is not to be fired till the cones are burnt out, the method of firing it is this: Let the hole in the block, at the top of the uppermost cone, be a little larger than the spindle which passes through it. Then, from the first case of the vertical wheel before the fun, carry a leader down the side of the spindle to the top of the block of the horizontal wheel, on which must be a tin barrel: then this leader being met by another brought from the end of the last case of the horizontal wheel, will give fire to the vertical wheel as soon as the cones are extinguished: but the fun D must not be fired till the vertical wheel is quite burned out.\n\nCases for fire pumps are made as those for tourbil. Fire pumps; only they are patted, instead of being rolled dry. Having rolled and dried the cases, fill them: first put in a little meal-powder, and then a star; on which ram lightly a ladleful or two of composition, then a little meal-powder, and on that a star, then again composition; and so on till the cases are filled. Stars for fire pumps should not be round; but must be made either square, or flat and circular, with a hole through the middle: the quantity of powder for throwing the stars must increase near the top of the case; for, if much powder be put at the bottom, it will burst the case. The stars must differ in size in this manner: Let the star which is\nVarieties of Construction.\n\nPut in first be about a quarter less than the bore of the case; but let the next star be a little larger, and the third star a little larger than the second, and so on: let them increase in diameter till within two of the top of the case, which two must fit in tight. As the loading of fire-pumps is rather difficult, it will be necessary to make two or three trials before depending on their performance: when you fill a number of pumps, take care not to put in each an equal quantity of charge between the stars, so that when they are fired, they may not throw up too many stars together. Cases for fire-pumps should be made very strong, and rolled on four or eight ounce formers, 10 or 12 inches long each.\n\nA vertical scroll wheel may be made of any diameter, but must be constructed as in fig. 57, to do which proceed thus: Have a block made of a moderate size, in which fix four flat spokes, and on them fix a flat circular fell of wood; round the front of this fell place port-fires; then on the front of the spokes form a scroll, either with a hoop or strong iron wire; on this scroll tie cases of brilliant fire, in proportion to the wheel, head to tail, as in the figure. When you fire this wheel, light the first case near the fell; then, as the cases fire successively, the circle of fire will gradually diminish: but whether the illuminations on the fell begin with the scroll or not, is immaterial.\n\nN.B. This wheel may be put in the front of a regulated piece, or fired by itself, occasionally.\n\nThere are two sorts of fire-globes; one with projected cases; the other with the cases concealed. For the latter have a globe made of wood, of any diameter, and divide the surface of it into 14 equal parts, and at each division bore a hole perpendicular to the centre: these holes must be in proportion to the cases intended to be used: in every hole, except one, put a case filled with brilliant or any other charge, and let the mouths of the cases be even with the surface of the globe; then cut in the globe a groove, from the mouth of one case to the other, for leaders, which must be carried from case to case, so that they may all be fired together; this done, cover the globe with a single paper, and paint it. These globes may be used to ornament a building.\n\nFire-globes with projected cases are made thus: the globe being made with 14 holes bored in it as usual, fix in every hole except one, a case, and let each case project from the globe two-thirds of its length; then clothe all the cases with leaders, so that they may all take fire at the same time. Fire-globes are supported by a pintle, made to fit the hole in which there is no case.\n\nNothing adds more to the appearance of fire-works than placing them properly; though this chiefly depends on the judgement of the maker. The following are the rules generally observed, whether the works are to be fired on a building or on stands: if they are a double fet, place one wheel of a fort on each side of the building; and next to each of them, towards the centre, place a fixed piece, then wheels, and so on; leaving a sufficient distance between them for the fire to play from one without burning the other. Having fixed some of the works thus in front, place the rest behind them, in the centre of their intervals: The largest piece, which is generally a regulated or transparent piece, must be placed in the centre of the building, and behind it a fun, which must always stand above all the other works. A little before the building, or stands, place the large gerbes; and at the back of the works fix maroon batteries, pots des aigrettes, pots des brins, pots des faucissons, air-balloon, and flights of rockets: the rocket stands may be fixed behind, or anywhere else, so as not to be in the way of the works.\n\nSingle collections are fired on stands; which are made in the same manner as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEODOLITE\">theodolite</a> stands, only the top part must be long or short occasionally: these stands may be fixed up very soon without much trouble.\n\nThe following order of Firing will serve as a specimen of the Plan to be pursued in an exhibition of Fire-works.\n\n1. Two signal rockets\n2. Six sky rockets\n3. Two honorary vertical wheels illuminated\n4. Four caduceus spiral transparent stars\n5. Two horizontal air balloons illuminated\n6. Two Chinele fountains regulating pieces of four mutations each pots des aigrettes\n7. Four tourbillons\n8. A line rocket of five changes\n9. Four tourbillons\n10.

Octagon vertical wheel\n21. Porcupine's quills\n22. Crofs fires\n23. Star-piece with brilliant rays\n24. Six vertical wheels\n25. Brilliant fun\n26. Large flight of rockets.\n\nWhen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a> are to be exhibited, divide them into several sets, and fire one set after every fifth or sixth change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and air-works. Observe this rule in firing a double fet of works: Always begin with sky-rockets, then two moveable pieces, then two fixed pieces, and so on; ending with a large flight of rockets, or a maroon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>: if a single collection, fire a fixed piece after every wheel or two, and now and then some air and water-works.\nVarieties Fig. 58 represents a fountain of 30 rockets. Let A be a perpendicular post, 16 feet high from the ground, and four inches square. Let the rail, or cross piece C, be one foot six inches long, three inches broad, and one inch thick. The rail D, at bottom, must be five feet long, one foot broad, and one inch thick. F and G are the two sides which serve to supply the rails D, E, H, I; these sides are one foot broad at bottom, and cut in the front with a regular slope, to three inches at top; but their back edges must be parallel with the front of the pots A. The breadth of the rails E, H, I will be determined by the breadth of the sides; all the rails must be fixed at two feet distance from each other, and at right angles with the pots. Having placed the rails thus, bore in the bottom rail 10 holes, at equal distances, large enough to receive the stick of a one-pound rocket; in the back edge of this rail cut a groove from one end to the other, fit to contain a quick-match; then cut a groove in the top of the rail, from the edge of each hole, into the groove in the back; in the same manner cut in the second rail, E, eight holes and grooves; in the third rail, H, fix holes and grooves; in the fourth rail, I, four holes and grooves; and in the top rail, two holes and grooves. B, a rail with holes in it to guide the ends of the rocket sticks: this rail must be fixed five feet from the rail D. The fountain frame being thus made, prepare the rockets thus: Tie round the mouth of each piece of thin paper, large enough to go twice round, and to project about an inch and a half from the mouth of the rocket, which must be rubbed with wet meal-powder; in the mouth of each rocket put a leader, which secure well with the paper that projects from the mouth of the case; these leaders must be carried into the grooves in the back of the rails, in which lay a quick-match from one end to the other, and cover it with pasted paper; holes must be made in the rail D, to receive the ends of the sticks of the rockets in the rail E, and so on to the fourth rail; so that the sticks of the rockets at top may go through all the rails. The rockets being so prepared, fix a gerbe, or white flower-pot, on each rail, before the post, with its mouth inclining a little forwards; these gerbes must be lighted all at once. Behind or before each gerbe, fix a case of brilliant or slow fire; these cases must be filled so that they may burn out one after the other, to regulate the fountain; which may be done by carrying a leader from the end of each slow or brilliant fire, into the groove in the back of each rail. Different fixed rockets may be used in these fountains: but it will be best to fill the heads of the rockets on each rail with different sorts of things, in this manner; those at top with crackers, the next with rains, the third with serpents, the fourth with tailed stars, and the last flight with common or brilliant flares.\n\nThe piece called a palm tree, though made of common fires, and of a simple construction, has a very pleasing effect; from the fires interfering too often, that they resemble the branches of trees. Let A (fig. 59) be a perpendicular post, of any thickness, so that it be sufficiently strong to hold the cases; let the distance from B to C be two feet six inches, and from C to D two feet six inches, and let the length of each cross-piece be two feet; on each end of each fix a five-pointed star: then fix, on pegs made for the purpose, twelve-inch half-pound cases of brilliant fire, as in the figure.\n\nAll the cases and stars must be fired at once. This piece should be fixed high from the ground.\n\nAn illuminated pyramid, with Archimedian screws, a globe, and vertical fun, may be of any size. One made according to the dimensions of fig. 60, will be of a good illuminated proportion, whose height is 21 feet; from C to D, fix pyramid feet; from E to F, nine feet: the space between the gate rails must be six inches, and the rails as thin as possible: COGGLVI.\n\nIn all the rails stick portfires at four inches distance. The Archimedian screws, G, K, are nothing more than double spiral wheels, with the cases placed on their wheels horizontally instead of obliquely. The vertical fun, I, need not consist of more than 12 rays, to form a single glory. The globe at top must be made in proportion to the pyramid; which being prepared according to the preceding directions; place the leaders so that all the illuminating portfires, screws, globe, and fun, may take fire together. The pyramid must be supported by the two sides, and by a support brought from a pole, which must be placed two feet from the back of the pyramid, that the wheels may run freely.\n\nA rofe-piece may be used for a mutation of a regulated piece, or fired by itself: it makes the best appearance when made large; if its exterior diameter be six feet, it will be of a good size. Fig. 61 shows the manner in which it appears before it is fired. Let the outer fell be made of wood, and supported by four wooden spokes: all the other parts, on which the illuminations are fixed, must be made of strong iron wire: on the outer fell place as many half-pound cases of brilliant charge as you think proper, but the more the better; for the nearer the cases are placed, the stronger will be the rays: the illuminations should be placed within three inches of each other: they must all be fired together, and burn some time before the fun is lighted; which may be done by carrying a leader from the middle of one of the illuminations, to the mouth of one of the fun cases.\n\nFig. 62 represents an illuminated star. Let the diameter from A to B be two feet, and from C to D seven feet. First make a strong circular back or body of the illuminated star, two feet diameter, to which fix the illuminated rays: in the centre of the front of the body fix a spindle, on which put a double triangular wheel, six inches diameter, clothed with two ounce cases of brilliant charge: the cases on this wheel must burn but one at a time. Round the edge of the body nail a hoop made of thin wood or tin: this hoop must project in front six or seven inches: in this hoop cut three or four holes to let out the smoke from the wheel. The star and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARTER\">garter</a> may be cut out of strong pasteboard or tin, made in this manner: Cut a round piece of pasteboard or tin, two feet diameter, on which draw a star, and cut it out; then over the vacancy paste Persian silk; paint the letters yellow; four of the rays yellow, and four red; the crooks in the middle may be painted half red and half yellow, or yellow and blue. This transparent star must be fastened to the wooden hoop by a screw, made so as to take off and on; the illuminated rays are made of thin wood, with tin sockets fixed on their sides within four inches of each other; in these sockets stick illuminating portfires; behind the point of each ray fix a half-pound case of gray, black, or Chinese fire.\n\nN.B. The illuminated rays are to be lighted at the same\nVarieties same time as the triangular wheel, or after it is burnt out; which may be done by a tin barrel being fixed to the wheel, after the manner of those in the regulated pieces. Into this barrel carry a leader from the illuminated rays, through the back of the star; and this leader must be met by another, brought from the tail of the last case on the wheel.\n\nFig. 63. represents a table star, whose diameter, from E to F, is 12 feet; and from E to I, four feet. This proportion, observed on each side, will make the centre frame four feet square: in this square fix a transparent star, as in the figure. This star may be painted blue, and its rays made as those of the flaming stars described before. The wheel for this star may be composed of different coloured fires, with a charge or two of slow fire; the wheels \\(a, a, a, a\\) may be clothed with any number of cases, so that the star-wheel consist of the same: the illuminating portfires, which must be placed very near each other on the frames, must be so managed as to burn as long as the wheels, and lighted at the same time.\n\nThe regulated illuminated spiral piece, with a projected star-wheel illuminated, is represented by fig. 64, and is thus made. Have a block made eight inches diameter; in this block screw fix iron spokes, which must serve for spindles for the spiral wheels: these wheels are made as usual, each one foot and a half diameter, and three feet in height: the spindles must be long enough to keep the wheels four or five inches from one another: at the end of each spindle must be a screw-nut, on which the wheels that hang downwards will run; and on the spindles which stand upwards must be a shoulder, for the blocks of the wheels to run on.\n\nThe projected star-wheel must turn on the same spindle on which the large block is fixed; this spindle must be long enough to allow the star-wheel to project a little before the spiral wheels: the exterior diameter of the star wheel must be three feet five inches. On this wheel fix three circles of iron wire, and on them portfires; on the block place a transparent star, or a large five-pointed brilliant star. The cases on this wheel may burn four at once, as it will contain nearly twice the number of one of the spiral wheels: the cases on the spiral wheels must be placed parallel to their falls, and burn two at a time.\n\nA figure piece illuminated with five pointed stars \u2014 The construction of this piece is very easy, as shown by fig. 65, whose diameter from B to C is eight feet, and from D to F two feet: the vertical wheel in the centre must be one foot diameter, and consist of six four-ounce cases of different coloured charge, which cases must burn double: on the frames fix five-pointed brilliant or blue stars, rammed four inches with composition: let the space between each star be eight inches; at each point fix a gerbe, or case of Chinese fire. When to be fired, let the gerbe, stars, and wheel, be lighted at the same time.\n\nThe star-wheel illuminated, is shown by fig. 66. Its exterior fell is made of wood, three feet five inches or four feet diameter; within this fell, form with iron wire three circles, one less than the other, so that the diameter of the least may be about ten inches: place the portfires on these falls with their mouths inclining outwards, and the portfires on the points of the star with their mouths projecting in front; let the exterior fall be clothed with four-ounce cases of gray charge: these cases must burn four at a time, and be lighted at the same time as the illuminations.\n\nPyramid of flower-pots is represented at fig. 67, and made thus. Let the distance from A to B be six feet; pyramid of and from one rail to the other, two: on the bottom rail flower-pots, fix five paper mortars, each three inches and a half diameter; these mortars load with serpents, crackers, flares, &c.\n\nIn the centre of each mortar fix a case of spur-fire: on the second rail fix four mortars, so as to stand exactly in the middle of the intervals of those on the bottom rail; on the third rail place three mortars; on the fourth, two; and on the top of the pots, 1: the bottom rail must be six feet long: all the mortars must incline a little forwards, that they may be easily discharged; and the spur-fires rammed exactly alike, that the mortars may all be fired at the same time. Having prepared the pyramid according to the preceding directions, carry pipes of communication from one spur-fire to the other.\n\nFig. 68. represents one half of the illuminated regular-illuminated ring piece.\u2014\\(A, A, A, A\\) are flat wooden spokes, each regulating five feet long: at the end of each place a vertical wheel piece. 10 inches diameter, clothed with fix four-ounce cases of brilliant fire: these cases must burn but one at a time: on two of the spokes of each wheel place two portfires, which must be lighted with the first case of the wheel; on each spoke \\(A, A, A\\), behind the wheels, place fix cases of the same size with those on the wheels: these cases must be tied across the spokes with their mouths all one way, and be made to take fire successively one after the other, so that they may assist the whole piece to turn round.\n\nThe diameter of the large wheel must be two feet and a half; and its fell made of wood, which must be fixed to the large spokes; on this wheel place 24 cases of the same fort with those on the small wheels; these cases must burn four at a time: in this wheel make three circles with iron wire, and on them place illuminating portfires, as in the figure: the star-points on the large spokes may be made of thin alli-hoops; the diameter of these points close to the centre-wheel must be 11 inches: on these points place portfires, at three inches and a half distance one from the other.\n\nFig. 69. represents the blocks of this piece. The diameters of these blocks, at \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), must be eight inches; and \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), four inches and a half: the length of each of these blocks must be fix inches: at the small ends of these blocks fix an iron wheel, five inches diameter, and these wheels must have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, to turn the wheel \\(E\\): this wheel is fixed on a small spindle screwed into the large spindle, which goes through the two blocks, and on which they run.\n\nSupposing fig. 68. to be on the block \\(A\\), in fig. 69, and to turn to the right, and another piece of the same construction on the block \\(B\\), with its fires placed so as to turn it to the left; you will find them move very true and fast, by the help of the three iron wheels, which serve to regulate their motions, as well as to assist them in turning: let the iron circles in the front of the great wheels be of different diameters, so that when fired there may appear fix circles. When this piece is fired all the wheels and illuminations must be lighted at one time.\nAquatic Fire-works.\n\nWorks that sport in the water are much esteemed by most admirers of fire-works, particularly water-rockets; and as they seem of a very extraordinary nature to those who are unacquainted with this art, they merit a particular explanation.\n\nWater rockets, may be made from four ounces to two pounds. If larger, they are too heavy; so that it will be difficult to make them keep above water without a cork float, which must be tied to the neck of the case; but the rockets will not dive so well with as without floats.\n\nCases for these are made in the same manner and proportion as sky-rockets, only a little thicker of paper. When you fill those which are driven solid, put in first one ladleful of slow fire, then two of the proper charge, and on that one or two ladlefuls of sinking charge, then the proper charge, then the sinking charge again, and so on, till you have filled the case within three diameters; then drive on the composition one ladleful of clay; through which make a small hole to the charge; then fill the case, within half a diameter, with corn-powder, on which turn down two or three rounds of the case in the inside; then pinch and tie the end very tight; having filled the rockets (according to the above directions), dip their ends in melted rosin or sealing-wax, or else secure them well with grease. When you fire these rockets, throw in six or eight at a time; but, if you would have them all sink, or swim, at the same time, you must fill them with an equal quantity of composition, and fire them all together.\n\nPipes of communication, which may be used under water, must be a little thicker in the paper than those for land. Having rolled a sufficient number of pipes, and kept them till dry, wash them over with drying oil, and let them dry; but when you oil them, leave about an inch and a half at each end dry, for joints; as if they were oiled all over, when you come to join them, the paste would not stick where the paper is greasy: after the leaders are joined, and the paste dry, oil the joints. These pipes will lie many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> under water, without receiving any damage.\n\nTo make horizontal wheels for the water, first get a large wooden bowl without a handle; then have an eight-sided wheel made of a flat board 18 inches diameter, so that the length of each side may be near seven inches: in all the sides cut a groove for the cases to lie in. This wheel being made, nail it on the top of the bowl; then take four eight-ounce cases, filled with a proper charge, each about six inches in length. Now, to clothe the wheel with these cases, get some whitish-brown paper, and cut it into slips four or five inches broad and seven or eight long: these slips being pasted all over on one side, take one of the cases, and roll one of the slips of paper about an inch and a half on its end, so that there will remain about two inches and a half of the paper hollow from the end of the case: tie this case on one of the sides of the wheel, near the corners of which must be holes bored, through which put the pack-thread to tie the cases: having tied on the first case at the neck and end, put a little meal-powder in the hollow paper; then paste a slip of paper on the end of another case, the head of which put into the hollow paper on the first, allowing a sufficient distance from the tail of one to the head of the other for the pasted paper to bend without tearing: tie on the second case as you did the first: and so on with the rest, except the last, which must be closed at the end, unless it is to communicate to anything on the top of the wheel, such as fire-pumps or brilliant fires, fixed in holes cut in the wheel, and fired by the last or second case, as the fancy directs: six, eight, or any number, may be placed on the top of the wheel, provided they be not too heavy for the bowl.\n\nBefore tying on the cases, cut the upper part of all their ends, except the last, a little shelving, that the fire from one may play over the other, without being obstructed by the case. Wheel-cases have no clay drove in their ends, nor pinched, but are always left open, only the last, or those which are not to lead fire, which must be well secured.\n\nFor water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> you must have a bowl with a wheel Water on it, made in the same manner as the water-wheel; only in its middle there must be a hole, of the same diameter as that of the intended mine. These mines are tin pots, with strong bottoms, and a little more than two diameters in length: the mine must be fixed in the hole in the wheel, with its bottom resting on the bowl; then loaded with serpents, crackers, stars, small water-rockets, &c., in the same manner as pots of salutes; but in their centre fix a case of Chinese fire, or a small gerbe, which must be lighted at the beginning of the last case on the wheel. These wheels are to be clothed as usual.\n\nBowls for water-globes must be very large, and the Fire-globes wheels on them of ten sides: on each side nail a piece of the wood four inches long; and on the outside of each ter-piece cut a groove, wide enough to receive about one-fourth of the thickness of a four-ounce case: these pieces of wood must be nailed in the middle of each face of the wheel, and fixed in an oblique direction, so that the fire from the cases may incline upwards: the wheel being thus prepared, tie in each groove a four-ounce case filled with a gray charge; then carry a leader from the tail of one case to the mouth of the other.\n\nGlobes for these wheels are made of two tin hoops, with their edges outwards, fixed one within the other, at right angles. The diameter of these hoops must be rather less than that of the wheel. Having made the globe, drive in the centre of a wheel an iron spindle, which must stand perpendicular, and its length four or five inches more than the diameter of the globe.\n\nThis spindle serves for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, on which is fixed the globe, which must stand four or five inches from the wheel: round one side of each hoop must be soldered little bits of tin, two inches and a half distance from each other; which pieces must be two inches in length each, and only fastened at one end, the other ends being left loose, to turn round the small portfires, and hold them on: these portfires must be made of such a length as will last out the cases on the wheel. There need not be any portfires at the bottom of the globe within four inches of the spindle; as they would have no effect, but to burn the wheel: all the portfires must be placed perpendicularly from the centre of the globe, with their mouths outwards; and must be clothed with leaders, so as all to take fire with the second case of the wheel; and the cases must burn two at a time, one opposite the other. When two cases of a wheel begin together, two will\nwill end together; therefore the two opposite end cases must have their ends pinched and secured from fire. The method of firing such wheels is, by carrying a leader from the mouth of one of the first cases to that of the other; and the leader being burnt through the middle, will give fire to both at the same time.\n\nOdoriferous water balloons are made in the same manner as air-balloon, but very thin of paper, and in diameter one inch and three-fourths, with a vent of half an inch diameter. The shells being made, and quite dry, fill them with any of the following compositions, which must be rammed in tight: these balloons must be fired at the vent, and put into a bowl of water. Odoriferous works are generally fired in rooms.\n\nComposition I. Saltpetre two ounces, flour of sulphur one ounce, camphor half an ounce, yellow amber half an ounce, charcoal-dust three-fourths of an ounce, salt of benjamin half an ounce, all powdered very fine and well mixed.\n\nII. Saltpetre 12 ounces, meal-powder three ounces, frankincense one ounce, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a> half an ounce, camphor half an ounce, charcoal three ounces, all moistened with the oil of spike.\n\nIII. Saltpetre two ounces, sulphur half an ounce, antimony half an ounce, amber half an ounce, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a> raspings one-fourth of an ounce, all mixed with the oil of roses and a few drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERGAMOT\">bergamot</a>.\n\nIV. Saltpetre four ounces, sulphur one ounce, sawdust of juniper half an ounce, sawdust of cypres one ounce, camphor one-fourth of an ounce, myrrh two drams, dried rosemary one-fourth of an ounce, all moistened a little with the oil of roses.\n\nN. B. Water-rockets may be made with any of the above compositions, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, to make them weaker or stronger, according to the size of the cases.\n\nHaving procured four or five small ships, of two or three feet in length, make a number of small reports, which are to serve for guns. Of these range as many as you please on each side of the upper decks; then at the head and stern of each ship fix a two-ounce case, eight inches long, filled with a slow portfire composition; but take care to place it in such a manner that the fire may fall in the water, and not burn the rigging: in these cases bore holes at unequal distances from one another, but make as many in each case as half the number of reports, so that one case may fire the guns on one side, and the other those on the opposite. The method of firing the guns is, by carrying a leader from the holes in the cases to the reports on the decks; you must make these leaders very small, and be careful in calculating the burning of the slow fire in the regulating cases, that more than two guns be not fired at a time. When you would have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROADSIDE\">broadside</a> given, let a leader be carried to a cracker, placed on the outside of the ship; which cracker must be tied loose, or the reports will be too slow: in all the ships put artificial guns at the port-holes (A).\n\nHaving filled and bored holes in two portfires for regulating the guns in one ship, make all the rest exactly the same; then, when you begin the engagement, light one ship first, and set it a failing, and so on with the rest, sending them out singly, which will make them fire regularly, at different times, without confusion; for the time between the firing of each gun will be equal to that of lighting the slow fires.\n\nThe fire-ship may be of any size; and need not be very good, for it is always lost in the action. To prepare a ship for this purpose, make a portfire equal in size with those in the other ships, and place it at the stern; in every port place a large portfire, filled with a very strong composition, and painted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of a gun, and let them all be fired at once by a leader from the slow fire, within two or three diameters of its bottom; all along both sides, on the top of the upper deck, lay star-composition about half an inch thick and one broad, which must be wetted with thin size, then primed with meal-powder, and secured from fire by pasting paper over it; in the place where you lay this composition, drive some little tacks with flat heads, to hold it fast to the deck: this must be fired just after the sham guns, and when burning will show a flame all round the ship: at the head take up the decks, and put in a tin mortar loaded with crackers, which mortar must be fired by a pipe from the end of the slow fire; the firing of this mortar will sink the ship, and make a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>. The regulating portfire of this ship must be lighted at the same time with the first fighting ship.\n\nHaving prepared all the ships for fighting, we shall next proceed with the management of them when on the water. At one end of the pond, just under the surface of the water, fix two running blocks, at what distance you choose the ships should fight; and at the other end of the pond, opposite to each of these blocks, under the water, fix a double block; then on the land, by each of the double blocks, place two small windlasses; round one of them turn one end of a small cord, and put the other end through one of the blocks; then carry it through the single one at the opposite end of the pond, and bring it back through the double block again, and round the other windlass: to this cord, near the double block, tie as many small strings as half the number of the ships, at any distance; but these strings must not be more than two feet long each: make fast the loose end of each to a ship, just under her bowsprit; for if tied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>, or too near the water, it will overturn the ship. Half the ships being thus prepared, near the other double block fix two more windlasses, to which fasten a cord, and to it tie the other half of the ships as before: when you fire the ships, pull in the cord with one of the windlasses, to get all the ships together; and when you have set fire to the first, turn that windlass which draws them out, and so on with the rest, till they are all out in the middle of the pond; then, by turning the other windlasses, you will draw them back again; by which method you may make them change <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TACK\">tack</a> about backwards and forwards at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. For the fire-ship fix the blocks and windlasses between the others;\n\n(A) Reports for these and similar occasions are made, by filling small cartridges with grained powder; pinching them close at each end, and, when used, boring a hole in the side, to which is placed a match or leader for firing them.\nAquatic others; so that when she sails out, she will be between Fireworks. the other ships: you must not let this ship advance till the guns at her ports take fire.\n\nTo fire sky-rockets under water, you must have stands made as usual, only the rails must be placed flat instead of edgewife, and have holes in them for the rocket-sticks to go through; for if they were hung upon hooks, the motion of the water would throw them off: the stands being made, if the pond is deep enough, sink them at the sides so deep, that, when the rockets are in, their heads may just appear above the surface of the water; to the mouth of each rocket fix a leader, which put through the hole with the stick; then a little above the water must be a board, supported by the stand, and placed along one side of the rockets; then the ends of the leaders are turned up through holes made in this board, exactly opposite the rockets. By this means you may fire them singly or all at once. Rockets may be fired by this method in the middle of a pond, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>, a swan, a water-wheel, or any thing else you choose.\n\nTo represent Neptune in his chariot, you must have a Neptune (made of wood, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a> work) as big as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, fixed on a float large enough to bear his weight; on which must be two horses heads and necks, so as to seem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>, as shown by fig. 70. For the wheels of the chariot, there must be two vertical wheels of black fire, and on Neptune's head a horizontal wheel of brilliant fire, with all its cases, to play upwards. When this wheel is made, cover it with paper or pasteboard, cut and painted like Neptune's coronet; then let the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIDENT\">trident</a> be made without prongs, but instead of them, fix three cases of a weak gray charge, and on each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>'s head put an eight ounce case of brilliant fire, and on the mouth of each fix a short case, of the same diameter, filled with the white-flame composition enough to last out all the cases on the wheels: these short cases must be open at bottom, that they may light the brilliant fires; for the horses eyes put small portfires, and in each nostril put a small case half filled with gray change, and the rest with portfire composition.\n\nIf Neptune is to give fire to any building on the water; at his first setting out, the wheels of the chariot, and that on his head, with the white flames on the horses heads, and the portfires in their eyes and nostrils, must all be lighted at once; then from the bottom of the white flames carry a leader to the trident. As Neptune is to advance by the help of a block and cord, you must manage it so as not to let him turn about, till the brilliant fires on the horses and the trident begin; for it is by the fire from the horses (which plays almost upright) that the building, or work, is lighted; which must be thus prepared. From the mouth of the case which is to be first fired, hang some loose quick-match to receive the fire from the horses. When Neptune is only to be shown by himself, without setting fire to any other works, let the white flames on the horses be very short, and not to last longer than one case of each wheel, and let two cases of each wheel burn at a time.\n\nIf you would have swans or ducks discharge rockets into the water, they must be made hollow, and of paper, and filled with small water rockets, with some blowing powder to throw them out: but if this is not done, they may be made of wood, which will last many times. Having made and painted some swans, fix them on floats: then in the places where their eyes should be, bore holes two inches deep, inclining downwards, and wide enough to receive a small portfire; the portfire cases for this purpose must be made of brats, two inches long, and filled with a slow bright charge. In the middle of one of these cases make a little hole; then put the portfire in the eye-hole of the swan, leaving about half an inch to project out; and in the other eye put another portfire, with a hole made in it; then in the neck of the swan, within two inches of one of the eyes, bore a hole flatwise, to meet that in the portfire; in this hole put a leader, and carry it to a water-rocket, that must be fixed under the tail with its mouth upwards. On the top of the head place two one-ounce cases, four inches long each, drove with brilliant fire; one of these cases must incline forwards, and the other backwards: these must be lighted at the same time as the water-rocket; to do which, bore a hole between them in the top of the swan's head, down to the hole in the portfire, to which carry a leader: if the swan is filled with rockets, they must be fired by a pipe from the end of the water-rocket under the tail. When you set the swan a swimming, light the two eyes.\n\nTo make a fire-fountain for the water, first have a Water-fire float made of wood, three feet diameter; then in the middle fix a round perpendicular post, four feet high, and two inches diameter; round this post fix three circular wheels made of thin wood, without any spokes. The largest of these wheels must be placed within two or three inches of the float, and must be nearly of the same diameter. The second wheel must be two feet two inches diameter, and fixed at two feet distance from the first. The third wheel must be one foot four inches diameter, and fixed within six inches of the top of the post: the wheels being fixed, take 18 four or eight-ounce cases of brilliant fire, and place them round the first wheel with their mouths outwards, and inclining downwards; on the second wheel place 13 cases of the same, and in the same manner as those on the first; on the third, place eight more of these cases, in the same manner as before, and on the top of the post fix a gerbe; then clothe all the cases with leaders, so that both they and the gerbe may take fire at the same time. Before firing this work, try it in the water to see whether the float is properly made, so as to keep the fountain upright.\n\nAs the artificial fire-works which we have described, require considerable caution in their preparation and management, and are attended with great expense, attempts have been made to imitate some of the more simple kinds by optical delusion, and to give to the objects represented the appearance of moving fire, though they be really fixed, and no fire be employed. These attempts have been tolerably successful; and by means of this invention, a spectacle of artificial fire-works may be apparently exhibited at a trifling expense; and if the pieces employed are constructed with ingenuity, and with a proper attention to the rules of perspective, while in viewing them we employ glasses which magnify the objects, and prevent them from being too distinctly seen, a very agreeable illusion will be produced.\n\nThe artificial fire-works imitated with most success by this invention, are fixed fans, gerbes, and jets of fire, cascades, globes, pyramids, and columns, moveable around their axes. To represent a gerbe of fire, take\nOptical paper blackened on both sides, and very opaque; and having delineated on a piece of white paper the figure of a gerbe of fire, apply it to the black paper, and with the point of a very sharp penknife make several flares (Plate CCCCLVII. fig. 71.) in it, as 3, 5, or 7, proceeding from the origin of the gerbe: these lines must not be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, but cut through at unequal intervals. Pierce these intervals with unequal holes made with a pinking iron, in order to represent the sparks of such a gerbe. In short, you must endeavour to paint, by these lines and holes, the well-known effect of the fire of inflamed gunpowder, when it issues through a small aperture.\n\nAccording to the same principles, you may delineate the cascades (fig. 72.) and jets of fire which you are desirous of introducing into this exhibition, which is purely optical; and those jets of fire which proceed from the radii of fans, either fixed or moveable. It may easily be conceived, that in this operation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> must be the guide.\n\nIf you are desirous of representing globes, pyramids, or revolving columns, draw the outlines of them on paper, and then cut them out in a helical form; that is, cut out spirals with the point of a penknife, and of a size proportioned to that of the piece.\n\nIt is to be observed also, that as these different pieces have different colours, they may be easily imitated by pasting on the back of the paper, cut as here described, very fine silk paper coloured in the proper manner. As jets, for example, when loaded with Chinese fire, give a reddish light, you must paste to the back of these jets transparent paper, slightly tinged with red; and proceed in the same manner in regard to the other colours by which the different fire-works are distinguished.\n\nWhen these preparations have been made, the next thing is to give motion, or the appearance of motion, to this fire, which may be done two ways, according to circumstances.\n\nIf a jet of fire, for example, is to be represented, prick unequal holes, and at unequal distances from each other, in a band of paper, fig. 73., and then move this band, making it ascend between a light and the above jet; the rays of light which escape through the holes of the moveable paper will exhibit the appearance of sparks rising into the air. It is to be observed that one part of the paper must be whole; that another must be pierced with holes thinly scattered; that in another place they must be very close, and then moderately so: by these means it will represent those sudden jets of fire observed in fire-works.\n\nTo represent a cascade, the paper pierced with holes, instead of moving upwards, must be made to descend.","sp":166,"ep":212},{"h":"METAPHYSICS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> I. chap. vii. and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">RELIGION</a>); <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>,\nshould more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> be required, to the\nwritings of Ditton, Sherlock, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">Well</a>.\n\nOur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, after proving his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a> by the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> which he wrought, and by the completion of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> predictions in which he was described, declared\nthat the doctrine of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a> was one of those\ntruths which he came to announce. To show that such\nan event was possible, he restored to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of\nJairus, a ruler of the synagogue, a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of Nain,\nwho was carried out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIER\">bier</a> to be buried, and his\nfriend Lazarus, whose body at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was thought to\nhave become the prey of corruption. Though the two\nfirst of these miracles were wrought in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of\na <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of witnesses, yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, owing to particular\ncircumstances, produced a much greater noise among\nthe Jews. It was performed on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> seemingly of\nsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BETHANY\">Bethany</a>, not far from Je-\nrusalem, and in the presence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> many persons\nwho from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> had come to console with\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> and Martha. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> doubts were entertained of the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of Lazarus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Our Lord was at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>\n\n(x) Perhaps no man has been more culpable in this respect than the celebrated Warburton, who seems at first to\nhave himself denied an intermediate state of conscious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. He afterwards imagined that such a state is sup-\nposed, though not expressly asserted, in Scripture; and at last he maintained it with all the zeal and warmth of a\nprofelyte. To prove the sincerity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a>, he treated his adversaries with scurrilous nicknames, banter,\nand abuse; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> which seldom succeeds in recommending a bad cause, and which never confers\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> on one that is good.\nwhen he expired, and his body had already been lying for some days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. When he came forth at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of our Lord, all were astonished. Those from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, on returning home, are impatient to relate what they had seen; those who heard of no memorable event cannot conceal it; the report reaches the ears of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> priests. They are soon made acquainted with every circumstance; and dreading the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, they think it necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> upon the occasion, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> that ought to be pursued in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which was likely to be attended with so many and important consequences. In this council, it seems to be agreed, that our Lord had performed, and was still continuing to perform, many miracles; that this last miracle, as being of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> kind, would make many converts; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> measures were not speedily taken to prevent these uncommon displays of his power, all would believe on him; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> would be excited, the rulers deplored, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> of the Jews deprived of its few remaining privileges. Yet notwithstanding these private concessions made in the council, the members who dreaded to let their sentiments be known to the people, affect in public to treat our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a> as an impostor. But he who had already demonstrated the absurdity of their opinions, who supposed that his miracles were wrought by Beelzebub <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of the devils, is again ready to confute the ridiculous affections of those who pretended to say that they were a deception. His friend Lazarus was still living at the distance of only a few miles, and many of the Jews who had gone to see him were ready to attest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the report. If the rulers, apprehending the consequences of the truth, be afraid to know it, and if they are unwilling to go to Bethany, or to send for Lazarus and those who were present at his resurrection, our Lord gives them a fair opportunity of detecting his fraud, if there was any such to be found in him. To preserve their power, and remove the jealous suspicion of the Romans, it had been already determined in council to put him to death; and our Lord foretells that the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after his death he shall rise from the grave. Here no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was reserved for deception. The feet of the Pharisees and the chief priests are openly warned and put upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>; and very fortunately for the cause of Christianity, this singular prediction was not heard with scorn, or indeed, if with scorn, it was only affected. We know from the sentiments expressed in the council, that our Lord was secretly dreaded by the rulers; and that his predictions, in their private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, were not to be slighted. The means accordingly which they employed to prevent, even in the very appearance, the completion of his prophecy, were admirably calculated to remove the scruples of the most wary and sceptical inquirers, if their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was only to search after truth. At the next festival of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a>, when the scheme of Caiaphas was put in execution, and when it was deemed expedient by the council that he should die, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the nation from the jealousy of the Romans; as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of their steady loyalty to Rome he was apprehended, was tried as an enemy to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, was at last condemned upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and suspended on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> until they were fully satisfied of his death. Even after his death, the spear of a soldier was thrust into his side; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> that gushed out with the blood is a proof to those who are acquainted with the structure and economy of living bodies, that he must have been some time dead.\n\nAfter he was taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from the cross, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> was put on the door of the sepulchre in which he was laid, and above as the best check against secret fraud; and a guard of all His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> was stationed around it, as the best security against open violence. In spite, however, of all these precautions, the prediction was accomplished; the angel of God, descending from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> with a countenance like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, and with raiment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> as snow; the watch flake, and become as dead men; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> quakes; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> is rolled from the mouth of the sepulchre; the angel sits on it, and our Lord comes forth.\n\nIt was in vain for the Jews to allege that his disciples came in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOLE\">stole</a> him away, while the watch were asleep. One must smile at these puerile affections. How came the disciples to know that the watch were asleep? or what excuse had the watch for sleeping, and incurring a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which they knew to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>? and how came they, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of wonder, to be brought as an evidence for those transactions that happened at the time when they were asleep?\n\nWhatever credit may be given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> infidels to this ill-framed story, it is past dispute that it had none among the Jewish rulers at the time that it was current. Not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after our Saviour's resurrection, the apostles were called before the council, and threatened with death for teaching in the name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>. Their boldness upon that occasion was so provoking to the rulers, that the threat would have been instantly put in execution, had not Gamaliel, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of the law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> reputation, put them in mind of other impostors who had perished in their attempts to mislead the people; and concluded a very sensible speech with these remarkable words: \"And now, I lay unto you, refrain from those men, and let them alone; for if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a>, or this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, be of men, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\" This advice the council followed. But is it possible that Gamaliel could have given it, or the council paid the least regard to it, had the story of the disciples flealing the body been then credited? Surely some among them would have observed, that a work or counsel, founded on imposture and fraud, could not be supposed to be of God, and they would unquestionably have slain the apostles.\n\nThe story of stealing the body is indeed one of the most senseless fictions that ever was invented in support of a bad cause. Our Lord was on the earth 40 days after he arose. He appeared frequently to his disciples. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> and drank in their presence; and when some of them doubted, he bade them handle him and see that he was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTRE\">spectre</a>, showed the mark of the spear in his side, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a> in his feet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. Besides thus appearing to his disciples, he was seen by more than 500 brethren at one time; all of whom, as well as his disciples, must necessarily have known him previous to his suffering, and could therefore attest that he was the person who was once dead, but was then alive. Yet for strangers in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, who had not seen him previous to his death, and could not therefore identify his person after he arose, our Lord reserved many other proofs that were equally convincing. Before his ascension, he bade his disciples wait till they received power, by the Holy Ghost.\nGhost descending upon them: That then they should be witnesses with him, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, and unto the uttermost ends of the earth; in order that the people of all these nations, observing the miracles wrought in his name, might themselves become ocular witnesses that those who preached his resurrection were warranted to do so by his authority; and that this authority, on which so numerous miracles attended, must be divine.\n\nWe intend not here to examine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> objections and cavils that have been advanced respecting the truth of this important fact. The kinds, however, we shall mention in general. Some have doubted of our Lord's resurrection, as being an event which is not confirmed by general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, because they imagine that what happens once should happen again, and even repeatedly, in order to be true. Some, taking their own to be preferable schemes, have objected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which it happened, and to the manner in which it is narrated.\u2014Some have imagined, that possibly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> may be false; that possibly the disciples were very ignorant, and might be deceived; that possibly, too, they were deep politicians, and a set of impostors; and that possibly the writings which detected their falsehoods may have been destroyed. It is difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, and worse to convince, against this evidence of possibilities: but we flatter ourselves, that to the candid reader it will appear sufficiently overturned in our article Miracle; where it is shown that neither clowns nor politicians could have acted the part that was acted by the apostles, had not the resurrection been an undoubted fact.\n\nSome of the objectors to it have also maintained, that possibly there is nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> without us, that there is nothing mental within us, and that possibly the whole world is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of arguing we pretend not to explain; it is thought by some to proceed entirely from a pervertent of mind or disposition, while in books of medicine it is always considered as a symptom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, and the patient recommended to be treated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, and not in the academy.\n\nBy his raising others, and particularly by rising himself, from the dead, our Saviour demonstrated that a resurrection from the dead is possible. And on that authority, which by his miracles he proved to be divine, he declared to his followers, that there is to be a general resurrection both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and of the unjust, instructing his disciples to propagate this doctrine through all nations; St Paul confessing, that if there be no resurrection of the dead, preaching is vain, and our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> is vain.\n\nAs to the order of succession in which the dead are to be raised, the Scriptures are almost silent. St Paul says, that every man is to rise in his own order, and that the dead in Christ are to rise first: and St John observed in his vision, that the souls of them which were beheaded for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>, neither his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a>,\n\nVol. XVII. Part II.\n\nNeither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or resurrection in their hands, lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the dead lived not again until the thousand years (y) were finished.\n\nA question that has much oftener agitated the minds of men is, with what sort of bodies are the dead to be raised? St Paul has answered, with incorruptible and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> bodies (z). And to silence the disputatious caviller of his day, he illustrated his doctrine by the growth of grain. \"Thou fool (said he), that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain.\" To us it appears very surprising, that any one who reads this passage with the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, should perplex himself, or disturb the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> with idle attempts to prove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of the bodies with which we shall die and rise again at the last day. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> expressly affirms, that \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> and blood cannot inherit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of God; that we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; that there are celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial another.\"","sp":427,"ep":429},{"h":"OAK PUCERON","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> given by naturalists to a very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of animal of the puceron kind. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> themselves in the clefts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a> and some other trees, and getting into the crevices, where the bark is a little separated from the wood, they there live at ease, and feed to their fill, without being exposed to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> enemies. They are larger than the other pucerons, the winged ones being nearly as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> fly; and those without wings are also larger than any other species of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a>. The winged ones are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and the others of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> is twice the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of their bodies, and, when walking, it is carried straight along the belly, trailing behind it with the point up. When the creature has a mind to suck a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the tree that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before it, it draws up and shortens the trunk, till it brings it to a proper length and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; but when it sucks in the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, it crawls upon the inner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the bark, and the turned up end of the trunk, which resembles a tail, fixes itself against the wood that is behind it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to its back, and sucks there. The extremity of this trunk holds so fast by the wood, that when it is pulled away, it frequently brings a small piece of the wood away with it.\n\nThe ants are as fond of these as of the other species of pucerons, and that for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, not feeding upon them, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> their dung, which is a liquid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of a sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> juice of the tree, very little altered.

The ants are so extremely fond of the juices of the tree, when prepared for them by passing through the body of this animal, that when the puceron has a drop not yet evacuated, but hanging only in part out at the passage, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANT\">ant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> on it there.","sp":117,"ep":117},{"h":"PRO RATA","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> sometimes used by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> for in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>; as, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> must reap the profit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sustain the loss, pro rata to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, that is, in proportion to his stock.","sp":80,"ep":80},{"h":"PROJECTION","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALCHEMY\">Alchemy</a>, the casting of a certain imaginary powder, called powder of projection, into a crucible, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other vessel, full of some prepared metal, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; which is to be hereby presently transmuted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>.\n\nPowder of Projection, or of the philosophers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, is a powder supposed to have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of changing any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> metal, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, into a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> one, as silver or gold, by the admixture of a little quantity thereof.\n\nThe mark to which alchemists directed all their endeavours, was to discover this powder of projection.

Hence, when a dial is to be constructed upon a given plane, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> or inclined to the horizon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a> and inclination of that place must be previously found.\n\nIn an erect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> south dial, its zenith Z is the south point of the horizon, ZP is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of this point from the pole, and ZE its distance from the equator. If the dial is directed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, Z represents the north point of the horizon; ZP the distance of Z from the pole under the horizon; and ZE the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of the equator above the horizon.\n\nIf the dial is an erect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> or west dial, the zenith Z is the east or west points of the horizon accordingly, and the pole P is at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> distance, for the angle ZAP is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angle; and therefore the line AP will not meet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> PZ.

Should I, for instance, define a man to run with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and engage to satisfy him upon his return; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> on his return I gave him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of the usual hire in like cases; but if he be not satisfied with less than the triple of such a sum, am I obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> his demands? This will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to consider the rules by which a promise should be interpreted.\n\nIf a promise were always to be deemed obligatory Whether in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> in which the promisee receives it, a man would not know what he had promised; the promiser, from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of views, associations, and interests, or promisee might conceive a sense of which the promiser had never dreamed; might suppose engagements which were never intended, which could not be foreseen, and, although foreseen, could not be performed. For these reasons it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to think that the sense of the promiser should rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the interpretation. He knows precisely what it is he has undertaken, and is unquestionably the best judge of what meaning he affixed to his words. His explanation should therefore be admitted, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> alone could give him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to decide in the affair.\n\nBut something more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> information, or a knowledge of the cause, is expected from a judge, as integrity is equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to his character. Doubts may arise when the words will admit of various meanings, whether the promiser will be so candid as impartially to own the precise meaning which he had actually annexed to his expressions: At any rate, if he wishes to deceive, he might purposely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a>, and perform the promise in a sense of his own without satisfying the reasonable hopes of the promisee.\n\nWhen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Tarpeius bargained with Tatus to betray the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a> for what he and his Sabines wore on their left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, meaning their rings and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> bracelets, Tatus probably performed his promise in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> which he intended, when he caused her to be buried under their shields, which they carried also on their left hands. But who will say that here were not treachery and a dishonourable abuse of that confidence which had been repose in him?\nIt must therefore be obvious, that the import of a promise, where its meaning is disputed, is not to be determined by the sense of the promiser nor by the expectations of the promisee; and if it was said that the obligation of a promise arose from those expectations which had been raised by it, the affront now must be limited to those expectations which were intentionally raised by the promiser, or those which to his knowledge the promisee was induced to entertain in consequence of that declaration which had been made to him. Should there still be a doubt about what expectations were intentionally raised, and what should have been reasonably entertained, recourse must be had to the judgement of those who are allowed to be persons of candour, and who are acquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the men, and with those circumstances in which the promise was made.\n\nThe following are some of the cases in which a promise is not binding. As the obligation to perform the promise arises from those expectations which are intentionally raised by the promiser; it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> promise can be binding before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a>, before the promise has been communicated to the promisee, and before he has entertained hopes of its performance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is similar where a promise is released, that is, where the performance is dispensed with by the promisee, and where he entertains no expectations on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of any thing than the promiser has said to him. Should a third person entertain hopes on account of the promise, he is to cherish these hopes at his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a>, having no encouragement from the promiser to do so: yet if this person has been warranted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> by the promisee, the promisee has renounced his privilege of releasing the promise, and along with the promiser becomes bound for its performance.\n\nA promise is not binding where the performance is unlawful; and the performance is unlawful where it is contrary to former promises, or to any moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> precept, which from the beginning to the end of time is of perpetual and unalterable obligation. Thus no man is bound by his promise to give me what he has already promised to another; and no man is bound by his promise to blaspheme God, to commit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, or to criminate the innocent. Such promises are unlawfully made, and cannot be otherwise than unlawfully performed.\n\nSome have even carried their scruples so far as to doubt, whether any promise unlawfully made, can be lawfully performed. Should a man, during the lifetime of his wife, happen to promise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> to another, such a man (they say) by the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> has already committed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a> in his heart; and should he afterwards become a widower, he is not bound, and he even ought not, to fulfil his engagements, as this would be putting his criminal intention into execution. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, we must confess, is to us unintelligible.\u2014As the wife is dead, what now should prevent the man from marrying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his affections? Why, say the casuists, he already is under a promise to marry her, and his promise was made at a time when it should not have been made. It is true, the performance, considered by itself, is opposed by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>; but then it originated in what was wrong; and however much the Supreme Being and the bulk of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> may be out of the secret, we have discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> logic of casuistry, that evil can never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> out of good, nor good out of evil; but that the means and the end, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, are always of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> in morals.\n\nWhen a promise is made, the particular circumstances in which it is to be deemed obligatory are sometimes mentioned. \"I promise (for instance) to lend my friend 200 pounds within three days, provided a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDITOR\">creditor</a> which I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> do not make a demand on me before that time. In other cases no circumstance is foreseen by the promiser to prevent the fulfilling of his engagement; and hence we have erroneous promises, which proceed on the supposition that things are true, possible, and lawful, which are not so. An erroneous promise, which proceeds on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> representation of the promisee, is not binding.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> lately purchased an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> in the south of England at a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, believing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> in the newspapers, and which likewise was given by the auctioneer, to be true; but finding afterwards that the estate nowise corresponded to the description, the law freed him from his engagement, because the seller had evidently been guilty of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of promise in not satisfying those expectations which he had intentionally and even studiously excited in the buyers.\n\nAn erroneous promise, whose performance is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, is not binding. Before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> a planter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOBAGO\">Tobago</a> promised to send to his friend in England 12 hogsheads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> from the next year's produce of his estate; but before that time Tobago fell into the hands of the French, and the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> found it impossible to answer the expectations of his friend in England.\n\nAn erroneous promise, whose performance is unlawful, or, to speak more precisely, whose performance is contrary to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> promise, or to any moral or religious obligation, is not binding. A father, believing the accounts from abroad of his son's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, soon after bequeathed his fortune to his nephew; but the son, the report of whose death had been false, returns home, and the father is released from the promise to his nephew, because it was contrary to a prior promise, which he had tacitly come under to his son. This prior promise was implied in the whole of the father's conduct, and was expressed in signs as emphatic and as unequivocal as those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. It had all the effect too of the most solemn promise on the son, who, to his father's knowledge, was induced in consequence of this promise to entertain the most languine hopes of succeeding to his father, if he survived. The world likewise could bear testimony that these expectations were not rashly cherished. He was brought into existence by means of his father, who was thereby understood to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> him affectionately; he was ushered into society as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and was therefore supposed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of its wealth. Religion itself supported his pretensions, pronouncing the father worse than an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> who neglects to show that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to his children which the world naturally expects from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>.\u2014That the father's promise was not released from the mere circumstance that the mistake was known to his nephew the promisee, will appear plain from the following circumstance. Suppose the father a landed proprietor, that the lease of one of his farms has expired, and that he has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been expecting\nPromise, to let it at \u00a3200l.; suppose that this sum is refused, and that he agrees with the present tenant to grant a new lease at \u00a3150l.\u2014the obligation here to perform his promise is not dissolved by an after offer of \u00a3200l., though the tenant knew that \u00a3200l. had been expected, and that only from despairing of that sum his landlord had granted the new lease at \u00a3150l.: the promise is binding, because the performance is every way lawful, contrary to no prior engagement, and opposed to no principle in morals. The law of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, were the proprietor reluctant, would enforce the obligation, and exact obedience in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of authority; because breaches of faith, were they permitted in such cases, would destroy all confidence, and annihilate the bonds of social <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>:\n\nMen live and prosper but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> trust;\nA confidence of one another's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\nOroonoko.\n\nThe great difficulty which many have to encounter in determining when erroneous promises ought or ought not to be kept, arises from their proceeding on a principle of whole consequences they do not seem to be always aware. There is seldom, they perceive, a virtuous action that is not attended with some happy effects; and it will, perhaps, be generally allowed, that the comparative merit of similar virtues may safely be estimated by their utility: But to make utility, as some do, the criterion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and pronounce an action vicious or virtuous merely on account of those consequences which they see may flow from it, is a dangerous maxim. Evil has often sprung out of good, and good out of evil; and good and evil have frequently sprung from the same action. In Mandeville's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIVE\">Hive</a>,\n\nThat root of evil Avarice,\nThat damn'd ill-natur'd baneful vice,\nWas slave to Prodigality,\nThat noble sin; whilst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">Luxury</a>\nEmploy'd a million of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>,\nAnd odious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">Pride</a> a million more.\nEnvy itself and Vanity\nWere ministers of Industry:\nThat darling folly, Fickleness,\nIn diet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, and dress,\nThat strange ridiculous vice, was made\nThe very wheel that turn'd the trade.\n\nThe description here is not altogether false; and these indeed may be some of the consequences that flow from avarice, luxury, pride, vanity, and envy: but there are not all.\u2014To see at once all the consequences that spring from an action, the good and the bad, the particular and general, the immediate and remote, would require sometimes the foresight of Omniscience, and at all times a knowledge superior to what is human. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">Fable</a> of the Bees, the author's object was to show that private vices are public benefits; and he therefore was naturally led by his argument to consider only such consequences of vice as favoured his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. He wanted candour. And that artifice which runs through his Fable happens to remind us, that while the remote and the general effects of an action may not be seen, the particular and immediate, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> within our notice, are apt to be viewed through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of paffion, interest, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. For these reasons, it appears surprising how any person should ever imagine that the obligation to perform a promise should depend entirely upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> which the promiser apprehended of its utility.\n\nThe best refutation of such an opinion are the singular conclusions to which it leads.\n\nA late writer on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, who appears to have embraced it, gets into reasoning not very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> he looks on morals as an article of trade: virtue and vice, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">Chapter</a> of Promises, ridiculous but antiquated terms for profit and loss; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and absurd, and wrong are used to express what is beneficial and what is hurtful, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, to himself and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\u2014With respect to veracity, those \"rational and intelligent beings,\" by whom he wishes the affairs of the world to be carried on, may, while they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as rational and intelligent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> or perform their promises at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. He thinks it \"essential to various circumstances of human intercourse, that we should be known to bestow a steady attention upon the quantities of convenience or inconvenience, of good or evil, that might arise to others from our conduct.\" After this attention, the disappointment of the promisor is not to be minded, though the expectations excited by these \"rational and intelligent beings\" may have \"altered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of his situation, and engaged him in undertakings from which he would otherwise have abstained.\" What the promiser takes to be the general utility and the fitness of things is to be his guide. And a breach of promise will be attended with the following advantages: \"The promisor, and all other men, will be taught to depend more upon their own exertions, and less upon the affluence of others, which caprice may refuse or justice withhold. He and all others will be taught to acquire such merit, and to engage in such pursuits, as shall oblige any honest man to come to their succour if they should stand in need of affluence.\" This breach of promise, with a view to the general utility, will, so far from being criminal, form a part of that resolute execution of justice which would in a thousand ways increase the independence, the energies, and the virtue of mankind.\"\n\nSuch are the views which determined this author to consider \"the validity of promises\" as \"inconsistent with justice,\" and as \"foreign to general good.\" From one, however, who relies with so much confidence on the promiser, it would certainly be desirable to know, chap. 3, whether the person, who violates his faith for the public utility, is always to be candid. Where breach of a private faith promotes his own interest, ought he alone to decide on the validity of his promise? or where promises, to induce are broken for the general good, is he to be guided by his schemes his own visionary schemes of utility? Is he to act as a utility on trustee for the public without any delegated power? the public, and shall the community submit to his decisions without so much as putting the question, Who hath made thee a ruler over us? When a writer thus deviates so far from the path of reason, it is natural to ask, what was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IGNIS_FATUUS\">ignis fatuus</a> that misled him? In the present case it is pretty obvious. Being something of opinion with the celebrated Turgot, that romances are the only books in which moral principles are treated in an im- book in partial manner, this gentleman, in his Chapter of chap. 6: Promises, seems to have borrowed a part of his morality from...\nfrom the doggerels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a>; and having adopted, though from different motives, the political principles of Sir Hudibras's squire, that obedience to civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is not due because it is promised, he has come to exactly the same conclusion with respect to the obligation of keeping one's word. But Ralph has reasoned with more ingenuity; and has shown not only that the public good, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, may be sometimes promoted by a breach of faith.\n\nThe saints, whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> and vows oblige,\nKnow little of their privilege;\nFarther, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on\nSome self-advantage of their own:\nFor if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>, to serve his turn,\nCan tell truth, why the saints should scorn,\nWhen it serves theirs, to swear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>,\nI think there's little reason why:\nElse he has a greater pow'r than they,\nWhich 'twere impious to say:\nW'are not commanded to forbear,\nIndefinitely, at all to swear;\nBut to swear idly, and in vain,\nWithout self-interest and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>;\nFor breaking of an oath and lying\nIs but a kind of self-denying,\nA faint-like virtue; and from hence\nSome have broke oaths by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>:\nSome, to the glory of the Lord,\nPerjur'd themselves and broke their word:\nFor saints may do the same thing by\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, in sincerity,\nWhich other men are tempted to,\nAnd at the devil's instance do.\n\nHudibras, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTO\">Canto</a> II.\n\nHere are new views of utility; which, were they to be considered as of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, would increase the difficulty of determining when an erroneous promise ought to be kept.\n\nBut should views of utility be laid aside, and should it be made an invariable rule that truth is on no account to be violated, that deceit is never to be practised, and that moral obligations are not to be dispelled for the prospect of any physical advantage; those doubts which arise concerning the validity of erroneous promises will soon disappear. Disagreeable perhaps and ridiculous consequences may sometimes arise to a few individuals from an honest and conscientious adherence to their promise; but will any assert that the general good, that burden of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a>, will ever be endangered by too much veracity?\n\nSo numerous inconveniences arise daily from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> operation of those great physical laws, which are under the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Providence, that those philosophers who have adopted the principle of utility, and are much surprized to see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a> so awkwardly planned for the ease and comfort of them and their species, have been under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of imputing many events in nature to the malignity of some evil independent being; or of allowing that things have degenerated since they first came from the hands of the Creator, and that they must now be exceedingly altered from what they had been when He chose to pronounce them all very good. Thus, absurdity or impiety must always be the consequence of judging of the vice and virtue of an action by its utility, and of estimating its utility by our limited views and erroneous conceptions.\n\nAs for extorted promises, it is curious to observe how this question should always be started, whether or not they ought to be kept; and another question should seldom be thought of, whether or not they ought to be made? Fortitude was one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> virtues, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; and is deemed of such importance promises, in the Christian system, that the fearful are clasped with the unbelievers, and are thought unworthy of the favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, as being incapable of supporting those trials to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> exposes the faithful as the true test of Christian virtue.\u2014If a person should want the necessary fortitude to be virtuous, it will be a poor excuse for his baseness, that he has added deceit to his cowardice; and surely it is not the business of morality, when it has found him guilty of one crime, to grant him a dispensation for committing two. The laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">jurisprudence</a>, it will readily be allowed, cannot favour the claims of the promisor; because they ought never to lend their support to oppression and violence. But their acquittal, should he violate his faith, will by no means vindicate the character of the promiser. Their acquitting a woman from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of adultery, goes a short way in restoring the fair reputation of her innocence.\n\nLet jurisprudence decide as it will, the man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and the generous patriot can never be brought to respect the person who, struck with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANIC\">panic</a>, could betray either himself or his friends. The magnanimous spirits who could die for the truth will view with contempt his pitiful deceit. Those unfortunate men who may suffer from that very distrust which the breach of his faith has begotten, will always detest him as a traitor and enemy; and heaven itself cannot be supposed to reward that soldier who deserts her cause, and relinquishes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> which she has assigned him, at the sight of danger.\n\nIf we once begin to accommodate morality to the dispositions and humours of mankind, it is hard to say where this species of complaisance will end. The degrees of timidity are so various, and some tempers by nature so yielding, that repeated importunity or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> request will extort a promise.\n\nA young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> was frequently pressed by her dying husband to grant him a promise that she would not marry after his death. For some time she was able to refuse with becoming spirit his absurd request; but upon his declaring oftener than once that he could not otherwise die in peace, she complied and promised. Too young and weak, however, for this effort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINENCE\">continence</a>, she afterwards listened to the addresses of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> lover, and found her heart inflexibly engaged before she adverted to the impropriety of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>. But proposals of marriage could scarcely fail to remind her of her promise and awaken her scruples. These she communicated to her lover, with her firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to remain a widow, if the contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, which she greatly preferred, and on which her earthly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> depended, were not approved by some spiritual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a>.\n\nUpon this declaration it was agreed to take the advice of their own minister, who was an eminent dissenting clergyman.\nPromise. clergyman in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>; but this gentleman, unwilling to decide in a matter of such importance, proposed to refer it to Dr Secker, who was then bishop of that see. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> too declined to give any judgment in the case; but, as was his way, muttered up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of arguments on each side of the question, and committed them to a letter, which a learned gentleman of our acquaintance had some time ago an opportunity of seeing in manuscript.\n\nIf the sentiments to which the bishop was inclined could have been inferred from his statement of arguments, he seemed to think that the promise was binding. In our opinion, he ought to have given a positive decision. It was no matter whether the promise was distorted or not; the promise was made; and the question was now, whether or not was the performance lawful? That it was lawful appears evident. The lady was under a moral obligation to remain a widow; and no moral obligation, so far as we know, required her to marry.\n\nTo be fruitful and multiply, indeed, is declared in Scripture, and is found, to the woful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of many, to be one of the general laws of our nature. But of all those laws intended by nature to regulate the conduct of inferior intelligences, the moral, which were meant to be checks and correctors of those abuses to which the physical are apt to be carried, are certainly the most sacred and obligatory. To procreate his species, a man is not then to be guilty of adultery, or of fornication, or to listen to the lewd calls of incontinency. St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, that it is better to marry than burn, cannot be allowed in this instance to have much weight. He has not defined what degree of amorous inflammation constitutes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, nor in what cases this burning would be a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> for marrying. In the present instance he does not even consider marriage as a duty; he compares it with burning, and thinks it only the least of the two evils. Not that marriage is evil of itself; for he that marrieth doth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>; but there are circumstances in which it would be inconvenient to marry, and in which he that marrieth not is said to do better. But if those inconveniences be reasons sufficient to deter from marrying, is that person to be held excusable who, in order to gratify an animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, somewhat refined, should violate an oath, and trample on a sacred moral obligation?\n\nThe young lady might indeed declare that her earthly happiness was at an end if she were not permitted to marry again; but what circumstance prevented her from marrying? It was not the opinion of her own pastor, or the bishop of Oxford: the truth is, it was certain scruples of her own, which being unable of herself to overcome, she had piously solicited the assistance of others. It is certainly a misfortune that a devotional and amorous turn should always be so closely connected in the females. Both, however, cannot always be indulged. Who will say, that the motive is rational which inclines one to cherish a passion which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> disapproves? The virtue of continency might indeed have borne hard on this lady's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and in her way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> happiness might have formed a gate so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIT\">strait</a> and narrow as it might be difficult for her to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through; but after all, her case was not harder than that of mans, who take the vows of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHASTITY\">chastity</a>, and endure sufferings of a similar nature, and in some instances even perhaps greater than hers; yet doing it cheerfully, from the supposition that the Omnipotent is well acquainted with the nature of the great sacrifice which they make, and that after death he will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> to requite them, and bestow on them something like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, which in their opinion can scarcely be less than a happiness in heaven as ample as their wishes and as lasting as their souls.\n\nEvery promise, therefore, which is not released, nor fraudulently obtained by the promisor, is to be held binding if the performance be lawful and possible.\n\nThe Christian cannot, and a man of honour will scarcely venture to reject this maxim, that a good man ought not to change though he swear to his hurt. Yet an oath, a simple promise and a promissory oath are not very different in point of obligation. Most people know, and where any moral duty is concerned, they ought particularly to reflect, that this world is governed by an Almighty Being, who knows all things, who lives always, and who is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> to reward and to punish. The person who makes a promissory oath does it avowedly under an immediate tenet of these truths; the person who makes a simple promise, though he certainly ought, yet may not reflect on these at the time. The former, when he violates his oath, exhibits, only to outward appearance, a greater contempt of the Divine power, knowledge, and justice, than he who violates a simple promise under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the same truths. To Him who knows the secrets of the heart, the breach of the promise must appear as criminal as the breach of the oath.

To give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> idea of the pronunciation of a language, it seems necessary to fix as nearly as possible all the several sounds employed in the pronunciation of that language. Cicero tells us, that the pronunciation underwent several changes among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>: and indeed it is more precarious in the living languages, being, as Du <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOS\">Bos</a> tells us, subservient to fashion in these. The French language is clogged with a difficulty in pronunciation from which most others are free; and it consists in this, that most of their words have two different pronunciations, the one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>, the other in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>.\n\nAs to the pronunciation of the English language, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> Mr Martin, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPELLING\">Spelling</a>-Book of Arts and Sciences, lays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the following rules: 1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> (e) lengthens the sound of the foregoing vowel; as in can, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>; rob, robe; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUN\">tun</a>, tune, &c. 2. The final (e), in words ending in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>, is founded before the r like u; as maffacre, maffacre-cur; lucre, lu cur, &c. 3. The Latin diphthongs ae, oe, are founded like e; as Eina, Eina, economy, economy, &c.; but at the end of the words oe sounds like o; as in toe, foe, &c. 4. Also the English improper diphthongs, ea, eo, eu, ue, found only the e and u; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> or te; jeofee or jeffe; due or du; true or tru, &c. though sometimes eo and ea are pronounced like ce, as in people, fear, near, &c. 5. Sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPHTHONG\">diphthong</a> (ie) is pronounced like e in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a>, like ee in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, and, at the end of words, always like y, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, &c.; and ei is pronounced either like e or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AI\">ai</a>, as in deceit, reign, &c. 6. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIPHTHONG\">triphthong</a> eau is pronounced like o, in beau and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JET_D_EAU\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a> d'eau; and ieu founds like u in lieu, adieu, &c. 7. The sound of e is hard before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOWELS\">vowels</a> a, o, u, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, cup, &c.; also sometimes before h, as in chart, cold, &c.; and before l and r, as in clear, creep, &c. It is otherwise generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, cells, cyder, child, &c. 8. In French words ch is founded like sh, as in chargreen, machine; and sometimes like qu, as in choir. 9. The sound of g is hard before a, o, u, l, r, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>, go, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, glean, grope; also before ui, as in guill, guild, &c.; and before h, as in gholf; sometimes before i, as in gibbous, gibberish. It is also generally hard before e, as in get, geld, &c.; but soft in many words derived from the Greek and Latin, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEALOGY\">genealogy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, &c. Two gg are always hard, as in danger, &c. The sound of g, when soft, is like that of j. 10. In any part of a word, ph sounds like f, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, &c. 11. The sound of qu, at the end of French words, is like k, as in rigueur, &c. 12. The syllables ti and ci, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> followed by a vowel, found like fi or fli; as in fiction, logician, &c. 13. When ce occurs before i, the first is hard and the latter as soft; as in flaccid, &c. 14. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> p is not pronounced at the beginning of syllables before f and t; as in palm, piarmics, &c. As to other peculiarities regarding the pronunciation of single letters, many of them have been taken notice of at the beginning of each, in the course of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nBut it is not enough to know the just pronunciation of single letters, but also of words: in order to which, the accenting of words ought to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> understood; since nothing is more harsh and disagreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, than to hear a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> speak or read with wrong accents. And indeed in English the same word is often both a noun and a verb, distinguished only by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a>, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> of the noun, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of the verb; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a> and ferment; record and record, &c. We are to observe also, that in order to a just <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of words, some require only a single accent on the syllable, as in torment, &c.; but in others it should be marked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, as in animal, because it is pronounced as if the letter were wrote double, viz. animal.\n\nMr Sheridan's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found extremely useful as a directory in acquiring the pronunciation of the English language; but care must be taken to avoid his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> brogue, which has certainly miffled him in several instances. Mr Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary, lately published, will likewise deserve the student's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.

Their mortars are proved with the chambers full of powder, and the shells loaded. Three rounds are fired as quick as possible.\n\n2nd, The Dutch prove all their artillery by firing each piece 5 times; the two first rounds with a quantity of powder = 2-3ds of the weight of the shot; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> three rounds with a quantity of powder = \u00bd the weight of the shot.\n\n3rd, The French the same as the Dutch.\n\nProof, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a> and other spirituous liquors, is a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> lather which appears on the top of the liquor when poured into a glass.

Plants are also propagated by parting their roots, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which, properly managed, sends out fresh roots. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of propagating plants is by layering or laying the tops of the branches in the ground.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of layering is this: Dig a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>-trench round the stool, of a depth suitable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the plant; and having pitched upon the shoots to be layered, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the trench (either with or without ploughing, as may be found most convenient), and there peg them fast; or, putting some mould upon them, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> them hard enough to prevent their springing up again\u2014fill in the mould\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYER\">layer</a> in an upright posture, treading the mould hard behind it; and cut it carefully off above the first, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, or third eye.

The annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of one seed even of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> mallow has been found to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than 200,000; but it has been proved, by a strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> into the more minute parts of the vegetable world, that the common wall moss produces a much more numerous offspring. In one of the little heads of this plant there have been counted 13,824 seeds. Now allotting to a root of this plant eight branches, and to each branch six heads, which appears to be a very moderate computation, the produce of one seed is $6 \\times 13824 = 82944$; and $8 \\times 82944$ gives 663,552 seeds as the annual produce of one seed, and that so small that 13824 of them are contained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> is but one ninth of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> but one 23rd of an inch, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> but the 13th part of a grain.\n\nFor the propagation or culture of particular plants, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">AGRICULTURE</a>.","sp":65,"ep":66},{"h":"PROPERITUS","t":"Sextus Aurelius, a celebrated Latin poet, born at Mevania, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Umbria, now called Bevagna, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPOLETO\">Spoleto</a>.

Not that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> of goods seems ever to have been applicable, even\neven in the earliest ages, to aught but the substance of the thing; nor could it be extended to the use of it. For, by the law of nature and reason, he who first began to use it, acquired therein a kind of transient property, that lasted so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as he was using it, and no longer: or, to speak with greater precision, the right of possession continued for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> only that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of possession lasted. Thus the ground was in common, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it was the permanent property of any man in particular; yet whoever was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of any determinate spot of it, for rent, for trade, or the like, acquired for the time a sort of ownership, from which it would have been unjust, and contrary to the law of nature, to have driven him by force; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> that he quitted the use or occupation of it, another might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> it without injustice. Thus also a vine or other tree might be said to be in common, as all were equally entitled to its produce; and yet any private individual might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the sole property of the fruit, which he had gathered for his own repast. A doctrine well illustrated by Cicero, who compares the world to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, which is common to the public, and yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which any man has taken is for the time his own.\n\nBut when mankind increased in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, craft, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>, it became necessary to entertain conceptions of more permanent dominion; and to appropriate to individuals, not the immediate use only, but the very substance of the thing to be used: otherwise innumerable tumults must have arisen, and the good order of the world been continually broken and disturbed, while a variety of persons were striving who should get the first occupation of the same thing, or disputing which of them had actually gained it. As human life also grew more and more refined, abundance of conveniences were devised to render it more easy, commodious, and agreeable; as habitations for shelter and safety, and raiment for warmth and decency. But no man would be at the trouble to provide either, so long as he had only an usufructuary property in them, which was to cease the instant that he quitted possession;\u2014if, as soon as he walked out of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, or pulled off his garments, the next stranger who came by would have a right to inhabit the one and to wear the other. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of habitations in particular, it was natural to observe, that even the brute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, to whom every thing else was in common, maintained a permanent property in their dwellings, especially for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of their young; that the birds of the air had nests, and the beasts of the field had caverns, the invasion of which they esteemed a very flagrant injustice, and would sacrifice their lives to preserve them. Hence a property was soon established in every man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and home-stall; which seem to have been originally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> temporary huts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> cabins, suited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> for more speedily peopling the earth, and suited to the wandering life of their owners, before any extensive property in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> or ground was established. And there can be no doubt, but that moveables of every kind became sooner appropriated than the permanent substantial soil; partly because they were more susceptible of a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPANCY\">occupancy</a>, which might be continued for months together without any sensible interruption, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> by usage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> into an established right; but principally because few of them could be fit for use, till improved and meliorated by the bodily labour of the occupant; which bodily labour, bestowed upon any subject which before lay in common to all men, is universally allowed to give the fairest and most reasonable title to an exclusive property therein.\n\nThe article of food was a more immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a>, and therefore a more early consideration. Such as were not other contented with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of the earth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> sought for a more solid refreshment in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of beasts, which they obtained by hunting. But the frequent disappointments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> to that method of provision induced them to gather together such animals as were of a more tame and docile nature; and to establish a permanent property in their flocks and herds, in order to sustain themselves in a less precarious manner, partly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> of their dams, and partly by the flesh of the young. The support of these their cattle made the article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> also a very important point. And therefore the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a> (the most venerable monument of antiquity, considered merely with a view to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>) Nature will furnish us with frequent instances of violent contrariarchal divisions concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>; the exclusive property of which appears to have been established in the first digger or occupant, even in such places where the ground and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERBAGE\">herbage</a> remained yet in common. Thus we find <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, who was but a sojourner, asserting his right to a well in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABIMELECH\">Abimelech</a>, and exacting an oath for his security, \"because he had digged that well.\" And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a>, about 90 years afterwards, reclaimed this his father's property; and, after much contention with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILISTINES\">Philistines</a>, was suffered to enjoy it in peace.\n\nAll this while the soil and pasture of the earth remained still in common as before, and open to every occupant: except perhaps in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a sole and exclusive property in lands (for the sake of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>) was earlier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, and therefore more readily complied with. Otherwise, when the multitude of men and cattle had consumed every convenience on one spot of ground, it was deemed a natural right to seize upon and occupy such other lands as would more easily supply their necessities. This practice is still retained among the wild and uncultivated nations that have never been formed into civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a> and others in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>; where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> itself, and the boundless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their territory, confine to retain them still in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> state of vagrant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, which was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> in the earliest ages, and which Tacitus informs us continued among the Germans till the decline of the Roman empire. We have also a striking example of the same kind in the history of Abraham and his nephew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">Lot</a>. When their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> substance became so great, that pasture and other conveniences grew scarce, the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that a strife arose between their servants; so that it was no longer practicable to dwell together. This contention Abraham endeavoured to compose: \"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between thee and me. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: If thou wilt take the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.\" This plainly implies an acknowledged right, in either, to occupy whatever ground he pleased, that was not pre-occupied by other tribes. \"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a>, that it was well watered everywhere, even as the garden of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, and journeyed east; and Abraham dwelt in the land of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>,\"\nUpon the same principle was founded the right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIGRATION\">migration</a>, or sending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> to find out new habitations, when the mother-country was overcharged with inhabitants; which was practised as well by the Phoenicians and Greeks, as the Germans, Scythians, and other northern people. And, so long as it was confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> and cultivation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> uninhabited countries, it kept strictly within the limits of the law of nature.\n\nBut as the world by degrees grew more populous, it daily became more difficult to find out new spots to inhabit, without encroaching upon former occupants; and by constantly occupying the same individual spot, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the earth were consumed, and its spontaneous produce destroyed, without any provision for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> supply or succession. It therefore became necessary to pursue some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> method of providing a constant subsistence; and this necessity produced, or at least promoted and encouraged, the art of agriculture. And the art of agriculture, by a regular connection and consequence, introduced and established the idea of a more permanent property in the soil than had hitherto been received and adopted. It was clear that the earth would not produce her fruits in sufficient quantities without the assistance of tillage; but who would be at the pains of tilling it, if another might watch an opportunity to seize upon and enjoy the product of his industry, art, and labour? Had not therefore a separate property in lands, as well as moveables, been vested in some individuals, the world must have continued a forest, and men have been mere animals of prey; which, according to some philosophers, is the genuine state of nature. Whereas now (so graciously has Providence interwoven our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> and our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> together) the result of this very necessity has been the ennobling of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, by giving it opportunities of improving in rational faculties, as well as of exerting its natural. Necessity begat property; and in order to insure that property, recourse was had to civil society, which brought along with it a long train of inseparable concomitants; states, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, laws, punishments, and the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> duties. Thus connected together, it was found that a part only of society was sufficient to provide, by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour, for the necessary subsistence of all; and leisure was given to others to cultivate the human mind, to invent useful arts, and to lay the foundations of science.\n\nThe only question remaining is, How this property became actually vested; or what it is that gave a man an exclusive right to retain in a permanent manner that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> land which before belonged generally to everybody, but particularly to nobody? And as we before observed, that occupancy gave the right to the temporary use of the soil; so it is agreed upon all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, that occupancy gave also the original right to the permanent property in the substance of the earth itself, which excludes every one else but the owner from the use of it. There is indeed some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> among the writers on natural law, concerning the reason why occupancy should convey this right, and invest one with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> property: Grotius and Puffendorf insisting, that this right of occupancy is founded upon a tacit and implied assent of all mankind, that the first occupant should become the owner; and Barbeyrac, Titus, Mr. Locke, and others, holding that there is no such implied assent, neither is it necessary that there should be; for that the very act of occupancy, alone, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of bodily labour, is from a principle of natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, without any consent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, sufficient of itself to gain a title. A dispute that favours too much of nice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHOLASTIC\">scholastic</a> refinement. However, both sides agree in this, that occupancy is the thing by which the title was in fact originally gained; every man seizing to his own continued use such spots of ground as he found most agreeable to his own convenience, provided he found them unoccupied by any one else.\n\nProperty, both in lands and moveables, being thus originally acquired by the first taker, which taking means it is amounts to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, that he intends to appropriate preferred the thing to his own use, it remains in him, by the principle of universal law, till such time as he does some other act which shows an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to abandon it; for then it becomes naturally speaking, publici juris once more, and is liable to be again appropriated by the next occupant. So if one is possessed of a jewel, and casts it into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIGHWAY\">highway</a>, this is such an express delictum, that a property will be vested in the first fortunate finder that shall seize it to his own use. But if he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a> it privately in the earth, or other secret place, and it is discovered, the finder acquires no property therein; for the owner had not by this act declared any intention to abandon it, but rather the contrary: and if he loses or drops it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, it cannot be collected from thence that he despaired to quit the possession; and therefore in such case the property still remains in the loser, who may claim it again of the finder. And this, we may remember, is the doctrine of the English law with relation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-TREASURE_TROVE\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">Treasure</a>-Trove.\n\nBut this method of one man's abandoning his property, and another seizing the vacant possession, however well-founded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, could not long subsist in fact. It was calculated merely for the rudiments of civil society, and necessarily ceased among the complicated interests and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> refinements of polite and established governments. In these it was found, that what became inconvenient or useless to one man, was highly convenient and useful to another; who was ready to give in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for it some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> that was equally desirable to the former proprietor. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> convenience introduced commercial traffic, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> transfer of property by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, grant, or conveyance: which may be considered either as a continuance of the original possession which the first occupant had; or as an abandoning of the thing by the present owner, and an immediate successive occupancy of the same by the new proprietor. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> delictum of the owner, and delivering the possession to another individual, amount to a transfer of the property; the proprietor declaring his intention no longer to occupy the thing himself, but that his own right of occupancy shall be vested in the new acquiree. Or, taken in the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, if I agree to part with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> of my land to Titius, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> of conveyance is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of my intending to abandon the property; and Titius, being the only or first man acquainted with such my intention, immediately steps in and seizes the vacant possession: thus the consent expressed by the conveyance gives Titius a good right against me; and possession or occupancy confirms that right against all the world besides.\n\nThe most universal and effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of abandoning property is by the death of the occupant: when, both on the death of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> possession and intention of keeping possession pant.\nProperty, on ceasing, the property, which is founded upon such possession and intention, ought also to cease of course. For, naturally speaking, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> a man ceases to be, he ceases to have any dominion over it; if he had a right to dispose of his acquisitions one moment beyond his life, he would also have a right to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> their disposal for a million of ages after him; which would be highly absurd and inconvenient (A). All property must therefore cease upon death, considering men as absolute individuals, and unconnected with civil society: for then, by the principles before established, the next immediate occupant would acquire a right in all that the deceased possessed. But as, under civilized governments, which are calculated for the peace of mankind, such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> would be productive of endless disturbances, the universal law of almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> (which is a kind of secondary law of nature) has either given the dying person a power of continuing his property, by disposing of his possessions by will; or, in case he neglects to dispose of it, or is not permitted to make any disposition at all, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNICIPAL\">municipal</a> law of the country then steps in, and declares who shall be the successor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of the deceased; that is, who alone shall have a right to enter upon this vacant possession, in order to avoid that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> which its becoming again common would occasion. And farther, in case no testament be permitted by the law, or none be made, and no heir can be found so qualified as the law requires, still, to prevent the robust title of occupancy from again taking place, the doctrine of escheats is adopted in almost every country; whereby the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> of the state, and those who claim under his authority, are the ultimate heirs, and succeed to those inheritances to which no other title can be formed.\n\nThe right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>, or descent to the children and relations of the deceased, seems to have been allowed much earlier than the right of devising by testament. We are apt to conceive at the first view that it has nature on its side; yet we often mistake for nature what we find established by long and inveterate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. It is certainly a wise and effectual, but clearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a>, establishment; since the permanent right of property, vested in the ancestor himself, was not natural, but merely a civil right. It is true, that the transmission of one's possessions to posterity has an evident tendency to make a man a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> and a useful member of society; it sets the passions on the side of duty, and prompts a man to deserve well of the public, when he is sure that the reward of his services will not die with himself, but be transmitted to those with whom he is connected by the dearest and most tender affections. Yet, reasonable as this foundation of the right of inheritance may seem, it is probable that its immediate original arose not from speculations altogether so delicate and refined, and, if not from fortuitous circumstances, at least from a plainer and more simple principle. A man's children or nearest relations are usually about him on his death-bed, and are the earliest witnesses of his decease. They became therefore generally the next immediate occupants, till at length in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time this frequent usage ripened into general law. And therefore also in the earliest ages, on failure of children, a man's servants born under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> were allowed to be his heirs; being immediately on the spot when he died. For we find the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> Abraham expressly declaring, that \"since God had given him no seed, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> Eliezer, one born in his house, was his heir.\"\n\nWhile property continued only for life, testaments last wills were useless and unknown; and when it became inheritable, the inheritance was long indefeasible, and the children or heirs at law were incapable of exclusion by will. Till at length it was found, that so strict a rule of inheritance made heirs disobedient and headstrong, defrauded creditors of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> debts, and prevented many provident fathers from dividing or charging their estates as the exigence of their families required. This introduced pretty generally the right of disposing of one's property, or a part of it, by testament; that is, by written or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> instructions properly witnessed and authenticated, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the deceased; which we therefore emphatically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> his will. This was established in some countries much later than in others. In England, till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, a man could only dispose of one-third of his moveables from his wife and children; and in general, no will was permitted of lands till the reign of Henry VIII., and then only of a certain portion; for it was not till after the Reformation that the power of devising real property became so universal as at present.\n\nWills, therefore, and testaments, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of inheritance, and successions, are all of them creatures of the civil or municipal laws, and accordingly are in all respects regulated by them; every different country having different ceremonies and requisites to make a testament completely valid; neither does anything vary more than Blackstone's Commentaries on the laws of England, under different national establishments. In England particularly, this diversity is carried to such a length, as if it had been meant to point out the power of the laws in regulating the succession to property, and how futile every claim must be that has not its foundation in the positive rules of the state. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> estates, the father may succeed to his children; in landed property, he never can be their immediate heir by any remote possibility: in general, only the eldest son, in some places only the youngest, in others all the sons together, have a right to succeed to the inheritance: in real estates, males are preferred to females, and the eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> will usually exclude the rest; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of personal estates, the females of equal degree are admitted together with the males, and no right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMOGENITURE\">primogeniture</a> is allowed.\n\nThis one consideration may help to remove the scruples of many well-meaning persons, who set up a respecting mistaken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> in opposition to the rules of law, heritable property. If a man disinherits his son, by a will duly executed and removed, and leaves his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> to a stranger, there are many who consider this proceeding as contrary to natural justice; while others so scrupulously adhere to the supposed intention of the dead, that if a will of lands be attested by only two witnesses instead of three, which the law requires,\n\n(A) This right, inconvenient as it certainly is, the law of Scotland gives to every man over his real estate, by authorizing him to entail it on his heirs for ever. See Law, clxxx. 9, 10, 11, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAILZIE\">Tailzie</a>.\nProperty requires, they are apt to imagine that the heir is bound in conscience to relinquish his title to the devisee. But both of them certainly proceed upon very erroneous principles: as if, on the one hand, the son by nature had a right to succeed to his father's lands; or as if, on the other hand, the owner was by nature entitled to direct the succession of his property after his own decease. Whereas the law of nature suggests, that on the death of the possessor, the estate should again become common, and be open to the next occupant, unless otherwise ordered, for the sake of civil peace, by the positive law of society. The positive law of society, which is with us the municipal laws of England and Scotland, directs it to vest in such person as the last proprietor shall by will, attended with certain requisites, appoint; and, in effect of such appointment, to go to some particular person; who, from the result of certain local constitutions, appears to be the heir at law. Hence it follows, that where the appointment is regularly made, there cannot be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of right in any one but the person appointed; and, where the necessary requisites are omitted, the right of the heir is equally strong, and built upon as solid a foundation, as the right of the devisee would have been, supposing such requisites were observed.\n\nBut, after all, there are some few things, which, notwithstanding the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> and continuance of property, must still unavoidably remain in common; being such wherein nothing but an usufructuary property is capable of being had: and therefore they still belong to the first occupant, during the time he holds possession of them, and no longer. Such (among others) are the elements of light, air, and water; which a man may occupy by means of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a>, his gardens, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, and other conveniences: such also are the generality of those animals which are said to be ferae naturae, or of a wild and untameable disposition; which any man may seize upon and keep for his own use or pleasure. All these things, so long as they remain in possession, every man has a right to enjoy without disturbance; but if once they escape from his custody, or he voluntarily abandons the use of them, they return to the common stock, and any other man has an equal right to seize and enjoy them afterwards.\n\nAgain, there are other things in which a permanent property may subsist, not only as to the temporary use, but also the solid substance; and which yet would be frequently found without a proprietor, had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the law provided a remedy to obviate this inconvenience. Such are forests and other waste grounds, which were omitted to be appropriated in the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of lands: such also are wrecks, estrays, and that species of wild animals, which the arbitrary constitutions of positive law have distinguished from the rest by the well-known appellation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>. With regard to these and some others, as disturbances and quarrels would frequently arise among individuals contending about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of this species of property by first occupancy, the law has therefore wisely cut up the root of dissension, by vesting the things themselves in the sovereign of the state; or else in his representatives appointed and authorized by him, being usually the lords of manors. And thus our legislature has universally promoted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> ends of civil society, the peace and security of individuals, by steadily pursuing that wise and orderly maxim, of assigning to every property thing capable of ownership a legal and determinate owner.\n\nIn this age of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> and innovation, much has been said of liberty and equality; and some few have of those contended for an equalization of property. One of who con- tend the wildest declaimers on this subject, who is for abolishing property altogether, has (unadventently we suppose) given a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, not only of his own arguments, but also of the arguments of all who have written, or, we think, can write, on the same side of the question. After labouring to prove that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> injustice in any man to retain more than is absolutely necessary to supply him with food, clothes, and shelter, this zealous reformer states an objection to his theory, arising from the well-known allurements of sloth, which, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of property were not permitted, would banish industry from the whole world. The objection he urges fairly, and answers it thus: \"It may be observed, that the equality for which we are pleading is an equality that would succeed to a state of great intellectual improvement. So bold a revolution cannot take place in human affairs, till the general mind has been highly cultivated. The present age of mankind is greatly enlightened; but it is to be feared is not yet enlightened enough. Hasty and undigested tumults may take place, under the idea of an equalization of property; but it is only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> and clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of justice, of justice mutually to be rendered and received, of happiness to be produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEJECTION\">dejection</a> of our most rooted habits, that can introduce an invariable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of this sort. Attempts without this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> will be productive only of confusion. Their effect will be momentary, and a new and more barbarous inequality will succeed. Each man with unaltered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> will watch his opportunity to gratify his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of power, or his love of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, by usurping on his inattentive neighbours.\"\n\nThese are just observations, and such as we have often made to ourselves on the various proposed reforms of ignominy of government. The illumination which the author requires before he would introduce his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of human property, would constitute men more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>; for to be under the influence of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> or appetite, and to be guided in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> by unmixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> and pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, is a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> which we can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to no being inferior to God. But it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the greater part of this writer's book to prove that all men must arrive at such perfection before his ideal republic can contribute to their happiness; and therefore every one who is conscious of being at any time swayed by passion, and who feels that he is more attached to his wife or children than to strangers, will look without envy to the present inequalities of property and power, if he be an intelligent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Mr. Godwin.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> PROPERTY. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">Copy</a>-Right.\n\nPROPHECY is a word derived from \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">Definition</a>. In its original import signifies the prediction of future events.\n\nAs God alone can perceive with certainty the future actions of free agents, and the remote consequences of proves a future laws of nature which he himself established, prophecies, when clearly fulfilled, affords the most convincing evidence of an intimate and supernatural communion between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>.\nProphecy between God and the person who uttered the prediction. Together with the power of working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, it is indeed the only evidence which can be given of such a communion. Hence among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of every religious system, except that which is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of nature, there have been numberless pretenders to the gift of prophecy. The Pagan nations of antiquity had their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a>, augurs, and soothsayers. Modern idolaters have their necromancers and diviners; and the Jews, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, and Mahometans, have their seers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPHETS\">prophets</a>.\n\nThe ill-founded pretensions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGANISM\">paganism</a>, ancient and modern, have been exposed under various articles of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. (See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">Divination</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECROMANCY\">Necromancy</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">Mythology</a>). And the claims of the Arabian impostor are examined under the articles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCORAN\">Alcoran</a> and Mahometanism; so that at present we have only to consider the use, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, of the Jewish and Christian prophecies.\n\nPrevious to our entering on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, it may be proper to observe, that in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, the signification of the word prophecy is not always confined to the foretelling of future events. In several instances it is of the same import with preaching, and denotes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of illustrating and applying to present practical purposes the doctrines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>. Thus in Nehemiah it is said, \"Thou hast appointed prophets to preach,\" and whoever speaketh unto men to edification, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHORTATION\">exhortation</a>, and comfort, is by St Paul called a prophet. Hence it was that there were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of prophets in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a>, where young men were instructed in the truths of religion, and fitted to exhort and comfort the people.\n\nIn this article, however, it is chiefly of importance to confine ourselves to that kind of prophecy which, in declaring truths either past, present, or future, required the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of God.\n\nEvery one who looks into the history of the world must observe, that the minds of men have from the beginning been gradually opened by a train of events still improving upon, and adding light to each other; as that of each individual is, by proceeding from the first elements and seeds of science, to more enlarged views, and a still higher growth. Mankind neither are nor ever have been capable of entering into the depths of knowledge at once; of receiving a whole system of natural or moral truths together; but must be let into them by degrees, and have them communicated by little and little, as they are able to bear it. That this is the case with respect to human science, is a fact which cannot be questioned; and there is as little room to question it with respect to the progress of religious knowledge among men, either taken collectively or in each individual. Why the case is thus in both, why all are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULT\">adult</a> at once in body and mind, is a question which the religion of nature is equally called upon with revelation to answer. The fact may not be easily accounted for, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of it is incontrovertible.\n\nAccordingly, the great object of the several revelations recorded in the Old Testament was evidently to keep alive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of religion in the minds of men, and to train them by degrees for the reception of those simple but sublime truths by which they were to be saved. The notions which the early descendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> entertained of the Supreme Being, and of the revelation in which they stood to him, were probably very gross; and we see them gradually refined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of revelations or prophecies, each in succession more explicit than that by which it was preceded, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVENT\">advent</a> of Him who was the way, the truth, and the life, and who brought to light life and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>.\n\nWhen a revelation was made of any important truth, the grounds of which the mind of man has not faculties to comprehend, that revelation, though undoubtedly a prophecy, must have been so far from confirming the truth of revealed religion in general, that it could not gain credit itself, but by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRINSIC\">extrinsic</a> evidence that it came indeed from God. Hence we find Moses, after it was revealed to him from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> bush that he should deliver his countrymen from Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a>, replying, \"Behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>; for they will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto thee.\" This revelation certainly constituted him a prophet to Israel; and there cannot be a doubt but that he perfectly knew the divine source from which he received it: but he very naturally and reasonably concluded, that the children of Israel would not believe that the Lord had appeared to him, unless he could give them some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this supernatural appearance than his own simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> of its reality. This proof he was immediately enabled to give, by having conferred upon him the power of working miracles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of his prophecy. Again, when Gideon was called to the deliverance of Israel, the angel of the Lord came and said unto him, \"The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour: go in this thy might, and thou shalt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have not I sent thee?\" Here was a prophecy delivered by the angel of the Lord to encourage Gideon's undertaking: but he, being probably afraid of some illusion of sense or imagination, demanded a sign that he was really an angel who talked with him. A sign is accordingly given him, a miraculous sign, with which he is satisfied, and undertakes the work appointed him.\n\nFrom these and many similar transactions recorded in the Old Testament, it appears that prophecy was never intended as evidence of an original revelation. It is no proof, indeed, by its very nature, totally unfit for such a purpose; because it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, without some extrinsic proof of its divine origin, to know whether any prophecy be true or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>, till the era arrive at which it ought to be fulfilled. When it is fulfilled, it affords complete evidence that he who uttered it spoke by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of God, and that the doctrines which he taught of a religious nature, were all either dictated by the same spirit, or at least are true, and calculated to direct mankind in the way of their duty.\n\nThe prophecies vouchsafed to the patriarchs in the it was almost early periods of the world, were all intended to tend to keep alive in their minds a sense of religion, and to direct their views to the future completion of that first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and greatest prophecy which was made to Adam immediately on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>: but in order to secure credit to those prophecies themselves, they were always accompanied by some miraculous sign that they were indeed given by the God of truth, and not the delusions of fanaticism or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOCRISY\">hypocrisy</a>. Prophecy, in the proper sense of the word, commenced with the fall; and the first instance of it is implied in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> denounced upon\nProphecy, the original deceiver of mankind; \"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: It shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUISE\">bruise</a> thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"\n\nThis prophecy, though one of the most important that ever was delivered, when considered by itself, is exceedingly obscure. That Adam should have underflood it, as some of his degenerate sons have pretended to do, in a literal sense, is absolutely impossible. He knew well that it was the great God of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> and earth who was speaking, and that such a Being was incapable of trifling with the wretchedness of his fallen creature. The sentence denounced upon himself and his wife was awful and severe. The woman was doomed to sorrow in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>; the man to sorrow and travail all the days of his life. The ground was cursed for his sake; and the end of the judgement was, \"Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return.\" Had our first parents been thus left, they must have looked upon themselves as rejected by their Maker, delivered up to trouble and sorrow in the world, and as having no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> in any other. With such impressions on their minds they could have retained no sense of religion; for religion, when unaccompanied by hope, is a state of frenzy and distraction: yet it is certain that they could have no hope from anything expressly recorded by Moses, except what they might draw from this sentence passed on their deceivers. Let us then endeavour to ascertain what consolation it could afford them.\n\nAt that awful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, they must have been sensible that their fall was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, whom by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> they had found to be an enemy to God and to man. It could not therefore but be some comfort to them to hear this enemy first condemned, and to see that, however he had prevailed against them, he had gained no victory over their Maker. By his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> they were secured from thinking that there was any malignant being equal to the Creator in power and dominion; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> which, through the prevalence of evil, gained ground in after times, and was destructive of all true religion. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of God's supreme dominion being thus preserved, it was still necessary to give them such hopes as might induce them to love as well as to fear him; and these they could not but conceive when they heard from the mouth of their Creator and Judge, that the serpent's victory was not complete even over themselves; that they and their posterity should be enabled to contest his empire; and that though they were to suffer much in the struggle, they should yet finally prevail, bruise the serpent's head, and deliver themselves from his power and dominion.\n\nThis prophecy therefore was to our first parents a light shining in a dark place. All that they could certainly conclude from it was, that their case was not desperate; that some remedy, some deliverance from the evil they were under, would in time appear; but when or where, or by what means they were to be delivered, they could not possibly understand, unless the matter was further revealed to them, as probably it was at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of sacrifice (See Sacrifice). Observe, however, as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> or prophecy was, it served after the fall as a foundation for religion, and trust and confidence towards God in hopes of deliverance in time from the evils of disobedience: and this appears to have been the sole purpose for which it was given, and not, as some well-meaning though weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for Christianity have imagined, as a prediction <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> directly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> of Christ.\n\nAs this prophecy was the first, so is it the only considerable one in which we have any concern from the creation to the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>. It was proportioned to the then wants and necessities of the world, and was the grand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of God's mercy after the fall. Nature had no certain help for sinners; her rights were lost with her innocence. It was therefore necessary either to destroy the offenders, or to raise them to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>, by giving them such hopes as might enable them to exercise a reasonable religion. So far the light of this prophecy extended. By what means God intended to work their salvation, he did not expressly declare; and who has a right to complain that he did not, or to prescribe to him rules in dispensing his mercy to the children of men?\n\nUpon the hopes of mercy which this prophecy gives, the curse in very general terms, mankind rested till the birth of removed Noah. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> a new prophecy was delivered from the earth by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMECH\">Lamech</a>, who foretells that his son should comfort them concerning the work and toil of their hands, \"because of the earth which the Lord had cursed.\" We are to remember that the curse pronounced upon the earth was part of the sentence passed upon our first parents; and when that part was remitted, if it ever was remitted, mankind would acquire new and more lively hopes that in God's good time they should be freed from the whole. But it has been shown by Bishop Sherlock, that this declaration of Lamech's was a prediction, that intent of during the life of his son the curse should be taken off from the earth: and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> has proved with great perspicuity, and in the most satisfactory manner, that this happy revolution actually took place after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>. The limits prescribed to an article of this kind will not permit us even to abridge his arguments. We shall only observe, that the truth of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> is manifest from the very words of scripture; for when God informs Noah of his design to destroy the world, he adds, \"But with thee will I establish my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a>:\" and as soon as the deluge was over, he declared that he \"would not again curse the ground any more for man's sake;\" but that while the earth should remain, seed-time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, should not cease.\" From this last declaration it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that a curse had been on the earth, and that seed-time and harvest had often failed; that the curse was now taken off; and that in consequence of this covenant, as it is called, with Noah and his seed and with every living creature, mankind should not henceforth be subjected to toil so severe and so generally fruitless.\n\nIt may seem surprising perhaps to some, that after so great a revolution in the world as the deluge made, God should say nothing to the remnant of mankind of the punishments and rewards of another life, but should make a new covenant with them relating merely to fruitful seasons and the bleatings of the earth. But in the scriptures we see plainly a gradual working of providence towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> of the world from the curse of the fall; that the temporal bleatings were first restored as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEDGE\">pledge</a> of better things to follow; and that the covenant given to Noah had, strictly speaking, nothing to do with the hopes of futurity,\nProphecy, which were referred to be the matter of another covenant, in another age, and to be revealed by him, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> it was to \"bring life and immortality to light through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>.\" But if Noah and his forefathers expected deliverance from the whole curse of the fall, the actual deliverance from one part of it was a very good pledge of a further deliverance to be expected in time. Man himself was cursed as well as the ground; he was doomed to dust: and fruitful seasons are but a small relief, compared to the greatness of his loss. But when fruitful seasons came, and one part of the curse was evidently abated, it gave great assurance that the other should not last for ever, but that by some means, still unknown to them, they should be freed from the whole, and finally bruise the serpent's head, who, at the deluge, had so severely bruised man's heel.\n\nUpon this assurance mankind rested for some generations, and practised, as we have every reason to believe, a rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> to the one God of the universe. At last, however, idolatry was by some means or other introduced (see Polytheism), and spread so universally through the world, that true religion would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> have entirely failed, had not God visibly interposed to preserve such a sense of it as was necessary for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of his great design to restore mankind. This he did by calling Abraham from amidst his idolatrous kindred, and renewing to him the word of prophecy: \"Get thee out of thy country (said he), and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> great; and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\" These magnificent promises were several times repeated to the father of the faithful with additional circumstances of great importance, such as, \"that he should be multiplied exceedingly; that he should be a father of many nations; that kings should come out of him;\" and above all, that God would establish an everlasting covenant with him and his seed, to give him and them all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession, and to be their God.\"\n\nUpon such of these promises as relate to temporal blessings we need not dwell. They are much of the same nature with those which had been given before to Lamech, Noah, Shem, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPHETH\">Japheth</a>; and all the world knows how amply and literally they have been fulfilled. There was however so little probability in nature of their accomplishment at the time when they were made, that we find the patriarch asking, \"Whereby he should know that he should inherit such an extent of country?\" And as he promises that he should inherit it were meant to be a foundation for religion and confidence in God, a miraculous sign was given him that they came indeed from the spirit of truth. This removed from his mind every doubt, and made him give the fullest credit, not only to them, but also to that other promise, \"that in his seed should all the nations of the earth be blessed.\"\n\nWhat distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> he had of this blessing, or in what manner he hoped it should be effected, we cannot pretend to say. \"But that he understood it to be a promise of restoring mankind, and delivering them from the remaining curse of the fall, there can be no doubt. He knew that death had entered by sin; he knew that God had promised victory and redemption to the seed of the woman. Upon the hopes of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> the religion of his ancestors was founded; and when God, from whom this blessing on all men was expected, did expressly promise a blessing on all men, and in this promise founded his everlasting covenant\u2014what could Abraham else expect but the completion in his seed of that ancient promise and prophecy concerning the victory to be obtained by the woman's seed? The curse of the ground was expiated in the flood, and the earth restored with a blessing, which was the foundation of the temporal covenant with Noah; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> share of which God expressly grants to Abraham and his posterity particularly, together with a promise to bring, by their means, a new and further blessing upon the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of men. If we lay these things to heart, we cannot suppose that less could be expected from the new promise or prophecy given to Abraham than a deliverance from that part of the curse still remaining on men: Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return.\" In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this covenant Abraham and his posterity had reason to expect that the time would come when man should be called from his dust again. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> they had his assurance who gave the covenant, that he would be their God for ever. Well might our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a> then tell the sons of Abraham, that even Moses at the bush showed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a> of the dead, when he called the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>.*\n\nThese promises made to Abraham were renewed to Isaac and Jacob; to the last of whom it was revealed not only that all the nations of the earth should be blessed in his seed, but that the blessing should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from his son Judah. It is, however, by no means evident that any one of those patriarchs knew precisely by what means (a) the curse of the fall was to be entirely removed, and all men called from their dust again. It was enough that they were convinced of the fact in general terms, since such conviction was a sufficient foundation of a rational religion; and the descendants of Abraham had no other foundation upon which to rest their\n\n---\n\n(A) This they certainly could not know from the promises expressed in the very general terms in which they are recorded in the book of Genesis. It is, however, not improbable that those promises, as they immediately received them, were conceived in terms more precise and particular; and, at all events, Dr Warburton has proved to the full conviction of every man who is not a determined unbeliever, that Abraham was commanded to sacrifice his son Isaac, not only as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of his obedience, but also that God might give him what he earnestly desired, a scintilla representation of the means by which mankind were to be redeemed from death. The learned writer thinks, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> compels us to think with him, that to this transaction our Saviour alludes when he says, \"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it and was glad.\"\ntheir hopes, and pay a cheerful worship to the God of their fathers, till the giving of the law to Moses. Then indeed they were incorporated into a society with municipal laws of their own, and placed under a theocratic government; the temporal promises made to their fathers were amply fulfilled; religion was maintained among them by rewards and punishments equally distributed in this world (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a>); and a series of prophets succeeding one another pointed out with greater and greater clearness, as the fulness of time approached, the person who was to redeem mankind from the power of death; by what means he was to work that great redemption, and at what precise period he was to make his appearance in the world. By these supernatural interpositions of divine providence, the principles of pure theism and the practice of true religion were preserved among the children of Israel, when all other nations were sunk in the grossest idolatry, and wallowed in the most abominable vices; when the far-famed Egyptians, Greeks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> to flocks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> and the vilest reptiles; and when they had no well-grounded hope of another life, and were in fact without God in the world.\n\nFrom this short deduction, we think ourselves intitled to conclude, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> use and intent of prophecy, under the various dispensations of the Old Testament, was not, as is too often supposed, to establish the divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISSION\">mission</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, but to keep alive in the minds of those to whom it was given, a sense of religion, and a hope of future deliverance from the curse of the fall. It was, in the expressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, \"a light that shone in a dark place, unto which men did well to take heed until the day dawned and the day-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> arose in their hearts.\" But though this was certainly the original intent of prophecy (for Christ, had he never been foretold, would have proved himself to be the Son of God with power by his astonishing miracles, and his resurrection from the dead), yet it cannot be denied, that a long series of prophecies, given in different and far distant ages, and having all their completion in the life, death, and resurrection, of Jesus, concur very forcibly with the evidence of miracles to prove that he was the seed of the woman ordained to bruise the head of the serpent, and restore man to his forfeited inheritance. To the Jews the force of this evidence must have been equal, if not superior, to that of miracles themselves; and therefore we find the Apostles and first preachers of the gospel, in their addresses to them, constantly appealing to the law and the prophets, whilst they urged upon the Gentiles the evidence of miracles.\n\nIn order to form a right judgement of the argument for the truth of Christianity drawn from the sure word of prophecy, we must not consider the prophecies given in the Old Testament as so many predictions only independent of each other; for if we do, we shall totally lose sight of the purpose for which they were originally given, and shall never be able to satisfy ourselves when confronted by the objections of unbelievers. It is easy for men of leisure and tolerable parts to find difficulties in particular predictions, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of them made by writers, who lived many hundred years ago, and who had many ancient books and records of the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, from which they drew many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, and perhaps some prophecies; which books and records we have not to enable us to understand, and to justify prophecy, their applications. But it is not so easy a matter to show, or to persuade the world to believe, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of prophecies reaching through several thousand years, delivered at different times, yet manifestly subservient to one and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of providence from beginning to end, is the effect of art and contrivance and religious fraud. In examining the several prophecies recorded in the Old Testament, we are not to suppose that each of them expressly pointed out and clearly characterized Jesus Christ. Had they done so, instead of being a support to religion in general, the purpose for which they were originally intended, they would have had a very different effect, by making those to whom they were given repine at being placed under dispensations so very inferior to that of the gospel. We are therefore to inquire only whether all the notices, which, in general and often metaphorical terms, God gave to the fathers of his intended salvation, are perfectly answered by the coming of Christ; and we shall find that nothing has been promised with respect to that subject which has not been performed in the amplest manner. If we examine the prophecies in this manner, we shall find that there is not one of them, which the Apostles have applied to the Messiah, that is not applicable in a rational and important sense to something in the birth, life, preaching, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAZARETH\">Nazareth</a>; that as applied to him they are all consistent with each other; and that though some few of them may be applied without absurdity to persons and events under the Jewish dispensation, Christ is the only person that ever existed in whom they all meet as in a centre. In the limits prescribed us, it is impossible that we should enter upon a particular proof of this position. It has been proved by numberless writers, and, with respect to the most important prophecies, by none with greater success than Bishop Sherlock in his Use and Intent of Prophecy in the several ages of the World; a work which we recommend to our readers as one of the most valuable on the subject in our own or any other language.\n\nBut admitting that it would have been improper, for objection the reasons already hinted at, to have given a clear and from the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Christ, and the Christian dispensation, to men who were ordained to live under dispensations less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>, how, it may be asked, comes it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> that many of the prophecies applied by the writers of the gospel to our Saviour and his actions are still dark and obscure, and so far from belonging evidently to him and to him only, that it requires much learning and sagacity to show even now the connection between some prophecies and the events?\n\nIn answer to these questions, the learned prelate just answered, referred to observes, \"That the obscurity of prophecy does not arise from hence, that it is a relation or description of something future; for it is as easy to speak of things future plainly, and intelligibly, as it is of things past or present. It is not, therefore, of the nature of prophecy to be obscure; for it may easily be made, when he who gives it thinks fit, as plain as history. On the other side, a figurative and dark description of a future event will be figurative and dark till when the event happens; and consequently will have all the obscurity of a figurative and dark description as well after as before the event. The prophet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAIAH\">Isaiah</a> describes the peace\nProphecy, peace of Christ's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in the following manner: \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WOLF\">wolf</a> shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> down with the kid, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a> and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them.\" Nobody, some modern Jews excepted, ever understood this literally; nor can it now be literally applied to the state of the gospel. It was and is capable of different interpretations: it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> temporal peace, or that internal and spiritual peace\u2014that tranquility of mind, which sets a man at peace with God, himself, and the world. But whatever the true meaning is, this prophecy does no more obtrude one determinate sense upon the mind since the coming of Christ than it did before. But then we say, the state of the gospel was very properly prefigured in this description, and is as properly prefigured in a hundred more of the like kind; and since they all agree in a fair application to the state of the gospel, we strongly conclude, that this state was the thing foretold under such expressions. So that the argument from prophecy for the truth of Christianity does not rest on this, that the event has necessarily limited and ascertained the particular sense and meaning of every prophecy; but in this, that every prophecy has in a proper sense been completed by the coming of Christ. It is absurd, therefore, to expect clear and evident conviction from every single prophecy applied to Christ; the evidence must arise from a view and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of all together.\" It is doubless a great mistake to suppose that prophecy was intended solely or chiefly for their sakes in whole time the events predicted are to happen. What great occasion is there to lay in so long beforehand the evidence of prophecy to convince men of things that are to happen in their own times; the truth of which they may, if they please, learn from their own senses? Yet some people are apt to talk as if they thought the truth of the events predicted depended very much on the evidence of prophecy: they speak, for instance, as if they imagined the certainty and reality of our Saviour's resurrection were much concerned in the clearness of the prophecies relating to that great and wonderful event, and seem to think that they are confusing the truth of his resurrection when they are pointing out the absurdity of the prophecies relating to it. But can anything be more absurd? For what ground or pretence is there to inquire whether the prophecies foretelling that the Messiah should die and rise again do truly belong to Christ, unless we are first satisfied that Christ died and rose again?\n\nThe part which unbelievers ought to take in this question, if they would make any use of prophecy, should be, to show from the prophets that Christ was necessarily to rise from the dead; and then to prove that in fact Jesus never did rise. Here would be a plain consequence. But if they like not this method, they ought to let the prophecies alone; for if Christ did not rise, there is no harm done though the prophets have not foretold it. And if they allow the resurrection of Christ, what do they gain by discrediting the prophets? The event will be what it is, let the prophecies be what they will.\n\nThese considerations show how far the gospel is necessarily concerned in prophetical evidence, and how clear the prophecies should be. Christ claims to be the person foretold in the law and the prophets; and as truth must ever be consistent with itself, this claim must be true as well as all others. This is the part then to be tried on the evidence of prophecy: Is Christ that person described and foretold under the Old Testament or not? Whether all the prophecies relating to him be plain or not plain, it matters little; the single question is, Are there enough plain to show us that Christ is the person foretold under the Old Testament? If there be, we are at an end of our inquiry, and want no farther help from prophecy; especially since we have seen the day dawn and enjoyed the marvellous light of the gospel of God.\n\nBut so unreasonable are unbelievers, that whilst some objections of them object to the obscurity of the prophecies, from others have rejected them altogether on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their clearness, pretending that they are histories and not prophecies. The prophecies against which this objection has been chiefly urged are those of Daniel, which were first called in question by the famous Porphyry. He affirmed that they were not composed by Daniel, whose name they bear, but by some author who lived in Judea about the time of Antiochus Epiphanes; because all to that time contained true history, but that all the facts beyond that were manifestly false.\n\nThis method of opposing the prophecies, as a father answered, of the church rightly observes, is the strongest testimony of their truth: for they are so exactly fulfilled, that to infidels the prophet seemed not to have foretold things future, but to have related things past. To an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> of this age, if he has the same ability and knowledge of history that Porphyry had, all the subsequent prophecies of Daniel, except those which are still fulfilling, would appear to be history and not prophecy; from what for it entirely overthrows the notion of their being written in the days of Antiochus Epiphanes, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACCABEES\">Maccabees</a>, and establishes the credit of Daniel as a prophet beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, that there are several of those prophecies which have been fulfilled since that period as well as before; nay, that there are prophecies of Daniel which are fulfilling at this very time in the world.\n\nOur limits will not permit us to enter into the objections which have been made to this prophet by the author of The Literal Scheme of Prophecy considered; nor is there occasion that we should enter into them. They have been all examined and completely answered by Bishop Chandler in his Vindication of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of Christianity, by Mr Samuel Chandler in his Vindication of the Antiquity and Authority of Daniel's Prophecies, and by Bishop Newton in his excellent Dissertations on the Prophecies. To these authors we refer the reader; and shall conclude the present article with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> view of some prophecies given in very remote ages, which are in this age receiving their accomplishment.\n\nOf these the first is that of Noah concerning the ferocity of the posterity of Canaan. In the greater part of original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>, and in our version of the holy scriptures, this prophecy is thus expressed: \"Cursed be Canaan; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of servants shall he be unto his brethren:\" but in the Arabic version, and in some copies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTUAGINT\">Septuagint</a>, it is, \"Cursed be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a> the father of Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.\" Whether the curse was really pronounced upon Ham, which we think most probable, or only upon his son Canaan, we shall find the prediction remarkably\nProphecy, ably fulfilled, not barely ages after the book of Genesis was very generally known, but also at this very day. It is needless to inform any man who has but looked into the Old Testament, that when the ancient patriarchs pronounced either a curse or a blessing upon any of their sons, they meant to declare the future fortunes, not of that son individually, but of his descendants as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> or a nation. Let us keep this in mind, and proceed to compare with Noah's prophecy first the fortunes of the descendants of Canaan, the fourth son of Ham, and then the fortunes of the posterity of Ham by his other sons.\n\nWith the fate of the Canaanites every reader is acquainted. They were conquered by Joshua several centuries after the delivery of this prophecy; and such of them as were not exterminated were by him and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> reduced to a state of the lowest servitude to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a>, the posterity of Shem the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Ham. The Greeks and Romans, too, who were the descendants of Japheth, not only subdued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, but also purified and conquered such of the Canaanites as were anywhere remaining, as for instance the Tyrians and Carthaginians, of whom the former were ruined by Alexander and the Grecians, and the latter by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIPIO\">Scipio</a> and the Romans. Nor did the effects of the curse stop there. The miserable remainder of that devoted people have been ever since slaves to a foreign yoke; first to the Saracens who are descended from Shem, and afterwards to the Turks who are descended from Japheth; and under the Turkish dominion they groan at this day.\n\nIf we take the prophecy as it stands in the Arabic version, its accomplishment is still more remarkable. The whole continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> was peopled principally by the posterity of Ham. And for how many ages have the better parts of that country lain under the dominion first of the Romans, then of the Saracens, and now of the Turks? In what wickedness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, barbarity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, and misery, live most of its inhabitants? and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> how many thousands are every year sold and bought like beasts in the market, and conveyed from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the world to do the work of beasts in another; to the full accomplishment indeed of the prophecy, but to the lasting disgrace of those who are from the love of gain the instruments of fulfilling it. Nothing can be more complete than the execution of the sentence as well upon Ham as upon Canaan; and the hardiest infidel will not dare to say that it was pronounced after the event.\n\nThe next prophecy which we shall notice is that of Abraham concerning the multitude of his descendants; which every one knows is still fulfilled in the Jews even in their dispersed state, and therefore cannot have been given after the event of which it speaks.\n\nOf the same kind are the several prophecies concerning Ishmael; of which some have been fulfilled, and others are at present fulfilling in the most astonishing manner. Of this son of Abraham it was foretold, that \"he should be a wild man; that his hand should be against every man, and every man's hand against him; that he should dwell in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of all his brethren; that he should be multiplied exceedingly, beget twelve princes, and become a great nation.\" The sacred historian who records these prophecies adds, that \"God was with the lad, and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.\"\n\nTo show how fully and literally all these prophecies have been accomplished, would require more room than we have to below; and to the reader of history the labour would be superfluous. We shall therefore only request the unbeliever to attend to the history of the Arabs, the undoubted descendants of Ishmael; and to say how it comes to pass, that though they have been robbers by land and pirates by sea for time immemorial, though their hands have been against every man, and every man's hand against them, they always have dwelt, and at this day dwell, in the presence of their brethren, a free and independent people. It cannot be pretended that no attempt has ever been made to conquer them; for the greatest conquerors in the world have all in their turns attempted it; but though some of them made great progress, not one was ever crowned with success. It cannot be pretended that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> nature of their country has been their protection; for their country has been often penetrated, though it never was entirely subdued. When in all human probability they have been on the brink of ruin, they were signalized and providentially delivered. Alexander was preparing an expedition against them, when he was cut off in the flower of his age. Pompey was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of his conquests when urgent affairs called him elsewhere. Aelius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLUS\">Gallus</a> had penetrated far into their country, when a fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> destroyed great numbers of his men, and obliged him to return. Trajan besieged their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> city, but was defeated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> and whirlwinds. Severus besieged the same city twice, and was twice repelled from before it. The Turks, though they were able to wrest from them their foreign conquests, have been so little able to subdue the Arabs themselves, or even to restrain their depredations, that they are obliged to pay them a sort of annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> for the safe passage of the pilgrims who go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> to pay their devotions. On these facts we shall not exclaim. He who is not struck upon comparing the simple history of this singular people with the prophecies so long ago delivered of them and their great ancestor, whose love of liberty is compared to that of the wild ass, would rise wholly unmoved from our exclamations.\n\nA fourth prophecy of this kind, which cannot be alleged to have been uttered after the event, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENUNCIATION\">denunciation</a> of Moses against the children of Israel in case of the Jews' disobedience; which is so literally fulfilled, that plainly even at this moment it appears rather a history of the present state of the Jews, than a remote prediction of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. \"And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other. And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest; but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind. And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life,\" (Deut. xxviii. 64, 65, 66.). \"And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a bye-word, among all nations, whither the Lord shall lead you,\" (Deut. xxviii. 37.).\n\nSimilar to this denunciation, but attended with some circumstances still more wonderful, is the following prediction of the prophet Hosea: \"The children of Israel shall abide many days without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, and without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and without a sacrifice, and without an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a>, and\nProphecy, and without an ephod, and without teraphim. Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days (n).\u201d In this passage we find the state of the Jews for the last 1700 years clearly and distinctly described with all its circumstances. From the time that they rejected their Messiah all things began to work towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of their politics both civil and religious; and within a few years from his death, their city, temple, and government, were utterly ruined; and they themselves not carried into a gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, to enjoy their laws, and live under governors of their own, as they did in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, but they were sold like beasts in a market, and became slaves in the strictest sense; and from that day to this have had neither prince nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> among them. Nor will any one of them ever be able, after all their pretences, to prove his descent from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>, or to say with certainty whether he is of the tribe of Judah or of the tribe of Levi, till he shall discover that unknown country where never mankind dwelt, and where the apocryphal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESDRAS\">Esdras</a> has placed their brethren of the ten tribes. This being the case, it is impossible they can have either an altar, or a sacrifice, or a priesthood, according to the institution of Moses, but are evidently an outcast people living under laws which cannot be fulfilled.\n\nThe cause of this deplorable condition is likewise assigned with the same perspicuity: They are scattered over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the earth, because they do not acknowledge Christ for the Messiah; because they do not submit to their own king, the true David. In the prophetic writings the name of David is frequently given to the Messiah, who was to descend from that prince. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a>, speaking of the kingdom of Christ, says, \u201cI will set up one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.\u201d And Jeremiah says, \u201cThey shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.\u201d\n\nThat in these places, as well as in the passage under consideration, the Messiah is meant, is undeniable; for David the son of Jesse was dead long before any of the three prophets was born; and by none of them it is said, \u201cafterwards David their king shall come again;\u201d but \u201cafterwards the children of Israel shall return to David their king,\u201d they shall recover from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> infatuation, and seek him whom they have not yet known. By their not receiving Jesus for their Christ, they have forfeited all claim to the divine favour, and are, of consequence, \u201cwithout a king, and without a chief, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a priesthood.\u201d\n\nThe time, however, will come, when they shall return and seek \u201cthe Lord their God and David their king;\u201d when they shall tremble before him whom their fathers crucified, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> the Son even as they honour the Father. That this part of the prophecy will in time be as completely fulfilled as the other has been, may be confidently expected from the wonderful preservation of the Jews for so many ages. Scattered as they are over the whole earth, and hated as they are by all nations, it might naturally be thought, that in process of time they would have coalesced with their conquerors, and have been ultimately absorbed and annihilated by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>, so that no trace of them should now have remained; yet the fact is, that, dispersed as they have ever since been over the whole face of the globe, they have never, in a single instance, in any country, lost their religious or natural distinctions; and they are now generally supposed to be as numerous as they were under the reigns of David and Solomon. This is contrary to all history, and all experience of the course of human affairs in similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; it has been boldly and justly styled a standing miracle. Within 1000 or 1200 years back, a great variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> and important revolutions have taken place among the nations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. In the southern part of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> the Britons were conquered by the Saxons, the Saxons by the Danes, and the Danes and Saxons by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORMANS\">Normans</a>; but in a few centuries these opposite and hostile nations were consolidated into one indistinguishable mass. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, about the same time that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> was subdued by the Saxons, was conquered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a> and Vandals; and it is not easy to conceive a more striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> than that which subsisted between the polished inhabitants of that delightful country and their savage invaders; and yet how soon did all distinction cease between them! In France, the Roman colonies gradually assimilated with the ancient Gauls; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, though the Moors continued for several ages, and till their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> expulsion, a distinct people, yet after they were once reduced to a state of subjection, their numbers very sensibly diminished; and such of them as were suffered to remain after their last overthrow have been long since blended with the Spaniards that they cannot now be distinguished. But with regard to the Jews, the wonder is, that though they do not in any country where they are settled bear any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the natural inhabitants, though they are universally reduced to a state of the lowest subjection, and even exposed to hatred, contempt, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>; yet in no instance does there seem to be the least appearance or probability of their numbers being diminished, in no instance do they discover any decay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their religious principles. Whence then comes it that this people alone, who, having no form of government or a republic anywhere subsisting, are without the means by which other people are kept united and distinct, should still be preserved amongst so many different nations? How comes it, when they have been thus scattered into so many distant corners, like dust which cannot be perceived, that they should still so long survive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of their own state, as well as that of so many others? To these questions the answer is obvious: They are\n\n(b) Such is our translation of this remarkable prophecy; but the Greek version of the Seventy has it, perhaps more properly, thus: \u201cThe children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a chief, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a priesthood, and without a prophecies. Afterwards,\u201d &c.\nare preserved, that, as a nation, \"they may return and seek the Lord their God and David their king, and fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.\"\n\nWe might here subjoin many prophecies both from the Old and the New Testament, and especially from the writings of St Paul and St John, which so clearly describe the various fortunes of the Christian church, her progress to that state of general corruption under which she was sunk three centuries ago, and her gradual restoration to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> purity, that they cannot be supposed to proceed from the cunning craftiness of men, or to have been written after the events of which they speak. To do justice to these, however, would require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, and many excellent volumes have been written upon them. The reader who wishes for satisfaction on so interesting a subject will do well to consult the writings of Mr Mede and Sir Isaac Newton, together with Bishop Newton's Dissertations, and the Sermons of Hurd, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, and Bagot, preached at Warburton's lecture. We shall only observe, that one of the ablest reasoners that Great Britain ever produced, after having paid the closest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the predictions of the New Testament, hath been bold enough to put the truth of revealed religion itself upon the reality of that prophetic spirit which foretold the desolation of Christ's church and kingdom by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTICHRIST\">antichrist</a>. \"If (says he), in the days of St Paul and St John, there was any footstep of such a fort of power as this in the world; or if there had been any such power in the world; or if there was then any appearance or probability that could make it enter into the heart of man to imagine that there ever could be any such kind of power in the world, much less in the temple or church of God; and if there be not now such a power actually and conspicuously exercised in the world; and if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of this power, drawn after the event, can now describe it more plainly and exactly than it was originally described in the words of the prophecy\u2014then may it, with some degree of plausibility, be suggested, that the prophecies are nothing more than enthusiastic imaginations.\"\n\nUpon the whole, we conclude with Bishop Sherlock, that the various prophecies recorded in the Holy Scriptures were given, not to enable man to foresee with clearness future events, but to support the several dispensations of religion under which they were respectively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> prophecies recorded in the Old Testament led mankind to hope for a complete deliverance from the curse of the fall; and therefore tended to fill their minds with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and to enforce a cheerful obedience to that God who in the midst of judgement remembereth mercy. The prophecies, whether in the Old or New Testament, that portray the present state of the Jews, and the various fortunes of the Christian church, as they are daily fulfilling in the presence of all men, are the strongest possible proof of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> of our holy religion, and supply to us in the latter days the place of miracles, by which it was at first established.","sp":66,"ep":78},{"h":"PROPHET","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who foretells <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> events; but is particularly applied to such inspired persons among the Jews as were commissioned by God to declare his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and purposes to that people.

The central point is formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> crossing each other at right angles, which are cut on a piece of glass. The limb is divided into degrees and half degrees, having an index with a vernier graduated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> to a single minute, and is furnished with a tooth and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a>, by means of which the index is moved round by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>. It has two pointers, one at each end of the index, furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> for keeping them suspended while they are bringing to any angle; and being\nAnother circular protractor, different from either of the former, is represented at fig. 4. The centre is also formed by the intersection of two lines at right angles to each other, which are cut on glass, that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLAX\">parallax</a> may thereby be avoided. The index is moved round by a tooth and pinion. The limb is divided into degrees and half degrees, and subdivided to every minute by the vernier. The pointer may be set at any convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the centre, as the socket which carries it moves upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> BC, and is fixed thereto by the nut D, at right angles to the bar BC, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> with it. There is another bar EF: On this bar different scales of equal parts are placed; so that by moving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> against the inner edge thereof, angles may be transferred to any distance within the limits, from the centre containing the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of degrees marked out by the index.\n\nIt would indeed be superfluous to describe any more of these circular protractors, especially as the little alterations in them depend very much upon the fancy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>. Suffice it however to say, that we have seen others still differently constructed, one of which we shall briefly describe. The divisions upon the limb of this instrument are similar to those already described; but the index is a straight bar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to some considerable distance each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> beyond the limb of the instrument, and has a vernier to show minutes as usual; a mark upon one of the edges of the index always coincides with the centre of the instrument. Instead, therefore, of pricking down the angle as in the former, part of the line containing the angle may be drawn, which, although perhaps not so accurate as a point, is more conspicuous, and the line is easily completed upon removal of the protractor. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> dimensions of the circular part of these instruments is from six to ten inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>; and they are made of brass.","sp":82,"ep":85},{"h":"PROTUBERANCE","t":"in Anatomy, is any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> supernatural, that projects or advances out beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>.","sp":85,"ep":85},{"h":"PROVEDITOR","t":"an officer in several parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, particularly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, who has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of matters relating to policy.","sp":85,"ep":85},{"h":"PROVENCE","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of France bounded by Dauphine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIEDMONT\">Piedmont</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> on the south, and by the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a>, which separates it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>, on the west: it is about 100 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and near as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>.","sp":85,"ep":85},{"h":"PROVEND","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Provender, originally signified a kind of veal containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of corn daily given to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> of labour, for his subsistence; but is now generally used to signify the food for cattle; whatever it is.","sp":85,"ep":85},{"h":"PROVERB","t":"according to Camden, is a concise, witty, and wise speech, grounded upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> containing some useful instruction.\n\nBook of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVERBS\">PROVERBS</a>, a canonical book of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, containing a part of the proverbs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a>.

Therefore, in order to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> management of fruit-trees, provision should always be made to have a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> wood in every part of the trees; and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> there should not be a superfluity of useless branches, which would exhaust the strength of the trees, and cause them to decay in a few years.\n\nThe reasons for pruning of fruit-trees, are, 1. To preserve them longer in a vigorous bearing-state; 2. To render them more beautiful; and, 3. To cause the fruit to be larger and better tasted.\n\nThe general instructions for pruning are as follow. The greatest care ought to be taken of fruit-trees in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, when they are in vigorous growth; which is the only proper season for procuring a quantity of good wood in the different parts of the tree, and for disposing all useless branches as soon as they are produced, in order that the vigour of the tree may be entirely distributed to such branches only as are designed to remain. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> trees ought not to be neglected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> and May, when their shoots are produced; however, those branches which are intended for bearing the succeeding year should not be shortened during the time of their growth, because this would cause them to produce two lateral shoots, from the eyes below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where they were stopped, which would draw much of the strength from the buds of the first shoot: and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the two lateral shoots are not entirely cut away at the winter-pruning, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> prove injurious to the tree. This is to be chiefly understood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>-fruit and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>; but pears and apples, being much harder, suffer not so much, though it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> disadvantage to those also to be thus managed. It must likewise be remarked, that peaches, nectarines, apricots, cherries, and plums, are always in the greatest vigour when they are least maimed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>; for where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> branches are taken off, they are subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> and decay. It is therefore the most prudent method to rub off all useless buds when they are first produced, and to pinch others, where new shoots are wanted to supply the vacancies of the wall; by which management they may be so ordered as to want but little of the knife in winter-pruning. The management of pears and apples is much the same with these trees in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>; but in winter they must be very differently pruned: for as peaches and nectarines, for the most part, produce their fruit upon the former year's pruning wood, and must therefore have their branches shortened according to their strength, in order to produce new shoots for the succeeding year; so, on the contrary, pears, apples, plums, and cherries, producing their fruit upon spurs, which come out of the wood of five, six, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years old, should not be shortened, because thereby those buds which were naturally disposed to form these spurs, would produce wood-branches; by which means the trees would be filled with wood, but would never produce much fruit. The branches of standard-trees should never be shortened unless where they are very luxuriant, and, by growing irregularly on one side of the trees, attract the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a>, by which means the other parts are either unfurnished with branches, or are rendered very weak; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the branch should be shortened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as low as is necessary, in order to obtain more branches to fill up the hollow of the tree; but this is only to be understood of pears and apples, which will produce shoots from wood of three, four, or more years old; whereas most sorts of stone-fruit will gum and decay after such amputations: whenever this happens to stone-fruit, it should be remedied by stopping or pinching those shoots in the spring, before they have obtained too much vigour, which will cause them to push out side-branches; but this must be done with caution. You must also cut out all dead or decaying branches, which cause their heads to look ragged, and also attract noxious particles from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>: in doing this, you should cut them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> down to the place where they were produced, otherwise that part of the branch which is left will also decay, and prove equally hurtful to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the tree; for it seldom happens, when a branch begins to decay, that it does not die quite down to the place where it was produced, and if permitted to remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> uncut, often infects some of the other parts of the tree. If the branches cut off are large, it will be very proper, after having smoothed the cut part exactly even with a knife, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHISEL\">chisel</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a>, to put on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAFTING\">grafting</a> clay, which will prevent the wet from soaking into the tree at the wounded part. All such branches as run across each other, and occasion a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the tree, should be cut off; and as there are frequently young vigorous shoots on old trees, which rise from the old branches near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, and grow upright into the head, these should be carefully cut out every year, lest, by being permitted to grow, they fill the tree too full of wood.\n\nAs to the pruning of forest-trees, if they be large, it is best not to prune them at all; yet, if there be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, avoid taking off large boughs as much as possible. And, 1. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOUGH\">bough</a> be small, cut it smooth, close and sloping. 2. If the branch be large, and the tree old, cut it off at three or four feet from the stem. 3. If the tree grow crooked, cut it off at the crook, sloping upward, and nurce up one of the most promising shoots for a new stem. 4. If the tree grow top-heavy, its head must be lightened, and that by thinning the boughs that grow out of the main branches. But if you would have them spring, rub off the buds, and thrust up the side-shoots. 5. If the side-bough still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out, and the top be able to sustain itself, give the boughs that put forth in spring a pruning after Midsummer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them close.\nIt has been observed, that trees are subject to gum and decay, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of pruning; to prevent these injurious effects, a remedy has been proposed by Mr Bucknall, which on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, it is said, has been successful. By this method the branches to be removed are to be cut close to the place of separation from the trunk, smoothed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> with a knife, and the wound is to be smeared over with medicated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAR\">tar</a>, laid on with a painter's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>. The following is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this medicated tar. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an ounce of corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBLIMATE\">sublimate</a> reduced to fine powder, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> it with a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a>, is introduced into a three pint earthen pipkin, with about a glaifful of gin or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> is to be well stirred till the sublimate is dissolved. The pipkin is then gradually filled with vegetable or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> tar, and constantly stirred, till the mixture be blended together as intimately as possible; and this quantity will at any time be sufficient for 200 trees. To prevent danger, let the corrosive sublimate be mixed with the tar as quickly as possible after it is purchased; for being of a very poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to all animals, it should not be suffered to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, for fear of mischief to some part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>.\n\nBy applying this composition, Mr Bucknall can, without the least danger, use the pruning hook on all sorts of trees, much more freely than by the use of any article hitherto recommended. The following remarks by the author on pruning in general, seem worthy of notice, and we give them in his own words. \"I give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> (says he) to fruit branches, and wood branches; but beg, once for all, that no branch shall ever be shortened, unless for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the tree, and then constantly taken off close to the separation, by which means the wound soon heals. The more the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of the branches shoots circularly, a little inclining upwards, the more equally will the sap be distributed, and the better will the tree bear; for, from that circumstance, the sap is more evenly impelled to every part. Do not let the ranges of branches be too near each other; for, remember all the fruit and the leaves should have their full share of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; and where it suits, let the middle of the tree be free from wood, so that no branch shall ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> another, but all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> ends point upwards.\"","sp":94,"ep":95},{"h":"PRUNUS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the icosandra <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> ranking under the 36th order, Pomacea.

The district properly called Prussia is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> extent, and divided into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCAL\">Ducal</a> and Regal Prussia, the latter belonging to the republic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> till the late partition of the Polish territories.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> is by some thought to be derived from the Borufl, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of the Sarmatians, who, by migrating from the foot of the Riphaean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, were tempted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and fertility of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there. Others think that the name of this country is properly Poruffia; Po in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the natives signifying near, and Poruffia signifying near Raffia. To the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> we find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Prussia himself attesting in the treatise intitled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of Brandenburg. However, it must be owned, that these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any other etymologies of the word are very uncertain, and we find nothing like it mentioned by historians before the tenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> state of Prussia is almost entirely unknown. However, the people are said to have been very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and barbarous; living upon raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, and drinking the blood of horses at their feasts, according to Stella, even to intoxication (a). Nay, to extremely savage were these people, that they were even unacquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of constructing huts, and took up their dwelling in caves and cavities of rocks and trees, where they protected themselves and children from the inclemencies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>. Among such a people it is vain to expect that any transactions would be recorded, or indeed that anything worthy of being recorded would be transacted. We shall therefore begin our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Prussia with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEUTONIC\">Teutonic</a> knights first got footing in the country. (See TEUTONIC Knights).\n\nOn the expulsion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> from the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALADIN\">Saladin</a>, a settlement was given to the Teutonic knights in Prussia by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONRAD\">Conrad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Mazovia, the competitor of Boleslaus V. for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Poland.

Possibly, however, the vital fluid may have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of this kind, though unknown in our days where such barbarous customs are diffused. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">Drunkenness</a> from drinking blood is frequently mentioned in Scripture, but whether literally or metaphorically must be decided by the learned.\ngreatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the country which now goes by the name of Prussia; and, not content with this, became very troublesome to Poland, in such a manner that the monarchs of that kingdom were sometimes obliged to carry on dangerous and bloody wars with them; for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of which we refer to the article POLAND, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a>. 61, 67, &c.\n\nThe Teutonic order <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in Prussia till the year 1531. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> was Albert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of Brandenburg, and nephew to Sigismund I, king of Poland. He was preferred to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> in hopes that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to Sigismund might procure a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a> of some of the places which had been taken from the order during the former unsuccessful wars with Poland; but in this the fraternity were disappointed. Albert, however, was so far from endeavouring to obtain any favour from his uncle by fair means, that he refused to do homage to him, and immediately began to make preparations for throwing off his dependence altogether, and recovering the whole of Prussia and Pomerania by force of arms. In this he was so far from succeeding, that, being foiled in every attempt, he was forced to resign the dignity of grand-master; in recompense for which, his uncle bestowed on him that part of Prussia now called Ducal, in quality of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> duke. It was now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the house of Brandenburg to assist in the expulsion of the fraternity; and accordingly, being at last driven out of Prussia and Pomerania, they transferred their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> to Mariendal in Franconia; but in that and other provinces of the empire where they settled, little more than the name of the order, once so famous, now remains.\n\nThe other most considerable part of his Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>'s dominions is the electorate of Brandenburg. Like other parts of Germany, it was anciently possessed by barbarians, of whom no history can be given. These were subdued by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>, as is related under the article FRANCE; but being on every occasion ready to revolt, in 927 Henry the Fowler established margraves, or governors of the frontiers, to keep the barbarians in awe. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MARGRAVE\">margrave</a> of Brandenburg was Siegfried, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>-in-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to the above-mentioned emperor; under whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> the bishoprics of Brandenburg and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAVELBERG\">Havelberg</a> were established by Otho I. From this Siegfried, to the succession of the house of Hohenzollern, from whom the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> is descended, there are reckoned eight different families, who have been margraves of Brandenburg; namely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Saxons, of Walbeck, Staden, Plenck, Anhalt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, Luxemburg, and Misnia. The margraves of the four first races had continual wars with the Vandals and other barbarous people; nor could their ravages be stopped till the reign of Albert furred the Bear, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of the house of Anhalt. He was made margrave by the emperor Conrad III. and afterwards raised to the dignity of elector by Frederic Barbarossa, about the year 1100. Some years afterwards the king of the Vandals dying without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, left the Middle Marche by his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> to the elector, who was besides possessed of the Old Marche, Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, the country of Anhalt, and part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUSATIA\">Lusatia</a>. In 1332 this line became extinct, and the electorate devolved to the empire. It was then given by the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> of Bavaria to his son Louis, who was the first of the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. Louis the Roman succeeded his brother; and as he also died without children, he was succeeded by Otho, his third brother, who sold the electorate to the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> IV. of the house of Luxemburg, for 200,000 florins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. Charles IV. gave the Marche to his son Wenceslaus, to whom Sigismund succeeded. This elector, being embarrassed in his circumstances, sold the New Marche to the knights of the Teutonic order. John succeeded Sigismund; but aspiring to the empire, sold the electorate to William duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEISSEN\">Meissen</a>; who, after he had possessed it for one year, sold it again to the emperor Sigismund. In 1417, Frederic VI. burgrave of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a>, received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> of the country of Brandenburg at the diet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCE\">Constance</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the emperor Sigismund; who, two years before, had conferred upon him the dignity of elector, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>-chamberlain of the Holy Roman empire.\n\nThis prince, the first of the family of Hohenzollern, found himself possessed of the Old and Middle Marche, but the dukes of Pomerania had usurped the Marche <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UKRAINE\">Ukraine</a>. Against them, therefore, the elector immediately declared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, and soon recovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. As the New Marche still continued in the hands of the Teutonic knights, to whom it had been sold as we have already mentioned, the elector, to make up for this, took possession of Saxony, which at that time happened to be vacant by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Albert the last elector of the Anhalt line. But the emperor, not approving of this step, gave the investiture of Saxony to the duke of Meissen; upon which Frederic voluntarily desisted from his acquisitions. This elector made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of his possessions by will. His eldest son was deprived of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> on account of his having too closely applied himself to search for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER_S_STONE\"><a class=\"xref\" hre</a>f=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; so he left him only Voigtsland. The electorate was given to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> son Frederic; Albert, furred Achille, had the duchies of Franconia; and Frederic, furred the Fat, had the Old Marche; but by his death it returned to the electorate of Brandenburg.\n\nFrederic I. was succeeded by his son, called also Frederic, and furred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a>-tooth on account of his strength. He might with as great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> have been furred the Magnanimous, since he refused two crowns, viz. that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, which was offered him by the pope, and the kingdom of Poland to which he was invited by the people; but Frederic declared he would not accept of it unless Casimir brother to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADISLAUS\">Ladislaus</a> the late king refused it. These influences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> had such an effect on the neighbouring people, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Lower Lusatia made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> surrender of their country to him. But as Lusatia was a fief of Bohemia, the king of that country immediately made war on the elector, in order to recover it. However, he was so far from being successful, that, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of peace concluded in 1462, he was obliged to yield the perpetual sovereignty of Corbus, Peits, Sommerfeld, and some other places, to the elector. Frederic then, having redeemed the New Marche from the Teutonic order for the sum of 100,000 florins, and still further enlarged his dominions, resigned the sovereignty in 1469 to his brother Albert, furred Achille.\n\nAlbert was 57 years old when his brother resigned the furred Achille.\nthe electorate to him. Most of his exploits, for which he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHILLES\">Achilles</a>, had been performed while he was burggrave of Nuremberg. He declared war against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> duke of Bavaria, and defeated and took him prisoner. He gained eight battles against the Nurembergers, who had rebelled and contested his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> to the burggraviate. In one of these he fought singly against 16 men, till his people came up to his assistance. He made himself master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of Griefenburgh in the same manner that Alexander the Great took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the Oxhydraeae, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a> from the top of the walls into the town, where he defended himself singly against the inhabitants till his men forced the gates and rescued him. The confidence which the emperor Frederic III. placed in him, gained him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of almost the whole empire. He commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">Imperial</a> armies against Lewis the Rich duke of Bavaria; and against Charles the Bold duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a>, who had laid siege to Nuis, but concluded a peace at the interposition of Albert. He gained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> at 17 tournaments, and was never dismounted.\n\nAll these exploits, however, had been performed before Albert obtained the electorate. From that time we meet with no very important transactions till the year 1594, when John Sigismund of Brandenburg, having married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Albert duke of Prussia, this united that duchy to the electorate, to which it has continued to be united ever since; and obtained pretensions to the countries of Juliers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERG\">Berg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEVES\">Cleves</a>, Marck, Ravenburg, and Ravenstein, to the succession of which Anne was heiress.\n\nSigismund died in 1619, and was succeeded by his son George William; during whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> the electorate suffered the most miserable calamities. At this time it was that the war commenced between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> and Catholics, which lasted 30 years. The former, although <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> together, were on the point of being utterly destroyed by the Imperialists under the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Tilly and Wallenstein, when Gustavus Adolphus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> turned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> in their favour, and threatened the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> with utter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>*. But by his death at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Lutzen, the fortune of war was once more changed. At last, however, peace was concluded with the emperor; and, in 1648, the elector died, leaving his dominions to his son Frederic William, named the Great.\n\nThis young prince, though only 20 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> at the time of his accession, applied himself with the utmost diligence to repair the losses and devastations occasioned by the dreadful wars which had preceded. He received the investiture of Prussia personally from the king of Poland, on condition of paying 100,000 florins annually, and not making truce or peace with the enemies of that crown. His envoy likewise received the investiture of the electorate from the emperor Ferdinand III. The elector then thought of recovering his provinces from those who had usurped them. He concluded a truce for 20 years with the Swedes, who evacuated the greatest part of his estates. He likewise paid 140,000 crowns to the Swedish garrisons, which still possessed some of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; and he concluded a treaty with the Hessians, who delivered up a part of the duchy of Cleves; and obtained of the Hollanders the evacuation of some other cities.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the powers of Europe began to be weary of a war which had continued for such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time with such unrelenting fury. The cities of Osnaburg and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a> being chosen as the most proper places for negotiation, the conferences were opened in the year 1645; but, by reason of the multiplicity of business, they were not concluded till two years after. France, which had espoused the interests of Sweden, demanded that Pomerania should be ceded to that kingdom as an indemnification for the expenses which the war had cost Gustavus Adolphus and his successors. Although the empire and the elector refused to give up Pomerania, it was at last agreed to give up to the Swedes either Pomerania, with the isles of Rugen and Wollin, also some cities; in return for which cession, the bishoprics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALBERSTADT\">Halberstadt</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINDEN\">Minden</a>, and Camin, were secularized in favour of the elector, of which he was put in possession, together with the lordships of Hochenstein and Richtenstein, with the reverence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOPRIC\">archbishopric</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGDEBURG\">Magdeburg</a>. This was Treaty of the treaty of Westphalia concluded in 1648, and which Westphalia serves as a basis to all the possessions and rights of the German princes. The elector then concluded a new treaty with the Swedes, for the regulation of limits, and for the acquittal of some debts, of which Sweden would only pay a fourth; and next year the electorate, Pomerania, and the duchies of Cleves, were evacuated by the Swedes.\n\nNotwithstanding all these treaties, however, the elector succeeds the Swedes soon after invaded Pomerania, but were entirely defeated by the elector near the town of Fehrbellin. Three thousand were left dead on the spot, among whom were a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of officers; and a great many were taken prisoners. The elector then pursued his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, gained many advantages over the Swedes, and deprived them of the cities of Stralund and Gripswald. On this the Swedes, hoping to oblige the elector to evacuate Pomerania, which he had almost totally subdued, invaded Prussia, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVONIA\">Livonia</a>, with 16,000 men; and advancing into the country, they burned the suburbs of Memel, and took the cities of Til'e and Insterburg. The elector, to oppose the invaders, left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> on the 10th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1679, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of 9000 men. The Swedes retired at his approach, and were greatly harassed by the troops on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>. So successful indeed was the elector on this occasion, that the Swedes lost almost one half of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> killed or taken prisoners. At last, having crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Frisch-haff and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURLAND\">Courland</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, he arrived on the 10th of January, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a>, within three miles of Til'e, where the Swedes had their headquarters. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, Trefenfeldt, defeated two regiments of the enemy near Splitter; and the Swedes who were in Til'e abandoned that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and retired towards Courland. They were pursued by General Gortz, and entirely defeated with such slaughter, that scarce 3000 of them returned to Livonia. Yet, notwithstanding these victories, the elector, being pressed on a treaty of the other side by the victorious generals of France, peace with M. Turenne and the prince of Conde, was obliged to make peace with the Swedes. The conditions were,\nthat the treaty of Westphalia should serve for a basis to the peace; that the elector should have the property of the customs in all the ports of Further Pomerania, with the cities of Camin, Gartz, Griessenburg, and Wildenbruck; on his part, he consented to give up to the Swedes all that he had conquered from them, and to give no assistance to the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, upon condition that France delivered up to him his provinces in Westphalia, and paid him 300,000 ducats, as an indemnification for the damages done by the French to his states. This treaty was styled the peace of St Germain.\n\nWith the treaty of St Germain terminated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> exploits of Frederic William, who passed the last years of his administration in peace. His great qualities had rendered him respected by all Europe, and had even been heard of in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>. He received an embassy from Murad Geray, chaim of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, courting his friendship. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARIAN\">barbarian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> appeared in such tattered clothes as scarce covered his nakedness, so that they were obliged to furnish him with other clothes before he could appear at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERPRETER\">interpreter</a> had a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> and no ears. In 1684, Frederic received into his dominions great numbers of Protestants who fled out of France from the persecutions of Louis XIV., after he had revoked the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> of Nantes. Twenty thousand of them are said to have settled at this time in the electorate, where they introduced new arts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, that were of the utmost benefit to the country. By this, however, he disquieted Louis XIV., for which reason he concluded an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the emperor; and having furnished him with 8,000 troops against the Turks in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, the emperor yielded to him the circle of Schwibus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a>, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> for all his rights in that province.\n\nIn 1688, the elector Frederic William died, and was succeeded by his son Frederic III. This prince was remarkably fond of show and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>, which, during the course of his government, involved him in much expense. The regal dignity seemed to be the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>. To obtain this, he joined with the emperor in the alliance against France, in which he was engaged by William III., king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. He also yielded up the circle of Schwibus, which had been given to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a>; and, in 1700, obtained from the emperor that dignity which he had so earnestly desired. The terms on which it was obtained were, 1. That Frederic should never separate from the empire those provinces of his dominions which depended on it. 2. That he should not, in the emperor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>, demand any other marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> than those which he had hitherto enjoyed. 3. That his Imperial majesty, when he wrote to him, should only give him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Dilection. 4. That nevertheless the ministers which he had at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> should be treated like those of other crowned heads. 5. That the elector should maintain 6,000 men in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> at his own expense, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the emperor should be obliged to make war on account of the succession of the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a> to the crown of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. 6. That those troops should continue there as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the war lasted.\n\nThus was the kingdom of Prussia established through the friendship of the emperor, with whom Frederic I., so called as being the first king of Prussia, continued all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in strict alliance. Indeed he was a pacific prince; and though contemptible in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, and incapable of achieving great things, had this merit, that he always preserved his dominions in peace, and thus consulted the true interest of his subjects much more than those monarchs who have dazzled the eyes of the world by their military exploits. He was indeed vain, and fond of show, as we have already observed; but had a good heart, and is said never to have violated his conjugal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a>; though it does not appear that he was greatly beloved by his royal comforts (of whom he had three) on that or any other account.\n\nFrederic I. died in the beginning of 1713, and was succeeded by Frederic William. He was in almost everything the reverse of his father. His dispositions were altogether martial; so that he applied himself entirely to the augmentation of his army, and perfecting them in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, by which means they became the most expert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> in Europe. His foible was an ambition of having his army composed of men above the ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>; but as these could not be procured, he composed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGIMENT\">regiment</a> of the tallest men he could find; and as his officers made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> of picking up such men wherever they could find them for his majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, the neighbouring states were frequently offended, and a war was often likely to ensue even from this ridiculous cause. However, his Prussian majesty was never engaged in any martial enterprise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>; but having put his army on the most respectable footing of any in the world, and filled his coffers, for he was of a very saving disposition, he put it in the power of his son to perform those exploits which have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of astonishment to all Europe.\n\nIt was in this king's reign that Prussia first perceived its enemy beneath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> enemy and rival to be the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, whereas not France as had been formerly supposed. Hence frequent bickerings took place between these two powers, for which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> of the Protestants by some of the Catholic states of the empire afforded a pretence; and though a war never actually place, yet it was easy to see that both were mortal enemies to each other. But when Frederic William died in 1740, this enmity broke out in full force. The empress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> was then left in a very disagreeable situation, as has been observed under the article BRITAIN, No. 41c, &c. Of this Frederic III. took the advantage to do himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, as he said, with regard to Silesia, of which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> had been unjustly deprived. This province was seized at that time; but it cost him dear; for the empress, having at last overcome all difficulties, formed against him the most terrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> that ever was known in Europe.\n\nThe treaty was hardly concluded with the king of Prussia, by which he reluctantly yielded up the province of Silesia, and with it a clear revenue of 800,000l. a-year, before he entered into another with the court of Peterburg, which was concluded May 22, 1746. This treaty, as far as it was made public, was only of a defensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; but five secret and separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> were added to it. By one of these it was provided, that in case his Prussian majesty should attack the empress queen, or the empress of Russia, or even the republic of Poland, it should be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of the treaty of Dresden, by which Silesia was given up. It was also stipulated, that notwithstanding that treaty (which indeed had been dictated by the king of Prussia himself),\nthe right of the empress-queen to Silesia still continued, and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of that province the contracting powers should mutually furnish an army of 60,000 men. To this treaty, called the treaty of Petersburg, the king of Poland was invited to accede; but he, being in a manner in the power of the king of Prussia, did not think proper to sign it: however, he verbally acceded to it in such a manner, that the other parties were fully convinced of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to cooperate with all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; and in consideration of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>, it was agreed that he should have a share in the partition of the king of Prussia's dominions, in case of a successful event of their enterprises.\n\nIn consequence of these machinations, every art was used to render the king of Prussia personally odious to the empress of Russia; the queen of Hungary made vast preparations in Bohemia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORAVIA\">Moravia</a>; and the king of Poland, under pretence of a military amusement, drew together 16,000 men, with whom he occupied a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIRNA\">Pirna</a>. The queen of Hungary, still further to strengthen herself, concluded a treaty with the court of France at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>, dated May 1, 1756.\n\nBut in the mean time, the king of Prussia having undisturbed by his emissaries what was going forward, resolved to be beforehand with his enemies, and at least to keep the war out of his own country; and therefore entered Saxony with a considerable army. At first he affected only to demand a free passage for his troops, and an observance of the neutrality professed by the king of Poland; but, having good reasons to doubt this neutrality, he demanded, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a>, that these Saxon troops should immediately quit the strong post they occupied, and disperse themselves. This demand was refused; on which his Prussian majesty blockaded the Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> at Pirna, resolving to reduce it by famine, since its strong situation rendered an attack very dangerous. At that time there were in Bohemia two Saxon armies, one under the command of M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, and the other under M. Piccolomini. To keep these in awe, the king had sent M. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCHWERIN\">Schwerin</a> with an army into Bohemia from the country of Glatz, and M. Keith had penetrated into the same kingdom on the side of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MEININGEN\">Meiningen</a>. But still the king of Prussia did not entirely confide in these dispositions; and therefore fearing lest M. Brown might afford some assistance to the Saxons, he joined his forces under Keith, and on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1 attacked and defeated the Austrian general, so that the latter found it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to relieve the Saxons, who, after a vain attempt to retire from their post, were all taken prisoners. The king of Poland quitted his dominions in Germany, and the Prussians took up their winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> in Saxony. Here they seized on the revenues, levied exorbitant contributions, and obliged the country to furnish them with recruits. The king of Prussia at this time made himself master of the archives of Dresden, by which means he procured the originals of those pieces above-mentioned, which, when produced to the world, gave a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the combination that had been formed against him, and consequently justified the measures he had taken for his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>.\n\nNo sooner had the king entered Saxony, in the manner already related, than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> was commenced against him in the emperor's Aulic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, and before the diet of the empire, where he was soon condemned for contumacy, and put to the ban of the empire.\n\nThe various circles of the empire were ordered to furnish their contingents of men and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to put this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> in execution; but these came in so slowly, that, had it not been for the affluence of the French under the prince de Soubise, the army would probably have never been in a condition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>. The Austrians, in the mean time, made great preparations and raised 100,000 men in Bohemia, whom they committed to the care of Prince Charles of Lorraine, assisted against him by M. Brown. The Czarina sent a body of 60,000 men under M. Apraxin, to invade the Ducal Prussia; whilst a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was equipped in the Baltic, in order to co-operate with that army. The king of Sweden also acceded to the confederacy, in hopes of recovering the possessions in Pomerania which his ancestors had enjoyed; and the duke of Mecklenburg took the same party, promising to join the Swedish army with 6000 men as soon as it should be necessary. On the king of Prussia's side appeared nobody excepting an army of between 30,000 and 40,000 Hanoverians commanded by the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>; and these were outnumbered and forced to yield to a superior army of French commanded by M. d'Estrees.\n\nIn the mean time, his Prussian majesty, finding that he must depend for assistance solely on his own abilities, resolved to make the best use of his time. Accordingly, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> 1757, his armies poured into Austria to Bohemia from two different quarters, while the army king himself prepared to enter it from a third. M. Schwerin entered from Silesia; the prince of Bevern from Lusatia, where he defeated an army of 28,000 Austrians that opposed his passage. As the intentions of the king himself were not known, the Austrians detached a body of 20,000 men from their main army to observe his motions. This was no sooner done than the king cut off all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> and the main body; and having joined his two generals with incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a>, he engaged the Austrians near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAGUE\">Prague</a>, totally defeated them, took their camp, military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, and cannon; but lost the brave General Schwerin, who was killed at the age of 82, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a>'s standard in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. On the Austrian side, M. Brown was wounded, and died in a short time, though it is supposed more from the chagrin he suffered, than from the dangerous nature of the wound itself.\n\nAbout 40,000 of the Austrian army took refuge in Prague, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> fled different ways. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> and town was instantly invested by the king, and all succours were cut off. The great number of troops which it contained rendered an attack unadvisable, but seemed to render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of it by famine inevitable; however, the king, to accomplish his purpose the more speedily, prepared to bombard the town. On the 29th of May, after a most dreadful storm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, four batteries began to play on the city. From these were thrown, every 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, 288 bombs, besides a vast number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot balls, so that it was soon on fire in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> made a vigorous defence, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-conducted rally; but had the misfortune to be repulsed with great loss. The magistrates, burgesses, and clergy, seeing their city on the point of being reduced...\nreduced to an heap of rubbish, supplicated the command-\ner in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> manner to capitulate; but he was\ndeaf to their intreatesies, and drove 12,000 of the most\nuseless mouths out of town, who were quickly driven in\nagain by the Prussians.\n\nThus the affairs of the empress queen seemed verg-\ning to destruction, when Leopold count Daun took\nupon him the command of the remains of M. Brown's\narmy. This general had arrived within a few miles of\nPrague the day after the great battle. He immedi-\nately collected the scattered fugitives with the greatest\ndiligence, and retired with them to a strong post in\nthe neighbourhood, from whence he gave the troops\nin Prague hopes of a speedy relief. It was now the\nking of Prussia's business, either to have attempted to\nmake himself master of the city by one desperate effort,\nor entirely to have abandoned the enterprise, and\ndriven Count Daun from his post before his troops had\nrecovered from the terror of their late defeat; but, by\nattempting to do both, he rendered himself incapable\nof doing either. Though the army of Count Daun\nalready amounted to 65,000 men, and though they\nwere strongly entrenched, and defended by a vast train\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, his majesty thought proper to send no\nmore than 32,000 men. This body made the arduous\nattempt on the 18th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>; but though they\ndid all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> courage and conduct could do, and\nthough the king himself at last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> at the head of\nhis cavalry, the Prussians were driven out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>\nwith great loss. This engagement was named the battle\nof Colin.\n\nThe first consequence of the battle of Colin was,\nthat the king of Prussia was obliged to raise the siege\nof Prague; soon after which, he was obliged to quit\nBohemia, and take refuge in Saxony. The Austrians\nharassed him as much as possible; but, notwithstanding\ntheir great superiority, their armies were not in a\ncondition to make any decisive attempt upon him, as\nthe frontiers of Saxony abounded with situations easily\ndefended. In the mean time, the Russians, who had\nhitherto been very dilatory in their motions, began to\nexert themselves, and entered Ducal Prussia, under M.\nApraxin and Fermor, where they committed innum-\nerable cruelties and excesses. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> body of\nAustrians entered Silesia, and penetrated as far as\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRESLAU\">Breslau</a>. Then they made a turn backwards, and be-\nsieged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHWEIDNITZ\">Schweidnitz</a>. Another body entered Lusatia,\nand made themselves masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ZITTAU\">Zittau</a>. An army of\n22,000 Swedes entered Prussian Pomerania, took the\ntowns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANKLAM\">Anklam</a> and Demmin, and laid the whole\ncountry under contribution. The French, too, being\nfreed from all restraint by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> of the duke\nof Cumberland at Closter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a>*, made their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into\nHalberstadt and the Old Marche of Brandenburg,\nfirst exacting contributions, and then plundering the\ntowns. The army of the empire, being reinforced by\nthat of the prince de Soubise, after many delays, was\non full march to enter Saxony, which left the Au-\nstrians at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to exert the greatest part of their\nforce in the reduction of Silesia. General Haddock\npenetrated through Lusatia, passed by the Prussian ar-\nmies, and suddenly appeared before the gates of Ber-\nlin, which city he laid under contribution. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\ntired on the approach of a body of Prussians; yet he\nstill found means to keep such a post as interrupted the\nking's communication with Silesia. The destruction\nof the king of Prussia therefore now seemed inevitable.\nEvery exertion which he had made, though brave\nand well-conducted, had been unsuccessful. His general\nLehwald, who opposed the Russians, had orders to\nattack them at all events. He obeyed his orders;\nand with 30,000 men attacked 60,000 of the enemy\nstrongly entrenched at a place called Norkitten. The\nRussians behaved with the greatest valour; but after\nhaving killed five times more of the enemy than the Rus-\nsians themselves lost, they were obliged to retire, though\nmore formidable after their defeat than the Russians\nafter their victory. The king, in the mean time, ex-\nerted himself on every side, and his enemies fled every-\nwhere before him; but whilst he pursued one body,\nanother gained upon him in some other part, and the\nwinter came on fast, while his strength decayed, and\nthat of his adversaries seemed to increase on every\nquarter.\n\nThe Prussian monarch, however, though distressed,\ndid not abandon himself to despair, or lose that won-\nderful presence of mind which has so eminently distin-\nguished him in all his military enterprises. He indu-\nstriously delayed a decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> till the approach of\nwinter; but at last, after various movements, on No-\nvember 5, 1757, he met at Rothenbach with the united\narmy of his enemies commanded by the prince of Sax-\nony at Hilburghausen and the prince de Soubise. The allied\narmy amounted to 50,000 men complete; but most of\nthe troops of the Circles were new raised, and many\nof them not well affected to the cause. The Prus-\nsians did not exceed 25,000 men; but they were su-\nperior to any troops in the world, and were inspired,\nby the presence of their king, with the most enthusi-\nastic valour. The Austrians were defeated with the\nloss of 3000 killed, eight generals, 250 officers of dif-\nferent ranks, and 6000 private soldiers, taken prifon-\ners, while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> alone prevented the total destruction of\nthe army.\n\nBy this battle the king was set free on one side;\nbut this only gave him an opportunity of renewing\nhis labours on another. The Austrians had a great\nforce, and now began to make a proportionable pro-\ngress in Silesia. After a siege of 16 days, they had re-\nduced the strong fortress of Schweidnitz, and obliged\nthe Prussian garrison of 4000 men to surrender pri-\nsoners of war. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">Hearing</a> then of the victory at Rothen-\nbach, and that the king of Prussia was in full march\nto relieve Silesia, they resolved to attack the prince\nof Bevern in his strong camp under the walls of Bres-\nlau. They attacked the Prince's army on November\n22nd; but their attack was frustrated with the greatest\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. The slaughter of the Austrians was pro-\ndigious. A great part of the enemy had retired from the prince\nof Bevern, when all at once the Prussian generals took the same reso-\nlution. Their army had suffered much in the engage-\nment, and they became apprehensive of a total defeat\nin case their intrenchments should be forced in any\npart; for which reason they quitted their strong post,\nand retired behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODER\">Oder</a>. Two days after, the\nprince of Bevern, going to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECONNOITRE\">reconnoitre</a> without effort,\nattended only by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOM\">groom</a>, was taken prisoner by an\nadvanced party of Croats, a small body of whom had\ncrossed the Oder.\nOn this the town of Breilau immediately surrendered; where, as well as at Schweidnitz, the Austrians found great quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMUNITION\">ammunition</a>, and money. All Silesia was on the point of falling into their hands, and the Prussian affairs were going into the utmost distraction, when the king himself by a most rapid march passed through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THURINGIA\">Thuringia</a>, Meissen, and Lusatia, in spite of the utmost efforts of the generals Haddick and Marhal, who were placed there to oppose him; and, entering Silesia on the 2d of December, joined the prince of Bevern's corps, who repassed the Oder to meet him. The garrison of Schweidnitz, who, as we have already observed, had been made prisoners of war, also joined the king's army unexpectedly; and their presence contributed not a little, notwithstanding the smallness of their number, to raise the spirits of the whole army. They had submitted to the capitulation with the greatest reluctance; but as the Austrians were conducting them to prison, they happened to receive intelligence of the victory at Ro\u00dfbach; on which they immediately rose on the escort that conducted them, and entirely dispersed it; and afterwards marching in such a direction as they thought might most readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them to their king, they accidentally fell in with his army.\n\nHis Prussian majesty now approached Breilau; on which the Austrians, confident in their superiority, (for they exceeded 70,000, while the Prussians scarce amounted to 36,000), abandoned their strong camp, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> which the prince of Bevern had formerly occupied, and advanced to give him battle. The king did not intend by any means to disappoint them, but advanced on his part with the greatest celerity. The two armies met on December 5th, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Leuthen. Count Daun made the best dispositions possible. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> occupied by his army was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, with small eminences in some parts. These eminences they surrounded with artillery; and as the ground was also interspersed with thickets, they fought to turn these likewise to their advantage. On their right and left were hills, on which they planted batteries of cannon. The ground in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> was intersected by many causeways; and to make the whole more impracticable, the Austrians had felled a great number of trees, and scattered them in the way. It was almost impossible at the beginning of the engagement for the Prussian cavalry to act, on account of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a>; but, by a judicious disposition made by the king himself, all difficulties were overcome. His majesty had placed four battalions behind the cavalry of his right wing; foreseeing that General Nadaffi, who was placed on the enemy's left with a corps de reserve, designed to attack him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANK\">flank</a>. It happened as he had foreseen: that general's cavalry attacked the Prussian right wing with great fury; but he was received with such a severe fire from the four battalions, that he was obliged to retire in disorder. The king's flank then, well covered and supported, was enabled to act with such order and vigour as repulsed the enemy. The Austrian artillery was also silenced by that of the Prussians; however, the Austrians continued to make a gallant resistance during the whole battle. After having been once thrown into disorder, they rallied all their forces about Leuthen, which was defended on every side by entrenchments and redoubts. The Prussians attacked them with the utmost impetuosity, and at last became masters of the post; on which the enemy fled on all sides, and a total rout ensued. In this battle the Austrians lost 6000 killed on the spot, 15,000 taken prisoners, and upwards of 200 pieces of cannon.\n\nThe consequences of this victory were very great. Breilau was immediately invested, and surrendered on December 29th; the garrison, amounting to 13,000 men, were made prisoners of war. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> of Schweidnitz was formed as closely as the season of the year would permit; while detached Prussian parties overran the whole country of Silesia, and reduced every place of least importance. The Russians, who had ravaged and destroyed the country in such a manner that they could not subsist in it, thought proper to retire out of the Prussian dominions altogether. Thus General Lehwaldt was left at liberty to act against the driven out Swedes; and them he quickly drove out of Prussian Pomerania, the whole of which country he not only recovered, but also some part of Swedish Pomerania. Thus the duchy of Mecklenburg being left quite exposed, the king took ample vengeance on it by exacting the most severe contributions of men and money. To complete this monarch's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> also, the French, who had retired after the battle of Ro\u00dfbach, were now opposed by the Hanoverians under Prince Ferdinand, who kept them so well employed, that, during the rest of the war, the king of Prussia had no more trouble from them. See BRITAIN, No. 442.\n\nThe beginning of the year 1758 was favourable to the arms of his Prussian majesty. On the 3d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> he commenced his operations against Schweidnitz, and began the siege so vigorously, that the place surrendered in 13 days. He then disposed his forces in such a manner as might best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> his dominions against his numerous enemies. For this purpose Count Dohna commanded a body of troops on the side of Pomerania; another considerable body was posted between Wohlau and Glogau, in order to cover Silesia from the Russians, in case they should make their inroad that way. An army, in a little time after, was formed in Saxony, commanded by the king's brother Prince Henry. This army consisted of 30 battalions and 45 squadrons, and was designed to make head against the army of the empire; which, by great efforts made during the winter, and the junction of a large body of Austrians, was again in a condition to act. Between all these armies a ready communication was kept up by a proper choice of posts. After the reduction of Schweidnitz, the king having made a show of invading Bohemia, suddenly burst into Moravia, where in a short time he made himself master of the whole country, and on the 27th of May laid siege to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLMUTZ\">Olmutz</a> the capital. Of this M. Daun was no longer informed, than he took his route to Moravia through Bohemia; and, though he was not in a condition to Olmutz risk a battle, nor indeed would have done so unless he without had had a very considerable advantage; yet, by placing success himself in a strong situation where he could not be attacked, by harassing the king's troops and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off their convoys, he at last obliged him to abandon the enterprise. The king, however, who frequently owed a good part of his success to the impenetrable secrecy with which he covered all his designs, gave not the least hint of his intention to raise the siege of Olmutz.\nOn the contrary, the very day before the siege was raised, the firing continued as brisk as ever; but in the night (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1.) the whole army took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Bohemia in two columns, and gained an entire march upon the Austrians. Thus, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of his enemies, the Prussian army reached Bohemia with very little molestation. Here he seized upon a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> at Lieutomifiel; defeated some corps of Austrians who had attempted to interrupt his progress; and arrived at Konigsgratz, of which he took possession, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> from it 7000 Austrians who were intrenched there. This city and several other districts he laid under contribution: but soon after entered Silesia, and marched with the utmost rapidity to encounter the Ruffians, who had at that time united their forces under generals Brown and Fermor, entered the New Marche of Brandenburg, and laid siege to Custrin.\n\nThe king arrived at this city at a very critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. The Ruffians had laid siege to it on the 15th of August; and though they were not well skilled in managing artillery, yet, by furious and unremitting discharges at random, they threw in such a number of bombs and red-hot balls, that the town was soon on fire in every quarter. Some of the wretched inhabitants were burned; others buried in the ruins of their houses, or killed by the balls which fell like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> in the streets; while many of the survivors abandoned their habitations, and fled out of the town on that side where it was not invested. The governor did every thing for the defence of the place; but as the walls were built after the old manner, it was impossible that the town could have made a defence for any length of time, especially as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> magazine of the besieged had been blown up. The avenger of all these injuries, however, was now at hand. The king came in sight of the Ruffians on the 25th of August, after a march of 56 days, and beheld the country everywhere defoliated, and the villages in flames by the depredations of his cruel enemy, who had raised the siege at his approach, and retired towards a neighbouring village named Zornedorff. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, a most terrible fire of cannon and mortars poured destruction on the right wing of the Russian army for two hours without intermission. The slaughter was such as might have been expected; but the Ruffians kept their ground with astonishing resolution, new regiments still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> forward to supply the places of those that fell. When the first line had fired away all their charges, they rushed forward on the Prussians with their bayonets; and all at once these brave troops, though encouraged by the presence of their king, gave way and fled before an enemy already half defeated. The Ruffian generals ought now to have attacked with their cavalry the disordered infantry of their enemies, which would have completed the defeat, and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, given the finishing stroke to the king of Prussia's affairs. This opportunity, however, they lost: but the king was not so negligent; for, by a very rapid and masterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, he brought all the cavalry of his right wing to the centre, and falling on the Ruffian foot uncovered by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and even disordered by their own success, they pushed them back with most miserable slaughter, at the same time that the repulsed battalions of infantry, returning from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, and exasperated at their late disgrace, rendered the victory no longer doubtful. The Ruffians were now thrown into the most dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blew the dust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> into their faces, so that they could not distinguish friends from foes; they fired on each other, plundered their own baggage which stood between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and intoxicated themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a>: the ranks fell in upon one another; and, being thus crammed together into a narrow space, the fire of the Prussians had a full and dreadful effect, while their enemies kept up only a scattered and ineffectual fire, generally quite over their heads. Yet even in this dismal situation the Ruffians did not fly; but suffered themselves to be slaughtered till seven at night, when their generals having caused an attack to be made on the Prussian right wing, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the enemy was drawn to that quarter, and they had time to retire a little from the field of battle to recover their order.\n\nIn this engagement, which was called the battle of Zornedorff, the Ruffians lost 21,529 men, while that of the Prussians did not exceed 2000. A vast train of artillery was taken, together with the military chest, and many officers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. The consequence was, that the Ruffian army retreated as far as Landpferg on the frontiers of Poland, and the king was left at liberty to march with his usual expedition to the relief of Prince Henry of Saxony.\n\nThe prince was at this time sorely pressed by M. Daum. As soon as the king had left Bohemia in the countenance already related, M. Daum, considering that it would have been to no purpose to follow him, resolved to turn his arms towards Saxony. Towards that country, therefore, he took his route through Lusatia, by Zittau, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GORLITZ\">Gorlitz</a>, and Bauzen. On the 3rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> he invested the strong fortress of Sonnefeldt; which unaccountably surrendered, after a single day's resistance, to one of his generals named Maguire. He then began to favour the operations of General Laudohn, who had advanced through the Lower Lusatia to the confines of Brandenburg; and, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the attention of the Prussian forces which were left in Silesia to the northward of that duchy, he facilitated the progress of the generals Harfch and De Ville in the southern parts. He then proposed that Prince Henry should be attacked by the army of the empire, while that of the Austrians should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBE\">Elbe</a>, and, falling at the same time on the Prussians, second the attack of the Imperialists, and cut off the retreat of their enemies from Dresden. The sudden appearance of the king of Prussia, however, put an end to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>; General Laudohn abandoned all his conquests in Lower Lusatia, and the king of Prussia retired towards M. Daum, while that general himself retired from the neighbourhood of Dresden as far as Zittau. The army of the empire only kept its ground; possessing itself of the strong post at Pirna, formerly mentioned, but did not undertake any thing. As for the Swedes, who had directed their motions by those of the Ruffians, they no sooner heard of the victory of Zornedorff, than they retreated with much more expedition than they had advanced.\n\nThus the king of Prussia's affairs seemed to be pretty well retrieved, when by one fatal piece of negligence he was brought to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERGE\">verge</a> of ruin. M. Daum had possessed himself of an advantageous camp at Stolphen, by which he preserved a communication with the army of\nof the empire. On the other hand, the king of Prussia, having taken possession of an important post at Bautzen, extended his right wing to the village of Hochkirchen, by which he preserved a communication with his brother Prince Henry, protected Brandenburg, and was better situated than he could be anywhere else for throwing succours into Silesia. The two armies kept a watchful eye on the motions of each other; and as the principal aim of M. Daun was to cut off the king's communication with Silesia, and of the king to cut off M. Daun's communication with Bohemia, a battle seemed inevitable, though great danger seemed to await that party who should begin the attack.\n\nIn this critical posture of affairs, the Austrian general formed a design of attacking the Prussian camp in the night. In what manner he came to surmise such a vigilant enemy has never been accounted for; but that such a surmise was actually accomplished on the 14th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, is certain. In the dead of the preceding night, the Austrian army began to march in three columns towards the camp of the king of Prussia; and though the night was exceedingly dark, and they had a considerable way to go, they all arrived at the same time, in safety, without being discovered, and without the least confusion; and at five in the morning began a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and well-conducted attack. The Prussians were in a moment thrown into confusion; Marshal Keith, one of their best generals, received two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a>-balls, and fell dead on the spot. Prince Francis of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a> had his head <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> off by a cannon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> as he was mounting his horse; and every thing seemed to announce the total destruction of the army. Still, however, the king preserved his wonderful presence of mind, which indeed he never appears to have lost on any occasion. He ordered some detachments from his left to support his right wing; but the moment that these orders were received, the left itself was furiously attacked. General Ketzow, who commanded in that quarter, repulsed the Austrians with difficulty, and was not able to afford any considerable assistance to the right, which alone was obliged to sustain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the grand attack. The Austrians, in the beginning of the engagement, had driven the Prussians out of the village of Hochkirchen; and as the fate of the day depended on the possession of that post, the hottest dispute was there. The Prussians made three bloody and unsuccessful attacks on the village; on the fourth they carried it; but the Austrians continually pouring in fresh troops, at last drove them out with prodigious slaughter on all sides. The king then ordered a retreat, which was conducted in good order, without being pursued; however, this bloody action cost him 7000 men, together with a great number of cannon. The Austrians computed their own loss at 5000.\n\nHis Prussian majesty, having thus happily escaped such imminent danger, took every possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to prevent the enemy from gaining any considerable advantage from his defeat. Perceiving that the only advantage they wished to derive from it was to cover the operations of their armies in Silesia, and that he had now nothing to fear on the side of Saxony, he largely reinforced his own army from that of Prince Henry, and hastened into Silesia, in order to raise the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEISSE\">Neisse</a>, which had been completely invested on the 4th of October. On the 24th of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, therefore, he quitted his camp, and, making a great compass, to avoid obstructions from the enemy, arrived in the plains of Gorlitz. A body of the Austrians had in vain attempted to secure this post before him, and none who arrived after him were defeated with the loss of 800 men. From this place the king pursued his march with the utmost diligence; but was followed by General Laudohn, at the head of 24,000 men, who constantly hung on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REAR\">rear</a>, and harassed his army. The king, however, knowing the importance of his expedition, continued his march without interruption, and defied his antagonist to obtain many little advantages without molestation. Daun, however, not content with the opposition given by Laudohn, sent a large body of horse and foot by another route to reinforce the generals Karlsfeld and De Ville, who had formed the siege of Neisse and the blockade of C\u00f6bel, while he himself passed the Elbe, and advanced towards Dresden.\n\nAll these precautions, however, were of little avail. The generals Karlsfeld and De Ville, notwithstanding their reinforcement, no sooner heard of the king of Prussia's approach, than they raised the siege of both places, and retired, leaving behind them a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of military stores. The end of the Prussian monarch's march being thus accomplished, he instantly returned by the same way he came, and hastened to the relief of Saxony, the capital of which (Dresden) was in great danger from Marshal Daun. The place was but indifferently fortified, and garrisoned only by 12,000 men; so that it could not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to hold out long against a numerous and well-appointed army. It was besides commanded by a large suburb, of which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> once the enemy got possession, all defence of the city must then be vain. For this reason M. Schmettau, the Prussian governor, determined to set these suburbs on fire, which Dresden was actually done November 10th, with an incredible burst of lofs to the inhabitants, as in the suburbs were carried on lofts of those valuable manufactures which render the city of Dresden remarkable. This disappointed the designs of M. Daun; but, though the action was agreeable to the laws of war, and had been executed with all the caution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of which such an action was capable, yet the Austrians exclaimed against it as a piece of the most unprovoked and wanton cruelty recorded in history.\n\nAfter the king of Prussia had approached Dresden, all Saxony opposite the Austrian armies retired into Bohemia, where they pitched up their winter-quarters, as the king of Prussia did in Saxony. This unhappy country he said he would now consider as his own by right of conquest. But instead of treating the conquered people as his lawful subjects, he oppressed them in all possible ways, by levying the most severe and exorbitant contributions, surrounding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> with soldiers, and confining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> in narrow lodgings on straw-beds, till they drew upon their correspondents for such funds as he wanted.\n\nIn 1759, as early as the 23rd of February, the Prussians commenced their military operations. General Woberow marched with a body of troops into Poland; where he destroyed several very large magazines belonging to the Russians, and returned into Silesia without any loss on the 18th of April. In the meantime, by some movements of the king of Prussia himself, the greatest part of the Austrian troops had been drawn...\nPrussia drew towards the frontiers of Silesia. Prince Henry immediately took advantage of this opening, and on the 13th of April entered Bohemia with his army divided into two columns. One, commanded by himself, marched towards Peterswalde; the other, under General Hulsen, passed by the towns of Palfberg and Commottau. That commanded by Prince Henry himself penetrated as far as Loboschutz and Leitmeritz; the enemy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> everywhere before them, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> or abandoning the vast magazines which they had amassed in these parts. The body under General Hulsen had more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> employment. A strong pass at Palfberg was defended by a considerable body of Austrians. General Hulsen, having conducted his cavalry by another way in such a manner as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> directly on their rear, attacked them in front with his infantry, drove them out of their intrenchments, and totally defeated them with the loss of a great number killed, and 2000 taken prisoners, while that of the Prussians did not exceed 70 killed and wounded. After this exploit they returned into Saxony, with hostages for the contributions which they had largely exacted during the course of their expedition.\n\nSome other successes obtained by Prince Henry, cleared the country of Franconia of his enemies; but now the approach of the Russians seemed once more to bring the affairs of the king of Prussia to a crisis. Notwithstanding the destruction of their magazines, they had continued to advance into Silesia, where they were opposed by Count Dohna; but as the troops he had with him were very far inferior to his enemies, he found it impossible to do more, at least with any appearance of success, than to observe their motions and harass them on their march. But this was so displeasing to the king, that he disgraced his general, and appointed Wedel to succeed him, with orders to attack the Russians at all events. To enable him, however, in some measure to comply with this desperate order, he sent him some reinforcements, which brought his army up to near 30,000. With these, on the 23rd of July 1759, General Wedel attacked 70,000 Russians posted in the most advantageous manner at Zulichau, and defended by a numerous artillery. Though the Prussians marched on to certain destruction and disgrace, they sustained the attack for a long time with unparalleled resolution. At last, however, they gave way, and were obliged to retire with the loss of 4700 killed or taken prisoners, and 3000 wounded.\n\nThe consequences of this victory were, that the Russians penetrated into the king's territories, and took possession of the towns of Croffen and Frankfort on the Oder, which made it absolutely necessary for the king to come in person to oppose them. Accordingly, on the 4th of August, he joined Wedel with a considerable body of forces, having left the greatest part of his army in Saxony under Prince Henry. But as Marshal Daun had sent a body of 12,000 horse and 8000 foot under General Laudohn to the assistance of the Russians, the king still found himself unable to fight them; as, with this and some other reinforcements, their army now amounted to upwards of 90,000. He therefore recalled General Finck, whom he had sent into Saxony with 9000 men; but with all his reinforcements, it was found impossible to augment his army to 50,000 complete. His situation, however, was now so critical that a battle was unavoidable; and therefore, on the 12th of August, with this inferiority of number, the king attacked his enemies strongly intrenched, and defended by a prodigious number of cannon. In this action, his principal effort was against the left wing of the Russian army. He began the attack, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, with a heavy cannonade; which having produced the desired effect, he attacked that wing with several battalions disposed in columns. The Russian intrenchments were forced with great slaughter, and 72 pieces of cannon were taken. But still there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFILE\">defile</a> to the right, to be passed, and several redoubts which covered the village of Cunnersdorf to be mastered. These were attacked with the same resolution, and taken one after another. The enemy made another stand at the village, and endeavoured to preserve their ground there by pushing forward several battalions of horse and foot; but this also proved unsuccessful; they were driven from post to post quite to the last redoubts. For upwards of six hours the Prussians were successful, and everywhere broke the enemy with prodigious slaughter; drove them from almost all the ground they had occupied before the battle, took more than half their artillery, and scarce anything seemed wanting to make the victory complete. In these circumstances, the king wrote the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILLET\">billet</a> to the queen: \"Madam, we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the Russians from their intrenchments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory.\" Of this victory, however, he deprived himself, by an excessive eagerness for conquest. The enemy, defeated almost in every quarter, found their left wing, shattered as it was, to be more entire than any other part of their army. Count Solikoff, the Russian general, therefore assembled the remains of his right wing, and, gathering as many as he could from his centre, reinforced the left, and made a stand at a redoubt which had been erected on an advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> in a place called the Jews burying-ground. All the king's generals are said to have been of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that he ought to allow the Russians the peaceable possession of this post. Their army had already suffered so much, that it would have been impossible for them to have attempted any enterprise of consequence after the battle; but their artillery was still numerous, the post very strong, and the Prussian troops greatly fatigued. These reasons for a few moments had some weight with the king; but the natural impetuosity of his temper getting the better of his reason, he led on his wearied troops again and again; till at last, when their strength was in a manner totally exhausted, they were attacked and utterly routed by the Austrian and Russian cavalry, the former of which had hitherto remained quite inactive, and were therefore quite fresh, and irresistible by the enfeebled Prussians. The night, and the prudent use of some eminences, prevented the total destruction of the army; however, their loss amounted to 20,000 men killed and wounded. The king, when he found the victory totally lost, sent another billet to the queen, expressing in the following manner: \"Remove from Berlin with the royal family; let the archives be carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTSDAM\">Potsdam</a>; the town may make conditions with the enemy.\"\n\nImmediately after this defeat, the king set himself about repairing his losses with the utmost diligence. In a few days everything was again put in order in his camp.\ncamp. He replaced his artillery from Berlin; recalled General Kliest with 5000 men from Pomerania; detached 6000 from his own army to the defence of Saxony; and with the remainder put himself between the Ruffians and Great Glogau, covering that city which had been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> object of their designs; and in short, notwithstanding their victory, obliged them to return to Poland without accomplishing anything besides the carnage at Cumberdorf.\n\nThe misfortunes of the Prussian monarch, however, were not at an end. Prince Henry, indeed, by a most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> and well-conducted march, entered Saxony, which was now totally overrun by the armies of the enemy. At the same time, strong detachments having been sent into that country under generals Finck and Wunlich, the whole was in a short time recovered except Dresden. Towards this place Marshal Daun retired, and in all probability would soon have been obliged to leave Saxony entirely. But the king's impatience could not be satisfied without cutting off his retreat, and forcing him to a battle; for which purpose he sent General Finck with upwards of 12,000 men according to the Prussian account, but 20,000 according to the Austrians, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> some passes through which M. Daun could only take his route towards Bohemia. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> was executed with great exactness; but the Prussian general, having probably advanced too far into these defiles, and neglected to preserve a communication with the main army, gave his enemy an opportunity of surrounding him, and at last forcing him and his whole army to surrender prisoners of war. This disaster was soon after followed by another. General Durckel was posted at the right of the Elbe, opposite to Meissen; but on the approach of a large body of Austrians, they prepared to retreat over the river into a place where they hoped to be more secure. But having been obliged by an hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> to withdraw their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of boats, a thaw supervened, when they attempted to lay a bridge of pontoons, so that they were again obliged to have recourse to their boats. In this situation, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REAR_GUARD\">rear-guard</a> was attacked with great fury by the Austrians, and all the soldiers who composed it killed or taken. The loss of the Prussians on this occasion was computed at 3000 men.\n\nThe year 1765 showed the Prussian monarch in a more dangerous situation than he had ever yet experienced. Indeed his affairs now seemed to be altogether desperate. His losses were not to be measured by the number of the killed or prisoners, but by armies destroyed or taken. Forty generals had died or been killed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> since the beginning of October 1764, exclusive of those who were wounded or taken prisoners. This itself would have been an irreparable loss, had not the very wars which destroyed these furnished others equally capable of filling their places. But another deficiency, which could not be remedied, still remained.\u2014The king had, by his indefatigable industry and exertions, supplied all the deficiencies of men in his armies, but they were not the same men as before. The hardy veterans, with whom he had originally taken the field, were now no more, and their places were supplied by others who had neither the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>; so that now he was obliged to supply this deficiency by his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and heroism.\n\nBut whatever abilities the Prussian monarch might possess, and though he undoubtedly exerted them to the utmost, it seemed only to be contending against fate, and his enemies gained still greater and greater advantages. General Laudohn, with whom none but the king himself seems to have been able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a>, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of artful movements, drew into a disadvantageous situation M. Fouquet, one of the Prussian generals, with a strong body of forces. Perceiving it impossible for them to escape, Laudohn then made a violent attack on their intrenchments in the dead of the night of June 23rd. The Prussians made a gallant defence, but at last were all killed or taken prisoners except about 300. Of the Prussians were killed 4000, and 7000 taken prisoners; 8 pieces of cannon, and a great number of colours, were also lost. The victory, however, was dear bought; for the Austrians lost above 12,000 men in killed and wounded; whom, however, they could better spare than the Prussians, on account of their numbers.\u2014This action was called the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANDSHUT\">Landshut</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Laudohn failed not to improve this victory Glatz to the utmost. He instantly turned back from Landshut by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHINE\">Rhine</a>, and fell upon the city of Glatz; which he took in a very short time, with the garrison who defended it, consisting of 2000 men. In this place were found 101 pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> cannon, with immense quantities of provisions and military stores. From thence he marched against Breissau, and immediately invested it. But, in the mean time, the king of Prussia, whose motions had been all this time counteracted by M. Daun in Saxony, marched with his usual rapidity towards Silesia. By this means he drew M. Daun out of Saxony; and indeed the Austrian general used such expedition, that he gained two full days on the king. This was no sooner known to his Prussian majesty, than he returned with the same expedition that he had advanced, and sat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> before Dresden. Of Dresden this M. Daun soon received intelligence, and returned to besiege it. In the mean time, however, the buildings of the city were terribly shattered by the king's cannon and bombs which continually played on it. His endeavours, however, proved ineffectual to reduce it before the arrival of M. Daun. The siege had been begun on the 13th of July, and on the 19th M. Daun appeared within a league of Dresden. The Prussians then redoubled their efforts. They had that day received reinforcements of heavy cannon and mortars, with which they battered the place incessantly. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a>, several principal streets, and some palaces, and the noble manufactory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a>, were entirely destroyed. The siege was continued till the 22d; but, on the night of the 21st, M. Daun had thrown 16 battalions into the city; which rendered it impossible for the king to continue longer before it with any prospect of success. He therefore raised the siege, and retired without molestation, though there were three considerable armies of the enemy in the neighbourhood. Breissau was fiercely bombarded by Laudohn, but the approach of Prince Henry obliged him to desist from his enterprise on the 5th of August.\n\nBut, in the mean time, the fortune of the king seemed likely to be terminated by one fatal stroke. Finding it impossible for him to carry on a defensive war, he marched towards Silesia with such astonishing rapidity,\npidity, that before the middle of August he had advanced 200 miles, leaving Marshal Daun with his army far behind him. This expedition he undertook in order to engage General Laudohn before he could have time to effect a junction with Daun and Lacy, another Austrian general; which triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> seemed to threaten him with unavoidable destruction at once. This, however, he found it impossible to prevent: and the three armies, when joined, formed a most tremendous line of encampments, extending no less than 30 English miles; at the same time that every one of their posts was strong, and the communication between them easy. The king was strongly encamped at Lignitz; and for several days employed all his military skill in attempting to induce one of the bodies to detach itself from the rest, or to attack them at some disadvantage; but without effect. At last, the Austrian generals, having maturely weighed all circumstances, resolved to attack the king's camp itself, strong as it was; and Marshal Daun, remembering the advantage he had gained at Hochkirchen by an attack in the night-time, resolved to follow the same plan now. The plan therefore was laid in the following manner. The whole army, as soon as it should begin to grow dark, was to march from their several posts to such situations as were marked out for each corps: they were to strike their tents, but yet to keep up the fires in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a>, and to have the drums beat the tattoo as usual, by which means they had a probability of surprising the enemy; or if not, they judged it absolutely impossible for him to escape them, though he should be ever so much on his guard. In what manner the king of Prussia became acquainted with this plan, is not known. His friends attributed it to his own penetration and knowledge of the stratagems of war; the Austrians, to intelligence given him by deserters. But, in whatever way he became acquainted with this design, it is certain that he took the most effectual methods of preventing it. As the Austrian plan was to surround his camp, and this could not be done without the division of their army which he had so long desired, he resolved to intercept one of the parties; and if that should be disabled from acting, he could then more easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> with the other two. Therefore, in the very evening calculated for the decisive attack on his camp, he quitted it with the utmost privacy, and took an advantageous post on the road through which General Laudohn was to pass. The nature of this post was such, that at the same time it stopped the progress of Laudohn in front, Daun would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> under great difficulties if he should attempt his rear; at the same time that, for his further security, the king strengthened the rear with several batteries. As soon as his army was drawn up, he divided it; leaving his right on the ground where it had been formed, to observe Marshal Daun, and to maintain that post; whilst with his left he turned in order to fall on the corps under General Laudohn. In the mean time, that commander, ignorant of the fate which was awaiting him, advanced with the utmost expedition towards the place which had been assigned him, in order to share in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of destroying the Prussian monarch; when, at three in the morning, on the 15th of August, a thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a> which covered the ground, suddenly clearing up, discovered, like the opening of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, the dreadful front of the Prussian army regularly embattled, and advantageously posted. Laudohn, though surprised, made the best dispositions that he could; and the Austrians, who had been engaged in these circumstances, would admit of, and an obstinate engagement ensued; in which, however, he was at last obliged Laudohn, to yield to the superior skill of his adversary, with the loss of 10,000 killed, wounded, and prisoners, 82 pieces of cannon, and 23 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of colours.\n\nThe victory, though complete, gave but a partial relief to the king of Prussia. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> service it did was the preventing of the Russians from joining those enemies which he already had. Count Czernin had been advancing with 24,000 men, and had even passed the Oder; but was so intimidated by this news, that he instantly repassed that river on the same bridges which he had lately built, even though M. Daun sent him a strong body of troops in order to encourage him to advance. Soon after this battle, the king joined his brother Prince Henry at New Marche; and marched against Daun, who had begun to form the blockade of Schweidnitz, fell upon a corps under General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BECK\">Beck</a>, made two battalions of Croats prisoners, and dispersed the rest, which obliged the enemy to abandon the enterprise they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> undertaken. About the same time, General Hulsen gained a considerable advantage over the Imperial army in Saxony, with very trifling losses on his part, by which he effectually prevented them from cutting off his communication with the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOR\">Tor</a>-gau.\n\nBy these successes the affairs of his Prussian majesty seemed to revive: but there was no end of his enemies. The late manoeuvres had drawn him so far into Silesia, that his communication with Brandenburg was almost wholly cut off. The Russian army, which after it had repassed the Oder began to move out of Silesia, sent forward a powerful detachment under Count Czernin towards the marche of Brandenburg. A body of 15,000 Austrians, under the generals Lacy and Brentano, and the whole united body of Austrians and Imperialists which acted in Saxony, began their march in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the Russians, and proposed to unite at the gates of Berlin. These armies amounted to 40,000 men. To oppose this formidable power, General Hulsen called to his assistance General Werner, who had been sent with a body of troops into Pomerania; but, after being joined by him, their united forces were found not to exceed 15,000 or 16,000 men. To attempt a defence of the capital with this force would have been little short of madness: and therefore these commanders were obliged to leave Berlin to its fate; Berlin, which indeed, considering the barbarity of the Russians and the animosity of the Austrians, seemed to be a dreadful one. However, by the powerful mediation of several foreign ministers, the town obtained terms which were not altogether intolerable; but the magazines, arsenals, and foundries were destroyed, and an immense quantity of military stores seized, with a number of cannon and other arms. The city was first obliged to pay 800,000 guilders, after which a contribution of 1,900,000 crowns was laid on: yet notwithstanding this, many violences were committed, and the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> was plundered and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> abused in a scandalous manner.\n\nThe combined armies laid in Berlin only four days; dreading the severe vengeance of the king of Prussia, who\nwho they heard was advancing towards that place with great expedition. But so great were the embarrassments which now attended that monarch, that it seemed almost beyond human power to retrieve his affairs. The Imperialists, on their return from Berlin, having no army to oppose them, made themselves masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, Torgau, Meissen, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITTENBERG\">Wittenberg</a>; in which last city they found the grand magazine of the Prussians immensely stored with provisions, ammunition, &c. M. Stainville also, with a detachment from Braglio the French general's army, laid the city and duchy of Halberstadt under contribution. In Eastern Pomerania, the Russians had besieged Colberg by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and land. In the Western Pomerania, the Swedes advanced with great celerity, hoping to share in the plunder of Berlin. In Silesia, the king, no sooner began his march to the northward, than Laudohn advanced, and laid siege to the important fortress of C\u00f6fel; and, to complete this distress and embarrassment, the king himself was attended at every step by Count Daun with a superior army well prepared to take every advantage.\n\nIn this desperate situation the king, being joined by his generals Hulsen and Prince Eugene of Wirtemberg with the corps under their command, advanced up the Elbe, while M. Daun fell back to cover Leipzig and Torgau, but the latter, finding that the Prussians directed their march towards the Elbe, encamped within reach of Torgau; one part of his army extending to the Elbe, by which he was covered on that side, whilst on the other he was covered by hills and woods, so that it was impossible to choose a more advantageous situation. The Prussian army did not amount to 50,000 men, whilst that of the Austrians exceeded 86,000; yet such were the unfortunate circumstances of the king, that he was obliged to fight under all these disadvantages; and therefore he caused his army to be informed, that he was now to lead them to a most desperate attempt, that his affairs required it, and that he was determined to conquer or die. His soldiers unanimously declared that they would die with him.\n\nThe 3d of November 1762 was the day on which this important affair was decided. The king divided his forces into three columns. General Hulsen was to take post with one in a wood that lay on the left of the Austrian army, and had orders not to move until he found the rest of the Prussians engaged. General Zieten was to charge on the right; and the great attack in front was to be conducted by the king in person. His forces were disposed in such a manner, that either his right or left must take the enemy in rear and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> them in, so as to disable them from undertaking anything against the part where he intended to effect his principal attack. On the other hand, M. Daun perceiving the king to be serious in his design of fighting, to prevent confusion, sent all his baggage over the Elbe, across which he threw three bridges in case a retreat should be necessary. At the same time he caused Torgau to be evacuated; and then, extending his first line to a village called Zinne on the left, he stretched it to another called Crofowitz on the right; supporting the right of his second line upon the Elbe. In this disposition he was found, when, about two o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, the king began his attack. He was received by the fire of 200 pieces of cannon, which were disposed along the Austrian front. The Prussians were thrice led on to the attack; but were every time repulsed and broken with terrible slaughter. The king at length commanded a fresh body of cavalry to advance, which at first compelled the Austrians to retire; but new reinforcements continually coming in, this cavalry was in its turn obliged to fall back, and the Prussians maintained themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulty, until General Zieten, with the right wing, attacked the enemy in the rear, repulsed them, and possessed himself of some eminences which commanded the whole Austrian army. Encouraged by this success, the Prussian infantry once more advanced, mastered several of the enemy's intrenchments, and made way for a new attack of their cavalry, which broke in with irresistible fury on the Austrians, and threw several bodies of them into irreparable disorder. It was now about 9 o'clock, and of consequence both armies were involved in thick darkness; yet the fire continued without intermission, and the battalions with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> rage discharged at one another without distinguishing friend from foe. M. Daun received a dangerous wound in the thigh, and was carried from the field, which probably hastened the defeat of his troops. The command then devolved on Count O'Donnell; who, finding the greatest part of his troops in disorder, the night advanced, and the enemy possessed of some eminences which commanded his camp, and from which it was in vain to think of driving them, ordered a retreat, which was conducted with wonderful order and exactness; none were lost in passing the bridges, and by far the greater part of their artillery was preserved. The loss of the Prussians was estimated at 10,000 killed and wounded, and 3,000 taken prisoners. That of the Austrians in killed and wounded is not known; but 8,000 were taken prisoners, with 216 officers, among whom were four generals.\n\nThe consequence of the victory of Torgau was, that the king recovered all Saxony except Dresden; and in any except the mean time General Werner having marched into Dresden Pomerania, the Russians raised the siege of Colberg, recovered, and retired into Poland, without having effected anything further than wasting the open country. Werner then flew to the assistance of Western Pomerania, where he defeated a body of Swedes, and at last drove them totally out of the country. General Laudohn too abruptly raised the blockade of C\u00f6fel; and afterwards, abandoning Landshut, he retired into the Austrian Silesia, leaving the Prussian part entirely in quiet. M. Daun placed one part of his army in Dresden, and the other in some strong posts which lie to the south and west of it, by which he commanded the Elbe, and preserved his communication with Bohemia. The army of the empire retired into Franconia, and placed its headquarters at Bamberg.\n\nThough these successes had, to appearance, retrieved the king's affairs in some measure, yet his strength seemed now to be wholly exhausted; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1761, he made no such vigorous efforts as he had formerly done. The Russians, dividing themselves into two bodies, invaded Silesia and Pomerania. In the former country they laid siege to Breslau, and in the latter to Colberg. Tottleben also, who had commanded the Russian armies, was now removed on a suspicion that he had corresponded with the king of Prussia, and General Romanow put in his place; by which it was expected...\nexpected that the Russian operations would be more brisk this year than formerly.\n\nThe king continued strongly encamped near Schweidnitz; where he was to closely watched by generals Daun and Laudohn, that he could attempt nothing. However, he defeated the designs of the Russians against Breslau, by sending General Platen to destroy their magazines; which he accomplished with great success, at the same time cutting off a body of 4000 of their troops. But this only brought the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-DIRE\">dire</a> destruction upon Colberg; to which place that body of Russians immediately marched, cruelly wasting the country as they went along. The king of Prussia could do nothing but fend detachments of small parties, which, though they could not oppose their enemies in the field, yet he hoped, by cutting off the convoys of the enemy, might distress them to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> as to oblige them to abandon the siege, or at least protract it till the severity of the winter should render it impossible for them to carry on their operations. Thus he weakened his own army so much, that it was found requisite to draw 4000 men out of Schweidnitz in order to reinforce it; and no sooner was this done, than General Laudohn suddenly attacked and took that fortress by a coup de main. Colberg made a brave defence; but the troops sent to its relief being totally unable to cope with the Russian army consisting of 50,000 men, it was obliged to surrender on the 3rd of December; and thus the fate of the Prussian monarch seemed to be decided, and almost every part of his dominions lay open to the invaders.\n\nIn the midst of these gloomy appearances the empress of Russia, the king's most inveterate and inflexible enemy, died on the 2nd of January 1762. Her successor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> III., instead of being the king's enemy, was his most sanguine friend. As early as the 23rd of February, in a memorial delivered to the ministers of the allied courts, he declared, that \"in order to the establishment of peace, he was ready to sacrifice all the conquests made in this war by the arms of Russia, in hopes that the allied courts will on their parts equally prefer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of peace and tranquillity, to the advantages which they might expect from the continuance of the war, but which they cannot obtain but by a continuance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of human blood.\"\u2014This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> was not so well relished by the allies; however, they were very willing to make peace, provided it was for their own interest; but they recommended to his attention fidelity to treaties, which constitutes a no less valuable part of the royal character, than humanity and disinterestedness. This answer made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CZAR\">czar</a>; a supposition of hostilities took place on the 16th of March, which was followed by a treaty of alliance on the 5th of May. In this treaty the czar stipulated nothing in favour of his former confederates; on the contrary, he agreed to join his troops to those of the king of Prussia, in order to act against them. Sweden, which had for a long time acted under the direction of Russian counsels, now followed the example of her mistress, and concluded a peace with Prussia on the 22nd of May.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that the king of Prussia would remain long inactive after such an unexpected turn in his favour. His arms were now everywhere attended with success. Prince Henry drove the Imperialists from some important posts in Saxony, by which he secured all that part which the Prussians possessed; and though the Austrians frequently attempted to recover these posts, they were constantly repulsed with great slaughter. The king was not joined by his new allies till the latter end of June; after which he drove M. Daun before him to the extremity of Silesia, leaving the town of Schweidnitz entirely uncovered, and which the king immediately prepared to invest. In the meantime, different detachments of Prussians, some on the side of Saxony, and others on that of Silesia, penetrated deep into Bohemia, laid many parts of the country under contribution, and spread an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>. A considerable body of Russian irregulars also made an irruption into Bohemia, where they practised on the Austrians the same cruelties which they had long been accustomed to practise on the Prussians.\n\nBut while the king was thus making the best use of his time, he was all at once threatened with a fatal revolution in the course of fortune by a new revolution in Russia. The Russian emperor was deposed, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> was soon after followed by his death. The empress, who succeeded him, suspected that her husband had been misled by the counsels of his Prussian majesty, against whom, therefore, she entertained a mortal enmity. She could not, however, in the very beginning of her reign, undertake again a war of so much importance as that which had been just concluded. She therefore declared her intention of observing the peace concluded by the late emperor; but, at the same time, of recalling her armies from Silesia, Prussia, and Pomerania; which indeed the unsettled state of the kingdom now made in some degree necessary. At the same time a discovery was made with regard to the king of Prussia himself, which turned the scale greatly in his favour. The Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, flaming with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> against this monarch, and against their late unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>; and the empress, full of suspicion that the conduct of the latter might have been influenced by the councils of the former, searched eagerly amongst the papers of the late emperor for an elucidation or proofs of this point. They found indeed many letters from the Prussian monarch, but in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> absolutely different from what they had expected. The king had, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> would permit, kept a reserve and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> with regard to the too rash advances of this unhappy ally; and, in particular, counselled him to undertake nothing against the empress's consort. The hearing of these letters read is said to have had such an effect upon the empress, that she burst into tears, and expressed her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> towards the Prussian monarch in the warmest terms. Still, however, the Russian army was ordered to separate from the Prussians; but all the important places which the former had taken during the whole war, were faithfully restored.\n\nThe king, finding that the Russians were no more to take an active part in his favour, resolved to profit by their appearance in his camp; and therefore, the very day after the order for their return had arrived, he attacked the Austrian army, and drove their right wing from some eminences and villages where they were advantageously posted; by which means he entirely cut off their communications with Schweidnitz, so that nothing could be attempted for its relief. Prince Henry kept them in continual alarms for Bohemia; and a\ngreat part of their attention, and no small part of their forces, were engaged on that side. Marshal Daun, now finding himself rendered almost incapable of undertaking any thing, detached General Laudohn, with a force very much superior, to attack the prince of B\u00e9vern, and drive him from the advantageous post he occupied. But the prince defended himself with such resolution, that all the efforts of Laudohn could not succeed before the king had time to come to his assistance. The Austrians, being then put between two fires, were routed and pursued with terrible slaughter; after which, the king met with no more disturbance in his preparations for the siege, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> were opened on the 18th of July. Marshal Daun made no attempts to relieve the place; but the garrison being very strong, it held out for near two months from the opening of the trenches. It is said that the attack was conducted, and the defence made, by two engineers who had written on the subject of the attack and defence of fortified places; and they were now practically engaged to prove the superiority of their systems. At last, however, the garrison, to the number of 8000 men, surrendered prisoners of war; and the whole body, except nine, were soon after drowned at the mouth of the Oder, on their passage to their intended confinement in K\u00f6nigsberg.\n\nThe king of Prussia, now become master of Schweidnitz, turned his attention towards Saxony, where he considerably reinforced his brother's army, and made preparations for laying siege to Dresden. In this country the Austrians had lately met with some success, and driven Prince Henry as far back as Freyberg; but on the 29th of October, they were attacked by the Prussian army thus reinforced, and totally routed. Great numbers were slain, and near 6000 taken prisoners. This victory proved decisive: and the empress-queen, finding herself deserted by all her allies, was glad to conclude a treaty; the substance of which was, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> restitution and oblivion should take place, and both parties sit down at the end of the war in the same situation in which they began it. This treaty is called the peace of Hubertusburg.\n\nThe war was no sooner concluded than the king of Prussia turned his attention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> policy, and the recovery of his dominions from those innumerable calamities which had befallen them during the war. He immediately distributed lands to his disbanded soldiers, and gave them the horses of his artillery to assist them in their cultivation. By his wise and prudent management, the horrors of war were soon forgotten; and the country was quickly in as flourishing a state as ever. Notwithstanding this pacific disposition, however, the king never slackened his endeavours for the defence of his country, by keeping a respectable army on foot; which might be able to act on the least emergency.\n\nIn the year 1778, a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> with the house of Austria took place, concerning the duchy of Bavaria. But though the most enormous warlike preparations were made on both sides, and immense armies brought into the field, nothing of consequence was effected. What little advantage there was, seems to have been on the Prussian side, since they made themselves masters of several towns, and kept the war in the enemy's country. However, the emperor acted with so much caution, and showed so much skill in a defensive war, that all the manoeuvres of his Prussian majesty could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> advantage; as, on the other hand, his adversary was too wise to venture an engagement. A peace therefore was very soon concluded, and since that time the history of Prussia, during the remainder of the great Frederic's reign, affords no remarkable event which we have not mentioned in the life of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, and in the article Poland. He left his crown to his nephew, whose great character was not then much developed; and it was easily seen that a new kingdom, which had risen suddenly to such unexampled power and greatness as to excite the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of all its neighbours, would require great abilities to preserve it from dismemberment.\n\nThe late king had indeed bequeathed the most effectual securities to his successor for the preservation of his dominions, that human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> could provide or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a>; by leaving him a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, the finest army in Europe, and a people enthusiastically attached to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> and government. The new monarch, with these advantages, was not wanting to himself. The late king's predilection for the French language and French literature were not grateful to his subjects. The present sovereign began his reign with declaring in council, \"Germans we are, and Germans I mean we shall continue;\" giving directions, at the same time, that their native language should resume its natural rank and station, from which for near half a century it had been degraded by the French. This was a very popular measure, and it was followed by another still more so. Observing that he had marked with great concern the progress of impiety and profaneness on the one hand, and of enthusiasm on the other, he declared, that he would not have his subjects corrupted either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FANATICS\">fanatics</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">atheists</a>, and strictly prohibited all publications tending to excite a contempt or indifference for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>.\n\nSuch, on his immediate accession to the throne, was the pacific conduct of the monarch, which endeared him to his subjects, and commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of all good men. An opportunity soon occurred, in which he was thought to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> such talents in negotiation and in military arrangements, as proclaimed him in every respect a worthy successor of his uncle. The States of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, who had long been jealous of Holland, the power of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADTHOLDER\">stadtholder</a>, and inclined to a republican government without any permanent chief, had gained such an ascendancy in the States general, that in 1786 and 1787 they in effect divested the Prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> of all his prerogatives, (see United Provinces.) They proceeded even to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a> of the princess, sister to the king of Prussia; and depending upon support from France, treated with insolence every power connected with them in Europe. The court of Berlin did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> these proceedings without indignation; and the king formed his plan for restoring the power of the stadtholder with such secrecy and prudence, that perhaps nothing could surpass it but the bravery and military skill of the duke of Brunswick, by whom it was carried into execution. In the short space of one month, that accomplished general led 18,000 Prussians to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, and restored the just prerogatives of the prince of Orange.\n\nThe affairs of Prussia during the early period of the French revolution, and the active but unsuccessful part which that monarch took against it, are interwoven with the\nthe historical details of that period under the articles of France and Britain, to which we refer our readers. For a number of years he acted the prudent part of standing clear of hostilities as much as possible; and when he did at last interfere, we find little in his conduct which is entitled to the praise either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> or honour. Indeed it may perhaps be admitted, that on many occasions he acted rather from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> than choice; and finding that a contest with France was both absurd and ruinous, he chose to sacrifice a less evil to a greater good. Whether by consent or compulsion is not certainly known, the king of Prussia ceded to France the duchies of Cleves and Berg, March 1806, which were to be governed by Prince <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURAT\">Murat</a>, the brother-in-law of Bonaparte, under the title of Joachim, duke of Cleves and Berg.\n\nThe king of Prussia likewise took possession of the Hanoverian states 30th October 1806, at the time when Great Britain had no reason to apprehend any such mysterious conduct from that quarter. He entered into a secret treaty with France for the purpose of shutting the northern ports; a measure which gave such offence to this country, that the British minister thought proper to take his leave of Berlin. At one period he came to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to make no separate treaty with the French government, and propose a treaty of peace and alliance between his court and that of Britain. To give this as much effect as possible, the Prussian princes of the blood began to raise volunteer regiments in Poland and Silesia, the loyalty of the peasantry in these countries far exceeding the most sanguine expectations.\n\nSo low, however, were the king of Prussia's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINANCES\">finances</a> at the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Hutchison's arrival at Memel, March 1807, that his lordship found it necessary to advance 80,000l. for the support of his family and domestic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>. This being intimated to the British ministers, his majesty recommended it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> to enable him to implement the agreement. Yet not long after this period he actually entered into a treaty of peace with the emperor of France, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of which his territories were so dreadfully mutilated, as to leave him little more of a sovereign than the name. He was required to renounce the whole of his dominions situated between the Rhine and the Elbe; the circle of Rothus, in Lower Lusatia; all the provinces which formerly constituted part of the kingdom of Poland; the city of Dantzig; and he was laid under the necessity of shutting all the ports and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> in his whole dominions against the trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of Great Britain. Not above 18 months <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to this treaty, the king of Prussia might have been said to hold the fate of Europe in his hands; but by means of it he was reduced to the very lowest rank among the powers of Europe. Had he taken a decided part against France before the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTERLITZ\">Austerlitz</a>, he might have been able to secure the independence of Europe; but, having suffered this auspicious moment to pass unimproved, the consequences were exactly such as might have been predicted, without any pretensions to uncommon sagacity.","sp":95,"ep":110},{"h":"PRYNNE","t":"WILLIAM, an English lawyer, much distinguished in the civil commotions under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. was born at Swainwick in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMERSETSHIRE\">Somersetshire</a> in 1600.

His first pretence was that of being a sufferer for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. He procured a certificate that he was of Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, that he left that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> for the sake of the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and was going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIMAGE\">pilgrimage</a> to Rome. Being unable to purchase a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIM\">pilgrim</a>'s garb, and observing one in a chapel, dedicated to a miraculous saint, which had been set up as a monument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> by some wandering pilgrim, he contrived to take both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> and cloak away; and, being thus accoutred, begged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in fluent Latin, accosting only clergymen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; whom he found so generous and credulous, that, before he had gone 20 miles, he might easily have saved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and put himself in a much better dress; but as soon as he had got what he thought was sufficient, he begged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more; but viewed every thing worth seeing, and then retired to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">inn</a>, where he spent his money as freely as he had obtained it. Having heard the Jesuits speak much of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, he started the wild scheme, when he was in Germany, of passing for a native of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Formosa; and what he wanted in knowledge, he supplied by a pregnant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>.

At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTTERDAM\">Rotterdam</a>, some persons having put firewood questions to him, that carried the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of doubt, he took one more whimsical step, which was to live upon raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, roots, and herbs; which strange food he thought would remove all scruples. The bishop of London patronized him with credulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>; and Philomannazar found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> circle of friends, who extolled him as a prodigy.

They feed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> wax, and for food enter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>-hives; where they boldly engage the bees, and are not to be prevented by them from feeding, though at the expense of their habitations and the cells of their reservoirs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>; so that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> uncommon thing for a swarm of bees to be forced to change their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of habitation, and make new combs elsewhere; leaving the old ones to this contemptible victor, whom they know not how to drive out or dispel.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, and all the authors who have written on bees, have complained of this destructive animal. It never eats the honey, but feeds only on the wax; attacking principally those waxy cells where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> bee deposits her eggs for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> progeny.\n\nThe bees, who are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for most other creatures by means of their stings, would easily destroy these weak creatures, were it not for the impervious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMOUR\">armour</a> they were covered with. They form themselves a coat of armour of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. The first, which immediately covers the body, is of a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>; and the outer covering over this is of the bees-wax: this is laid considerably thick; and the creature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> thrusting out its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to feed, goes on devouring the cells undisturbed, while a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of the inhabitants are in vain buzzing about him, and attempting to pierce him with their stings. He never forsakes his covering, but lengthens and enlarges it as he goes; and gnawing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the sides of the cells in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, without staying to eat them one by one, the havoc and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> he occasions are scarcely to be conceived. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the change of this creature approaches, it contracts its body within its double covering, and there changes into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NYMPH\">nymph</a> state; whence, after a proper time, it comes forth in form of a moth, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> horns and a crooked proboscis.\n\nThe bees have cunning enough to know their destructive enemy in this new form; and as this is a weak and defenceless state, they attack and destroy all the moths of this species they meet with. They seldom are so fortunate, however, as to kill the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> as soon as produced; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> only one escapes, it is able to lay a foundation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of its brethren. All the flies of the moth kind lay a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of eggs, and this is behind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> with none of them in that particular: the young ones produced from the eggs of one surviving female of this species are sufficient to destroy many honey-combs; nay, many hives of them. The moth produced by this caterpillar flies but little; yet it is very nimble in avoiding danger, by running, which it does with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> swiftness.\n\nThere is a species of these pseudo-tinea, or wax-eating caterpillars, which infest the subterraneous hives of wasps and other creatures which make wax: the manner of living, feeding, and defending themselves from their enemies, is the same in all the species. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, if they are at any time distressed for food, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> eat their own dung; the wax having passed almost unaltered through their bodies, and being still wax, and capable of affording them more nourishment on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> digestion. These species, though they naturally live on this soft food, yet if by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> they meet with harder only, they know how to live upon it; and can eat a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into the covers and leaves of books, and make themselves cases and coverings of the fragments of these substances. The accurate author of these observations describes also a kind of pseudo-tinea which feeds on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, and another that eats <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>; both making themselves houses of all the materials they feed on.\n\nThere is also another kind very destructive to corn: these make themselves a covering by fastening together a great number of the grains, and there living and eating in secret. All these creatures, whatever be their food or habitation, finally become phalenes, or moths; and may be distinguished, even in this state, from the other species, by having granulated horns of a remarkable structure, and all of them a proboscis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, more or less incurved.","sp":113,"ep":113},{"h":"PSEUDONYMUS","t":"among critics, an author who publishes a book under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> feigned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>; as cryp-\nonymus is given to him who publishes one under a disguised name, and anonymous to him who publishes without any name at all.\n\nPSIDium, the guava; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the iocandra clas, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> ranking under the 19th order, Hesperidace.

There are different persons who know how to fascinate these animals; and they again never meddle with serpents.\n3. Those that fascinate serpents, eat them both raw and boiled, and even make broth of them, which they eat very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> amongst them; but in particular, they eat such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> when they go out to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> them. I have been told, that serpents fried or boiled are frequently eaten by the Arabians both in Egypt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, though they know not how to fascinate them, but catch them either alive or dead.\n4. After they have eaten their soup, they procure a blessing from their sheikhs (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> or lawyer), who uses some superstitious ceremonies, and amongst others, spits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> them several times with certain gestures. This manner of getting a blessing from the priest is pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, and certainly cannot in the least help to fascinate serpents; but they believe, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> at least persuade others, that the power of fascinating serpents depends upon this circumstance.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this testimony of Haffelquift, the story of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCANTATION\">incantation</a> of serpents, though frequently alluded to in Scripture, has been generally treated as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>. It is, however, affirmed as a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, both by Mr Brute and M. Savary. \"There is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt (says the former of these travellers) of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>. The Scriptures are full of it. All that have been in Egypt have seen as many different instances as they chose. Some have doubted that it was a trick; and that the animals thus handled had been first trained, and then deprived of their power of hurting; and fond of the discovery, they have settled themselves upon it, without experiment, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of all antiquity.\" But I will not hesitate to aver, that I have seen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> (and this may be seen daily without any trouble or expense), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who came from the catacombs, where the pits of the mummy birds are kept, who has taken a cobra with his naked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of others lying at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of a tub, has put it upon his bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, covered it with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> he wears, then taken it out, put it in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, and tied it about his neck like a necklace; after which it has been applied to a hen, and bit it, which died in a few minutes;\nand, to complete the experiment, the man has taken it by the neck, and beginning at his tail, has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> it as one would do a carrot or stock of celery, without any seeming repugnance.\n\n\"We know from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, that where any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> has been remarkably infested with serpents, there the people have been screened by this secret.\n\n\"To leave ancient history, I can myself vouch, that all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> people in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Senaar, whether Funge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBA\">Nuba</a>, are perfectly armed against the bite of either scorpion or viper. They take the ceraflies in their hands at all times, put them in their bosoms, and throw them to one another as children do apples or balls, without having irritated them by this usage so much as to bite. The Arabs have not this secret naturally, but from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> they acquire an exemption from the mortal consequences attending the bite of these animals, by chewing a certain root, and washing themselves (it is not anointing) with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.\"\n\nFrom this account we should be apt to think, that these vipers really would not bite any who were thus armed against their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>; especially as he adds, that he \"constantly observed, that the viper, however lively before, upon being seized by any of these barbarians, seemed as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> taken with sicknesses and feebleness, frequently shut his eyes, and never turned his mouth towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of the person who held him.\" Yet in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the ceraflies, he says, \"I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one of them at Cairo, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Julian and Rofa, crawl up the side of a box in which there were many, and there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> still, as if hiding himself, till one of the people who brought them to us came near him; and though in a very disadvantageous posture, sticking as it were perpendicularly to the side of the box, he leaped near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of three feet, and fastened between the man's forefinger and thumb, so as to bring the blood. The fellow showed no signs of either pain or fear, and even kept him with us full four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, without his applying any sort of remedy, or seeming inclined to do so.\"\n\nIt is difficult to see how these two accounts can be reconciled. If those who catch vipers are in danger of being bit by them after they are catched, certainly they must be so before, and then the whole relation becomes contradictory. Our author tells us, that these feats were performed for a season, by those who were artificially armed against the viper's poison, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as those who had the exemption naturally; but though put in possession of the drugs, he never had the courage to make the experiment. That he should have made such a dreadful experiment on himself, no person in his senses would expect; but it is indeed very surprising, that he did not attempt by means of these medicines to arm some of the brute creatures, of the lives of which he was sufficiently prodigal, against the effects of that deadly poison by which so many of them perished. As surprising it is, that he did not try what effect the root or its decoction would have upon the serpents themselves; or that, though he says he had a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> root by him, he gave neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it.\n\nThough it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to reconcile the particulars of this account to one another, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> fact of the incantation is confirmed by the testimony of M. Savary.\n\nThis writer tells us, that he saw at the feast of Sidi Ibrahim, a troop of people, seemingly possessed, with naked arms and a fierce look, holding in their hands enormous serpents, which twined round their body, and endeavoured to escape. These Piylli, grasping them strongly by the neck, avoided the bite; and notwithstanding their hissing, tore them with their teeth, and ate them alive, while the blood streamed from their mouth.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PTARMIGAN\">PTARMIGAN</a>.

The root of this is acid, nauseous, and bitterish; and like all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the fern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, mucilaginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. It creeps under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> in some rich soils to the depth of five or six feet, and is very difficult to be destroyed. Frequent mowing in pasture-grounds, plentiful dunging in arable lands, but, above all, pouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> upon it, are the most approved methods of killing it. It has, however, many good qualities to counterbalance the few bad ones. Fern cut while green, and left to rot upon the ground, is a good improver of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> burnt, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> yield the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of salt that most other vegetables will. Fern is also an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> for potatoes; for if buried beneath their roots, it never fails to produce a good crop.\u2014Its astringency is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, that it is used in many places abroad in dressing and preparing kid and chamois <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>.\u2014In several places in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, the inhabitants mow it green, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> it to ashes, make those ashes up into balls, with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which they dry in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> with instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>. In many of the Western Isles the people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a very considerable profit from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of the ashes to soap and glaze makers. In Glen Elg in Invernessshire, and other places, the people thatch their housetops with the stalks of this fern, and flatten them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> made either of birch-bark or heath. Sometimes they use the whole plant for the same purpose, but that does not make so durable a covering. Swine are fond of the roots, especially if boiled in their wash. In some parts of Normandy we read that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> have been reduced to the miserable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of mixing them with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>.

According to the different animals whose eggs they are hatched from, these are of different form and structure. Some are hexapodes, or endowed with six feet; these belong to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEETLE\">beetle</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, and finally change into beetles like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> animal from whose eggs they sprung. Others have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> legs, and are produced from the eggs of flies of various kinds. And, finally, others are genuine caterpillars, though small; but these are the most rare of all.\n\nThe two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> kinds are the hexapodes, or beetle-worms; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APODES\">apodes</a>, or fly-worms. The fly which gives origin to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> of these is a four-winged one; and takes care always to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> her eggs in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where there are plenty of the pulices, usually on the stalk or young branches of a tree in the midst of large families of them. The worm, as soon as hatched, finds itself in the midst of abundance of food, preying at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> on these animals, which are wholly defenceless. The stalks of the elder and woodbine are frequently found covered over with these pulices; and among them there may usually be found one or more of these destroyers feeding at will, sucking in the juices from their bodies, and then throwing away the dry skins. Besides the worms of this four-winged fly, there is one of a two-winged wasp-fly, very destructive of these animals.","sp":118,"ep":118},{"h":"PULLEY","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">Mechanics</a>, one of the five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL_POWERS\"><a class=\"xref\" h</a>ref=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> powers.

This led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>, that the inhabitants of Pulo-Condore were originally Cochin Chinese, who fled from their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to one of its sovereigns who had been dethroned by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his own subjects.\n\nHere the squadron was to purchase <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and the people promised to have the proposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> in readiness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible, at the appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, a party of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> went from the Hindoostan to a small island near Pulo-Condore; but being apprehensive of an approaching storm, they made towards the ship with all convenient speed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> again becoming favourable, they set off for the island again, and were astonished, on their arrival, to find it wholly abandoned. In the principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABIN\">cabin</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> was found, written in the Chinese language, expressing their terror at the arrival of such great ships and powerful persons; not being able to satisfy their demands as to cattle and other provisions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> inhabitants of Pulo-Condore having scarcely any to supply, they therefore fled to preserve their lives; declared themselves to be few in number, and very poor, but honest; and concluded with requesting the great people to have pity on them, as they had left their all behind, and earnestly implored them not to burn their cabins.\n\nThe generous English left them animadversion that they called merely for refreshment on fair and equitable terms, without harbouring against them any evil designs. They claimed a connection to a civilized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, actuated by principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, by which they were prohibited from plundering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> doing injury to others, who might have the misfortune to be fewer or weaker than themselves. No doubt the poor terrified inhabitants would be agreeably surprized to find, on their return, not only that all their tents were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> safety, but that nothing was either disturbed or removed, and a small present left to their chief in the principal dwelling.\n\nPULO-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINGEN\">Lingen</a>, another island of the cluster mentioned above, is of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, though inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> to Pulo Condore. It is chiefly remarkable for a mountain in its centre, terminating in a fork like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a>, but denominated by mariners the ass's ears. The people of Lord Macartney's squadron were constantly discovering new islands, many of which were clothed with verdure; some had lofty trees growing upon them; others were nothing but naked rocks, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of innumerable birds, and whitened with their dung.\n\nPULO PENANG.

When quickness and greatness are joined together, it becomes violent; and when it is little and slow it is called a weak pulse. They are also said to be frequent and rare, equal and unequal; but these are not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> affections of motion. Frequency and quickness are often confounded with each other. A pulse is said to be hard or soft, with regard to the artery, according as it is tense, remitted, and hard, or flaccid, soft, and lax: for the disposition of the arteries contributes greatly to the change of the pulse; wherefore it sometimes happens, that the pulse in both arms is not alike, which is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in a hemiplegia. Add to these a convulsive pulse, which does not proceed from the blood, but from the state of the artery; and is known by a tremulous tubular motion, and the artery seems to be drawn upwards: this, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> fevers, is the sign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and is said to be the pulse in dying persons, which is likewise generally unequal and intermittent. A great pulse shows a more copious afflux of the blood to the heart, and from thence into the arteries: a little pulse the contrary.\n\nThe pulses of persons differ according to the largeness of the heart and vessels, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and temper of the blood, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>; as also with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, season, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, motion, food, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, watchings, and passions of the mind. The pulse is larger and more quick in men than in women; in the bilious and sanguineo-bilious, than in the phlegmatic and melancholic. Those who are lean, with tense fibres, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessels, have a greater and a stronger pulse, than those that are obese, with lax fibres and small vessels; whence they are more healthy, robust, and apt for labour. In children, the pulse is quick and soft; in adults greater and more violent. In the old, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> great, hard, and slow. Labour, motion, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the body, increase the circulation of the blood, the excretions, and particularly respiration; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> renders the circulation slow and weak; intense speaking increases the circulation, and consequently renders the pulse large and quick. In watching, the pulse is more evident; in sleep, more slow and languid. After drinking hot things, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, or hot bath-waters, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as after meals, the pulse vibrates more quick. But nothing produces a greater change in the pulse than affections of the mind: in terror, it is unequal, small, and contracted; in joy, frequent and great; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, quick and hard; in sadness, flow, small, deep, and weak; and in intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, languid and weak.

But when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> is dense, humid, rainy, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> south wind; as also where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> is sedentary, the sleep long, and the season autumnal, the pulse is languid and small, and the perspiration decreased. In May it is great, and sometimes violent; in the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, quick but weak; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, slow, soft, and weak; in the winter, hard and great. A drastic purge and an emetic render the pulse hard, quick, and weak, with loss of strength; chalybeates, and the bark, render it great and robust, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> lively; volatiles amplify and increase the pulse; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> and nitrous remedies refrigerate the body, and appease the pulse; opiates and the like render it small and weak, and decrease the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> of the folds; and potions render it small, contracted, and hard.

It was a wheel turned by an ass, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> round, not a string of earthen pots, but a string of wigs of hay, which it drew through a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>. This rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a>-pump was in frequent use for watering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> fields. It is highly probable that it is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> antiquity, although we do not recollect its being mentioned by any of the Greek or Roman writers. The Arabs and Indians were nothing less than innovators; and we may suppose with great safety, that what arts we now find among them they possessed in very remote periods.\n\nNow the step from this to the pump is but short, though it is nice and refined; and the forcing pump of Ctesibius is the closest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>.\n\nLet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> (fig. 1.) be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the water in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>, and D the height where it is to be delivered. Let DC be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> wooden trunk, reaching as deep under water as possible. Let the rope EF be fitted with its knot of hay F. When it is drawn up through the trunk, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> bring up along with it all the water lying between C and A, which will begin to run out by the spout D as soon as the knot gets to G, as far below D as C is below A. All this is very obvious; and it required but little reflection to be assured, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> F was let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> again, or pushed down, by a rod instead of a rope, it would again perform the same office. Here is a very simple pump. And if it was ever put in practice, it behoved to show the supporting power of the atmosphere, because the water would not only be lifted by the knot, but would even follow it. The imperfection of this pump behoved to appear at first sight, and to suggest its remedy. By pushing down the knot F, which we shall henceforth call the piston, all the force expended in lifting up the water between A and G is thrown away, because it is again let down. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> G, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, would prevent this. But then there must be a passage made for the water by a lateral tube KBD (fig. 2.). And if this be also furnished with a valve H, to prevent its losing the water, we have the pump of Ctesibius, as sketched in fig. 2. The valve is the great refinement; but perhaps even this had made its appearance before in the noria. For, in the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> kinds of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>, the pots have a stop or valve in their bottom, which hangs open while the pot descends with its mouth downwards, and then allows it to fill readily in the cistern; whereas, without the valve, it would occasion a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> load to the wheel. If we suppose that the valve had made its appearance so early, it is not improbable that the common pump sketchedin fig. 3., was as old as that of Ctesibius. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> we shall first give a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> varieties of these engines, considering them in their simplest form, and we shall explain in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> terms their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of operation. We shall then give a concise and popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of their operation, furnishing principles to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> us in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; and we shall conclude with the description of a few peculiarities which may contribute to their improvement or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\nThere are but two sorts of pumps which essentially differ; and all the varieties that we see are only modifications of these. One of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> pumps has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> piston; the other has a piston with a perforation and a valve. We usually call the first a FORCING PUMP, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> a LIFTING OR SUCKING PUMP.\n\nFig. 2. is a sketch of the forcing pump in its most Forcing simple form and situation. It consists of a hollow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> AC, called the WORKING <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">BARREL</a>, open at both ends, and having a valve G at the bottom, opening upwards. This cylinder is filled by a solid piston EF, covered externally with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> or tow, by which means it fits the box of the cylinder exactly, and allows <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> water to escape by its sides. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> KHD, which communicates laterally with this cylinder, and has a valve at some convenient place H, as near as possible to its junction with the cylinder. This valve also opens upwards. This pipe, usually called the RISING PIPE, or MAIN, terminates at the place D, where the water must be delivered.\n\nNow suppose this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> set into the water, so that the upper end of the cylinder may be under or even operation with the surface of the water AB; the water will open the valve G, and after filling the barrel and lateral pipe, will also open the valve H, and at last stand at an equal height within and without. Now let the piston be put in at the top of the working barrel, and thrust down to K. It will push the water before it. This will shut the valve G, and the water will make its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> through the valve H, and fill a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> Bb of the rising pipe, equal to the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the working barrel. When this downward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the piston ceases, the valve H will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> down by its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and shut this passage. Now let the piston be drawn up again: The valve H hinders the water in the rising pipe from returning into the working barrel. But now the valve G is opened by the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> water, and the water enters and fills the cylinder as the piston rises. When the piston has got to the top, let it be thrust down again: The valve G will again be shut, and the water will be forced through the passage at H, and rise along the main, pushing before it the water already there, and will now have its surface at L. Repeating this operation, the water must at last arrive at D, however...\never remote, and the next stroke would raise it to \\( e \\); so that during the next rise of the piston the water in \\( eD \\) will be running off by the spout.\n\nThe effect is the same whatever be the position of the working barrel, provided only that it be under water. It may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> horizontally or sloping, or it may be with its mouth and piston rod underwater. It is still the same forcing pump, and operates in the same manner and by the same means, viz. the pressure of the surrounding water.\n\nThe external force which must be applied to produce this effect is opposed by the pressure exerted by the water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the piston. It is evident, from the common laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>, that this opposing pressure is equal to the weight of a pillar of water, having the face of the piston for its base, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height \\( dA \\) of the place of delivery above the surface of the water \\( AB \\) in the cistern for its height. The form and dimensions of the rising pipe are indifferent in this respect, because heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> press only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of their perpendicular height. Observe that it is not \\( dF \\), but \\( dA \\), which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> this pressure, which the moving force must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> and surmount. The whole pressure on the under surface \\( Ff \\) of the piston is indeed equal to the weight of the pillar \\( dFf \\); but part of this is balanced by the water \\( AFfa \\). If indeed the water does not get into the upper part of the working barrel, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a> does not obtain. While we draw up the piston, this pressure is removed, because all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is cut off by the valve \\( H \\), which now bears the whole pressure of the water in the main. Nay, the ascent of the piston is even assisted by the pressure of the surrounding water. It is only during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of the piston therefore that the external force is necessary.\n\nObserve that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> now given of the external force is only what is necessary for balancing the pressure of the water in the rising pipe. But in order that the pump may perform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, it must surmount this pressure, and cause the water to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> at \\( D \\) with such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> that the required <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of water may be delivered in a given time. This requires force, even although there were no opposing pressure; which would be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> if the main were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>. The water fills it, but it is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. In order that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLON\">gallon</a>, for instance, may be delivered in a second, the whole water in the horizontal main must be put in motion with a certain velocity. This requires force. We must therefore always distinguish between the state of equilibrium and the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> working. It is the equilibrium only that we consider at present; and no more is necessary for understanding the operation of the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of pumps. The other force is of much more intricate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, and will be considered by itself.\n\nThe simplest form and situation of the lifting pump is represented by the sketch fig. 3. The pump is immersed in the cistern till both the valve \\( G \\) and piston \\( F \\) are under the surface \\( AB \\) of the surrounding water. By this means the water enters the pump, opening both valves, and finally stands on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> within and without.\n\nNow draw up the piston to the surface \\( A \\). It must lift up the water which is above it (because the valve in the piston remains shut by its own weight); so that its surface will now be at \\( a \\), \\( <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">Aa</a> \\) being made equal to \\( AF \\). In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the pressure of the surrounding water forces it into the working barrel, through the valve \\( G \\); and the barrel is now filled with water. Now, let the piston be pushed down again; the valve \\( G \\) immediately shuts by its own weight, and in opposition to the endeavours which the water in the barrel makes to escape this way. This attempt to compress the water in the barrel causes it to open the valve \\( F \\) in the piston; or rather, this valve yields to our endeavour to push the piston down through the water in the working barrel. By this means we get the piston to the bottom of the barrel; and it has now above it the whole pillar of water reaching to the height \\( a \\). Drawing up the piston to the surface \\( A \\) a second time, must lift this double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> along with it, and its surface now will be at \\( b \\). The piston may again be thrust down through the water in the barrel, and again drawn up to the surface; which will raise the water to \\( c \\). Another repetition will raise it to \\( d \\); and it will now show itself at the intended place of delivery. Another repetition will raise it to \\( e \\); and while the piston is now descending to make another stroke, the water in \\( ed \\) will be running off through the spout \\( D \\); and thus a stream will be produced, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> continual, but very unequal. This is inconvenient in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; thus, in a pump for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> uses, such a hobbling stream would make it very troublesome to fill a bucket. It is therefore usual to terminate the main by a cistern \\( LMNO \\), and to make the spout small. By this means the water brought up by the successive strokes of the piston rises to such a height in this cistern, as to produce an efflux by the spout nearly equable. The smaller we make the spout \\( D \\) the more equable will be the stream; for when the piston brings up more water than can be discharged during its descent, some of it remains in the cistern. This, added to the supply of next stroke, makes the water rise higher in the cistern than it did by the preceding stroke. This will cause the efflux to be quicker during the descent of the piston, but perhaps not yet sufficiently quick to discharge the whole supply. It therefore rises higher next stroke; and at last it rises so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, that the increased velocity of efflux makes the discharge precisely balance the supply. Now, the quantity supplied in each stroke is the same, and occupies the same room in the cistern at top; and the surface will sink the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inches during the descent of the piston, whether that surface has been high or low at the beginning. But because the velocities of the efflux are as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> roots of the heights of the water above the spout, it is evident that a fink of two or three inches will make a smaller change in the velocity of efflux when this height and velocity are great. This seems but a trifling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; but it serves to illustrate a thing to be considered afterwards, which is important and arbitrary, but perfectly similar to this.\n\nIt is evident, that the force necessary for this operation must be equal to the weight of the pillar of water \\( dAaD \\), if the pipe be perpendicular. If the pump be standing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALOOF\">aloof</a>, the pressure which is to be balanced is still equal to the weight of a pillar of water of this perpendicular height, and having the surface of the piston for its base.\n\nSuch is the simplest, and, we may add, by far the best, form of the forcing and lifting pumps; but it is not the most usual. Circumstances of convenience, economy, and more frequently of fancy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, have caused the pump-makers to deviate greatly from this form. It is not usual to have the working barrel in\nPump.\n\nthe water; this, especially in deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, makes it difficult access for repairs, and requires long piston rods. This would not do in a forcing pump, because they would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a>.\n\nWe have supposed, in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the lifting pump, that the rise of the piston always terminated at the surface of the water in the cistern. This we did in order that the barrel might always be filled by the pressure of the surrounding water. But let us suppose that the rise of the piston does not end here, and that it is gradually drawn up to the very top; it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the pressure of the atmosphere is by this means taken off from the water in the pipe (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>), while it remains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> on the water of the cistern. It will therefore cause the water to follow the piston as it rises through the pipe, and it will raise it in this way 33 feet at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a>. If, therefore, the spout D is not more than 33 feet above the surface of the water in the cistern, the pipe will be full of water when the piston is at D. Let it be pushed down to the bottom; the water will remain in the pipe, because the valve G will shut; and thus we may give the piston a stroke of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> not exceeding 33 feet. If we raise it higher than this, the water will not follow; but it will remain in the pipe, to be lifted by the piston, after it has been pushed down through it to the bottom.\n\nBut it is not necessary, and would be very inconvenient, to give the piston too long a stroke. The great use of a pump is to render effectual the reciprocation of a short stroke which we can command, while such a long stroke is generally out of our power. Suppose that the piston is pushed down only to b; it will then have a column b f' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on it, and it will lift this column when again drawn up. And this operation may be repeated like the former, when the piston was always under water; for the pressure of the atmosphere will always cause the water to follow the piston to the height of 33 feet.\n\nNor is it necessary that the fixed valve G be placed at the lower orifice of the pipe, nor even under water. For, while things are in the state now described, the piston drawn up to f, and the whole pipe full of water; if we suppose another valve placed at b above the surface of the cistern, this valve can do no harm. Now let the piston descend, both valves G and b will shut. G may now be removed, and the water will remain supported in the space b G by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and now the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> motions of the piston will produce the same effect as before.\n\nWe found in the former case that the piston was carrying a load equal to the weight of a pillar of water of the height <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, because the surrounding water could only support it at its own level. Let us see what change is produced by the affluence of the pressure of the atmosphere. Let the under surface of the piston be at b; when the piston was at f, 33 feet above the surface of the cistern, the water was raised to that height by the pressure of the atmosphere. Suppose a partition made at b by a thin plate, and all the water above it taken away. Now pierce a hole in this plate. The pressure of the atmosphere was able to carry the whole column f a. Part of this column is now removed, and the remainder is not a balance for the air's pressure. This will therefore cause the water to spout up through this hole and rise to f. Therefore the under surface of this plate is pressed up by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> water with a force equal to the weight of that pillar of water which it formerly supported; that is, with a force equal to the weight of the pillar f b. Now the under surface of the piston, when at b, is in the same situation. It is pressed upwards by the water below it, with a force equal to the weight of the column f b; But it is pressed downwards by the whole pressure of the atmosphere, which presses on all bodies; that is, with the weight of the pillar f a. On the whole, therefore, it is pressed downwards by a force equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the weights of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> f a and f b; that is, by a force equal to the weight of the pillar b a.\n\nIt may be conceived better perhaps in this way. When the piston was under the surface of the water in the cistern, it was equally pressed on both sides, both by the water and atmosphere. The atmosphere exerted its pressure on it by the intervention of the water; which being, to all senses, a perfect fluid, propagates every external pressure undiminished. When the piston is drawn up above the surface of the pit-water, the atmosphere continues to press on its upper surface with its whole weight, through the intervention of the water which lies above it; and its pressure must therefore be added to that of the incumbent water. It also continues to press on the under surface of the piston by the intervention of the water; that is, it presses this water to the piston. But, in doing this, it carries the weight of this water which it is pressing on the piston. The pressure on the piston therefore is only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of the whole pressure of the atmosphere above the weight of the column of water which it is supporting. Therefore the difference of atmospheric pressure on the upper and under surfaces of the piston is precisely equal to the weight of the column of water supported in the pipe by the air. It is not, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> weight of this column that loads the piston; it is the part of the pressure of the atmosphere on its upper surface, which is not balanced by its pressure on the under surface.\n\nIn attempting, therefore, to draw up the piston, we have to surmount this unbalanced part of the pressure of the atmosphere, and also the weight of the water which lies above the piston, and must be lifted by it; and thus the whole opposing pressure is the same as before, namely, the weight of the whole vertical pillar reaching from the surface of the water in the cistern to the place of delivery. Part of this weight is immediately carried by the pressure of the atmosphere; but, in lieu of it, there is an equal part of this pressure of the atmosphere, abstracted from the under surface of the piston, while its upper surface sustains its whole pressure.\n\nSo far, then, these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the pump agree. Other circumstances there are some circumstances not very obvious which must be attended to, in order that the pump may deliver any water at the spout D. This requires, therefore, a serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>.\n\nLet the fixed valve G (fig. 4) be supposed at the surface of the cistern water. Let M m be the lowest, and N n the highest positions of the piston, and let HA = h be the height of a column of water equiponderant with the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the pump is filled, not with water, but with air, and the piston is in its lowest position, and all in equilibrium, the internal air has the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> and\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> with the external. The space $MAam$, therefore, contains air of the common density and elasticity. These may be measured by $h$, or the weight of a column of water whose height is $h$. Now, let the piston be drawn up to $Nn$. The air which occupied the space $MAam$ now occupies the space $NAan$, and its density is now $\\frac{MAam}{NAan}$. Its elasticity is now diminished, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to its density (see Pneumatics), and no longer balances the pressure of the atmosphere. The valve $G$ will therefore be forced up by the water, which will rise to some height $SA$. Now let the piston again descend to $Mm$. It cannot do this with its valve shut; for when it comes down so far as to reduce the air again to its common density, it is not yet at $M$, because the space below it has been diminished by the water which got into the pipe, and is retained there by the valve $G$. The piston valve, therefore, opens by the air which we thus attempt to compress, and the superfluous air escapes. When the piston has got to $M$, the air is again of the common density, and occupies the space $MSsm$. Now draw the piston up to $N$. This air will expand into the space $NSsn$, and its density will be reduced to $\\frac{MSsm}{NSsn}$, and its elasticity will no longer balance the pressure of the atmosphere, and more water will enter, and it will rise higher. This will go on continually. But it may happen that the water will never rise so high as to reach the piston, even though not 33 feet above the water in the cistern: For the successive diminutions of density and elasticity are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of quantities that decrease geometrically, and therefore will have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>. Let us see what determines this limit.\n\nAt whatever height the water stands in the lower part of the pipe, the weight of the column of water $SAas$, together with the remaining elasticity of the air above it, exactly balances the pressure of the atmosphere (see Pneumatics, No. 198.). Now the elasticity of the air in the space $NSsn$ is equal to $h \\times \\frac{MSsm}{NSsn}$. Therefore, in the case where the limit obtains, and the water rises no farther, we must have $h = AS + h \\times \\frac{MSsm}{NSsn}$, or, because the column is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> throughout, $h = AS + h \\times \\frac{MS}{NS}$, and $\\frac{MS}{NS} = h - AS = HS$, and $NS : MS = HA : HS$, and $NS - MS : NS = HA - HS : HA$, or $NM : NS = AS : AH$, and $NM \\times AH = NS \\times AS$. Therefore, if $AN$, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the piston in its highest position from the water in the cistern, and $NM$ the length of its stroke, be given, there is a certain determined height $AS$ to which the water can be raised by the pressure of the air: For $AH$ is a constant quantity; and therefore when $MN$ is given, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> $AS \\times SN$ is given. If this height $AS$ be less than that of the piston in its lowest position, the pump will raise no water, although $AN$ may be less than $AH$. Yet the same pump will raise water very effectually, if it be first of all filled with water; and we have seen professional engineers much puzzled by this capricious failure of their pumps. A little knowledge of the principles would have prevented their disappointment.\n\nTo insure the delivery of water by the pump, the stroke must be such that the rectangle $MN \\times AH$ may be greater than any rectangle that can be made of the parts of $AN$, that is, greater than the square of half $AN$. Or, if the length of the stroke be already fixed Mode by other circumstances, which is a common case, we must deliver of make $AN$ so short that the square of its half, measured water in feet, shall be less than 33 times the stroke of the piston.\n\nSuppose that the fixed valve, instead of being at the surface of the water in the cistern, is at $S$, or anywhere between $S$ and $A$, the performance of the pump will be the same as before: But if it be placed anywhere above $S$, it will be very different. Let it be at $T$. It is plain that when the piston is pulled down from $N$ to $M$, the valve at $T$ prevents any air from getting down; and therefore, when the piston is drawn up again, the air contained in the space $MTim$ will expand into the space $NTin$, and its density will be $\\frac{MT}{NT}$. This is less than $\\frac{MS}{NS}$, which expresses the density of the air which was left in the space $TSst$ by the former operations.\u2014The air, therefore, in $TSst$ will also expand, will open the valve, and now the water will rise above $S$. The proportion of $NS$ to $NT$ may evidently be such that the water will even get above the valve $T$. This diminishes the space $NTin$; and therefore, when the piston has been pulled down to $M$, and again drawn up to $N$, the air will be still more rarified, and the water will rise still higher. The foregoing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, however, is sufficient to show that there may still be a height which the water will not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, and that this height depends on the proportion between the stroke of the piston and its distance from the water in the cistern. We need not give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, because it will come in afterwards in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> with other circumstances. It is enough that the reader sees the physical causes of this limitation: And, lastly, we see plainly that the utmost security will be given for the performance of the pump, when the fixed valve is so placed that the piston, when in its lowest position, shall come into contact with it. In this case, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> of the air will be the complete easily kept possible; and, if there were no space left between the air-tight piston and valve, and all were perfectly air-tight, the rarefaction would be complete, and the valve might be anything less than 33 feet from the surface of the water in the cistern.\n\nBut this perfect contact and tightness is unattainable; and though the pump may be full of water, its continual downward pressure causes it to filtrate slowly through every crevice, and the air enters through every pore, and even detaches itself from the water, with which a considerable portion had been chemically combined. The pump by this means loses water, and it requires several strokes of brisk working to fill it again; and if the leathers have become dry, so much admission may be given to the air, that the pump will not fill itself with water by any working. It is then necessary to pour water into it, which flushes out these passages, and soon sets all to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> again. For these reasons, it is always prudent to place the fixed valve as low as other circumstances will permit, and to make the piston rod of such a length, that when it is at the bottom of its stroke it shall be almost in contact with the valve. When\nwe are not limited by other circumstances, it is evident that the best possible form is to have both the piston and the fixed valve under the surface of the water of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>. In this situation they are always wet and air-tight. The chief objection is, that by this disposition they are not easily come at when needing repair. This is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> objection in deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>. In such situations, therefore, we must make the best compensation of different circumstances that we can. It is usual to place the fixed valve at a moderate distance from the surface of the water, and to have a hole in the side of the pipe, by which it may be got out. This is carefully fitted up by a plate firmly screwed on, with leather or cement between the parts. This is called the clack door. It would, in every case, be very proper to have a fixed valve in the lower end of the pipe. This would combine all advantages. Being always tight, the pipe would retain the water, and it would leave to the valve above its full effect of increasing the rarefaction. A similar hole is made in the working barrel, a little above the highest position of the piston. When this needs repair, it can be got at through this hole, without the immense trouble of drawing up the whole rods.\n\nThus we have conducted the reader step by step, from the simplest form of the pump to that which long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has at last selected as the most generally convenient. This we shall now describe in some detail.\n\nThe Sucking Pump consists of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> DCCD, BAAB (fig. 5), of which the former is called the Barrel, or the Working Barrel, and the other is called the Suction-pipe, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> of a smaller diameter. These are joined by means of flanges E, F, pierced with holes to receive screwed bolts. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of leather, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, covered with a proper cement, is put between them; which, being strongly compressed by the screws-bolts, renders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> perfectly air-tight.\n\nThe lower end A of the suction-pipe is commonly fitted out a little to facilitate the entry of the water, and frequently has a grating across it at AA to keep out filth or gravel. This is immersed in the standing water YZ. The working barrel is cylindrical, as evenly and smoothly bored as possible, that the piston may fill it exactly through its whole length, and move along it with as little friction as may be consistent with air-tightness.\n\nThe piston is a sort of truncated cone OPKL, generally made of wood not apt to split, such as elm or beech. The small end of it is cut off at the sides, so as to form a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> OQP, by which it is fastened to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> rod or spear. It is exhibited in different positions in figures 6, 7, which will give a more distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of it than any description. The two ends of the conical part may be hooped with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>. This cone has its larger end surrounded with a ring or band of strong leather fastened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, or by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> hoop, which is driven on it at the smaller end. This band should reach to some distance beyond the base of the cone; the farther the better; and the whole must be of uniform thickness all round, so as to suffer equal compression between the cone and the working barrel.\n\nThe seam or joint of the two ends of this band must be made very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, but not sewed or stitched together. This would occasion bumps or inequalities, which would spoil its tightness; and no harm can result from the want of it, because the two edges will be squeezed close together by the compression in the barrel. It is by no means necessary that this compression be great. This is a very detrimental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of the pump-makers. It occasions enormous friction, and destroys the very purpose which they have in view, viz. rendering the piston air-tight; for it causes the leather to wear through very soon at the edge of the cone, and it also wears the working barrel. This very soon becomes wide in that part which is continually palled over by the piston, while the mouth remains of its original diameter, and it becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to thrust in a piston which shall completely fill the worn part. Now, a very moderate pressure is sufficient for rendering the pump perfectly tight, mode of and a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLOVE\">glove</a> leather would be sufficient for this purpose, if looed or detached from the solid cone; for tight, suppose such a loose and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, but impervious, band of leather put round the piston, and put into the barrel; and let it even be supposed that the cone does not compress it in the smallest degree to its internal surface.\n\nPour a little water carefully into the inside of this sort of cup or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>; it will cause it to swell out a little, and apply itself close to the barrel all round, and even adjust itself to all its inequalities. Let us suppose it to touch the barrel in a ring of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> all round. We can easily compute the force with which it is pressed. It is half the weight of a ring of water an inch deep and an inch broad. This is a trifle, and the friction occasioned by it not worth regarding; yet this trifling pressure is sufficient to make the passage perfectly impervious, even by the most enormous pressure of a high column of incumbent water; for let this pressure be ever so great, the pressure by which the leather adheres to the barrel always exceeds it, because the incumbent fluid has no preponderating power by which it can force its way between them, and it must intimate itself precisely so far, that its pressure on the inside of the leather shall still exceed, and only exceed, the pressure by which it endeavours to intimate itself; and thus the piston becomes perfectly tight with the smallest possible friction. This reasoning is perhaps too refined for the uninstructed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, and probably will not persuade him. To such we would recommend an examination of the pistons and valves contrived and executed by that practical artist, whose skill far surpasses our highest conceptions, ble from the all-wise Creator of this world. The valves which shut up the passages of the veins, and this in places where an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAVASATION\">extravasation</a> would be followed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, are cups of thin membrane, which adhere to the sides of the channel about half way round, and are detached in the rest of their circumference. When the blood comes in the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, it pushes the membrane aside, and has a passage perfectly free. But a stagnation of motion allows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> of the muscular (perhaps) membrane, to restore it to its natural shape, and the least motion in the opposite direction causes it instantly to clap close to the sides of the vein, and then no pressure whatever can force a passage. We shall recur to this again, when describing the various contrivances of valves, &c. What we have said is enough for supporting our directions for constructing a tight piston, of a piston. But we recommended thick and strong leather, while our present reasoning seems to render thin leather preferable. If the leather be thin, and the solid piston in any part does not press it gently to the barrel, there will be in this part an unbalanced pressure of the incumbent column of water, which would instantly burst even\nPump. A strong leather bag; but when the solid piston, covered with leather, exactly fills the barrel, and is even pressed a little to it, there is no such risk; and now that part of the leather band which reaches beyond the solid piston performs its office in the completest manner. We do not hesitate, therefore, to recommend this form of a piston, which is the most common and simple of all, as preferable, when well executed, to any of those more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>, and frequently very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, constructions, which we have met with in the works of the first engineers.\n\nTo proceed, then, with our description of the sucking-pump.\n\nAt the joining of the working barrel with the suction-pipe there is a hole H, covered with a valve opening upwards. This hole H is either made in a plate which makes a part of the suction-pipe, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> along with it, or it is made in a separate plate. This last is the most convenient, being easily removed and replaced.\n\nDifferent views are given of this valve in figs. 8, 9, 10. The diameter EF (fig. 10.) of this plate is the same with that of the flanges, and it has holes corresponding to them, through which their bolts pass which keep all together. A ring of thick leather NKL is applied to this plate, having a part cut out between N and L, to make room for another piece of strong leather NR (fig. 9.) which composes the valve. The circular part of this valve is broader than the hole in the middle of fig. 10. but not quite so broad as to fill up the inside of the ring of leather OQP of this fig., which is the same with GKI of fig. 10. The middle of this leather valve is strengthened by two brass (not iron) plates, the uppermost of which is seen at R of fig. 9.: the one on its underside is a little smaller than the hole in the valve-plate, that it may go freely in; and the upper plate R is larger than this hole, that it may compress the leather to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIM\">brim</a> all round. It is evident, that when this plate with its leathers is put between the joint flanges, and all is screwed together, the tail of leather N of fig. 9. will be compressed between the plates, and form a hinge, on which the valve can turn, rising and falling. There is a similar valve fastened to the upper side, or broadest side of the piston. This description serves for both valves, and in general for most valves which are to be found in any parts of a pump.\n\nThe reader will now understand, without any repetition, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of the whole operation of a sucking-pump. The piston rarifies the air in the working barrel, and that in the suction-pipe expands through the valve into the barrel; and, being no longer a balance for the atmospheric pressure, the water rises into the suction-pipe; another stroke of the piston produces a similar effect, and the water rises farther, but by a smaller step than by the preceding stroke: by repeating the strokes of the piston, the water gets into the barrel; and when the piston is now pushed down through it, it gets above the piston, and must now be lifted up to any height. The suction-pipe is commonly of smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> than the working barrel, for the sake of economy. It is not necessary that it be so wide; but it may be, and often is, made too small. It should be of such a size, that the pressure of the atmosphere may be able to fill the barrel with water as fast as the piston rises. If a void is left below the piston, it is evident that the piston must be carrying the whole weight of the atmosphere, besides the water which is lying above it. Nay, if the pipe be only so wide, that the barrels shall fill precisely as fast as the piston rises, it must sustain all this pressure. The suction-pipe should be wider than this, that all the pressure of the atmosphere which exceeds the weight of the pillar in the suction-pipe may be employed in pressing it on the under surface of the piston, and thus diminish the load. It cannot be made too wide; and too strict an economy in this respect may very sensibly diminish the performance of the pump, and more than defeat its own purpose. This is most likely when the suction-pipe is long, because there the length of the pillar of water nearly balances the air's pressure, and leaves very little accelerating force; so that water will rise but slowly even in the widest pipe. All these things will be made the subjects of computation afterwards.\n\nIt is plain that there will be limitations to the rise of the water in the suction-pipe, similar to what we found when the whole pump was an uniform cylinder. Let \\(a\\) be the height of the fixed valve above the water in the cistern: let \\(B\\) and \\(b\\) be the spaces in cubic measure between this valve and the piston in its highest and lowest positions, and therefore express the bulks of the air which may occupy these spaces: let \\(y\\) be the distance between the fixed valve and the water in the suction-pipe, when it has attained its greatest height by the rarefaction of the air above it: let \\(h\\) be the height of a column of water in equilibrium, with the whole pressure of the atmosphere, and therefore having its weight in equilibrium with the elasticity of common air; and let \\(x\\) be the height of the column whose weight balances the elasticity of the air in the suction-pipe, when rarefied as much as it can be by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the piston, the water standing at the height \\(a-y\\).\n\nThen, because this elasticity, together with the column \\(a-y\\) in the suction-pipe, must balance the whole pressure of the atmosphere, (see Pneumatics, No. 108.), we must have \\(h = x + a - y\\), and \\(y = a + x - h\\).\n\nWhen the piston was in its lowest position, the bulk of the air between it and the fixed valve was \\(b\\). Suppose the valve kept shut, and the piston raised to its highest position, the bulk will be \\(B\\), and its density \\(\\frac{b}{B}\\), and its elasticity, or the height of the column whose weight will balance it, will be \\(\\frac{h}{B}\\). If the air in the suction-pipe be denser than this, and consequently more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, it will lift the valve, and some will come in; therefore, when the pump has rarefied the air as much as it can, so that none does, in fact, come in, the elasticity of the air in the suction-pipe must be the same.\n\nTherefore \\(x = \\frac{h}{B}\\),\n\nWe had \\(y = a + x - h\\). Therefore \\(y = a + \\frac{h}{B} - h\\),\n\n\\(= a + \\frac{b - B}{B} h\\),\n\nTherefore when \\(\\frac{B - b}{B} h\\) is less than \\(a\\), the water will stop before it reaches the fixed valve. But when \\(a\\) is less than \\(\\frac{B - b}{B} h\\), the water will get above the fixed valve, \\(y\\) becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>.\nBut it does not follow that the water will reach the piton, that is, will rise so high that the piton will pass through it in its descent. Things now come into the condition of a pump of uniform dimensions from top to bottom; and this point will be determined by what was said when treating of such a pump.\n\nThere is another form of the fucking pump which is much used in great water works, and is of equal efficiency with the one now described. It is indeed the same pump in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> position. It is represented in fig. II., where ABCD is the working barrel, immersed, with its mouth downwards, in the water of the cistern. It is joined by means of flanges to the rising pipe or main.\n\nThis usually consists of two parts. The first, BEFC, is bent to one side, that it may give room for the iron frame TXYY, which carries the rod NO of the piton M, attached to the traverses RS, TOV of this frame. The other part, EGHF, is usually of a less diameter, and is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to the place of delivery. The piton frame XTYY hangs by the rod Z, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> or working beam, not brought into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The piton is perforated like the former, and is surrounded like it with a band of leather in form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a>-dish. It has a valve K on its broad or upper face, opening when pressed from below. The upper end of the working barrel is pierced with a hole, covered with a valve I, also opening upwards.\n\nNow suppose this apparatus immersed into the cistern till the water is above it, as marked by the line 2, 3, and the piton drawn up till it touch the end of the barrel. When the piton is allowed to descend by its own weight, the water rises up through its valve K, and fills the barrel. If the piton be now drawn up by the moving power of the machinery with which it is connected, the valve K shuts, and the piton pushes the water before it through the valve I into the main-pipe EFGH. When the piton is again let down, the valve I shuts by its own weight and the pressure of the water incumbent on it, and the barrel is again filled by the water of the cistern. Drawing up the piton pushes this water into the main pipe, &c., and then the water is at length delivered at the place required.\n\nThis pump is usually called the lifting pump; perhaps the simplest of all in its principle and operation.\u2014It needs no farther explanation; and we proceed to describe.\n\nThe Forcing Pump, represented in fig. 12. It consists of a working barrel ABCD, a suction-pipe CDEF, and a main or rising pipe. This last is usually in three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. The first GHIK may be considered as making part of the working barrel, and is commonly cast in one piece with it. The second IKLM is joined to it by flanges, and forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELBOW\">elbow</a> which this pipe must generally have. The third LNOM is properly the beginning of the main, and is continued to the place of delivery. At the joint IK there is a hanging valve or clack S; and there is a valve R on the top of the suction-pipe.\n\nThe piton PQTV is solid, and is fastened to a stout iron rod which goes through it, and is fixed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> drawn through its end. The body of the piton is a sort of double cone, widening from the middle to each end, and is covered with two bands of very strong leather, fitted to it in the manner already described.\n\nThe operation of this pump is abundantly simple. When the piton is thrust into the pump, it pushes the air before it through the valve S, for the valve R remains shut by its own weight. When it has reached near the bottom, and is drawn up again, the air which filled the small space between the piton and the valve S now expands into the barrel; for as soon as the air begins to expand, it ceases to balance the pressure of the atmosphere, which therefore shuts the valve S. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the air in the barrel the equilibrium at the valve R is destroyed, and the air in the suction-pipe lifts the valve, and expands into the barrel; consequently it ceases to be a balance for the pressure of the atmosphere, and the water is forced into the suction-pipe. Pushing the piton down again forces the air in the barrel through the valve S, the valve R in the mean time shutting. When the piton is again drawn up, S shuts, R opens, the air in the suction pipe dilates anew, and the water rises higher in it. Repeating these operations, the water gets at last into the working barrel, and is forced into the main by pushing down the piton, and is pushed along to the place of delivery.\n\nThe operation of this pump is therefore two-fold, forcing and forcing. In the first operation, the same force must be employed as in the fucking-pump, namely, a force equal to the weight of a column of water having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the piton for its base, and the height of the piton above the water in the cistern for its height. It is for the sake of this part of the operation that the upper cone is added to the piton. The air and water would pass by the sides of the lower cone while the piton is drawn up; but the leather of the upper cone applies to the surface of the barrel, and prevents this. The space contained between the barrel and the valve S is a great obstruction to this part of the operation, because this air cannot be rarefied to a very great degree. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, the suction-pipe of a forcing-pump must not be made long. It is not indeed necessary; for by placing the pump a few feet lower, the water will rise into it without difficulty, and the labour of suction is as much diminished as that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> is increased. However, an intelligent artist will always endeavour to make this space between the valve S and the lowest place of the piton as small as possible.\n\nThe power employed in forcing must evidently surmount the pressure of the whole water in the rising pipe, and (independent of what is necessary for giving the water the required velocity, so that the proper quantity per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> may be delivered), the piton has to withstand a force equal to the weight of a column of water having the section of the piton for its base, and the perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of the place of delivery above the lower surface of the piton for its height. It is quite indifferent in this respect what is the diameter of the rising pipe; because the pressure on the piton depends on the altitude of the water only, independent of its quantity. We shall even see that a small rising pipe will require a greater force to convey the water along it to any given height or distance.\n\nWhen we would employ a pump to raise water in a crooked pipe, or in any pipe of moderate dimensions, this form of pump, or something <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, must be used. In bringing up great quantities of water from mines, the common fucking-pump is generally employed,\nPUM\n\nPum.\n\ned, as really the best of them all; but it is the most expensive, because it requires the pipe to be perpendicular, straight, and of great dimensions, that it may contain the piston rods. But this is impracticable when the pipe is crooked.\n\nIf the forcing pump, constructed in the manner now described, be employed, we cannot use forcers with long rods. These would bend when pushed down by their further extremity. In this case, it is usual to employ only a short and stiff rod, and to hang it by a chain, and load it with a weight superior to the weight of water to be raised by it. The machinery therefore is employed, not in forcing the water along the rising-pipe, but in raising the weight which is to produce this effect by its subsequent descent.\n\nIn this case, it would be much better to employ the lifting-pump of fig. II. For as the load on the forcers must be greater than the resistances which it must surmount, the force exerted by the machine must in like manner be greater than this load. This double excess would be avoided by using the lifting-pump.\n\nIt will readily occur to the reader that the quantity of water delivered by any pump will be in the joint proportion of the surface or base of the piston and its velocity: for this measures the capacity of that part of the working barrel which the piston passes over. The velocity of the water in the conduit pipe, and in its passage through every valve, will be greater or less than the velocity of the piston, in the same proportion that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the piston or working barrel is greater or less than the area of the conduit or valve. For whatever quantity of water passes through any section of the working-barrel in a second, the same quantity must go through any one of these passages. This enables us to modify the velocity of the water as we please: we can increase it to any degree at the place of delivery by diminishing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> through which it passes, provided we apply sufficient force to the piston.\n\nIt is evident that the operation of a pump is by starts, and that the water in the main remains at rest, pressing on the valve during the time that the piston is withdrawn from the bottom of the working barrel. It is in most cases desirable to have this motion equable, and in some cases it is absolutely necessary. Thus, in the engine for extinguishing fires, the spout of water going by jerks could never be directed with a certain aim, and half of the water would be lost by the way; because a body at rest cannot in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> be put in rapid motion, and the first portion of every jerk of water would have but a small velocity. A very ingenious contrivance has been fallen upon for obviating this inconvenience, and procuring a stream nearly equable. We have not been able to discover the author. At any convenient part of the rising pipe beyond the valve S there is annexed a capacious vessel VZ (fig. 13. No. 1 and 2.) close a-top, and of great strength. When the water is forced along this pipe, part of it gets into this vessel, keeping the air confined above it, and it fills it to such a height V, that the elasticity of the confined air balances a column reaching to T, we shall suppose, in the rising pipe. The next stroke of the piston sends forward more water, which would fill the rising pipe to some height above T. But the pressure of this additional column causes some more of it to go into the air vessel, and compress its air so much more that its elasticity now balances a longer column. Every succeeding stroke of the piston produces a like effect. The water rises higher in the main pipe, but some more of it goes into the air-vessel. At last the water appears at the place of delivery; and the air in the air-vessel is now so much compressed that its elasticity balances the pressure of the whole column. The next stroke of the piston sends forward some more water. If the diameter of the orifice of the main be sufficient to let the water flow out with a velocity equal to that of the piston, it will do so, rising no higher, and producing no sensible addition to the compression in the air-vessel. But if the orifice of the main be contracted to half its dimensions, the water sent forward by the piston cannot flow out in the time of the stroke without a greater velocity, and therefore a greater force. Part of it, therefore, goes into the air-vessel, and increases the compression. When the piston has ended its stroke, and no more water comes forward, the compression of the air in the air-vessel being greater than what was sufficient to balance the pressure of the water in the main pipe, now forces out some of the water which is lying below it. This cannot return towards the pump, because the valve S is now shut. It therefore goes forward along the main, and produces an efflux during the time of the piston's rising in order to make another stroke. In order that this efflux may be very equable, the air-vessel must be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. If it be small, the quantity of water that is discharged by it during the return of the piston makes so great a portion of its capacity, that the elasticity of the confined air is too much diminished by this enlargement of its bulk, and the rate of efflux must diminish accordingly. The capacity of the air-vessel should be so great that the change of bulk of the compressed air during the inaction of the piston may be inconsiderable. It must therefore be very strong.\n\nIt is pretty indifferent in what way this air-vessel is connected with the rising pipe. It may join it laterally, as in fig. 13. No. 1, and the main pipe go on without interruption; or it may be made to surround an interruption of the main pipe, as in fig. 13. No. 2. It may also be in any part of the main-pipe. If the sole effect intended by it is to produce an equable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a>, as in ornamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a>, it may be near the end of the main. This will require much less strength, because there remains but a short column of water to compress the air in it. But it is, on the whole, more advantageous to place it as near the pump as possible, that it may produce an equable motion in the whole main-pipe. This is of considerable advantage: when a column of water several hundred feet long is at rest in the main-pipe, and the piston at one end of it put at once into motion, even with a moderate velocity, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> on the pipe would be very great. Indeed if it were possible to put the piston instantaneously into motion with a finite velocity, the strain on the pipe, tending to burst it, would be next to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a>. But this seems impossible in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; all changes of motion which we observe are gradual, because all impelling bodies have some elasticity or softness by which they yield to compression. And, the pistons, in the way in which pistons are commonly moved, viz., by cranks, or something analogous to them, the motion is very feebly gradual. But still the air-vessel tends to make the motion along the main-pipe less deftary, and therefore diminishes those strains which would really take place.\nplace in the main pipe. It acts like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of a travelling-carriage, whose jolts are incomparably less than those of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>; and by this means really enables a given force to propel a greater quantity of water in the same time.\n\nWe may here by the way observe, that the attempts of mechanicians to correct this unequal motion of the piston-rod are misplaced, and if it could be done, would greatly hurt a pump. One of the best methods of producing this effect is to make the piston-rod consist of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> bars, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> in the sides which fit each other. Let a toothed wheel be placed between them, having only half of its circumference furnished with teeth. It is evident, without any farther description, that if this wheel be turned uniformly round its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, the piston-rod will be moved uniformly up and down without intermission. This has often been put in practice; but the machine always went by jolts, and seldom lasted a few days. Unskilled mechanicians attributed this to defect in the execution: but the fault is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a>, and lies in the principle.\n\nThe machine could not perform one stroke, if the first mover did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLACKEN\">slacken</a> a little, or the different parts of the machine did not yield by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> or by compression; and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRENGTH_OF_MATERIALS\">strength of materials</a> could withstand the violence of the strains at every reciprocation of the motion. This is chiefly experienced in great works which are put in motion by a water-wheel, or some other equal power exerted on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of which the machine consists. The water-wheel being of great weight, moves with considerable steadiness or uniformity; and when an additional resistance is opposed to it by the beginning of a new stroke of the piston, its great quantity of motion is but little affected by this addition, and it proceeds very little retarded; and the machine must either yield a little by bending and compression, or go to pieces, which is the common event. Cranks are free from this inconvenience, because they accelerate the piston gradually, and bring it gradually to rest, while the water-wheel moves round with almost perfect uniformity. The only inconvenience (and it may be considerable) attending this slow motion of the piston at the beginning of its stroke is, that the valves do not shut with rapidity, so that some water gets back through them. But when they are properly formed and loaded, this is but trifling.\n\nWe must not imagine, that because the stream produced by the affluence of an air barrel is almost perfectly equable, and because as much water runs out during the returning of the piston as during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> stroke, it therefore doubles the quantity of water. No more water can run out than what is sent forward by the piston during its effective stroke. The continued stream is produced only by preventing the whole of this water from being discharged during this time, and by providing a propelling force to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> during the piston's return. Nor does it enable the moving force of the piston to produce a double effect: for the compression which is produced in the air-veil, more than what is necessary for merely balancing the quiescent column of water, rests on the piston, refilling its compression <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as much as the column of water would do, which produces a velocity equal to that of the efflux. Thus if the water is made to spout with the velocity of eight feet per second, this would require an additional column of one foot high, and this would just balance the compression in the air-veil, which maintains this velocity during the non-action of the piston. It is, however, a matter of fact, that a pump furnished with an air-veil delivers a little more water than it would do without it. But the difference depends on the combination of many very dissimilar circumstances, which it is extremely difficult to bring into calculation. Some of these will be mentioned afterwards.\n\nTo describe, or even to enumerate, the immense variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of these three simple pumps would fill a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>. We shall select a few, which are more deserving of notice.\n\nI. The common sucking-pump may, by a small addition, be converted into a lifting-pump, fitted for propelling the water to any distance, and with any velocity.\n\nFig. 14. is a sucking-pump, whose working-barrel ACDB has a lateral pipe AEGHF connected with it close to the top. This terminates in a main or rising pipe IK, furnished or not with a valve L. The top of the barrel is shut up by a strong plate MN, having a hollow neck terminating in a small flanch. The piston rod QR passes through this neck, and is nicely turned and polished. A number of rings of leather are put over the rod, and strongly compressed round it by another flanch and several screwed bolts, as is represented at OP. By this contrivance the rod is closely gripped by the leathers, but may be easily drawn up and down, while all passage of air or water is effectually prevented.\n\nThe piston S is perforated, and furnished with a valve opening upwards. There is also a valve T on the top of the suction-pipe YX; and it will be of advantage, though not absolutely necessary, to put a valve L at the bottom of the rising pipe. Now suppose the piston at the bottom of the working-barrel. When it is drawn up, it tends to compress the air above it, because the valve in the piston remains shut by its own weight. The air therefore is driven through the valve L into the rising pipe, and escapes. In the mean time, the air which occupied the small space between the piston and the valve T expands into the upper part of the working barrel; and its elasticity is so much diminished thereby, that the atmosphere presses the water of the cistern into the suction-pipe, where it will rise till an equilibrium is again produced. The next downward stroke of the piston allows the air, which had come from the suction-pipe into the barrel during the ascent of the piston, to get through its valve. Upon drawing up the piston, this air is also drawn off through the rising pipe. Repeating this process brings the water at last into the working-barrel, and it is then driven along the rising-pipe by the piston.\n\nThis is one of the best forms of a pump. The advantages of this construction may be very perfect, because the piston can be brought so near to the bottom of the working-barrel: and, for forcing water in opposition to great pressures, it appears preferable to the common forcing-pump; because in that the piston rods are compressed and exposed to bending, which greatly hurts the pump by wearing the piston and barrel on one side. This soon renders it less tight, and much water squirts out by the sides of the piston. But in this pump the piston rod is always drawn or pulled, which keeps it straight;\nand rods exert a much greater force in opposition to a pull than in opposition to compression. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> of leather round the piston-rods is found by experience to need very little repairs, and is very impervious to water. The whole is very accessible for repairs; and in this respect much preferable to the common pump in deep mines, where every fault of the piston obliges us to draw up some hundred feet of piston-rods. By this addition, too, any common pump for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> is converted into an engine for extinguishing fire, or may be made to convey the water to every part of the house; and this without hurting or obstructing its common uses. All that is necessary is to have a large cock on the upper part of the working barrel opposite to the lateral pipe in this figure. This cock serves for a spout when the pump is used for common purposes; and the merely shutting this cock converts the whole into an engine for extinguishing fire or for supplying distant places with water. It is scarcely necessary to add, that for these services it will be proper to connect an air-vent with some convenient part of the rising pipe, in order that the current of the water may be continual.\n\nWe have frequently spoken of the advantages of a continued current in the main pipe. In all great works a considerable degree of uniformity is produced by the manner of disposing the actions of the different pumps; for it is very rarely that a machine works but one pump. In order to maintain some uniformity in the resistance, that it may not all be opposed at once to the moving power, with intervals of total inaction, which would produce a very hobbling motion, it is usual to distribute the work into portions, which succeed alternately; and thus both diminish the strain, and give greater uniformity of action, and frequently enable a natural power which we can command, to perform a piece of work, which would be impossible if the whole resistance were opposed at once. In all pump machines therefore we are obviously directed to construct them so that they may give motion to at least two pumps, which work alternately. By this means a much greater uniformity of current is produced in the main pipe. It will be rendered still more uniform if four are employed, succeeding each other at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the time of a complete stroke.\n\nBut ingenious men have attempted the same thing with a single pump, and many different constructions for this purpose have been proposed and executed. The thing is not of much importance, or of great research. We shall content ourselves therefore with the description of one that appears to us the most perfect, both in respect of simplicity and effect.\n\nII. It consists of a working-barrel AB (fig. 15.) close at both ends. The piston C is solid, and the rod OP passes through a collar of leathers in the plate, which closes the upper end of the working-barrel. This barrel communicates laterally with two pipes H, K; the communications m and n being as near to the top and bottom of the barrel as possible. Adjoining to the passage m are two valves F and G opening upwards. Similar valves accompany the passage n. The two pipes H and K unite in a larger rising pipe L. They are all represented as in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>; but the upper ends must be bent backwards, to give room for the motion of the piston-rod OP.\n\nSuppose the piston close to the entry of the lateral pipe n, and that it is drawn up: it compresses the air above it, and drives it through the valve G, where it escapes along the rising pipe; at the same time it rarefies the air in the space below it. Therefore the weight of the atmosphere flushes the valve E, and causes the water of the cistern to rise through the valve D, and fill the lower part of the pump. When the piston is pushed down again, this water is first driven through the valve E, because D immediately flushes; and then most of the air which was in this part of the pump at the beginning goes up through it, some of the water coming back in its stead. In the mean time, the air which remained in the upper part of the pump after the ascent of the piston is rarefied by its descent; because the valve G flushes, as soon as the piston begins to descend, the valve F opens, the air in this suction pipe F expands into the barrel, and the water rises into the pipes by the pressure of the atmosphere. The next rise of the piston must bring more water into the lower part of the barrel, and must drive a little more air through the valve G, namely, part of that which had come out of the suction-pipe F; and the next descent of the piston must drive more water into the rising pipe H, and along with it most if not all of the air which remained below the piston, and must rarely fill more the air remaining above the piston; and more water will come in through the pipe F, and get into the barrel. It is evident, that a few repetitions will at last fill the barrel on both sides of the piston with water. When this is accomplished, there is no difficulty in perceiving how, at every rise of the piston, the water of the cistern will come in by the valve D, and the water in the upper part of the barrel will be driven through the valve G; and, in every descent of the piston, the water of the cistern will come into the barrel by the valve F, and the water below the piston will be driven through the valve E; and thus there will be a continual influx into the barrel through the valves D and F, and a continual discharge along the rising pipe L through the valves E and G.\n\nThis machine is, to be sure, equivalent to two forcing pumps, although it has but one barrel and one piston; yet to two it has no sort of superiority. It is not even more forcing-economical in most cases; because we apprehend that pumps, the additional workmanship will fully compensate for the barrel and piston that is saved. There is indeed a saving in the rest of the machinery, because one lever produces both motions. We cannot therefore say that it is inferior to two pumps; and we acknowledge that there is force ingenuity in the contrivance.\n\nWe recommend to our readers the perusal of Beli's \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a> Hydraulique\" where is to be found a commendable variety of combinations and forms of the simplest pumps; but we must caution them with respect to his theories, which in this article are extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. Also in Leupold's \"Theatrum Machinarum Hydraulicum,\" there is a prodigious variety of all kinds of pumps, many of them very singular and ingenious, and many which have particular advantages, which may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> local circumstances, and give them a preference. But it would be improper to dwell a work of this kind with so many peculiarities; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who makes himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the principles delivered here in sufficient detail, can be at no loss to suit a pump to his particular views.\nviews, or to judge of the merit of such as may be proposed to him.\n\nWe must now take notice of some very considerable and important varieties in the form and contrivance of the essential parts of a pump.\n\nIII. The forcing pump is sometimes of a very different form from that already described. Instead of a piston, which applies itself to the inside of the barrel, and slides up and down in it, there is a long cylinder POQ (fig. 16.) nicely turned and polished on the outside, and of a diameter somewhat less than the inside of the barrel. This cylinder (called a plunger) slides through a collar of leathers on the top of the working-barrel, and is constructed as follows. The top of the barrel terminates in a flanch ab pierced with four holes for receiving screw-bolts. There are two rings of metal cd ef of the same diameter, and having holes corresponding to those in the flanch. Four rings of soft leather, of the same size, and similarly pierced with holes, are well soaked in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, tallow, and a little rosin. Two of these leather rings are laid on the pump flanch, and one of the metal rings above them. The plunger is then thrust down through them, by which it turns their inner edges downwards. The other two rings are then slipped on at the top of the plunger, and the second metal ring is put over them, and then the whole are slid down to the metal ring. By this the inner edges of the last leather rings are turned upwards. The three metal rings are now forced together by the screwed bolts; and thus the leathern rings are strongly comprimised between them, and made to grasp the plunger so closely that no pressure can force the water through between. The upper metal ring just allows the plunger to pass through it, but without any play; so that the turned-up edges of the leathern rings do not come up between the plunger and the upper metal ring, but are lodged in a little conical taper, which is given to the inner edge of the upper plate, its hole being wider below than above. It is on this trifling circumstance that the great tightness of the collar depends. To prevent the leathers from shrinking by drought, there is usually a little cistern formed round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the pump, and kept full of water. The plunger is either forced down by a rod from a working beam, or by a set of metal-weights laid on it, as is represented in the figure.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to be particular in explaining the operation of this pump. When the plunger is at the bottom of the barrel, touching the fixed valve M with its lower extremity, it almost completely fills it. That it may do it completely, there is sometimes a small pipe RSZ branching out from the top of the barrel, and fitted with a cock at S. Water is admitted till the barrel is completely filled, and the cock is then shut. Now when the plunger is drawn up, the valve N in the rising pipe must remain shut by the pressure of the atmosphere, and a void must be made in the barrel. Therefore the valve M on the top of the suction-pipe must be opened by the elasticity of the air in this pipe, and the air must expand into the barrel; and being no longer a balance for the atmosphere, the water in the cistern must be forced into the suction-pipe, and rise in it to a certain height. When the plunger descends, it must drive the water through the valve N (for the valve M will immediately shut), and along with it most of the air which had come into the barrel. And as this air occupied the upper part of the barrel, part of it will remain when the plunger has reached the bottom; but a stroke or two will expel it all, and then every succeeding stroke of the descending piston will drive the water along the rising pipe, and every ascent of the plunger will be followed by the water from the cistern.\n\nThe advantage proposed by this form of piston is that it may be more accurately made and polished than the inside of a working barrel, and it is of much easier repair. Yet we do not find that it is much used, although an invention of the 17th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> (we think by Sir Samuel Morland), and much praised by the writers on these subjects.\n\nIt is easy to see that the sucking-pump may be varied in the same way. Suppose this plunger to be open pump fitted both at top and bottom, but the bottom filled with a partly valve opening upward. When this is pushed to the bottom of the barrel, the air which it tends to compress lifts the valve (the lateral pipe FIK being taken away and the passage shut up), and escapes through the plunger. When it is drawn up, it makes the same rarefaction as the solid plunger, because the valve at O flutes, and the water will come up from the cistern as in the former case. If the plunger be now thrust down again, the valve M flutes, the valve O is forced open, and the plunger is filled with water. This will be lifted by it during its next ascent; and when it is pushed down again, the water which filled it must now be pushed out, and will flow over its sides into the cistern at the head of the barrel. Instead of making the valve at the bottom of the piston, it may be made at the top; but this disposition is much inferior, because it cannot rarify the air in the barrel one half. This is evident; for the capacity of the barrel and plunger together cannot be twice the capacity of the barrel.\n\nIV. It may be made after a still different form, as represented in fig. 17. Here the suction-pipe CO comes up through a cistern KMN deeper or longer than the intended stroke of the piston, and has a valve C at top. The piston, or what acts in lieu of it, is a tube AHGB, open at both ends, and of a diameter somewhat larger than that of the suction-pipe. The interval between them is filled up at HG by a ring or belt of soft leather, which is fastened to the outer tube, and moves up and down with it, sliding along the smoothly polished surface of the suction-pipe with very little friction. There is a valve I on the top of this piston, opening upwards. Water is poured into the outer cistern.\n\nThe outer cylinder or piston being drawn up from its bottom, there is a great rarefaction of the air which mode of operation ter up through the suction-pipe to a certain height; for the valve I keeps shut by the pressure of the atmosphere and its own weight. Pushing down the piston causes the air, which had expanded from the suction-pipe into the piston, to escape through the valve I; drawing it up a second time, allows the atmosphere to press more water into the suction-pipe, to fill it, and also part of the piston. When this is pushed down again, the water which had come through the valve C is now forced out through the valve I into the cistern KMN, and now the whole is full of water. When, therefore, the piston is drawn up, the water follows, and fills it, if\nnot 33 feet above the water in the cistern; and when it is pulled down again, the water which filled the piston is all thrown out into the cistern; and after this it delivers its full contents of water every stroke. The water in the cistern KMN effectively prevents the entry of any air between the two pipes; so that a very moderate compression of the belt of soft leather at the mouth of the piston cylinder is sufficient to make all perfectly tight.\n\nIt might be made differently. The ring of leather might be flattened round the top of the inner cylinder at DE, and slide on the inside of the piston cylinder; but the first form is most easily executed. Muthenbroeck has given a figure of this pump in his large system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and speaks very highly of its performance. But we do not see any advantage which it possesses over the common friction-pump. He indeed says that it is without friction, and makes no mention of the ring of leather between the two cylinders. Such a pump will raise water extremely well to a small height, and it seems to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> only which he had examined: But if the friction-pipe is long, it will by no means do without the leather; for on drawing up the piston, the water of the upper cistern will rise between the pipes, and fill the piston, and none will come up through the friction-pipe.\n\nWe may take this opportunity of observing, that the many ingenious contrivances of pumps without friction are of little importance in great works; because the friction which is completely sufficient to prevent all escape of water in a well-constructed pump is but a very trifling part of the whole force. In the great pumps which are used in mines, and are worked by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-STEAM_ENGINE\"><a class=\"xr</a>ef\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>-engine, it is very usual to make the pistons and valves without any leather whatever. The working barrel is bored truly cylindrical, and the piston is made of metal of a size that will just pass along it without sticking. When this is drawn up with the velocity competent to a properly loaded machine, the quantity of water which escapes round the piston is insignificant. The piston is made without leathers, not to avoid friction, which is also insignificant in such works; but to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of frequently drawing it up for repairs through such a length of pipes.\n\nV. If a pump absolutely without friction be wanted, the following seems preferable for simplicity and performance to any we have seen, when made use of in proper situations. Let NO (fig. 18.) be the surface of the water in the pit, and K the place of delivery. The pit must be as deep in water as from K to NO. ABCD is a wooden trunk, round or square, open at both ends, and having a valve P at the bottom. The top of this trunk must be on a level with K, and has a small cistern EADF. It also communicates laterally with a rising pipe GHK, furnished with a valve at H opening upwards. LM is a beam of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, so fitted to the trunk as to fill it without sticking, and is of at least equal length. It hangs by a chain from a working beam, and is loaded on the top with weights exceeding that of the column of water which it displaces. Now suppose this beam allowed to descend from the position in which it is drawn in the figure; the water must rise all around it, in the crevice which is between it and the trunk, and also in the rising pipe; because the valve P shuts, and H opens; so that when the plunger has got to the bottom, the water will stand at the level of K. When the plunger is again drawn up to the top by the action of the moving power, the water sinks again in the trunk, but not in the rising pipe, because it is stopped by the valve H. Then allowing the plunger to descend again, the water must again rise in the trunk to the level of K, and it must now flow out at K; and the quantity discharged will be equal to the part of the beam below the surface of the pit-water, deducting the quantity which fills the small space between the beam and the trunk. This quantity may be reduced almost to nothing; for if the inside of the trunk and the outside of the beam be made tapering, the beam may be let down till they exactly fit; and as this may be done in square work, a good workman can make it exceedingly accurate. But in this case, the lower half of the beam and trunk must not taper: and this part of the trunk must be of sufficient width round the beam to allow free passage into the rising pipe. Or, which is better, the rising pipe must branch off from the bottom of the trunk. A discharge may be made from the cistern EADF, so that as little water as possible may descend along the trunk when the piston is raised.\n\nOne great excellence of this pump is, that it is perfectly free from all the deficiencies which in common pumps result from want of being air-tight. Another consideration is, that the quantity of water raised is precisely equal to the power expended; for any want of accuracy in the work, while it occasions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the quantity of water discharged, makes an equal diminution in the weight which is necessary for pulling down the plunger. We have seen a machine consisting of two such pumps suspended from the arms of a long beam, the upper side of which was formed into a walk with a rail on each side. A man stood on one end till it got to the bottom, and then walked soberly up to the other end, the inclination being about twenty-five degrees at first, but gradually diminished as he went along, and changed the load of the beam. By this means he made the other end go to the bottom, and to go alternately, with the easiest of all exercises, and what we are most fitted for by our structure. With this machine, a very feeble old man, weighing 110 pounds, raised 7 cubic feet of water 11\u00bd feet high in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and continued working 8 or 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. A stout young man, weighing nearly 135 pounds, raised 8\u00bd to the same height; and when he carried 30 pounds, conveniently flung about him, he raised 9\u00bd feet to this height, working 10 hours a-day without fatiguing himself. This exceeds Defagulier's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> of a horsehead of water 10 feet high in a minute, in the proportion of 9 to 7 nearly. It is limited to very moderate heights; but in such situations it is very effectual.\n\nIt was the contrivance of an untaught labouring man, possessed of uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>. We shall have occasion to mention, with respect, some other contrivances of the same person, in the article WATER-Works.\n\nVI. The most ingenious contrivance of a pump without friction is that of Mr Haffkins, described by Defaguliers, and called by him the QUICKSILVER PUMP. Its construction and mode of operation are pretty complicated; but the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> observations will, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, render it abundantly plain.\nLet \\( i/m/k \\) (fig. 19.) be a cylindrical iron pipe, about six feet long, open at top. Let \\( e/g/h/f \\) be another cylinder, connected with it at the bottom, and of smaller diameter. It may either be solid, or, if hollow, it must be close at top. Let \\( a/c/d/b \\) be a third iron cylinder, of intermediate diameter, so that it may move up and down between the other two without touching either, but with as little interval as possible.\n\nLet this middle cylinder communicate, by means of the pipe \\( A/B \\), with the upright pipe \\( F/E \\), having valves \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) (both opening upwards) adjoining to the pipe of communication. Suppose the outer cylinder suspended by chains from the end of a working beam, and let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> be poured into the interval between the three cylinders till it fills the space to \\( o/p \\), about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of their height. Also suppose that the lower end of the pipe \\( F/E \\) is immersed into a cistern of water, and that the valve \\( D \\) is less than 33 feet above the surface of this water.\n\nNow suppose a perforation made somewhere in the pipe \\( A/B \\), and a communication made with an air-pump. When the air-pump is worked, the air contained in \\( C/E \\), in \\( A/B \\), and in the space between the inner and middle cylinders, is rarefied, and is abstractions by the air-pump; for the valve \\( D \\) immediately shuts. The pressure of the atmosphere will cause the water to rise in the pipe \\( C/E \\), and will cause the mercury to rise between the inner and middle cylinders, and sink between the outer and middle cylinders. Let us suppose mercury 12 times heavier than water: Then for every foot that the water rises in \\( E/C \\), the level between the outside and inside mercury will vary an inch; and if we suppose \\( D/E \\) to be 30 feet, then if we can rarefy the air so as to raise the water to \\( D \\), the outside mercury will be depressed to \\( q/r \\), and the inside mercury will have risen to \\( s/t \\), \\( s/q \\) and \\( t/r \\), being about 30 inches. In this state of things, the water will run over by the pipe \\( B/A \\), and everything will remain nearly in this position. The columns of water and mercury balance each other, and balance the pressure of the atmosphere.\n\nWhile things are in this state of equilibrium, if we allow the cylinders to descend a little, the water will rise in the pipe \\( F/E \\), which we may now consider as a suction-pipe; for by this motion the capacity of the whole is enlarged, and therefore the pressure of the atmosphere will still keep it full, and the situation of the mercury will again be such that all shall be in equilibrium. It will be a little lower in the inside space and higher in the outside.\n\nTaking this view of things, we see clearly how the water is supported by the atmosphere at a very considerable height. The apparatus is analogous to a syphon which has one leg filled with water and the other with mercury. But it was not necessary to employ an air-pump to fill it. Suppose it again empty, and all the valves shut by their own weight. Let the cylinders descend a little. The capacity of the spaces below the valve \\( D \\) is enlarged, and therefore the included air is rarefied, and some of the air in the pipe \\( C/E \\) must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> itself into the space quitted by the inner cylinder. Therefore the atmosphere will press some water up the pipe \\( F/E \\), and some mercury into the inner space between the cylinders. When the cylinders are raised again, the air which came from the pipe \\( C/E \\) would return into it again, but is prevented by the valve \\( C \\).\n\nRaising the cylinders to their former height would compress this air; it therefore lifts the valve \\( D \\), and escapes. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> of the cylinders will have a similar effect. The water will rise higher in \\( F/C \\), and the mercury in the inner space; and then, after repeated strokes, the water will pass the valve \\( C \\), and fill the whole apparatus, as the air-pump had caused it to do before.\n\nThe position of the cylinders, when things are in this situation, is represented in fig. 20: the outer and inner cylinders in their lowest position having descended about 30 inches. The mercury in the outer space stands at \\( q/r \\), a little above the middle of the cylinders, and the mercury in the inner space is near the top \\( s/t \\) of the inner cylinder. Now let the cylinders be drawn up. The water above the mercury cannot get back again through the valve \\( C \\), which floats by its own weight. We therefore attempt to compress it; but the mercury yields, and descends in the inner space, and rises, in the outer till both are quickly on a level, about the height \\( v/u \\). If we continue to raise the cylinders, the compression forces out more mercury, and it now stands lower in the inner than in the outer space. But that there may be something to balance this inequality of the mercurial columns, the water goes through the valve \\( D \\), and the equilibrium is restored when the height of the water in the pipe \\( E/D \\) above the surface of the internal mercury is 12 times the difference of the mercurial columns (on the former supposition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity.) If the quantity of water is such as to rise two feet in the pipe \\( E/D \\), the mercury in the outer space will be two inches higher than that in the inner space. Another depression of the cylinders will again enlarge the space within the apparatus, the mercury will take the position of fig. 19, and more water will come in. Raising the cylinders will send this water four feet up the pipe \\( E/D \\), and the mercury will be four inches higher in the inner than in the outer space. Repeating this operation, the water will be raised still higher in \\( D/E \\); and this will go on till the mercury in the outer space reaches the top of the cylinder; and this is the limit of the performance. The dimensions with which we set out will enable the machine to raise the water about 30 feet in the pipe \\( E/D \\); which, added to the 30 feet of \\( C/F \\), makes the whole height above the pit-water 60 feet. By making the cylinders longer, we increase the height of \\( F/D \\). This machine must be worked with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and but slowly; for at the beginning of the forcing stroke the mercury very rapidly sinks in the inner space and rises in the outer, and will dash out and be lost. To prevent this as much as possible, the outer cylinder terminates in a foot of cup or dish, and the inner cylinder should be tapered atop.\n\nThe machine is exceedingly ingenious and refined; ingenuity and there is no doubt but that its performance will exceed that of any other pump which raises the water to trivance the same height, because friction is completely avoided, and there can be no want of tightness of the piston.\u2014But this is all its advantage; and, from what has been observed, it is but trifling. The expense would be enormous; for whatever care the cylinders are made, trifling the interval between the inner and outer cylinders must contain a very great quantity of mercury. The middle cylinder must be made of iron plate, and must be without a seam, for the mercury would dissolve every folder. For such\nsuch reasons, it has never come into general use. But it would have been unpardonable to have omitted the description of an invention which is so original and ingenious; and there are some occasions where it may be of great use, as in nice experiments for illustrating the theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRAULICS\">hydraulics</a>, it would give the finest pits for measuring the pressures of water in pipes, &c. It is on precisely the same principle that the cylinder bellows, described in the article Pneumatics, are constructed.\n\nWe beg leave to conclude this part of the subject with the description of a pump without friction, which may be constructed in a variety of ways by any common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTER\">carpenter</a>, without the assistance of the pump-maker or plumber, and will be very effective for raising a great quantity of water to small heights, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> marshes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a> pits, quarries, &c. or even for the service of a house.\n\nFig. 21. ABCD (fig. 21.) is a square trunk of carpenter's work open at both ends, and having a little cistern and spout at top. Near the bottom there is a partition made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, perforated with a hole E, and covered with a clack. ffff represents a long cylindrical bag or pudding, made of leather or of double canvas, with a fold of thin leather such as sheepskin between the canvas bags. This is firmly nailed to the board E with soft leather between. The upper end of this bag is fixed on a round board, having a hole and valve F. This board may be turned in the lathe with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> round its edge, and the bag fastened to it by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> bound tight round it. The fork of the piston-rod FG is firmly fixed into this board; the bag is kept defended by a number of wooden hoops or rings of strong wire ff, ff, ff, &c., put into it at a few inches distance from each other. It will be proper to connect these hoops before putting them in, by three or four cords from top to bottom, which will keep them at their proper distances. Thus will the bag have the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARBER\">barber</a>'s bellows powder-puff. The distance between the hoops should be about twice the breadth of the rim of the wooden ring to which the upper valve and piston-rod are fixed.\n\nNow let this trunk be immersed in the water. It is evident that if the bag be stretched from the compressed form which its own weight will give it by drawing up the piston-rod, its capacity will be enlarged, the valve F will be shut by its own weight, the air in the bag will be rarefied, and the atmosphere will press the water into the bag. When the rod is thrust down again, this water will come out by the valve F, and fill part of the trunk. A repetition of the operation will have a similar effect; the trunk will be filled, and the water will at last be discharged by the spout.\n\nHere is a pump without friction, and perfectly tight. For the leather between the folds of canvas renders the bag impervious both to air and water. And the canvas has very considerable strength. We know from experience that a bag of six inches diameter, made of sail-cloth No. 3, with a sheep skin between, will bear a column of 15 feet of water, and stand six hours work per day for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> without failure, and that the pump is considerably superior in effect to a common pump of the same dimensions. We must only observe, that the length of the bag must be three times the intended length of the stroke; so that when the piston-rod is in its highest position, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> or ridges of the bag may be pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a>. If the bag be more stretched than this, the force which must be exerted by the labourer becomes much greater than the weight of the column of water which he is raising. If the pump be laid asleep, which is very usual in these occasional and hasty drawings, it is necessary to make a guide for the piston-rod within the trunk, that the bag may play up and down without rubbing on the sides, which would quickly wear it out.\n\nThe experienced reader will see that this pump is very like that of Gollet and De la Deuille, described by Belidor, vol. ii. p. 120, and most writers on hydraulics. It would be still more like it, if the bag were on the under side of the partition E, and a valve placed farther down the trunk. But we think that our form is greatly preferable in point of strength. When in the other situation, the column of water lifted by the piston tends to burst the bag, and this with a great force, as the intelligent reader well knows. But in the form recommended here, the bag is compressed, and the strain on each part may be made much less than that which tends to burst a bag of six inches diameter. The nearer the rings are placed to each other the smaller will the strain be.\n\nThe same bag-piston may be employed for a forcing pump, by placing it below the partition, and inverting the valve; and it will then be equally strong, because the resilience in this case too will act by compression.\n\nWe now come naturally to the consideration of the different forms which may be given to the pistons and valves of a pump. A good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of what we have been describing already is reducible to this head; but, having a more general appearance, changing as it were the whole form and structure of the pump, it was not improper to keep these things together.\n\nThe great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIDERATUM\">desideratum</a> in a piston is, that it be as tight as possible, and have as little friction as is consistent with this indispensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. We have already said, little friction is the common form, when carefully executed, has these properties in an eminent degree. And accordingly this form has kept its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> amidst all the improvement which ingenious artists have made. Mr Belidor, an author of the first reputation, has given the description of a piston which he highly extols, and is undoubtedly a very good one, constructed from principle, and extremely well composed.\n\nIt consists of a hollow cylinder of metal g h (fig. 22.) pierced with a number of holes, and having at top aved one by flanch AB, whose diameter is nearly equal to that of the working-barrel of the pump. This flanch has a groove round it. There is another flanch IK below, by which this hollow cylinder is fastened with bolts to the lower end of the piston, represented in fig. 23. This consists of a plate CD, with a grooved edge similar to AB, and an intermediate plate which forms the seat of the valve. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this part is better understood by inspecting the figure than by any description. The piston-rod HL is fixed to the upper plate by bolts through its different branches at G, G. This metal body is then covered with a cylindrical bag of leather, fastened on it by cords bound round it, filling up the grooves in the upper and lower plates. The operation of the piston is as follows.\n\nA little water is poured into the pump, which gets past\npast the sides of the piston, and lodges below in the fixed valve. The piston being pushed down dips into this water, and it gets into it by the valve. But as the piston in descending compresses the air below it, this compressed air also gets into the inside of the piston, swells out the bag which surrounds it, and compresses it to the sides of the working-barrel. When the piston is drawn up again, it must remain tight, because the valve will shut and keep in the air in its most compressed state; therefore the piston must perform well during the suction. It must act equally well when pushed down again, and acting as a force; for however great the resistance may be, it will affect the air within the piston to the same degree, and keep the leather close applied to the barrel. There can be no doubt therefore of the piston's performing both its offices completely; but we imagine that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> to the barrel will be greater than is necessary: it will extend over the whole surface of the piston, and be equally great in every part of its surface; and we suspect that the friction will therefore be very great. We have very high authority for supposing that the adhesion of a piston of the common form, carefully made, will be such as will make it perfectly tight; and it is evident that the adhesion of Belidor's piston will be much greater, and it will be productive of worse consequences. If the leather bag be worn through in any one place, the air escapes, and the piston ceases to be compressed altogether; whereas in the common piston there will very little harm result from the leather being worn through in one place, especially if it projects a good way beyond the base of the cone. We still think the common piston preferable. Belidor's piston would do much better inverted as the piston of a sucking pump; and in this situation it would be equal, but not superior, to the common.\n\nBelidor describes another forcing piston, which he had executed with success, and prefers to the common wooden force. It consists of a metal cylinder or cone, having a broad flange united to it at one end, and a similar flange which is screwed on the other end. Between these two plates are a number of rings of leather strongly compressed by the two flanges, and then turned in a lathe like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of wood, till the whole fits tight, when dry, into the barrel. It will swell, says he, and soften with the water, and withstand the greatest pressures. We cannot help thinking this but an indifferent piston. When it wears, there is nothing to squeeze it to the barrel. It may indeed be taken out and another ring or two of leather put in, or the flanges may be more strongly screwed together; but all this may be done with any kind of piston; and this has therefore no peculiar merit.\n\nThe following will, we presume, appear vastly preferable. ABCD (fig. 24.) is the solid wooden or metal block of the piston; EF is a metal plate, which is turned hollow or dish-like below, so as to receive within it the solid block. The piston rod goes through the whole, and has a shoulder above the plate EF, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> H below. Four screw-bolts, such as i, k, l, m, also go through the whole, have their heads k, m sunk into the block, and nuts above at i, l. The packing or stuffing, as it is termed by the workmen, is represented at NO. This is made as solid as possible, and generally consists of soft hempen twine well soaked in a mixture of oil, tallow, and rosin. The plate EF is gently screwed down, and the whole is then put into the barrel, fitting it as tight as may be thought proper. When it wears loose, it may be tightened at any time by screwing down the nuts i, l, which cause the edges of the dish to squeeze out the packing, and compress it against the barrel to any degree.\n\nThe greatest difficulty in the construction of a piston is to give a sufficient passage through it for the water, and yet allow a firm support for the valve, and fixture for the piston rod. We shall see presently that it occasions a considerable expense of the moving power to force a piston with a narrow perforation through the water lodged in the working barrel. When we are raising water to a small height, such as 10 or 20 feet, the power expended amounts to a fourth part of the whole, if the water-way in the piston is less than one-half of the section of the barrel, and the velocity of the piston two feet per second, which is very moderate. There can be no doubt, therefore, that metal pistons are preferable, because their greater strength allows much wider apertures.\n\nThe following piston, described and recommended by Belidor, seems as perfect in these respects as the nature allows of things will allow. We shall therefore describe it in one of the author's own words as a model, which may be adopted with confidence in the greatest works.\n\n\"The body of the piston is a truncated metal cone (fig. 25.), having a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> at the greater end. Fig. 26. shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFILE\">profile</a>, and fig. 27. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of its upper base; where appears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> DD, pierced with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTISE\">mortise</a> E for receiving the tail of the piston-rod. A band of thick and uniform leather AA (fig. 26. and 28.) is put round this cone, and secured by a brass hoop BB firmly driven on its smaller end, where it is previously made thinner to give room for the hoop.\n\n\"This piston is covered with a leather valve, fortified with metal plates GG (fig. 29.). These plates are wider than the hole of the piston, so as to rest on its rim. There are similar plates below the leather of a smaller size, that they may go into the hollow of the piston; and the leather is firmly held between the metal plates by screws H, H, which go through all. This is represented by the dotted circle I K. Thus the pressure of the incumbent column of water is supported by the plates G G, whose circular edges rest on the brim of the water-way, and their straight edges rest on the cross bar DD of fig. 26. and 27. This valve is laid on the top of the conical box in such a manner that its middle FF rests on the cross bar. To bind all together, the end of the piston-rod is formed like a cross, and the arms MN (fig. 30.) are made to rest on the diameter FF of the valve, the tail EP going through the hole E in the middle of the leather, and through the mortise E of the cross bar of the box; and also through another bar QR (fig. 28. and 29.) which is notched into the lower brim of the box. A key V is then driven into the hole T in the piston-rod; and this wedges all fast. The bar QR is made strong; and its extremities project a little, so as to support the brass hoop BB which binds the leather band to the piston-box. The adjoining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> gives the dimensions of all the parts, as they were executed for a steam-engine near Cond\u00e9, where the piston gave complete satisfaction.\"\n\nThis piston has every advantage of strength, tightness,\nand large water-way. The form of the valve (which has given it the name of the butterfly-valve) is extremely favourable to the passage of the water; and as it has but half the motion of a complete circular valve, less water goes back while it is shutting.\n\nThe following piston is also ingenious, and has a good deal of merit. OPPO (fig. 31.) is the box of the piston, having a perforation Q, covered above with a flat valve K, which rests in a metal plate that forms the top of the box. ABCBA is a flirrup of iron to which the box is fixed by screws a, a, a, whose heads are sunk in the wood. This flirrup is perforated at C, to receive the end of the piston-rod, and a nut H is screwed on below to keep it fast. DEFED is another flirrup, whose lower part at DD forms a hoop like the sole of a flirrup, which embraces a small part of the top of the wooden box. The lower end of the piston-rod is screwed; and before it is put into the holes of the two flirrups (through which holes it slides freely) a broad nut G is screwed on it. It is then put into the holes, and the nut H firmly screwed up. The packing RR is then wound about the piston as tight as possible till it completely fills the working barrel of the pump. When long use has rendered it in any degree loose, it may be tightened again by screwing down the nut G. This causes the ring DD to compress the packing between it and the projecting shoulder of the box at PP; and thus causes it to swell out, and apply itself closely to the barrel.\n\nWe shall add only another form of a perforated piston; which being on a principle different from all the preceding, will suggest many others; each of which will have its peculiar advantages. OO in fig. 32. represents the box of this piston, fitted to the working barrel in any of the preceding ways as may be thought best. AB is a cross bar of four arms, which is fixed to the top of the box. CF is the piston-rod going through a hole in the middle of AB, and reaching a little way beyond the bottom of the box. It has a shoulder D, which prevents its going too far through. On the lower end there is a thick metal plate, turned conical on its upper side, so as to fit a conical seat PP in the bottom of the piston-box.\n\nWhen the piston-rod is pushed down, the friction on the barrel prevents the box from immediately yielding. The rod therefore slips through the hole of the cross bar AB. The plate E, therefore, detaches itself from the box. When the shoulder D presses on the bar AB, the box must yield, and be pushed down the barrels, and the water gets up through the perforation. When the piston-rod is drawn up again, the box does not move till the plate E lodges in the seat PP, and thus shuts the water-way; and then the piston lifts the water which is above it, and acts as the piston of a sucking pump.\n\nThis is a very simple and effective construction, and makes a very tight valve. It has been much recommended by engineers of the first reputation, and is frequently used; and from its simplicity, and the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> of which it is capable, it seems very fit for great works. But it is evident that the water-way is limited to less than one-half of the area of the working-barrel. For if the perforation of the piston be one-half of the area, the diameter of the plate or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> EF must be greater; and therefore less than half the area will be left for the passage of the water by its sides.\n\nWe come now to consider the forms which may be given to the valves of a hydraulic engine.\n\nThe requisites of a valve are, that it shall be tight, valves of sufficient strength to resist the great pressures to which it is exposed, that it afford a sufficient passage for the water, and that it do not allow much to go back while it is shutting.\n\nWe have not much to add to what has been said already on this subject. The valves which accompany valves the pump of fig. 5, are called clock valves, and are of all the most obvious and common; and the construction described on that occasion is as perfect as any. We only add, that as the leather is at last destroyed at the hinge by such incessant motion, and it is troublesome, especially in deep mines, and under water, to undo the joint of the pump in order to put in a new valve, it is frequently annexed to a box like that of a piston, made a little conical on the outside, so as to fit a conical seat made for it in the pipe, as represented in fig. 33, and it has an iron handle like that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>, by which it can be laid hold of by means of a long grappling-hook let down from above. Thus it is drawn up; and being very gently tapered on the sides, it sticks very fast in its place.\n\nThe only defect of this valve is, that by opening it very wide when pushed up by the stream of water, it allows a good deal to go back during its shutting again. In some great machines which are worked by a flow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRANK\">crank</a>, the return of the piston is so very slow, that a sensible loss is incurred by this; but it is nothing like what Dr Desaguliers says, one-half of a cylinder whose height is equal to the diameter of the valve.\u2014For in such machines, the last part of the upward stroke is equally slow, and the velocity of the water through the valve exceedingly small, so that the valve is at this time almost shut.\n\nThe butterfly-valve represented in figures 29, &c., is utility of free from most of those inconveniences, and seems the butterfly perfect of the clock valves. Some engineers make their great valves of a pyramidal form, consisting of four clocks, whose hinges are in the circumference of the water-way, and which meet with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in the middle, and are supported by four ribs which rise up from the sides, and unite in the middle. This is an excellent form, affording the most spacious water-way, and shutting very readily. It seems to be the best possible for a piston. The rod of the piston is branched out on four sides, and the branches go through the piston-box, and are fastened below with screws. These branches form the support for the four clocks. We have seen a valve of this form in a pump of five feet diameter, which discharged 20 hogsheads of water every stroke, and made 12 strokes in a minute, raising the water above 22 feet.\n\nThere is another form of valve, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a> or button tail valve. It consists of a plate of metal AB (fig. 34.) valves, turned conical, so as exactly to fit the conical cavity a b Fig. 34. of its box. A tail CD projects from the under side, which passes through a cross bar EF in the bottom of the box, and has a little knob at the end, to hinder the valve from rising too high.\n\nThis valve, when nicely made, is unexceptionable.\nPump. It has great strength, and is therefore proper for all severe strains, and it may be made perfectly tight by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a>. Accordingly it is used in all cases where this is of indispensable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. It is most durable, and the only kind that will do for passageways where steam or hot water is to go through. Its only imperfection is a small water-way; which, from what has been said, cannot exceed, or indeed equal, one-half of the area of the pipe.\n\nIf we endeavour to enlarge the water-way, by giving the cone very little taper, the valve frequently sticks so fast in the seat that no force can detach them. And this sometimes happens during the working of the machine; and the jolts and blows given to the machine in taking it to pieces, in order to discover what has been the reason that it has discharged no water, frequently detach the valve, and we find it quite loose, and cannot tell what has deranged the pump. When this is guarded against, and the diminution of the water-way is not of very great consequence, this is the best form of a valve.\n\nAnalogous to this is the simplest of all valves, represented in fig. 35. It is nothing more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of metal A, to which is fitted a seat with a small portion BC of a spherical cavity. Nothing can be more effectual than this valve; it always falls into its proper place, and in every position fits it exactly. Its only imperfection is the great diminution of the water-way. If the diameter of the sphere does not considerably exceed that of the hole, the touching parts have very little taper, and it is very apt to stick fast. It opposes much less resistance to the passage of the water than the flat under-surface of the button-valve. N.B. It would be an improvement of that valve to give it a taper-shape below like a boy's top. The spherical valve must not be made too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, otherwise it will be hurried up by the water, and much may go back while it is returning to its place.\n\nBelidor describes with great minuteness (vol. ii. p. 221, &c.) a valve which unites every requisite. But it is of such nice and delicate construction, and its defects are so great when this exactness is not attained, or is impaired by use, that we think it hazardous to introduce it into a machine in a situation where an intelligent and accurate artist is not at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. For this reason we have omitted the description, which cannot be given in few words, nor without many figures; and defer our curious readers to consult that author, or peruse Dr Defagulier's translation of this passage. Its principle is precisely the same with the following rude contrivance, with which we shall conclude the descriptive part of this article.\n\nSuppose ABCD (fig. 36.) to be a square wooden trunk. EF is a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>-board, exactly fitted to the trunk in an oblique position, and supported by an iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> which goes through it at I, one-third of its length from its lower extremity E. The two ends of this board are bevelled, so as to apply exactly to the sides of the trunk. It is evident, that if a stream of water come in the direction BA, its pressure on the part IF of this board will be greater than that upon EI. It will therefore force it up and rush through, making it stand almost parallel to the sides of the trunk. To prevent its rising so far, a pin must be put in its way. When this current of water changes its direction, the pressure on the upper side of the board being again greatest on the portion IF, it is forced back again to its former situation, and its two extremities resting on the opposite sides of the trunk, the passage is completely stopped. This board therefore performs the office of a valve; and this valve is the most perfect that can be, because it offers the freest passage to the water, and it allows very little to get back while it is shutting; for the part IE brings up half as much water as IF allows to go down. It may be made extremely tight, by fixing two thin fillets H and G to the sides of the trunk, and covering those parts of the board with leather which applies to them; and in this state it perfectly resembles Belidor's fine valve.\n\nAnd this construction of the valve suggests, by the Description way, a form of an occasional pump, which may be of use quickly set up by any common carpenter, and will be very effectual in small heights. Let a b c d e (fig. 36.) only be a square box made to slide along this wooden trunk constructed without flake, having two of its sides projecting upward, terminating like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GABLE\">gable</a>-ends of a house. A piece of wood e is mortised into these two sides, and to this the piston-rod is fixed. This box being furnished with a valve similar to the one below, will perform the office of a piston. If this pump be immersed so deep in the water that the piston shall also be under water, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> not to say that its performance will be equal to any. The piston may be made abundantly tight by covering its outside neatly with soft leather. And no pipe can be bored with greater accuracy than a very ordinary workman can make a square trunk, we presume that this pump will not be very deficient even for a considerable suction.\n\nWe now proceed to the last part of the subject, to consider the motion of water in pumps, in reference to the force which must be employed. What we have hitherto said with respect to the force which must be applied to a piston, related only to the sustaining the water at a certain height: but in actual service we must not only do this, but we must discharge it at the place of delivery in a certain quantity; and this must require a force superadded to what is necessary for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> support at this height.\n\nThis is an extremely intricate and difficult subject, an intricate and very imperfectly understood even by professed engineers. The principles on which this knowledge must be founded are of a much more abstruse nature than the ordinary laws of hydrostatics; and all the genius of Newton was employed in laying the foundation of this part of physical science. It has been much cultivated in the course of this century by the first mathematicians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Daniel and John Bernoulli have written very elaborate treatises on the subject, under the very apposite name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a>; in which, although they have added little or nothing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> denominations established in some part by Newton, and to Hydrodynamics, acquired in by them, yet they have greatly contributed to our progress in it by the methods which they have pursued in making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of those fundamental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> to the most important cases. It must be acknowledged, however, that both these propositions, and the extensions given them by these authors, are supported by a train of argument that is by no means unexceptionable; and that they proceed on assumptions or postulates which are but nearly true in any\nany case, and in many are inadmissible; and it remains to this hour a wonder or puzzle how these propositions and their results correspond with the phenomena which we observe.\n\nBut fortunately this correspondence does obtain to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. And it seems to be this correspondence chiefly which has given these authors, with Newton at their head, the confidence which they place in their respective principles and methods: for there are considerable differences among them in those respects; and each seems convinced that the others are in a mistake. Messieurs d'Alembert and De la <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANGE\">Grange</a> have greatly corrected the theories of their predecessors, and have proceeded on postulates which come much nearer to the real state of the case. But their investigations involve us in such an inextricable maze of analytical investigation, that even when we are again conducted to the light of day by the clue which they have given us, we can make no use of what we there discovered.\n\nBut this theory, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> as it is, is of great service. It generalizes our observations and experiments, and enables us to compose a practical doctrine from a heap of facts which otherwise must have remained solitary and unconnected, and as cumbersome in their application as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>.\n\nThe fundamental proposition of this practical hydrodynamics is, that water or any fluid contained in an open vessel of indefinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, and impelled by its weight only, will flow through a small orifice with the velocity which a heavy body would acquire by falling from the horizontal surface of the fluid. Thus, if the orifice is 16 feet under the surface of the water, it will issue with the velocity of 32 feet in a second.\n\nIts velocity corresponding to any other depth \\( h \\) of the orifice under the surface, will be had by this easy proportion: \"As the square root of 16 is to the square root of \\( h \\); so is 32 feet to the velocity required; or,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{16} : 32 = \\sqrt{h} : v, \\quad \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>{and} \\quad v = \\frac{32}{\\sqrt{16}} = \\frac{32}{4} \\sqrt{h}, = 8 \\sqrt{h}\n\\]\n\nthat is, multiply the square root of the height in feet by eight, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> is the required velocity.\n\nOn the other hand, it frequently occurs, that we want to discover the depth under the surface which will produce a known velocity \\( v \\). Therefore, \\( \\sqrt{h} = \\frac{v}{8} \\),\n\nand \\( h = \\frac{v^2}{64} \\): that is, divide the square of the velocity by 64, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> is the depth wanted in feet.\n\nThis proposition is sufficient for all our purposes. For since water is nearly a perfect fluid, and propagates all impressions undiminished, we can, in place of any pressure of a piston or other cause, substitute a perpendicular column of water whose weight is equal to this pressure, and will therefore produce the same efflux.\u2014Thus, if the surface of a piston is half a square foot, and it be pressed down with the weight of 500 pounds, and we would wish to know with what velocity it would cause the water to flow through a small hole, we know that a column of water of this weight, and of half a foot base, would be 16 feet high. And this proposition teaches us, that a vessel of this depth will have a velocity of efflux equal to 32 feet in a second.\n\nIf therefore our pressing power be of such a kind that it can continue to press forward the piston with the force of 500 pounds, the water will flow with this velocity, whatever be the size of the hole. All that remains is, to determine what change of actual pressure on the piston results from the motion of the piston itself, and to change the velocity of efflux in the subduplicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the change of actual pressure.\n\nBut before we can apply this knowledge to the circumstances which take place in the motion of water in previous pumps, we must take notice of an important modification, its application of the fundamental proposition, which is but very obscurely pointed out by any good theory, but is established on the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and unexceptionable observation.\n\nIf the efflux is made through a hole in a thin plate, and the velocity is computed as above, we shall discover the quantity of water which issues in a second by observing, that it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> or cylinder of the length indicated by the velocity, and having its transverse section equal to that of the orifice. Thus, in the example already given, supposing the hole to be a square inch, the solid contents of this prism, or the quantity of water issuing in a second, is \\( 1 \\times 32 \\times 12 \\) cubic inches, or 384 cubic inches. This we can easily measure by receiving it in a vessel of known dimensions. Taking this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, we uniformly find a deficiency of nearly 38 parts in 100; that is, if we should obtain 100 gallons in any number of seconds, we shall in fact get only 62. This is a most regular fact, whether the velocities are great or small, and whatever be the size and form of the orifice. The deficiency increases indeed in a very minute degree with the velocities. If, for instance, the depth of the orifice be one foot, the discharge is \\( \\frac{32}{100} \\); if it be 15 feet, the discharge is \\( \\frac{32}{150} \\).\n\nThis deficiency is not owing to a diminution of velocity; for the velocity may be easily and accurately measured by the distance to which the jet will go, if directed horizontally. This is found to correspond very nearly with the proposition, making a very small allowance for friction at the border of the hole, and for the resistance of the air. Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton ascribed the deficiency with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to this, that the lateral columns of water, surrounding the column which is incumbent on the orifice, press towards the orifice, and contribute to the expense equally with that column. These lateral filaments, therefore, issue obliquely, crossing the motion of the central stream, and produce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the jet; and the whole stream does not acquire a parallel motion and its ultimate velocity till it has got to some distance from the orifice. Careful observation showed him that this was really the case. But even his genius could not enable him to ascertain the motion of the lateral filaments by theory, and he was obliged to measure every thing as he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it. He found the diameter of the jet at the place of the greatest contraction to be precisely such as accounted for the deficiency. His explication has been unanimously acquiesced in; and experiments have been multiplied to ascertain all those circumstances which our theory cannot determine a priori.\n\nThe most complete set of experiments are those of Michelotti, made at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a> at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIEDMONT\">Piedmont</a>.\nHere jets were made of 1, 2, 3, and 4 inches diameter; and the water received into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CISTERNS\">cisterns</a> most accurately formed of brick, and lined with stucco. It is the result of these experiments which we have taken for a measure of the deficiency.\n\nWe may therefore consider the water as flowing through a hole of this contracted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, or substitute this for the real orifice in all calculations. For it is evident that if a mouth-piece (so to call it) were made, whose internal shape precisely tallied with the form which the jet assumes, and if this mouth-piece be applied to the orifice, the water will flow out without any obstruction. The vessel may therefore be considered as really having this mouth-piece.\n\nNay, from this we derive a very important observation, \"that if, instead of allowing the water to flow through a hole of an inch area made in a thin plate, we make it flow through a hole in a thick plank, so formed that the external orifice shall have an inch area, but be widened internally agreeably to the shape which nature forms, both the velocity and quantity will be that which the fundamental proposition determines.\" Michelotti measured with great care the form of the great jets of three and four inches diameter, and found that the bounding curve was an elongated trochoid. He then made a mouth-piece of this form for his jet of one inch, and another for his jet of two inches; and he found the discharges to be $\\frac{9}{10}$ and $\\frac{8}{10}$; and he, with justice, ascribed the trifling deficiency which still remained, partly to friction and partly to his not having exactly fitted his mouth-piece to the natural form. We imagine that this last circumstance was the sole cause: For, in the first place, the water in his experiments, before getting at his jet-holes, had to pass along a tube of eight inches diameter. Now a jet of four inches bears too great a proportion to this pipe; and its narrowness undoubtedly hindered the lateral columns from contributing to the efflux in their due proportion, and therefore rendered the jet less convergent. And, in the next place, there can be no doubt (and the observations of Daniel Bernoulli confirm it) that this convergency begins within the vessel, and perhaps at a very considerable distance from the orifice. And we imagine, that if accurate observations could be made on the motion of the remote lateral particles within the vessel, and an internal mouth-piece were shaped according to the curve which is described by the remotest particle that we can observe, the efflux of water would almost perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALLY\">tally</a> with the theory. But indeed the coincidence is already sufficiently near for giving us very valuable information. We learn that the quantity of water which flows through a hole, in consequence of its own weight, or by the action of any force, may be increased one half by properly shaping the passage to this hole; for we see that it may be increased from 62 to near 99.\n\nBut there is another modification of the efflux, which we confess our total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCAPACITY\">incapacity</a> to explain. If the water inflows through a hole made in a plate whose thickness is about twice the diameter of the hole, or, to express it better, if it inflows through a pipe whose length is about twice its diameter, the quantity discharged is nearly $\\frac{9}{10}$ of what results from the proposition. If the pipe be longer than this, the quantity is diminished by friction, which increases as the length of the pipe increases. If the pipe be shorter, the water will not fill it, but detaches itself at the very entry of the pipe, and flows with a contracted jet. When the pipe is of this length, and the extremity is flopped with the finger, so that it begins to flow with a full mouth, no subsequent contraction is observed; but merely striking on the pipe with a key or the knuckle is generally sufficient to detach the water in an instant from the sides of the pipe, and reduce the efflux to $\\frac{5}{10}$.\n\nThis effect is most unaccountable. It certainly arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> adhesion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> between the water and the sides of the pipe; but how this, acting at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles to the motion, should produce an increase from 62 to 82, nearly $\\frac{7}{10}$, we cannot explain. It shows, however, the prodigious force of this attraction, which in the space of two or three inches is able to communicate a great velocity to a very great body of water. Indeed the experiments on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes show that the mutual attraction of the parts of water is some thousands of times greater than their weight.\n\nWe have only further to add, that every increase of pipe beyond two diameters is accompanied with a diminution of the discharge; but in what ratio this is diminished it is very difficult to determine. We shall only observe at present that the diminution is very great. A pipe of 2 inches diameter and 30 feet long has its discharge only $\\frac{4}{10}$ of what it would be if only 4 inches long. If its length be 60 feet, its discharge will be no more than $\\frac{1}{10}$. A pipe of 1 inch diameter would have a discharge of $\\frac{1}{10}$, and $\\frac{1}{10}$ in the same situation. Hence we may conclude that the discharge of a 4-inch pipe of 30 feet long will not exceed $\\frac{1}{10}$ of what it would be if only 8 inches long. This will suffice for our present purposes; and the determination of the velocities and discharges in long conduits from pump-machines must be referred to the article WATER-WORKS. At present we shall confine our attention to the pump itself, and to what will contribute to its improvement.\n\nBefore we can proceed to apply this fundamental proposition to our purpose, we must anticipate in a loose way a proposition of continual use in the construction of water-works.\n\nLet water be supposed stagnant in a vessel EFGH Fig. 37., and let it be allowed to flow out by a cylindrical pipe HIKL, divided by any number of partitions B, C, D, &c. Whatever be the areas B, C, D, of these orifices, the velocity in the intermediate parts of the pipe will be the same; for as much passes through any one orifice in a second as passes through any other in the same time, or through any section of the intervening pipe. Let this velocity in the pipe be V, and let the area of the pipe be A. The velocity in the orifices B, C, D, must be $\\frac{VA}{B}$, $\\frac{VA}{C}$, $\\frac{VA}{D}$, &c. Let g be the velocity acquired in a second by a heavy body. Then, by the general proposition, the height of water in the vessel which will produce the velocity $\\frac{VA}{B}$ in the first orifice alone, is $\\frac{V^2A^2}{2gB^2}$. After this passage the velocity is again reduced to V in the middle of the space between the first and second orifices. In the second orifice this velocity is changed to $\\frac{VA}{C}$. This\nPump alone would have required a height of water \\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g C^2} \\).\n\nBut the water is already moving with the velocity \\( V \\), which would have resulted from a height of water in the vessel (which we shall, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the art, call the head of water) equal to \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\). Therefore there is only required a head of water \\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g C^2} - \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\), or\n\n\\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g C^2} = 1 \\). Therefore the whole height necessary for producing the efflux through both orifices, so as still to preserve the velocity \\( V \\) in the intervening pipe, is \\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g B^2} + \\frac{A^2}{C^2} = 1 \\). In like manner the third orifice \\( D \\) would alone require a head of water \\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g D^2} = 1 \\); and all the three would require a head \\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g B^2} + \\frac{A^2}{C^2} + \\frac{A^2}{D^2} = 2 \\). By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a> may easily be seen what head is necessary for producing the efflux through any number of orifices.\n\nLet the expense or quantity of water discharged in an unit of time (suppose a second) be expressed by the symbol \\( Q \\). This is measured by the product of the velocity by the area of the orifice, and is therefore \\( VA \\),\n\nor \\( \\frac{VA}{B} \\times B \\), or \\( \\frac{VA}{C} \\times C \\), &c., and \\( V^2 = \\frac{Q^2}{A^2} \\). Therefore we may compute the head of water (which we shall express by \\( H \\)) in reference to the quantity of water discharged, because this is generally the interesting circumstance. In this view we have \\( H = \\frac{Q^2}{2g A} \\times \\frac{A^2}{B^2} + \\frac{A^2}{C^2} + \\frac{A^2}{D^2} = 2 \\): which shows that the head of water necessary for producing the discharge increases in the proportion of the square of the quantity of water which is discharged.\n\nThese things being premised, it is an easy matter to determine the motion of water in a pump, and the quantity discharged, resulting from the action of any force on the piston, or the force which must be applied to the piston in order to produce any required motion or quantity discharged. We have only to suppose that the force employed is the pressure of a column of water of the diameter of the working barrel; and this is over and above the force which is necessary for merely supporting the water at the height of the place of delivery. The motion of the water will be the same in both cases.\n\nLet us, first of all, consider a simple pump. The motion here depends on the pressure of the air, and will be the same as if the pump were lying horizontally, and communicated with a reservoir, in which is a head of water sufficient to overcome all the obstructions to the motion, and produce a velocity of efflux such as we desire. And here it must be noted that there is a limit. No velocity of the piston can make the water rise in the suction-pipe with a greater velocity than what would be produced by the pressure of a column of water 33 feet high; that is, about 46 feet per second.\n\nLet the velocity of the piston be \\( V \\), and the area of the working barrel be \\( A \\). Then, if the water fills the barrel as fast as the piston is drawn up, the discharge during the rise of the piston, or the number of cubic feet of water per second, must be \\( V \\times A \\). This is always supposed, and we have already ascertained the circumstances which ensure this to happen. If, therefore, the water arrived with perfect freedom to the piston, the force necessary for giving it this velocity, or for discharging the quantity \\( V \\times A \\) in a second, would be equal to the weight of the pillar of water whose height is \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\), and base \\( A \\).\n\nIt does not appear at first sight that the force necessary for producing this discharge has anything to do with the obstructions to the ascent of the water into the pump, because this is produced by the pressure of the atmosphere, and it is the action of this pressure which is measured by the head of water necessary for producing the internal motion in the pump. But we must always recollect that the piston, before bringing up any water, and supporting it at a certain height, was pressed on both sides by the atmosphere. While the air supports the column below the piston, all the pressure expended in this support is abstracted from its pressure on the under part of the piston, while its upper part still supports the whole pressure. The atmosphere continues to press on the under surface of the piston, through the intermedium of the water in the suction-pipe, with the difference of these two forces. Now, while the piston is drawn up with the velocity \\( V \\), more of the atmospheric pressure must be expended in causing the water to follow the piston; and it is only with the remainder of its whole pressure that it continues to press on the under surface of the piston. Therefore, in order that the piston may be raised with the velocity \\( V \\), a force must be applied to it, over and above the force necessary for merely supporting the column of water, equal to that part of the atmospheric pressure thus employed; that is, equal to the weight of the head of water necessary for forcing the water up through the suction-pipe, and producing the velocity \\( V \\) in the working barrel.\n\nTherefore let \\( B \\) be the area of the mouth of the suction-pipe, and \\( C \\) the area of the fixed valve, and let the suction-pipe be of equal diameter with the working barrel. The head necessary for producing the velocity \\( V \\) on the working barrel is \\( \\frac{V^2 A^2}{2g B^2} + \\frac{A^2}{C^2} = 1 \\). If \\( d \\) expresses the density of water; that is, if \\( d \\) be the number of pounds in a cubic foot of water, then \\( d \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\) will express the weight of a column whose base is \\( A \\), and height \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\), all being reckoned in feet. Therefore the force which must be applied, when estimated in pounds, will be \\( p = \\frac{d AV^2}{2g} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{B^2} + \\frac{A^2}{C^2} - 1 \\right) \\).\n\nThe first general observation to be made on what has been said is, that the power which must be employed to produce the necessary motion, in opposition to all the obstructions, is in the proportion of the square of the velocity.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> which we would produce, or the square of the quantity of water we would discharge.\n\nWe have hitherto proceeded on the supposition, that there is no contraction of the jet in passing through these two orifices. This we know would be very far from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. We must therefore accommodate things to these circumstances, by diminishing B and C in the ratio of the contraction, and calling the diminished areas b and c; then we have \\( p = \\frac{A_d V^2}{2g} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{b^2} + \\frac{A^2}{c^2} - 1 \\right) \\).\n\nWhat this diminution may be, depends on the form of the parts. If the fixed valve, and the entry into the pump, are simply holes in thin plates, then \\( b = \\frac{6}{5} B \\) and \\( c = \\frac{6}{5} C \\). The entry is commonly widened or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>-shaped, which diminishes greatly the contraction: but there are other obstructions in the way, arising from the strainer usually put round it to keep out filth. The valve may have its contraction greatly diminished also by its box being made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-shaped internally; nay, even giving it a cylindrical box, in the manner of fig. 33., is better than no box at all, as in fig. 5.; for such a cylindrical box will have the unaccountable effect of the short tube, and make \\( b = \\frac{6}{5} B \\), instead of \\( \\frac{6}{5} B \\). Thus we see that circumstances seemingly very trifling may produce great effects in the performance of a pump. We should have observed that the valve itself prevents an obstacle which diminishes the motion, and requires an increase of power; and it would seem that in this respect the clack or butterfly valve is preferable to the button valve.\n\nExample. Suppose the velocity of the piston to be 2 feet or 24 inches per second, and that the two contracted areas are each \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the area of the pump, which is not much less than what obtains in ordinary pumps. We have \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{b^2} + \\frac{A^2}{c^2} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{5}{8} (25 + 25 - 1) = 36.75 \\) inches, and the force which we must add to what will merely support the column is the weight of a pillar of water incumbent on the piston, and something more than three feet high. This would be a sensible portion of the whole force in raising water to small heights.\n\nWe have supposed the suction-pipe to be of the same diameter with the working barrel; but it is usual to make it of smaller diameter, generally equal to the water way of the fixed valve. This makes a considerable change in the force necessary to be applied to the piston. Let \\( a \\) be the area of the suction-pipe, the area of the entry being still \\( b \\); and the equivalent entry without contraction being still \\( b \\), we have the velocity at the entrance \\( = \\frac{AV}{b} \\), and the producing head of water \\( = \\frac{A^2 V^2}{2g b^2} \\). After this the velocity is changed to \\( \\frac{AV}{a} \\) in the suction-pipe, with which the water arrives at the valve, where it is again changed to \\( \\frac{AV}{c} \\), and requires for this change a head of water equal to \\( \\frac{A^2 V^2}{2g c^2} \\). But the velocity retained in the suction-pipe is equivalent to the effect of a head of water \\( \\frac{A^2 V^2}{2g a^2} \\). Therefore the head necessary for producing such a current through the fixed valve, that the water may follow the piston with the velocity \\( V \\), is \\( \\frac{A^2 V^2}{2g b^2} + \\frac{A^2 V^2}{2g c^2} - \\frac{A^2 V^2}{2g a^2} \\), or \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{b^2} + \\frac{A^2}{c^2} - \\frac{A^2}{a^2} \\right) \\). This is evidently less than before, because \\( a \\) is less than \\( A \\), and therefore \\( \\frac{A^2}{a^2} \\) is greater than unity, which was the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of the former formula. There is some advantage, therefore, derived from making the diameter of the suction-pipe less than that of the working barrel: but this is only because the passage of the fixed valve is smaller, and the inspection of the formula plainly points out that the area of the suction-pipe should be equal to that of the fixed valve. When it is larger, the water must be accelerated in its passage through the valve; which is an useless expenditure of force, because this velocity is to be immediately reduced to \\( V \\) in the working-barrel. If the foregoing example be computed with \\( a \\) equal to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( A \\), we shall find the head \\( H \\) equal to 29 inches instead of 37.\n\nBut this advantage of a smaller suction pipe is in all cases very moderate; and the pump is always inferior to one of uniform dimensions throughout, having the orifice at the fixed valve of the same area. And if these orifices are considerably diminished in any proportion, the head necessary for overcoming the obstructions, so that the required velocity \\( V \\) may still be produced in the working barrel, is greatly increased. If we suppose the area \\( a \\) of \\( A \\), which is frequently done in house pumps, where the diameter of the suction-pipe does seldom exceed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of that of the working-barrel; and suppose everything made in proportion to this, which is also usual, because the unskilled pump-makers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> a symmetry which satisfies the eye; we shall find that the pump taken as an example will require a head of water \\( = 13 \\) feet and upwards. Besides, it must be observed that the friction of the suction-pipe itself has not been taken into the account. This alone is greater, in most cases, than all the obstructions we have been speaking of; for if this pipe is three inches diameter, and that of the working-barrel is six, which is reckoned a liberal allowance for a suction-pipe, and if the fixed valve is 25 feet above the surface of the pit-water; the friction of this pipe will amount to one-third of the whole propelling force.\n\nThus we have enabled the reader to ascertain the force necessary for producing any required discharge of water from a pump of known dimensions: and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of this determination gives us the discharge which will be produced by any given force. For making \\( \\frac{A^2}{b^2} + \\frac{A^2}{c^2} - \\frac{A^2}{a^2} \\) (which is a known quantity, resulting from the dimensions of the pump) \\( = M \\), we have \\( H = \\frac{V^2}{2g} M \\), and \\( V^2 = \\frac{2g H}{M} \\), and \\( V = \\sqrt{\\frac{2g H}{M}} \\). Now \\( H \\) is that part of the natural power which we have at command which exceeds what is necessary for merely supporting the column of water. Thus, if we have a pump whose piston has an area of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a square foot, its diameter being 6\u00bd inches; and we have to raise the water 32 feet, and can apply a power of 325 pounds to the piston; we wish to know at what rate the piston will be moved, and the quantity of water discharged?\nMerely to support the column of water of this height and diameter, requires 500 pounds. Therefore the remaining power, which is to produce the motion, is 25 pounds. This is the weight of a column 1 foot 4 inches high, and \\( H = 1333 \\) feet. Let us suppose the diameter of the suction-pipe \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of that of the working-barrel, so that \\( \\frac{A}{B} = 4 \\). We may suppose it executed in the best manner, having its lower extremity trumpet-shaped, formed by the revolution of the proper trochoid. The contraction at the entry may therefore be considered as nothing, and \\( \\frac{A}{b} = 4 \\), and \\( \\frac{A^2}{b^2} = 16 \\). We may also suppose the orifice of the fixed valve equal to the area of the suction-pipe, so that \\( \\frac{A^2}{c^2} \\) is also \\( = 16 \\), and there is no contraction here; and therefore \\( \\frac{A^2}{c^2} \\) is also 16. And lastly, \\( \\frac{A^2}{c^2} = \\frac{A^2}{a^2} \\) or \\( M = 16 + 16 - 16 = 16 \\).\n\nWe have also \\( 2g = 64 \\). Now \\( N = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gH}{M}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{64 \\times 1333}{16}} = 2309 \\) feet, and the piston will move with the velocity of 2 feet 4 inches nearly. Its velocity will be less than this, on account both of the friction of the piston and the friction of the water in the suction-pipe. These two circumstances will probably reduce it to one foot eight inches; and it can hardly be less than this.\n\nWe have taken no notice of the friction of the water in the working-barrel, or in the space above the piston; because it is in all cases quite insignificant. The longest pipes employed in our deep mines do not require more than a few inches of head to overcome it.\n\nBut there is another circumstance which must not be omitted. This is the resistance given to the piston in its descent. The pistons of an engine for drawing water from deep mines must descend again by their own weight in order to repeat their stroke. This must require a preponderance on that end of the working-beam to which they are attached, and this must be overcome by the moving power during the effective stroke. It makes, therefore, part of the whole work to be done, and must be added to the weight of the column of water which must be raised.\n\nThis is very easily ascertained. Let the velocity of the piston in its descent be \\( V \\), the area of the pump-barrel \\( A \\), and the area of the piston-valve \\( a \\). It is evident, that while the piston descends with the velocity \\( V \\), the water which is displaced by the piston in a second is \\( (A-a)V \\). This must pass through the hole of the piston, in order to occupy the space above, which is left by the piston. If there were no contraction, the water would go through with the velocity \\( \\frac{A-a}{a}V \\); but as there will always be some contraction, let the diminished area of the hole (to be discovered by experiment) be \\( b \\), the velocity therefore will be \\( \\frac{A-a}{b} \\). This requires for its production a head of water \\( \\frac{V^2(A-a)^2}{2g} \\). This is the height of a column of water whose base is not \\( A \\) but \\( A-a \\). Calling the density of water \\( d \\), we have for the weight of this column, and the force \\( p \\) in \\( d \\times A-a + \\left( \\frac{A-a}{b} \\right) \\times \\frac{V^2}{2g} = \\frac{dV^2(A-a)^2}{2gb^2} \\). This, we see again, is proportional to the square of the velocity of the piston in its descent, and has no relation to the height to which the water is raised.\n\nIf the piston has a button valve, its surface is at least equal to \\( a \\); and therefore the pressure is exerted on the water by the whole surface of the piston. In this case we shall have \\( p = \\frac{dV^2A^3}{2gb^2} \\) considerably greater than before. We cannot ascertain this value with great precision, because it is extremely difficult, if possible, to determine the resistance in so complicated a case. But the formula is exact, if \\( b \\) can be given exactly; and we know within very moderate limits what it may amount to. In a pump of the very best construction, with a button valve, \\( b \\) cannot exceed one-half of \\( A \\); and therefore \\( \\frac{A^3}{b^2} \\) cannot be less than 8. In this case, \\( \\frac{V^2A^3}{2gb^2} \\) will be \\( \\frac{V^2}{8} \\). In a good steam-engine pump \\( V \\) is about three feet per second, and \\( \\frac{V^2}{8} \\) is about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) feet, which is but a small matter.\n\nWe have hitherto been considering the sucking-pump, alone; but the forcing pump is of more importance, being apparently more difficult of investigation.\u2014Here pump, we have to overcome the obstructions in long pipes, with many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a>, contractions, and other obstructions. But the consideration of what relates merely to the pump is abundantly simple. In most cases we have only to force the water into an air-vesSEL, in opposition to the elasticity of the air compressed in it, and to send it thither with a certain velocity, regulated by the quantity of water discharged in a given time. The elasticity of the air in the air-vesSEL propels it along the Main. We are not now speaking of the force necessary for counterbalancing this pressure of the air in the air-vesSEL, which is equivalent to all the subsequent obstructions, but only of the force necessary for expelling the water out of the pump with the proper velocity.\n\nWe have in a manner determined this already. The piston is solid, and the water which it forces has to pass through a valve in the lateral pipe, and then to move in the direction of the main. The change of direction requires an addition of force to what is necessary for merely impelling the water through the valve. Its quantity is not easily determined by any theory, and it varies according to the abruptness of the turn. It appears from experiment, that when a pipe is bent to a right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, without any curvature or rounding, the velocity is diminished about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\). This would augment the head of water about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\). This may be added to the contraction of the valve hole. Let \\( c \\) be its natural area, and whatever is the contraction competent to its form increase it \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), and call the contracted area \\( c \\). Then this will require a head of water \\( = \\frac{V^2A^2}{2gc^2} \\).\nThis must be added to the head \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\), necessary for merely giving the velocity \\( V \\) to the water. Therefore the whole is \\( \\frac{V^2}{2g} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{e^2} + 1 \\right) \\); and the power \\( p \\) necessary for this purpose is \\( \\frac{dAV^2}{2g} \\left( \\frac{A^2}{e^2} + 1 \\right) \\).\n\nIt cannot escape the observation of the reader, that in all these formulae, expressing the height of the column of water which would produce the velocity \\( V \\) in the working barrel of the pump the quantity which multiplies the constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> \\( \\frac{dAV^2}{2g} \\) depends on the contracted passages which are in different parts of the pump, and increases in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> proportion of the sum of those contractions. It is therefore of the utmost consequence to avoid all such, and to make the main which leads from the forcing-pump equal to the working barrel. If it be only half the diameter, it has but one-fourth of the area, the velocity in the main is four times greater than that of the piston, and the force necessary for discharging the same quantity of water is 16 times greater.\n\nIt is not, however, possible to avoid these contractions altogether, without making the main pipe wider than the barrel. For if only fo wide, with an entry of the same size, the valve makes a considerable obstruction. Unskilful engineers endeavour to obviate this by making an enlargement in that part of the main which contains the valve. This is seen in fig. 14, at the valve L. If this be not done with great judgment, it will increase the obstructions. For if this enlargement is full of water, the water must move in the direction of its axis with a diminished velocity; and when it comes into the main, it must again be accelerated. In short, any abrupt enlargement which is to be afterwards contracted, does as much harm as a contraction, unless it be so short that the water in the axis keeps its velocity till it reaches the contraction. Nothing would do more service to an artist, who is not well founded in the theory of hydrodynamics, than to make a few simple and cheap experiments with a vessel like that of fig. 37.\n\nLet the horizontal pipe be about three inches diameter, and made in joints which can be added to each other. Let the joints be about six inches long, and the holes from one-fourth to a whole inch in diameter. Fill the vessel with water, and observe the time of its sinking three or four inches. Each joint should have a small hole in its upper side to let out the air; and when the water runs out by it, let it be stopped by a peg. He will see that the larger the pipe is in proportion to the orifices made in the partitions, the efflux is more diminished. We believe that no person would suspect this who has not considered the subject minutely.\n\nAll angular enlargements, all boxes, into which the pipes from different working barrels, unite their water before it goes into a main, must therefore be avoided by an artist who would execute a good machine; and the different contractions which are unavoidable at the seats of valves and the perforations of pistons, &c., should be diminished by giving the parts a trumpet-shape.\n\nIn the air-vessels represented in fig. 13, this is of very great consequence. The throat O, through which the water is forced by the expansion of the confined air, should always be formed in this manner. For it is this which produces the motion during the returning part of the stroke in the pump constructed like fig. 13, No. 1, and during the whole stroke in No. 2. Neglecting this seemingly trifling circumstance will diminish the performance at least one-fifth. The construction of No. 1, is the best, for it is hardly possible to make the passage of the other free from the effects of contraction. The motion of the water during the returning stroke is very much contorted.\n\nThere is one circumstance that we have not taken any notice of, viz. the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of the motion of the water in pumps. When a force is applied to the piston, motion which it does not in an instant communicate all the velocity which it acquires. It acts as gravity acts on heavy bodies; and if the resistances remained the same, it would produce, like gravity, an uniformly accelerated motion. But we have seen that the resistances (which are always measured by the force which just overcomes them) increase as the square of the velocity increases. They therefore quickly balance the action of the moving power, and the motion becomes uniform, in a time so short that we commit no error of any consequence by supposing it uniform from the beginning. It would have prodigiously embarrassed our investigations to have introduced this circumstance; and it is a matter of mere curiosity: for most of our moving powers are unequal in their exertions, and these exertions are regulated by other laws. The pressure on a piston moved by a crank is as variable as its velocity, and in most cases is nearly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> proportion of its velocity, as any mechanician will readily discover. The only case in which we could consider this matter with any degree of comprehensibility is that of a steam-engine, or of a piston which forces by means of a weight lying on it. In both, the velocity becomes uniform in a very small fraction of a second.\n\nWe have been very minute on this subject. For although it is the only view of a pump which is of any element-importance, it is hardly ever understood even by professional books fed engineers. And this is not peculiar to hydraulics, but is seen in all the branches of practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>. The elementary knowledge to be met with in such books as are generally perused by them, goes no farther than to state the forces which are in equilibrium by the intervention of a machine, or the proportion of the parts of a machine which will set two known forces in equilibrium. But when this equilibrium is destroyed by the superiority of one of the forces, the machine must move; and the only interesting question is, what will be the motion? Till this is answered with some precision, we have learned nothing of any importance. Few engineers are able to answer this question even in the simplest cases; and they cannot, from any confident science, say what will be the performance of an untried machine. They guess at it with a success proportioned to the multiplicity of their experience and their own sagacity. Yet this part of mechanics is as susceptible of accurate computation as the cases of equilibrium.\u2014We therefore thought it our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> to point out the manner of proceeding so circumstantially, that every step should be plain and easy, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> should always accompany our progress. This we think it has been in our power to do, by the very simple method of substituting a co-\nlumn of water acting by its weight in lieu of any natural power which we may chance to employ.\n\nTo such as wish to prosecute the study of this important part of hydraulics in its most abstruse parts, we recommend the perusal of the dissertations of Mr Pitot and Mr Boffet, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; also the dissertations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> de la Borda, 1766 and 1767; also the Hydraulique of the Chevalier De Buat. We shall have occasion to consider the motion of the water in the mains of forcing or lifting pumps which send the water to a distance, in the article WATER-Works; where the reader will see how small is the performance of all hydraulic machines, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of what the usual theories, founded on equilibrium only, would make him expect.","sp":120,"ep":144},{"h":"PUN","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> PUNN, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> where a word has at once different meanings.

Indeed, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEDICATION\">dedication</a> of this book, which is to Edward VI, we discover a colon: but, as this is the only one of the kind throughout the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> this stop was not established at this time, and so rarely put in by the printer; or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was, that it was not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> use. Thirty years after this time, in that sensible and judicious performance of Sir Thomas Elyot, entitled The Governour, imprinted 1582, we see the colon as frequently introduced as any other stop; but the semicolon and the admiration were still wanting, neither of these being visible in this book.\n\nIn Hakluyt's Voyages, printed 1599, we see the semicolon: and, as if the editors did not fully apprehend the propriety of its general admission, it is but sparingly introduced. It has been said, indeed, that the semicolon was brought into use at a much earlier period; but it appears that it was only for the purpose of an abbreviation, as in (namq;) (neg;) for namque, neque, and not in the sense in which it is now employed, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">Month</a>. Mag. v. 411.\n\nThe semicolon, indeed, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as all the ordinary points, is used in a work entitled \"Imagines Deorum,\" printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, in the year 1581, in Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>. We likewise meet with them in the translation of a justly celebrated book, written in French by that wise and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> Mornay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of Piefliis; in the \"Schoolmaster\" of Roger Ascham, printed in 1570, with the exception of the semicolon; and in the \"Trewneffe of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>,\" by Sir Philip Sidney, published in 1587, in which we find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTERISK\">asterisk</a>, brackets, the interrogation, the comma and the semicolon, all as we now use them; and the colon and period are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> dots.\n\nIn an alchemical manuscript of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> of 1572, the semicolon is said to be met with, as well as the other three points which are in common use. The colon and period are abundant in a work entitled \"Dionysius de Situ Orbis,\" printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in 1498, but none of the other stops or points. The single point (.) appears to be the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>. Since the year 1485 the colon was introduced; the comma is first seen about the year 1521; and the more refined semicolon was brought into use about the year 1570.\n\nThe invention of the semicolon is most probably due to the English; for from the Leyden edition of Pliny, 1553, it is evident that the Dutch printers were not then in the practice of using it; and if in 1570, they were, Roger Ascham would probably have employed it; for the Dutch were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> classical printers in his time; but we find that some English books were marked with it at that period.\n\nThe admiration was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> stop that was invented, and seems to have been added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> in a period not too far distant from our own time.\n\nThus we see that these notes of distinction came into use as learning was gradually advanced and improved; one invention indeed, but enlarged by several additions.\n\nBut notwithstanding what has been said relative to the use of stops as being a modern invention, we shall find reason to be satisfied that the ancients were not unacquainted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of making pauses in speaking and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, if we attend to the following elaborate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of Mr Warburton, which we shall lay before our readers in the words of the author.\n\n\"Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of pauses and divisions of sentences in speaking and writing must have been coeval with the knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> or by symbols.\"\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIDAS\">Suidas</a> * says, that the period and the colon were *De Thrasymachus and explained by Thrasyphamus, about 380 B.C., years before the Christian era. Cicero \u2020 says, that Cicero Thrasyphamus was the first who studied oratorical numbers, which entirely consisted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> structure of periods and colons. It appears from a passage in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> \u2021, that punctuation was known in his time. The learned...\"\nlearned Dr Edward Bernard * refers the knowledge of pointing to the time of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, and says, that it conflicted in the different position of one single point. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of a letter; thus, (A,) it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to a comma; in the middle (A:) it was equal to a colon; at the top (A') it denoted a period, or the conclusion of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> was easily practised in Greek manuscripts, while they were written in capitals. But when the small letters were adopted, that is, about the ninth century, this distinction could not be observed; a change was therefore made in the scheme of punctuation. Uncialis litterae hodierno usu diciemus eas in vestitis codicibus, quae priscam formam <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, ac soluta sunt, nec mutu\u00f2 colligantur. Hujus modi literae unciales observantur in libris omnibus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> nonum usque seculum. Montf. Pal\u00e6og. Recens. p. xii.\n\nAccording to Cicero, the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> as well as the Greeks made use of points. He mentions them under the appellation of librariorum not\u00e6; and in several parts of his works he speaks of 'interpunkte clausulae in orationibus', of 'clausulae atque interpunkte verborum', of interpunctiones verborum, &c.\u2020\n\nSeneca, who died A.D. 65, expressly says, that Latin writers in his time, had been used to punctuation. Nos \u2020, cum scribimus interpungere conficimus. Mucretius and Lepidus imagined that these words alluded to the insertion of a point after each word; but they certainly were mistaken, for they must necessarily refer to marks of punctuation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of sentences, because in the passage in which these words occur, Seneca is speaking of one Q. Haterius, who made no pauses in his orations.\n\nAccording to Suetonius in his Illust. Gram. Valerius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROBUS\">Probus</a> procured copies of many old books, and employed himself in correcting, pointing and illustrating them; devoting his time to this and no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of grammar. Multa exemplaria contracta emendare, ac distinguere et adnotare curavit; sibi huic, nec ulli praeterea, grammatic\u00e6 partes deditus.\n\nIt appears from hence that in the time of Probus, or about the year 68, that Latin manuscripts had not been usually pointed; and that grammarians made it their business to supply this deficiency.\n\nQuintilian, who wrote his celebrated treatise on Oratory, about the year 88, speaks of commas, colons, and periods; but it must be observed, that by these terms he means clauses, members, and complete sentences, and not the marks of punctuation \u00a7.\n\nAelius Donatus || published a treatise on Grammar in the fourth century, in which he explains the distinctio, the media distinctio, and the subdistinctio: that is, the use of a single point in the various positions already mentioned.\n\nJerom *, who had been the pupil of Donatus, in his Latin Version of the Scriptures, made use of certain distinctions or divisions, which he calls cola and comata. It has however been thought probable, that these divisions were not made by the addition of any points or stops; but were formed by writing, in one line, as many words as constituted a clause, equivalent to what we distinguish by a comma or a colon. These divisions were called \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 or \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2; and had the appearance of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> verses in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>. There are some Greek manuscripts still extant, which are written in this manner \u2020.\n\nThe best treatise upon punctuation I have seen, and from which these authorities are partly taken, was published some years since and dedicated to Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIFTON\">Clifton</a> Wintringham, Bart., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the author I know not *.","sp":144,"ep":152},{"h":"PUNCTUM FLUENS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> by which the schoolmen vainly attempt to bring within the reach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> the positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a> of God.

The following view of it is taken from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which is considered as a standard by the British Catholics. 1. Every sin, how slight soever, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than an idle word, as it is an offence to God, deserves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> from him, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be punished by him hereafter, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not cancelled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> here. 2. Such small sins do not deserve eternal punishment. 3. Few depart this life so pure as to be totally exempt from spots of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and from every kind of debt due to God's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. 4. Therefore few will escape without suffering something from his justice for such debts as they have carried with them out of this world; according to that rule of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> justice, by which he treats every foul hereafter according to its works, and according to the state in which he finds it in death. From these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, which the Papist considers as so many self-evident truths, he infers that there must be some third place of punishment; for, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> goodness of God can admit nothing into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> which is not clean and pure from all sin both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> and small; and his infinite justice can permit none to receive the reward of bliss,\nPurgatory who as yet are not out of debt, but have something in justice to suffer; there must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> be some place <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> state, where souls, departing this life, pardoned as to the eternal guilt or pain, yet obnoxious to some temporal penalty, or with the guilt of some venial faults, are purged and purified before their admittance into heaven. And this is what he is taught concerning purgatory. Which, though he knows not where it is, of what nature the pains are, or how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> is detained there; yet he believes, that those that are in this place, being the living members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, are relieved by the prayers of their fellow members here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, as also by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMS\">alms</a> and masses offered up to God for their souls. And as for such as have no relations or friends to pray for them, or give alms, or procure masses for their relief; they are not neglected by the church, which makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMEMORATION\">commemoration</a> of all the faithful departed in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and in every one of the canonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> of the divine office.\n\nSuch is the Popish doctrine of purgatory, which is built chiefly upon 2 Macc. xii. 43, 44, 45; St Matth. xii. 31, 32; and 1 Cor. iii. 15. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> the books of Maccabees are not acknowledged to be inspired scripture; but if they were, the texts referred to would rather prove that there is no such place as purgatory, since Judas did not expect the souls departed to reap any benefit from his sin-offering till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>, in St Luke, speaks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> in this world, and in the world to come; but surely neither of these is purgatory. The world to come is the state after the resurrection, and the remission spoken of is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a> to be pronounced on the penitent from the seat of general judgement. In the obscure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> referred to in the epistle to the Corinthians, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> is, by the best interpreters, thought to speak of the difficulty with which Christians should be saved from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>. Of the state of souls departed he cannot well be supposed to speak, as upon disembodied spirits fire could make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. We cannot help, therefore, thinking with the church of England, that \"the Romish doctrine of purgatory is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded on no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANTY\">warranty</a> of scripture;\" but we must confess at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, that it appears to us to be a very harmless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, neither hostile to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> nor dangerous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\n\nSee Resurrection.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PURIFICATION\">Purification</a>, in matters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> which consists in cleansing anything from a suppos'd pollution or defilement.\n\nThe Pagans, before they sacrificed, usually bathed or washed themselves in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and they were particularly careful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, because with these they were to touch the victims consecrated to the gods. It was also customary to wash the vessel with which they made their libations. The Mahometans also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> purifications previous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>; which are also of two kinds, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, or only washing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, hands, and feet. The first is required only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, as after having lain with a woman, touched a dead body, &c.

In an inaugural dissertation published at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> by Dr. Hendy, the author supposes pus to be a secreted fluid. It has been thought by many, that pus is either a sediment from serum when beginning to putrefy, or that it is the same fluid inflamed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the body. But both these opinions are refuted by some experiments of our author, which show, that pus is much less inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> than serum, and the putrefaction of both is heightened by an addition of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the blood. Some other experiments were made in order to try whether pus could be artificially produced. A thin piece of lamb's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, applied to an ulcer discharging laudable pus, and covered over with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, did not assume the appearance of pus, but became fetid, and was much lefened. Serum, in its inflammatory and in its ordinary state, and lymph in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, were applied to the same ulcer, which still discharged good pus; but none of these were converted into pus; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the contrary, they became very putrid.\n\nIn opposition to these arguments of our author, however, it may be alleged, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> pus was a secreted fluid, the vessels by which it was secreted would certainly be visible; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> such thing has ever been observed: on the contrary, it is certain that pus cannot be formed unless the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is excluded from the wound.

See MUCUS. Mr. Home, in a dissertation on the properties of pus, in which he avails himself of the experiments of Mr. Hunter, as delivered in his Physiological Lectures, says, \"that the characteristic of pus is its being composed of globules; and he thinks that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of globules seems to depend upon the pus being in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> state.

Mr. Home affirms, by experiment, that pus, at its formation, is not globular, but a transparent fluid, of a confluence, in some sort, resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JELLY\">jelly</a>; and that the globules are formed while lying upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the sore; requiring, in some instances, while the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air is excluded, fifteen minutes for that purpose.","sp":155,"ep":155},{"h":"PUSTULE","t":"a pimple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> small eruption <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the skin full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUS\">pus</a>; such as the eruptions of the smallpox.","sp":155,"ep":155},{"h":"PUTAMINEAE","t":"(from putamen \"a shell\") the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the 25th order of Linn\u00e6us's fragments of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>; consisting of a few genera of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> allied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, whose fleshy seed-vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fruit is frequently covered with a hard woody shell.

It differs also from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of bodies by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> with violent fire; because, in distillation new and permanent compounds are formed, but by putrefaction every thing seems to be resolved into substances much more simple and indestructible than those which are the result of any chemical process.\n\nThe bodies most liable to putrefaction are those of animals and vegetables, especially when full of juices. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">Stones</a>, though by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> moulder into dust, yet seem not to be subject to anything like a real putrefaction, as they are not resolved into any other substance than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> small dust, which still preserves its lapidaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. In like manner, vegetables of any kind, when deprived of their juices by drying, may be preserved for many ages without being subjected to anything like a putrefactive process. The same holds good with respect to animals; the parts of which, by simple drying, may be preserved in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> state for a much longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> than they could be without the previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHALATION\">exhalation</a> of their juices.\n\nPutrefaction is generally allowed to be a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, or rather to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> stage of that process; which, beginning with the vinous fermentation, goes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a>, to the stage of putridity, where it stops. It is argued, however, and seemingly not without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> putrefaction be a fermentation, it must necessarily be a kind distinct from either the vinous or acetous; since we frequently observe that it takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where neither the vinous nor the acetous stages have gone before; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, it must be, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> at least, entirely independent of and unconnected with them. In several other respects it differs so much from these processes, that it seems in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> doubtful whether it can with propriety be called a fermentation or not. Both the vinous and acetous fermentations are attended with a considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; but in the putrefaction of animal matters especially, the heat is for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> so small, that we cannot be certain whether there is any degree of it or not produced by the process. In cases, indeed, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of corrupting animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is very great, some heat may be perceived; and accordingly Dr Monro tells us, that he was sensible of heat on thrusting his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of a dead and corrupting whale. But the most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the putrefactive fermentation and that of the vinous and acetous kinds is, that the end of both these processes is to produce a new and permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>; but that of the putrefactive process is not to produce any new form, but to destroy, and resolve one which already exists into the original principles from which all things seem to proceed. Thus, the vinous fermentation produces spirits; the acetous, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>: but putrefaction produces nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and some effluvia, which, though most disagreeable, and even poisonous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, yet, being imbibed by the earth and vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of beings. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> supposed, indeed, that volatile alkali is a production of the putrefactive process: but this seems liable to dispute. The vapour of pure volatile alkali is not hurtful to the human frame, but that of putrefying substances is exceedingly so; and, excepting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of volatile alkali in putrid substances is very equivocal. This substance, which produces more alkali than any other, is much less offensive by its putrid fetor than others; and all animal substances produce a volatile alkali on being exposed to the action of fire, of quicklime, or of alkaline salts. In these cases the volatile alkali is not supposed to be produced by the quicklime or fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, but only to be extricated from a kind of ammoniacal salt pre-existing in the animal matters; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> is the same in the other case, viz. that volatile alkali is not produced, but only extricated, from these substances by putrefaction.\n\nThe only thing in which the putrefactive fermentation agrees with the other kinds is, that in all the three there is an extrication of fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. In the putrefactive process, it has been thought that this escape of the fixed air deprives the body of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>: and Dr Macbride has written a treatise, in which he endeavours to prove, that fixed air is the very power of cohesion itself, and that all bodies when deprived of their fixed air entirely lose their cohesion. According to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, the cause of putrefaction is the escape of fixed air; but it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to give a reason why fixed air, after having so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> remained in a body, and preserved its cohesion, should of a sudden begin to fly off without being acted upon by something else. To a similar objection the hypothesis of those is liable, who suppose putrefaction to be occasioned by the escape of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHLOGISTON\">phlogiston</a>; for phlogiston is now known to be a chimera: and though it were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, it would not fly off without something to carry it off, any more than fixed air. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol2.html#article-ANIMALCULES\">Animalcules</a> have been thought to be the cause of putrefaction: but if animal substances are covered so as to exclude the acelis of flies or other insects, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> such animalcules are to be discovered though putrefaction has taken place; and indeed it requires little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> to convince us, that animals are produced in corrupted bodies only because such substances prove a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIDUS\">nidus</a> for the eggs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> insects.\nTo understand the true cause of putrefaction, we must take notice of the circumstances in which the process goes on most rapidly. These are, heat, a little moisture, and confined air. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">Extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> prevents putrefaction, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> dryness; and a free circulation of air carries off the putrid effluvia; a stagnation of which seems to be necessary for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on the process. It seems also to hold pretty generally, that putrefying bodies swell and become specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>; for which reason the carcases of dead animals, after having sunk in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, rise to the top and float. This last phenomenon, as has been observed under the article Blood, no. 29, shows that these bodies have received a certain quantity of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> principle from the air, which thus swells them up to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>. It may be said indeed, that this increase of size in putrefying bodies is owing only to the extrication of air within themselves; but this amounts to the same thing; for the air which exits internally in the body of any animal, is entirely divested of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> while it remains there, and only shows its elastic properties upon being extricated. The elastic principle which combines with the air fixed in the animal substance, therefore, must come from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; and consequently the agent in putrefaction must be the elastic principle of the atmosphere itself, probably the same with elementary fire.\n\nBut, granting this to be true, it is difficult to show why putrefaction should not take place in a living body as well as in a dead one; seeing the one is as much exposed to the action of the air as the other. This difficulty, however, is not peculiar to the present hypothesis; but will equally occur whatever we may suppose the cause of putrefaction to be. The difficulty seems to be a little cleared up by Dr Priestley, who shows, that, by means of respiration, the body is freed from many noxious effluvia which would undoubtedly destroy it; and by the retention of which, he thinks, a living body would putrefy as soon as a dead one. The way in which respiration prevents the putrefaction of the body, is evidently the same with that in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> prevents fish or flesh hung up in it from becoming putrid. The constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of the air is like a stream of that element continually blown upon the body, and that not only upon its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, but into it; by which means putrefaction is prevented in those parts that are most liable to become putrid. On the other hand, the elastic principle received from the air by the blood*, by invigorating the powers of life, quickening the circulation, and increasing perspiration, enables the body to expel noxious particles from other parts of the body which cannot conveniently be expelled by the lungs.\n\nThis leads us to consider the reason why a free exposure to the air prevents the coming on of putrefaction, or why the confining of the putrid effluvia should be so necessary to this process. Here it will be proper to recollect, that putrefaction is a simple resolution of the body into earth, air, &c. of which it seems originally to have been composed. This resolution is evidently performed by an expansive power seemingly situated in every particle of the body. In consequence of this principle, the body first swells, then bursts, flies off in vapour, and its particles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> asunder from each other. The action of the putrefactive process, then, is analogous to that of fire, since these are the very properties of fire, and the very effects which follow the action of fire upon any combustible body. It is therefore exceedingly probable, that the agent in the air, which we have all along considered as the cause of putrefaction, is no other than fire itself; that is, the ethereal fluid expanding itself everywhere, as from a centre to a circumference. The force of the fluid, indeed, is much less in putrefaction than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNITION\">ignition</a>; and therefore the effects also take place in a much smaller degree, and require a much longer time: nevertheless, the same circumstances that are necessary for keeping up the action of fire, are also necessary for keeping up the putrefactive process. One of these is a free access of air, yet without too violent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a>; for as fire cannot burn without air, neither can it endure too much of it: thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> goes out if put under a receiver, and the air exhausted; and it will do the same if we blow violently upon it. In like manner, putrefaction requires a certain quantity of air, much less indeed than fire: and as it requires less to support it, so it can also endure much less air than fire; for a stream of air which would not put out a fire, will effectually prevent putrefaction. The cause of this in both is the same. Fire cannot burn because the vapour is carried off too fast; and thus the latent heat, which ought to support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, is entirely dissipated. In like manner putrefaction is as certainly attended with an emission of azotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> as fire is with an emission of flame. These gases contain a great quantity of latent heat, or of the expansive principle already mentioned; and if these are carried off with greater rapidity than the heat of the atmosphere can produce them, the consequence must be, that an opposite principle to that which produces putrefaction, namely, a principle of cold, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a>, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, must take place, and the body cannot putrefy. That this must be the case, is evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> which all evaporations have of producing cold; and it is well known that a brisk current of air promotes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> to a great degree. Hence also the reason is evident why bodies are preserved uncorrupted by cold; for thus the action of the expansive principle is totally overcome and suspended, so that none of its effects can be perceived.\n\nThus we may see, that one reason why an animal body does not putrefy while alive, is its ventilation, as we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it, by respiration; and another is, the continual accession of new particles, less disposed to putrefy than itself, by the food and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> which is constantly taken in. But if either of these ways of preventing the commencement of this process are omitted, then putrefaction will take place as well in a living as in a dead body. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this last fact we have innumerable instances. When air is infected with the putrid effluvia of marshes, and thus the natural effluvia are not carried off from the human body, but, on the contrary, some enter into it which are not natural to it, the most putrid diseases are produced. The same thing happens from the putrid effluvia of dead bodies. Of this we have a remarkable instance in the fever which took place in Germany in the year of 1755; one reason of which is said to have been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> of the air by the vast numbers of people killed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, to which was added a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> in the atmosphere for a long time; the putrid effluvia being by this prevented from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> off*. When Mr Howell with 145 others were imprisoned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-hole at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, after falling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, no\n\n* See Blood, no. 29.\nPutrefaction.\n\na <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> in that dismal habitation, he found himself in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> putrid fever. When sailors in long voyages are obliged to feed upon putrid aliments; when, through stormy weather, they are much exposed to wet; in the one case the putrefactive effluvia being kept from flying off, and in the other a greater quantity being thrown into the body than what it naturally contains, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCURVY\">scurvy</a>, malignant fevers, &c., make their appearance (A). Neither can these diseases be removed without removing every one of the causes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now mentioned: for as putrid diseases will be the consequence of confined air, nattiness, &c., though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> be ever so good; so, on the other hand, if the provisions be bad, the best air, and most exact cleanliness, nay, the best medicines in the world, will be of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; as hath been often observed in the scurvy.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the nature, cause, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of preventing putrefaction by means of a current of air, we may easily see the reason why it does not take place in some other cases also. Bodies will not putrefy in vacuo, because there the atmosphere has not access to impart its elastic principle; and though in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> itself the principle we speak of does undoubtedly exist, yet its action there is by far too weak to decompose the structure of an animal body. In extreme cold, the reason why putrefaction does not take place has been already shown. If the heat is extremely great, the process of ignition or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> takes place instead of putrefaction. If the body is very dry, putrefaction cannot take place, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> is too firm to be decomposed by the weak action of the elastic principle. Putrefaction may also be prevented by the addition of certain substances; but they are all of them such as either harden the texture of the body, and thus render it proof against the action of the elastic fluid, or, by dissolving its texture entirely, bring it into a state similar to what it would be brought by the utmost power of putrefaction, so that the process cannot then take place. Thus various kinds of salts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> harden the texture of animal substances, and thus are successfully used as antiseptics. The same thing may be said of ardent spirits; while oils and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> of various kinds prove antiseptic by a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of air, which is necessary in some degree for carrying on the process of putrefaction. Many vegetables, by the astringent qualities they possess, harden the texture of animal substances, and thus prove powerfully antiseptic; while, on the other hand, fixed alkaline salts, quicklime, and caustic volatile alkali, though they prevent putrefaction, yet they do it by dissolving the substances in such a manner that putrefaction could do no more though it had exerted its utmost force. There is only one other antiseptic substance whose effects deserve to be considered, and that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. This, though neither acid nor alkaline, is yet one of the most effectual means of preventing putrefaction: and this seems to be owing to its great tendency to run into the vinous fermentation, which is totally inconsistent with that of putrefaction; and this tendency is so great, that it can scarcely be counteracted, by the tendency of animal substances to putrefy in any circumstances whatever.\n\nSome kinds of air are remarkably antiseptic, though this subject has not been so fully inquired into as could be wished. The most powerful of them in this respect is the nitrous air; next to it, is fixed air; but the powers of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> are not so well known. It is probable that the antiseptic properties of fixed and nitrous air, are owing to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of extinguishing fire, or at least that the principle is the same; but till the nature of these two kinds of air are better known, little can be said with certainty on the subject.\n\nSir John Pringle has made experiments to determine the powers of certain substances to promote or to prevent putrefaction. From these experiments he has formed the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a>, showing the relative antiseptic powers of the saline substances mentioned. Having found that two drams of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEEF\">beef</a> put in a phial with two ounces of water, and placed in a heat equal to 90\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's\n\n(A) This aeriform fluid, which is exhaled from animal bodies in a state of putrefaction, acts at certain times more powerfully than at others, and is indeed in one stage of the process infinitely more noxious than any other elastic fluid yet discovered. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for August 1788, Dr St John, informs us, that he knew a gentleman who, by slightly touching the integuments of a human body beginning to liberate this corrosive gas, was affected with a violent inflammation, which in a very short space of time extended up almost the entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>, producing an extensive ulcer of the most foul and frightful appearance, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for several months, and reduced him to a miserable state of emaciation. The same writer mentions a celebrated professor who was attacked with a violent inflammation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> and fauces, from which he with difficulty recovered, merely by swooping over a body which was beginning to give forth this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELETERIOUS\">deleterious</a> fluid. Hence he infers, that the same gas modified or mixed, or united with others, may be the occasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, which has so often threatened to annihilate the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. It is happy, however, for mankind that this particular stage of putrefaction continues but for a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; and, what may appear very remarkable, this destructive gas is not very disagreeable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, and has nothing of that abominable and loathsome fetor produced by dead bodies in a less dangerous state of corruption; but has a certain smell totally peculiar to itself, by which it may be instantly discovered by any one that ever smelled it before. This is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> very worthy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of physicians: it is both extremely interesting, and very little known; but at the same time it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> in the highest degree unpleasing, from the detestable smell and nastiness which attend the putrefaction of animal bodies; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> must be armed with uncommon philanthropy and resolution to attempt it.\n\nDr St John thinks it probable that there is a rapid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIXATION\">fixation</a> of the basis of vital air in dead bodies at a certain stage of putrefaction, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> appearance which they sometimes make, and which exists but for a few hours: but whether this luminous appearance takes place in every body, or whether it precedes or follows the exhalations of the corrosive gas above-mentioned, he had not, when he wrote his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, been able to discover.\nFahrenheit's thermometer, became putrid in 14 hours, and that 60 grains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-falt preferred a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of beef and water more than 30 hours, he made the antiseptic power of the sea-falt a standard, to which he compared the powers of the other salts. The algebraic character + signifies, that the substance to which it is annexed had a greater antiseptic power than is expressed by the numbers:\n\n| Substance                  | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">Number</a> |\n|----------------------------|--------|\n| Sea-salt, or the standard  | 1      |\n| Sal-gem                    | 1+     |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOLATED\">Vitriolated</a> tartar         | 2      |\n| Spiritus Mindereri         | 2      |\n| Soluble tartar             | 2      |\n| Sal diureticus             | 2+     |\n| Crude sal ammoniac         | 3      |\n| Saline mixture             | 3      |\n| Nitre                      | 4+     |\n| Salt of hartshorn          | 4+     |\n| Salt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-WORMWOOD\">wormwood</a>           | 4+     |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORAX\">Borax</a>                      | 12     |\n| Salt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>              | 20     |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">Alum</a>                       | 30     |\n\nN.B. The quantities of spiritus Mindereri and of the saline mixture were such, that each of them contained as much alkaline salt as the other neutral salts.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYRRH\">Myrrh</a>, aloes, afaetida, and terr Japonica, were found to have an antiseptic power 30 times greater than the standard. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> ammoniacum and fagapenum showed little antiseptic power.\n\nOf all resinous substances, camphor was found to resist putrefaction most powerfully. Sir John Pringle believes that its antiseptic power is 300 times greater than that of sea-falt.\n\nChamomile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, Virginian snake-root, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, ginger, saffron, contrayerva root, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLS\">galls</a>, were found to be 12 times more antiseptic than sea-falt.\n\nInfusions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quantities of mint, angelica, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>-ivy, green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-roes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> wormwood, mustard, and horseradish, and also decoctions of poppy-heads, were more antiseptic than sea-falt.\n\nDecoctions of wheat, barley, and other farinaceous grains, checked the putrefaction by becoming sour.\n\nChalk, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> powders, accelerated the putrefaction, and resolved meat into a perfect mucus. The same powders prevented an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of farinaceous grains from becoming mucilaginous and sour.\n\nOne dram of sea-falt was found to prefer two drams of fresh beef in two ounces of water, above 30 hours, uncorrupted, in a heat equal to that of the human body, or above 20 hours longer than meat is preserved in water without salt; but half a dram of salt did not preserve it more than two hours longer than pure water. Twenty-five grains of salt had little or no antiseptic quality. Twenty grains, 15 grains, but especially 10 grains only of sea-falt, were found to accelerate and heighten the putrefaction of two drams of flesh. These small quantities of sea salt did also soften the flesh more than pure water.\n\nThe same learned and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> physician made experiments to discover the effects of mixing vegetable with animal matters.\n\nTwo drams of raw beef, as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, and an ounce of water, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> to the consistence of pap, and exposed to 90\u00b0 of heat according to Fahrenheit's thermometer, began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a> in a few hours, and continued in fermentation during two days. When it began to ferment and swell, the putrefaction had begun; and in a few hours afterwards, the smell was offensive. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the putrid smell ceased, and an acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and smell succeeded. Fresh alimentary vegetables, as spinach, asparagus, fowry-grafs, produced similar effects as bread on flesh, but in a weaker degree. From several other experiments he found, that animal substances excite the fermentation of vegetable substances, and that the latter substances correct the putrefactivity of the former.\n\nBy adding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALIVA\">saliva</a> to a similar mixture of flesh, bread, and water, the fermentation was retarded, moderated, but rendered twice the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, and the acid produced at last was weaker than when no saliva was used.\n\nBy adding an oily substance to the common mixture of flesh, bread, and water, a stronger fermentation was produced, which could not be moderated by the quantity of saliva used in the former experiment, till some fixed alkaline salt was added; which salt was found, without saliva, to stop suddenly very high fermentations.\n\nHe did not find that small quantities of the following salts, sal ammoniac, nitre, vitriolated tartar, sal diuretus, salt of hartshorn, salt of wormwood, were septic, as small quantities of sea-falt were.\n\nSugar was found to resist putrefaction at first, as other salts do, and also to check the putrefaction after it had begun by its own fermentative quality, like bread and other fermentative vegetables.\n\nLime-water made some small resistance to putrefaction.\n\nPort-wine, small beer, infusions of bitter vegetables, of bark, and the juice of antiscorbutic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, retarded the fermentation of mixtures of flesh and bread. But an undrained decoction of bark considerably increased that fermentation.\n\nCrab-eyes accelerated and increased the fermentation of a mixture of flesh and bread.\n\nLime-water neither retarded nor hastened the fermentation of such a mixture; but when the fermentation ceased, the liquor was neither putrid nor acid, but smell agreeably.\n\nFlesh pounded in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> was found to ferment sooner than that which had not been bruised.\n\nThe tough inflammatory crust of blood was found to be most putrefactive; next to which the cralfamentum, or red coagulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>; and lastly the serum.\n\nDr Macbride's experiments confirm many of those above related, especially those which show that the fermentation of vegetable substances is increased by a mixture of animal or putrefactive matter; that the putrefactive of the latter is corrected by the fermentative quality of the former; and that the putrefaction and fermentation of mixtures of animal and vegetable substances were accelerated by additions of absorbent earths and of Peruvian bark. He also found, that although unburnt calcareous earths were septic, quicklime and lime-water prevented putrefaction, but that they destroyed or disintegrated the texture of flesh.\n\nThe experiments of the author of the Effai pour servir \u00e0 l'Histoire de la Putrefaction, show that metallic salts,\nPUTTOCK-SHROUDS.

They were visited by M. Savary, of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of them we shall here give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>.\n\nHe took his journey in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, in order to get up to the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> one by sunrise. Having got within sight of the two great ones, while the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> shone upon them, he informs us, that they appeared, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of three leagues, like two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of rock crowned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>.\n\nIt is in the rich territory which surrounds them that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> has placed the Elysian fields. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> which intersect them are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYX\">Styx</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LETHE\">Lethe</a>.\n\nThe aspects of the pyramids varied according to the circuits he made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, and the position of the clouds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> themselves more and more to view.\n\nAt half past three in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> we arrived (says he) at the foot of the greatest. We left our clothes at the gate of the passage which leads to the inside, and descended, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> each of us a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAMBEAU\">flambeau</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> you must creep like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> to get into the interior passage, which corresponds with the former. We mounted it on our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, supporting ourselves with our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> against the sides. Without this precaution one runs the risk of slipping on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined plane</a>, where the slight notches are insufficient to stop the foot, and one might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the bottom. Towards the middle we fired a pistol, the frightful noise of which, repeated in the cavities of this immense edifice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time, and awakened thousands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATS\">bats</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> round us, struck against our hands and faces, and extinguished several of our wax candles. They are much larger than the European bats. Arrived above, we entered a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, the gate of which is very low. It is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> square, wholly composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> extend from one wall to the other, and form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARCOPHAGUS\">sarcophagus</a> made of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of marble lies at one end of it. It is empty; and the lid of it has been wrenched off. Some pieces of earthen vases <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> around it. Under this beautiful hall is a chamber not too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, where you find the entrance to a conduit filled with rubbish. After examining these caves, where daylight never penetrated, we descended the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, taking care not to fall into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>, which is on the left, and goes to the very foundations of the pyramid. Pliny makes mention of this well, and says it is 26 cubits deep. The internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of this edifice never being renewed, is so hot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEPHITIC\">mephitic</a> that one is almost suffocated. When we came out of it, we were dropping with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. After refreshing ourselves with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, we lost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> time in ascending the pyramid. It is composed of more than 200 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYERS\">layers</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. They overlap each other in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a>, which is from two to four feet. It is necessary to climb up all these enormous steps to reach the top. We undertook it at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, which is the least damaged. It took us, however, half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> with great pains and many efforts to effect it.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> was rising, and we enjoyed a pure air, with a most delicious coolness. After admiring the prospect around us, and engraving our names on the summit of the pyramid, we descended cautiously, for we had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> before us. A piece of stone detaching itself under our feet or hands might have sent us to the bottom.\n\n\"Arrived at the foot of the pyramid, we made the tour of it, contemplating it with a sort of horror. When viewed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, it seems to be made of masses of rocks; but at a hundred paces distance, the largeness of the stones is lost in the immensity of the whole, and they appear very small.\n\n\"To determine its dimensions is still a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>. From the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> to our days it has been measured by a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of travellers and learned men, and their different calculations, far from clearing up doubts, have only increased the uncertainty. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> serve at least to prove how difficult it is to come at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\"\nHeight of the great Pyramid.\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">Ancients</a> | Width of one of its sides |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| Herodotus | 800                      |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a>    | 625                      |\n| Diodorus Siculus | 600 and a fraction. |\n| Pliny     | 703                      |\n\nModerns.\n\n| Le Bruyn   | 616                      |\n| Propper Alpinus | 625                  |\n| Thevenot   | 520                      |\n| Niebuhr    | 449                      |\n| Greaves    | 414                      |\n\nNumber of layers of Stone which form it.\n\n| Greaves | 207 |\n| Maillet | 233 |\n| Albert Liewenstein | 260 |\n| Pococke | 212 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELON\">Belon</a>   | 250 |\n| Thevenot | 253 |\n\n\"It appears that Messrs Greaves and Niebuhr have prodigiously deceived themselves in measuring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height of the great pyramid. All the travellers allow that it has at least 200 layers of stone. These layers are from two to four feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. According to Pococke, they are from four feet and a half to four feet high, being not so high at the top as at the base. Propper Alpinus informs us, that the elevation of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYER\">layer</a> is five feet, but it diminishes infinitely in proportion as one mounts. Thevenot mentions 208 steps of large stones, the thickness of which makes the height of them about two feet and a half one with another: he measured some of them more than three feet high. I have measured several of them which were more than three feet high, and I found none less than two; the least height of them we can take as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> therefore is two feet and a half, which, even according to Mr Greaves's calculation, who reckons 207 layers, would make 517 feet 6 inches perpendicular height. Messrs Greaves, Maillet, Thevenot, and Pococke, who only differ in the number of the layers from 207 to 212, all mounted by the north-east angle, as the least injured. I followed the same route, and counted only 203 steps. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we reflect that the pyramid has been open on the side next the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, that the stones on that side have been thrown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> which covers them has formed a considerable hill, we shall not be astonished that Albert Liewenstein, Belon, and Propper Alpinus, who must have mounted by the south-east or south-west angle, which are less exposed to the sands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a>, should have found a greater number of steps: so that the calculation of these travellers, agreeing with that of Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, appears to be nearest the true height of the pyramid taken at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> base; whence we may conclude with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> that it is at least 600 feet high. Indeed this is authenticated by a passage of Strabo. These are his words: 'Towards the middle of the height of one of the sides is a stone that may be raised up. It thus an oblique passage which leads to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a> placed in the centre of the pyramid.' This passage, open in our days, and which in the time of Strabo was towards the middle of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the pyramid, is at present only 100 feet from the base. So that the ruins of the covering of the pyramid, and of the stones brought from within, buried by the sand, have formed a hill in this place 200 feet high. Pliny confirms this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHINX\">Sphinx</a> was in his time upwards of 62 feet above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. Its whole body is at present buried under the sand. Nothing more appears of it than the neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, which are 27 feet high. If even the Sphinx, though defended by the pyramids against the northerly winds, which bring torrents of sand from Libya, be covered as high as 38 feet, what an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> must have been heaped up to the northward of an edifice whose base is upwards of 700 feet long? It is to this we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the accounts of the historians who have measured the great pyramid at distant periods, and at opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>. Herodotus, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> nearest to its foundation, when its true base was still uncovered, makes it 800 feet square. This opinion appears very probable. Pliny also says that it covered the space of eight acres.\n\n\"Messrs Shaw, Thevenot, and the other travellers who pretend that this pyramid was never finished, because it is open and without coating, are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. It is only necessary to observe the remains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, with the splinters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble which are to be found in many parts of the steps, to see that it has been coated. After <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> attentively the description given of it by the ancients, every doubt vanishes, and the truth is as clear as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. Herodotus tells us, 'The great pyramid was covered with polished stones, perfectly well jointed, the smallest of which was 30 feet long. It was built in the form of steps, on each of which were placed wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> to raise the stones from one to another.' According to Diodorus, 'The great pyramid is built of stones, very difficult of workmanship, but of an eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. It is preserved to our days (towards the middle of the Augustan age) without being in the least injured. The marble was brought from the quarries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>.' This historian thought that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> was composed of stones, similar to those of the coating, which were of very hard marble. Had there been some pieces torn off, he would have perceived under that covering a calcareous stone rather soft. Pliny says that it 'is formed of stones brought from the quarries of Arabia. It is not far from the village of Buhris (which still exists under the name of Boufr), where those persons reside who are so skilful as to climb up to the top.'\n\n\"This passage shows that Pliny, deceived by the appearance, was in the same error with Diodorus Siculus. It demonstrates also that it was covered; for what difficulty would there have been for the inhabitants of Buhris to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> a building raised by steps? but it was really a prodigy for them to get up it when it formed a mountain, the four inclined planes of which presented a surface covered with polished marble. It is indeed an incontestable fact, that the great pyramid was coated. It is as certain too that it has been built, as Strabo gives us to understand; and that by removing a stone placed in the middle of one of the sides, one found a passage which led to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>. But I shall leave Mr Maillet, who visited it 40 times with all imaginable...\"\nPyramid, imaginable attention, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of relating the means employed to open it. I have examined the inside of it in two different journeys; twice I have mounted it: and I cannot help admiring the sagacity with which that author has developed the mechanism of that astonishing edifice.\"\n\nOur author next proceeds to give a particular description of the methods by which it is most probable that the pyramids were closed, and the immense labour requisite to open them. We must remark, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> outlet to the workmen he supposes to have been the well at the entrance formerly mentioned. This well descends towards the bottom of the pyramid by a line not quite perpendicular to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, but slanting a little, in such a manner as to resemble the figure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> Lamed. About 60 feet from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> there is a square window in this passage, from whence we enter a small grotto hewn out of the mountain; which in this place is not a solid stone, but a kind of gravel concreted together. The grotto extends about 15 feet from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> to well, where there is another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> hollowed likewise, but almost perpendicular. It is two feet four inches wide by two and a half in height. It descends through a space of 123 feet, after which we meet with nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and stones. M. Savary is convinced that the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of this passage was to serve as a retreat for the labourers who constructed the pyramid; and of this he looks upon the slope of the conduit, its winding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, its smallness, and its depth, to be certain proofs. The way out of it he supposes to have been formed by a passage over which hung a row of stones, which they had discovered the secret of suspending, and which falling down into the passage by the means of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> they set in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, that up the entrance for ever, as soon as the workmen were withdrawn from the pyramid.\n\nIt seems to be an unquestionable fact, that this pyramid was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a> of one of the kings of Egypt, and it is very probable that all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> answered similar purposes. We do not, however, think that this was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> use or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of their builders. Mr Bryant is of opinion that they were temples erected in honour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>; and a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1794 has done much to prove that they were altars dedicated to the sun, the first and greatest god in every pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>.\n\n\"Our English word pyramid (says he) is directly derived from the Latin pyramis, and mediately from the Greek \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03c2; all denoting the same mathematical figure. The original of the whole seems to be the Egyptian word pyramana, which, we are told by Oriental scholars, signifies light, or a ray of light. From this Coptic vocable the word \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1 in Greek, signifying fire, is probably deduced; as the flames of fire assume that conical or pyramidal form which the solar rays commonly display; and as it is natural for the mind to distinguish its objects rather by their external qualities, and those obvious and interesting appearances which they exhibit to the senses, than by their constituent and inseparable properties.\n\n\"The ancient Egyptians seem to have penetrated very far into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and although their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> appears at first sight to be extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and absurd, yet it is very probable that their deities were only emblematical personages, representing by Pyramidal images the grand effects or presiding principles which they supposed to exist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>. Thus the moon was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a>, and the sun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSIRIS\">Osiris</a>; and to the honour of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> deity, from whose visible influence and creative energy all things seem to spring into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, it is not improbable that the Egyptians erected those stupendous monuments, and dedicated them to him as temples or altars. It was natural to build them in that shape which the rays of the sun display when discovered to the eye, and which they observed to be the same in terrestrial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, because this circumstance was combined in their imaginations with the attribute which they adored. If they were temples dedicated to the sun, it seems a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that they should likewise be places of sepulture for kings and illustrious men, as the place which they covered would be considered as consecrated ground. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> is common, and is not contradicted by the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. But, considering them as altars, and as most travellers agree that they were never finished, but terminate in a square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> surface, it would not be refining too much to venture an assertion that, in great and solemn acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>, the Egyptians constructed fires, the flames of which should terminate in the vertex of the pyramid, and to complete that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMANATION\">emanation</a> of their deity which they admired and adored. As far, therefore, as we are justified in forming any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> on so dark a subject, we may venture to say, that the Egyptian pyramids were temples or altars dedicated to the sun, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> of that invisible power which creates, governs, and pervades, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of nature.\"\n\nThis reasoning has some force; and it certainly receives additional strength from the undoubted fact, that the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> for idolatrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> were erected on the tops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and of a pyramidal or conical form. (See Polytheism, No. 13 and 21.) It is likewise corroborated by other circumstances discovered by the members of the Asiatic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of their transactions we have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of several large statues of the gods Seva and Mchedeo, all of a conical or pyramidal figure; but it has been shown in the article already referred to, that the idolatry of Hindoostan was probably of Egyptian origin.\n\nIt is not known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> when the pyramids were built; but we have reason to expect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of them soon from Sanscrit records examined by Mr Wilford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of engineers. It is as little known at what time, or from what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a>, the great pyramid was opened. Some think it was done by one of the khalifa's about the beginning of the eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of finding a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>; but all he met with was the king's body, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> idols which had been buried along with it.\u2014By others it is supposed to have been done by the celebrated Harun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AL\">Al</a>-Rashid khalifa of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>; but all are agreed that this pyramid was opened in the time of the Arabs. The second pyramid has likewise been opened; and an attempt was made not long ago upon the third by one of the Beys of Cairo: but after removing a number of stones at a considerable expense, he thought proper to desist from the enterprise.\u2014Mr Bryant is of opinion that the pyramids, at least the three great ones, are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> structures of stone and mortar, but solid rocks cut into a pyramidal shape, and afterwards cased with stone; and to this\nPyramid. this we find that Mr Bruce likewise affirms. The reason given for this opinion is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> within it seem rather to answer to the natural cavities and rents in rocks than to the artificial ones in buildings. The opinion, however, we think sufficiently controverted by Savary and Maillet; and, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> critic observes, it is in itself as improbable as that the caverns inhabited by the Troglodytes were dug by the hands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. See Troglodytes.\n\nOn the east side of the second pyramid is the Sphinx, an enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of one solid stone, but so buried in the sand that only the top of the back is visible, which is 100 feet long. Its head rises, as we have seen, 27 feet above the sand; and its face has been disfigured by the Arabs, who hold all representations of men and living animals in detestation. Other travellers say that this Sphinx is a huge misshapen rock, by no means worthy of the attention which has been bestowed upon it.\n\nIn the desert of Saccara there is a great number of pyramids, which, in Mr Bruce's opinion, are composed of clay. They terminate in what the inhabitants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> a dagour or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> pyramid, about two miles from the Nile, between Suf and Woodan. This is no other than a hill cut into the shape of a pyramid, or naturally formed, for a considerable height; on the top of which is a pyramidal building of brick terminating in a point, and having its basis so exactly adapted to the top of the hill, that at a distance the difference cannot be perceived; especially as the face of the stones resembles very nearly the clay of which the pyramids of the Saccara are composed.\n\nBut a very different opinion concerning the purpose to which the great pyramid was originally destined, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> in which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> edifice was erected, is held by Mr Gabb, who has not long since published an elaborate treatise on this subject. According to this author not only the great pyramid, but also the smaller pyramids are of antediluvian origin; the immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of sand around those stupendous structures took place at the time of the deluge; the height of this sand, when the waters subsided, probably reached the summit of the pyramid, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> of the great pyramid was torn off by the violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the waters. The author contends that the sand round the pyramids could not have been collected by the force of the winds; and that it is equally improbable that it could have been deposited from the waters of the Nile during the inundations of that river; for the Nile was never known to rise to such a height, and the organized remains, such as shells and petrified oysters, found in the sands about the pyramids, are quite different from any shell-fish that inhabit the Nile. From all this the author concludes, that the great pyramid was erected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTEDILUVIANS\">Antediluvians</a>, that the remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of sand on the surface of the extensive rock on which that immense fabric stands can only be satisfactorily accounted for from the effects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> deluge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>; and that the accumulation of sand is diminishing rather than increasing by the force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. The author supposes that the other pyramids were also built before the flood, but at a later period than that of the great pyramid, which latter he thinks was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the immediate descendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SETH\">Seth</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this, Josephus is quoted, who notices a memorial of an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> preserved among the Jews, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> descendants of Seth were much employed in astronomical observations. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> geometrical figure of the pyramid, the commensurability of its parts to the whole, the scientific approach of the side of its base to a meridional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the circumference of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and the useful solutions of problems deducible from it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the same inference.\n\nBut the most curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a> concerning the pyramid relates to the purpose for which that stupendous fabric was raised; and here he is decidedly of opinion, that it was originally intended as a standard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, and not as has been more generally supposed as a sepulchral monument; and farther that the excavation of the celebrated granite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a> in the interior of the pyramid was intended not for the repository of a corpse, but for a standard measure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> was for linear measure. This is also the opinion of the French savans who accompanied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of Bonaparte to Egypt, and very successfully ascertained the dimensions of that remarkable building. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the pyramid is a geometrical square, the side of which is equal to 400 cubits of Cairo, or the great Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADIUM\">stadium</a>. The length of the granite chest in the upper chamber of the pyramid is exactly four cubits, which is precisely one hundredth part of the base of the side of the pyramid. The commensurability of the component parts of the pyramid now mentioned, as well as of others discussed by the author, is undoubtedly a curious circumstance.

But previous to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, he took care to cool them equally, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> them some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> upon the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, when it began to freeze, and Fahrenheit's thermometer was at 32 degrees.

Lead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> melts with three flames placed together, especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they burn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>.\n\nFrom these experiments, it appears at first view that iron is the least rarefied of any of these metals, whether it be heated by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> more flames; and therefore is most proper for making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> or instruments which we would have free from any alterations by heat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, as the rods of pendulums for clocks, &c. So likewise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of yards or feet should be made of iron, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> may be as nearly as possible the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter.\n\nThe expansion of lead and tin, by only one flame, is nearly the same; that is, almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of the expansion of iron. It is likewise observable, that the flames placed together, cause a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> than when they have a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between them; iron in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, being expanded 117 degrees, and only 109 in the latter; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is obvious.\n\nBy comparing the expansions of the same metal produced by one, two, three, or more flames, it appears that two flames do not cause double the expansion of one, nor three flames three times that expansion, but always Pyrometer legs; and these expansions differ so much the more from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of flames as there are more flames acting at the same time.\n\nIt is also observable, that metals are not expanded equally at the time of their melting, but some more some less. Thus tin began to run when rarefied 219 degrees; whereas brass was expanded 377 degrees, and yet was far from melting.\n\nMr Ellicot found, upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a>, that the expansion of bars of different metals, as nearly of the same dimensions as possible, by the same degree of heat, were as follow:\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a>, Silver, Brass, Copper, Iron, Steel, Lead,\n\\( \\frac{73}{103} \\) \\( \\frac{95}{89} \\) \\( \\frac{60}{56} \\) \\( \\frac{149}{155} \\)\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> difference between the expansions of iron and brass has been applied with good success to remedy the irregularities in pendulums arising from heat. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">PENDULUM</a>.\n\nMr Graham used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> alterations, in length, of metal bars, by advancing the point of a micrometer-screw, till it sensibly stopped against the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to be measured.

De Luc, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a hint suggested to him by Mr Ramsden. The basis of this instrument is a rectangular piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> two feet and a half long, 15 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and one inch and a half thick; and to this all the other parts are fixed. This is mounted in the manner of a table, with four deal legs, each a foot long and an inch...\nPyrometer inch and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> fitted near its four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, and kept together at the other ends by four firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-pieces. This small table is suspended by a hook to a stand; the board being in a vertical situation in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of its grain, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> its legs forward in such a manner as that the cross-pieces which join them may form a frame, placed vertically facing the observer. This frame sustains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, which is firmly fixed in another frame that moves in the former by means of grooves, but with a very considerable degree of tightness; the friction of which may be increased by the pressure of four screws. The inner sliding frame, which is likewise of deal, keeps the tube of the microscope in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position, and in great part without the frame, inasmuch that the end which carries the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> is but little within the space between the frame and the board. This microscope is constructed in such a manner that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> observed may be an inch distant from the lens; and it has a wire which is situated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of the glasses, in which the objects appear reversed. At the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> there is a piece of deal, an inch and a half thick and two inches broad, laid in a horizontal direction from the board to the top of the frame. To this piece the rods of the different substances, whose expansion by heat is to be measured, are suspended: one end of it slides into a socket, which is cut in the thickness of the board; and the other end, which rests upon the frame, meets there with a screw, which makes the piece move backward and forward, to bring the objects to the focus of the microscope.\n\nThere is a cork very strongly driven through a hole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PYROPHORUS\">Pyrophorus</a>, bored vertically through this piece; and in another Pyrophorus, vertical hole made through the cork, the rods are fixed at the top; so that they hang only, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> is not counteracted by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>. In order to heat the rods, a cylindrical bottle of thin glass, about 21 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and four inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, is placed in the inside of the machine, upon a stand independent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the apparatus. In this bottle the rods are suspended at a little less than an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from one of the insides, in order to have them near the microscope. Into this bottle is poured water of different degrees of heat, which must be stirred about, by moving upwards and downwards, at one of the sides of the bottle, a little piece of wood, fastened horizontally at the end of a stick: in this water is hung a thermometer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of which reaches to the middle of the height of the rods. During these operations the water rises to the cork, which thus determines the length of the heated part; the bottle is covered, to prevent the water from cooling too rapidly at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>; and a thin case of brass prevents the vapour from fixing upon the piece of deal to which the rods are fixed.\n\nPyrophorus, formed of \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1, fire, and \u03c6\u03c9\u03c2, I bear, in chemistry, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> usually given to that substance called by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> phosphorus; a chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> possessing the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of kindling spontaneously when exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.

He established a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principle was, That there is nothing true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or wrong, honest or dishonest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> or unjust; or that there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> standard of any thing beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, and that uncertainty and doubt belong to every thing. From this continual seeking after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and never finding it, the sect obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Sceptics or Pyrrhonians, from the founder, who is said to have acted upon his own principles, and to have carried his scepticism to such a ridiculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>, that his friends were obliged to accompany him wherever he went, that he might not be run over by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> precipices. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this was true, it was not without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> that he was ranked among those whose intellects were disturbed by intense study.

Eratothenes affirms, that in the 48th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a> *, when he was very young, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Ephebean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, he was a victor at the Olympic games. Hence Dr. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, in his Chron. of the 43rd Olympiad; whilst Lloyd \u2020, who denies that the Olympic victor was the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> with the Two Different Philosophers, places it about the 3rd year of the 48th Olympiad. Mr. Dodwell \u00a7 differs from both, and wishes to fix the birth of Pythagoras in the 4th year of the 52d Olympiad. Of the arguments of these learned writers, Le Clerc has given a summary in the Biblioth\u00e8que Choiseul, tom. x. p. 81. &c. and from a review of the whole, it would appear that he was not born earlier than the 4th year of the 43rd Olympiad, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> later than the 4th year of the 52d; but in what particular year of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> his birth took place, cannot with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of certainty be ascertained. It is generally believed that he was born in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a>, and that he flourished about 500 years before Christ, in the time of Tarquin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Rome*. His father Mnesarchus, who is thought by some to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPIDARY\">lapidary</a>, and by others a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, appears to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, and to have bestowed upon his son the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>.\n\nJamblicus \u2020 relates a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of wonderful stories respecting Pythagoras's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, his birth, and early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and represents him even in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> as a prodigy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and manly ferocity. But most of these idle tales confute themselves, afford nothing of importance to be depended upon, and only prove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a>, carelessness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of their author. Of his childhood and early education we know nothing, except that he was first instructed in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> by Creophilus, and afterwards in Scyrus by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHERECYDES\">Pherecydes</a>. According to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the times he was made acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> and music; eloquence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a> became his private studies, and in gymnastic exercises he often bore the palm for strength and dexterity. He first distinguished himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> at the Olympic games, where, beside gaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>, he is said to have excited the highest admiration by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of his person, and the brilliancy of his understanding.\nSoon after his appearance at these games, Pythagoras commenced his travels in quest of knowledge. He first visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, where, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of Polycrates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of Samos, he obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMASIS\">Amasis</a>, king of Egypt, by whose influence, combined with his own fidelity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, and perseverance, he at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> gained the confidence of the priests; from whom he learned their sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of symbolical learning. In Egypt, too, he became acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and the true solar system; and, before he left that country, made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of all the learning for which it was so famed among the nations of antiquity.\n\nHe afterwards visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> and Chaldea, where from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGI\">Magi</a> he learnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>, the interpreting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, and astronomy. He is likewise said to have travelled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, to have conversed with the Gymnosophists, and to have acquired from them a knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and literature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>; and such was his ardour in the pursuit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, that in quest of it, we are told by Cicero*, he crossed many seas, and travelled on foot through many barbarous nations.\n\nAfter Pythagoras had spent many years in gathering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> on every subject, especially respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the gods, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, he returned to his native island, and attempted to make his knowledge useful by instituting a school for the instruction of his countrymen. Failing of success in this laudable undertaking, he repaired to Delos, where he pretended to receive moral dogmas from the priests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>. He also visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>, where he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a> into the most sacred mysteries of Greece. He went likewise to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIS\">Elis</a>, and again assisted at the Olympic games; where in the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> he was saluted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOPHIST\">sophist</a> or wise man, which he declined for one more humble. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOLOGY\">Philology</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 1, and Philosophy, No. 1.\n\nHe returned to Samos enriched with mythological learning and mysterious rites, and again instituted a school. His mysterious symbols and oracular precepts made this attempt more successful than the former had been; but meeting with some opposition, or being detected in some pious frauds, he suddenly left Samos, retired to Magna Grecia, and settled at Crotona.\n\nHere he founded the Italic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> (see Philosophy, No. 20.); and his mental and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> accomplishments, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of his distant travels, and his Olympic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, soon procured him numerous pupils. His bold and manly eloquence and graceful delivery attracted the most illustrious, and produced a remarkable change in the morals of the people of Crotona. His influence was increased by the regularity of his own example, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to his precepts. He punctually attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> of the gods, and paid his devotions at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; he lived upon the purest and most innocent food, clothed himself like the priests of Egypt, and by his continual purifications and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> offerings appeared to be superior in sanctity to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of mankind. He endeavoured to assuage the passions of his scholars with verses and numbers, and made a practice of composing his own mind every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, by playing on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a>, and fingering along with it the psalms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a>. To avoid the temptations of ease and the seductions of idleness, bodily exercises also made a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Pythagoras' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>.\n\nAt Crotona he had a public school for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> benefit of the people, in which he taught them their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, praising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and condemning vice; and particularly instructing them in the duties of social life. Beside this, he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, which he denominated xanopoeion, in which there were two classes of students, viz. \u03b5\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af, who were also called \u03b1\u1f50\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, and \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af. The former of these were probationers, and were kept under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> examen. A silence of five years was imposed upon them; which Aepuleius thinks was intended to teach them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; but Clemens Alexandrinus thinks it was for the purpose of abstracting their minds from sensible objects, and inuring them to the pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>. The latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of scholars were called genuini, perfecti, mathematici, and, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a>. They alone were admitted to the knowledge of the arcana and depths of Pythagorean discipline, and were taught the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of ciphers and hieroglyphic writings.\n\nClemens observes, that these orders corresponded very exactly to those among the Hebrews; for in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPHETS\">prophets</a> there were two classes, viz. the sons of the prophets, who were the scholars, and the doctors or masters, who were also called perfecti; and among the Levites, the novices or tyros, who had their quinquennial exercises, by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>. Lastly, even among the proselytes there were two orders; \u03b5\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af, or proselytes of the gate; and \u03b5\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af or perfecti, proselytes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a>. He adds, it is highly probable, that Pythagoras himself had been a proselyte of the gate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not of the covenant. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">Gale</a> endeavours to prove that Pythagoras borrowed his philosophy from that of the Jews; to this end producing the authorities of many of the fathers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out the tracks and footsteps of Moses in several parts of Pythagoras' doctrine. But we believe the learned author was misled by the Christian Platonists.\n\nThe authority of Pythagoras among his pupils was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, that it was even deemed a crime to dispute his word; and their arguments were considered as infallibly convincing, if they could enforce them by adding, that \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> said so;\" an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which afterwards became proverbial in jurare in verba magistris. This influence over his school was soon extended to the world, and even his pupils themselves divided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of the people with their master; and the rules and legislators of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Greece, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, boasted of being the disciples of Pythagoras. To give more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> to his exhortations, as some writers mention, Pythagoras retired into a subterraneous cave, where his mother sent him intelligence of every thing which happened during his absence. After a certain number of months he again reappeared on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> with a grim and ghastly countenance, and declared in the assembly of the people that he was returned from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>. From similar exaggerations it has been asserted that he appeared at the Olympic games with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> thigh, and that he could write in letters of blood whatever he pleased on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-LOOKING_GLASS\"><a class=\"xre</a>f\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glass; and that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> it opposite to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, when full, all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> which were on the glass became\nPythagoras became legible on the moon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISC\">disc</a>. They also relate, that by some magical words he tamed a bear, flopped the flight of an eagle, and appeared on the same day and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> in the cities of Crotona and Metapontum, &c.\n\nAt length his singular doctrines, and perhaps his strenuously asserting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of the people against their tyrannical governors, excited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, and raised a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> against him; which soon became so outrageous as to oblige him to fly for his life. His friends fled to Rhegium; and he himself, after being refused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> by the Locrians, fled to Metapontum, where he was obliged to take refuge in the temple of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">muses</a>, and where it is said he died of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a> about 497 years before Christ. Reflecting the time, place, and manner of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, however, there are various opinions, and many think it uncertain when, where, or in what manner, he ended his days. After his death his followers paid the same respect to him as was paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> gods; they erected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of him, converted his house at Crotona into a temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CERES\">Ceres</a>, appealed to him as a deity, and swore by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>.\n\nPythagoras married Theano of Crotona, or, according to others, of Crete, by whom he had two sons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELEMACHUS\">Telemachus</a> and Mnesarchus, who, after his death, took care of his school. He is said also to have had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> called Damo.\n\nWhether he left any writings behind him is disputed. It seems probable, however, that he left none, and that such as went under his name were written by some of his followers. The golden verses which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROCLES\">Hierocles</a> illustrated with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a>, have been ascribed to Epicharmus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMPEDOCLES\">Empedocles</a>, and contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> summary of his popular doctrines. From this circumstance, and from the mysterious secrecy with which he taught, our information concerning his doctrine and philosophy is very uncertain, and cannot always be depended on.\n\nThe purpose of philosophy, according to the system of Pythagoras, is to free the mind from incumbrances, and to raise it to the contemplation of immutable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and the knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> and spiritual objects. To bring the mind to this state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of some difficulty, and requires a variety of intermediate steps. Mathematical science was with him the first step to wisdom, because it inures the mind to contemplation, and takes a middle course between corporeal and incorporeal beings. The whole science he divided into two parts, numbers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>; and each of these he subdivided into two others, the former into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> and music, and the latter into magnitude at rest and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; the former of which comprehends geometry, and the latter astronomy. Arithmetic he considered as the noblest science, and an acquaintance with numbers as the highest good. He considered numbers as the principles of every thing; and divided them into scientific and intelligible. Scientific number is the production of the powers involved in unity, and its return to the same; number is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a>, but is the source of that infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISIBILITY\">divisibility</a> into equal parts which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of all bodies. Intelligible numbers are those which existed in the divine mind before all things. They are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHETYPE\">archetype</a> of the world, and the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of beings. Of the Monad, Duad, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TRIAD\">Triad</a>, Tetrad, and Decad, various explanations have been given by Pythagoras, various authors; but nothing certain or important is known of them. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, numbers were used by Pythagoras as symbolical representations of the first principles and forms of nature, and especially of those eternal and immutable essences which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> denominated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>; and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the Monad was the simple root from which he conceived numbers to proceed, and as such, analogous to the simple essence of deity; from whence, according to his system, the various properties of nature proceeded.\n\nMusic followed numbers, and was useful in raising the mind above the dominion of the passions. Pythagoras considered it as a science to be reduced to mathematical principles and proportions, and is said to have discovered the musical chords from the circumstance of several men successively striking with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMMERS\">hammers</a> a piece of heated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANVIL\">anvil</a>. This story Dr Burney* <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Music, discredits; but allows, from the uniform testimony of all writers ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, that he invented the harp, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONOCHORD\">monochord</a> or monochord, (see Monochord). The music of the spheres, of which every one has heard, was a most fanciful doctrine of Pythagoras. It was produced, he imagined, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> striking on the other through which in their motion they passed; and he considered their musical proportions as exact, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>.\n\nPythagoras, as we have already seen, learned geometry in Egypt; but by investigating many new theorems, and by digressing its principles, he reduced it to a more regular science. A geometrical point, which he defines to be a monad, or unity with position, he says corresponds to unity in arithmetic, a line to two, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERFICIES\">superficies</a> to three, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> to four. He discovered several of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> of Euclid; and on discovering the 47th of book 11, he is said to have offered a hecatomb to the gods; but as he was averse to animal sacrifices, this assertion is surely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>. His great progress in astronomical science has been mentioned elsewhere. See Astronomy, No 11, 22. and Philosophy, No 15, 16.\n\nWisdom, according to Pythagoras, is convertible with those objects which are naturally immutable, eternal, and incorruptible; and its end is to assimilate the human mind to the divine, and to qualify us to join the assembly of the gods. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">Active</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a> prescribes rules and precepts for the conduct of life, and leads us to the practice of public and private virtue. On these heads many of his precepts were excellent, and some of them were whimsical and useless. Theoretical philosophy treats of nature and its origin, and is, according to Pythagoras, the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. It included all the profound mysteries which he taught, of which but little is now known. God he considers as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> mind, diffused through all things, and the self-moving principle of all things (\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd), and of whom every human soul is a portion. Cicero de Senect. It is very probable, that he conceived of the Deity as a subtle fire, eternal, active, and intelligent; which is not inconsistent with the idea of incorporeality, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> understood that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>. This Deity was primarily combined with the chaotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> matter, but he had the power of separating himself, and since the separation he has remained distinct. The learned Cudworth\nPythagoras, worth contends, that Pythagoras maintained a trinity of hypotheses in the divine nature, similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATONIC\">Platonic</a> triad (see PLATONISM). We cannot say that his arguments appear to have much force; but we think the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> which he wishes to establish extremely probable, as Plato certainly drew his doctrine from some of the countries which Pythagoras had visited before him.\n\nSubordinate to the Deity there were in the Pythagorean creed three orders of intelligences, gods, demons, and heroes, of different degrees of excellence and dignity. These, together with the human soul, were considered as emanations from the Deity, the particles of subtle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> assuming a grosser clothing the farther they receded from the fountain. Hierocles defines a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> to be a rational mind united with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> body. God himself was represented under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of monad, and the subordinate intelligences as numbers derived from and included in unity. Man is considered as consisting of an elementary nature, and a divine or rational soul. His soul, a self-moving principle, is composed of two parts; the rational, seated in the brain; and the irrational, including the passions, in the heart. In both these respects he participates with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>, whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERAMENT\">temperament</a> of their body, &c., allows not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> rationally. The sensitive soul perishes; the other assumes an ethereal vehicle, and passes to the region of the dead, till sent back to the earth to inhabit some other body, brutal or human. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEMPSYCHOSIS\">METEMPSYCHOSIS</a>.\n\nIt was unquestionably this notion which led Pythagoras and his followers to deny themselves the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, and to be so peculiarly merciful to animals of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Some authors, however, say, that flesh and beans, the use of which he also forbade, were prohibited, because he supposed them to have been produced from the same purified matter, from which, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of the world, man was formed.\n\nOf the symbols of Pythagoras little is known. They have been religiously concealed; and though they have awakened much curiosity, and occasioned many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> conjectures, they still appear to us dark and trifling. As a specimen we give the following: \"Adore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of the whistling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. Stir not the fire with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>. Turn aside from an edged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOOL\">tool</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">Pass</a> not over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>. Setting out on a journey, turn not back, for the furies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> return with you. Breed nothing that hath crooked talons. Receive not a swallow into your house. Look not in a mirror by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. At a sacrifice pare not your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>. Eat not the heart or brain. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">Taste</a> not that which hath fallen from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">Break</a> not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">Sleep</a> not at noon.

Breed a cock, but do not sacrifice it, for it is sacred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and moon. Plant mallows in thy garden, but eat them not. Abstain from beans.\"\n\nThe following precepts are more important: \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIS\">Dis</a>- course not of Pythagorean doctrines without light. Above all things govern your tongue. Engrave not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of God in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>. Quit not your station without the command of your general. Remember that the paths of virtue and of vice resemble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> Y. To this symbol Persius refers,\" when he says,\n\nEt ubi quae Samios diduxit litera ramos,\nSurgentem dextro manu travi limite collem.\n\nThere has the Sannian Y's instructive make\nPointed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> thy doubtful foot should take;\nThere warn'd thy raw and yet unpractis'd youth,\nTo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> path of truth.\n\nThe scantiness and uncertainty of our information respecting Pythagoras, renders a regular and complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his life and doctrines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. A modern author of profound erudition, pronounces him to have been unquestionably the wisest man that ever lived, if his masters the Egyptian priests must not be excepted. This is saying a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> too much; but that he was one of the most distinguished philosophers of antiquity, or, as Cicero expresses it, vir praestantissima sapientia, appears very evident; and his moral character has never been impeached. The mysterious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> which he threw over his doctrines, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> insanity of some of his symbols, have indeed subjected him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of imposture, and perhaps the charge is not wholly groundless: but when we consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which he lived, and the nature of the people with whom he had to deal, who would in all probability have resented more open innovations, even this will not appear so blamable as at first sight we are apt to think it; and it is worthy of notice, that the worst stories of this kind have come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to us in a very questionable shape, and with much probability appear to be false.","sp":213,"ep":216},{"h":"PYTHAGOREANS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers, so called from being the followers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>.

Some have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMMET\">plummet</a> suspended from the centre, and are furnished with sights to look through.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and most useful quadrants are the common surveying quadrant, astronomical quadrant, Adams's quadrant, Cole's quadrant, Gunter's quadrant, Hadley's quadrant, horodical quadrant, Sutton's or Collins's quadrant, and the clinical quadrant, &c. Of each of which in order.\n\n1. The common surveying quadrant, is made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, wood, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> substance; the limb of which is divided into 90\u00b0, and each of these farther divided into as many equal parts as the space <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> allow, either diagonally or otherwise. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> one of the semidiameters are fitted two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> sights; and to the centre is sometimes also fixed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABEL\">label</a>, or moveable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> two other sights; but in lieu of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> sights there is sometimes fitted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>; also from the centre there is hung a thread with a plummet; and on the under side or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the instrument is fitted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> and socket, by means of which it may be put into any position. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> use of it is for taking angles in a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, comprehended under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> going\nQuadrant. from the centre of the instrument, one of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, and the other is directed to some visible point. But besides the parts already described, there is frequently added on the face, near the centre, a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARTMENT\">compartment</a>, called the quadrant, or geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUADRAT\">Quadrat</a>.\n\nThis quadrant may be used in different situations: for observing heights or depths, its plane must be disposed perpendicularly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>; but to take horizontal distances, its plane is disposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> thereto. Again, heights and distances may be taken two ways, viz. by means of the fixed sights and plummet, or by the label: As to which, and the manner of measuring angles, see Geometry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">Mensuration</a>.\n\n2. The astronomical quadrant is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> one, usually made of brass, or wooden bars faced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> plates; having its limb nicely divided, either diagonally or otherwise, into degrees, minutes, and seconds; and furnished with two telecopes, one fixed on the side of the quadrant, and the other moveable about the centre, by means of the screw. There are also dented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> which serve to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the instrument to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> or phenomenon.\u2014The use of this curious instrument, in taking observations of the sun, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, and fixed stars, is obvious; for being turned horizontally upon its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, by means of the telescope, till the object is seen through the moveable telescope, then the degrees, &c. cut by the index give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> required. See Astronomy Index.\n\n3. Cole's quadrant is a very useful instrument invented by Mr Benjamin Cole. It consists of five parts, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> (fig. 1); the quadrantal arch DE; three vanes A, B, C; and the vernier FG. The staff is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of wood about two feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> and a quarter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and of sufficient thickness to prevent it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> or warping. The quadrantal arch is also of wood; and is divided into degrees, and third-parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches; to its extremities are fitted two radii, which meet in the centre of the quadrant by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, round which it easily moves. The sight-vane A is a thin piece of brass, almost two inches in height and one broad, placed perpendicularly on the end of the staff A, by the help of two screws passing through its foot. Through the middle of this vane is drilled a small hole, through which the coincidence or meeting of the horizon and solar spot is to be viewed. The horizon vane B is about an inch broad, and two inches and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, having a slit cut through it of near an inch long and a quarter of an inch broad; this vane is fixed in the centre-pin of the instrument, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> position, by the help of two screws passing through its foot, whereby its position with respect to the sight vane is always the same, their angles of inclination being equal to 45 degrees. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>-vane C is composed of two brass plates. The one, which serves as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>, is about four inches and a half long, and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch broad, being pinned at one end to the upper limb of the quadrant by a screw, about which it has a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>; the other end lies in the arch, and the lower edge of the arm is directed to the middle of the centre-pin; the other plate, which is properly the vane, is about two inches long, being fixed perpendicularly to the other plate, at about half an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from that end next the arch; this vane may be used either by its shade or by the solar spot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> by a convex <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> placed therein. And, because the Quadrant wood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is often apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARP\">warp</a> or twist, therefore this vane may be rectified by the help of a screw, so that the warping of the instrument may occasion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, which is performed in the following manner: Set the line G on the vernier against a degree on the upper limb of the quadrant, and turn the screw on the backside of the limb forward or backward, till the hole in the sight-vane, the centre of the gials, and the sunk spot in the horizon-vane, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in a right line.\n\nTo find the sun's altitude by this instrument: Turn your back to the sun, holding the instrument by the staff with your right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, so that it be in a vertical plane passing through the sun; apply your eye to the sight-vane, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through that and the horizon-vane till you see the horizon; with the left hand slide the quadrantal arch upwards, until the solar spot or shade, cast by the shade-vane, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> directly on the spot or slit in the horizon-vane; then will that part of the quadrantal arch, which is raised above G or S (according as the observation respected either the solar spot or shade) show the altitude of the sun at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a> altitude be required, the observation must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>; and as the sun approaches the meridian, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> will appear through the horizon-vane, and then is the observation finished; and the degrees and minutes, counted as before, will give the sun's meridian altitude: or the degrees counted from the lower limb upwards will give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a>-distance.\n\n4. Adams's quadrant differs only from Cole's quadrant in having an horizontal vane, with the upper part of the limb lengthened; so that the glass, which casts the solar spot on the horizon-vane, is at the same distance from the horizon-vane as the sight-vane at the end of the index.\n\n5. Gunter's quadrant, so called from its inventor Edmund Gunter, besides the usual apparatus of other quadrants, has a stereographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> on the plane of the equinoctial. It has also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> of the months, next to the divisions of the limb.\n\nUse of Gunter's quadrant. 1. To find the sun's meridian altitude for any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, or the day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> for any given meridian altitude. Lay the thread to the day of the month in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> next the limb; and the degree it cuts in the limb is the sun's meridian altitude. Thus the thread, being laid on the 15th of May, cuts 59\u00b0 30', the altitude sought; and, contrariwise, the thread, being set to the meridian altitude, shows the day of the month. 2. To find the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of the day. Having put the bead, which slides on the thread, to the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECLIPTIC\">ecliptic</a>, observe the sun's altitude by the quadrant; then, if the thread be laid over the same in the limb, the bead will fall upon the hour required. Thus suppose on the 10th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, the sun being then in the beginning of Taurus, I observe the sun's altitude by the quadrant to be 36\u00b0; I place the bead to the beginning of Taurus in the ecliptic, and lay the thread over 36\u00b0 of the limb; and find the bead to fall on the hour-line marked three and nine; accordingly the hour is either nine in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> or three in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>. Again, laying the bead on the hour given, having first rectified or put it to the sun's place, the degree cut by the thread on the limb gives the altitude. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">Note</a>, the bead may be rectified otherwise, by bringing...\nQuadrant: bringing the thread to the day of the month, and the bead to the hour-line of 12. 3. To find the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLINATION\">declination</a> from his place given, and contrariwise. Set the bead to the sun's place in the ecliptic, move the thread to the line of declination, and the bead will cut the degree of declination required. Contrariwise, the bead being adjusted to a given declination, and the thread moved to the ecliptic, the bead will cut the sun's place.\n\n4. The sun's place being given, to find his right ascension, or contrariwise. Lay the thread on the sun's place in the ecliptic, and the degree it cuts on the limb is the right ascension sought. Contrariwise, laying the thread on the right ascension, it cuts the sun's place in the ecliptic. 5. The sun's altitude being given, to find his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AZIMUTH\">azimuth</a>, and contrariwise. Rectify the bead for the time, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> article, and observe the sun's altitude; bring the thread to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> of that altitude; thus the bead will give the azimuth sought, among the azimuth lines. 6. To find the hour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> from some of the five stars laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on the quadrant. (1.) Put the bead to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> you would observe, and find how many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> it is off the meridian, by article 2. (2.) Then, from the right ascension of the star, subtract the sun's right ascension converted into hours; and mark the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>; which difference, added to the observed hour of the star from the meridian, shows how many hours the sun is gone from the meridian, which is the hour of the night. Suppose on the 15th of May the sun is in the 4th degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEMINI\">Gemini</a>, I set the bead to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCTURUS\">Arcturus</a>; and, observing his altitude, find him to be in the west about 52\u00b0 high, and the bead to fall on the hour-line of two in the afternoon; then will the hour be 11 hours 50 minutes past noon, or 10 minutes short of midnight: for 62\u00b0, the sun's right ascension, converted into time, makes four hours eight minutes; which, subtracted from 13 hours 58 minutes, the right ascension of Arcturus, the remainder will be nine hours 50 minutes; which added to two hours, the observed distance of Arcturus from the meridian, shows the hour of the night to be 11 hours 50 minutes.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURAL\">mural</a> quadrant has been already described under the article Astronomy. It is a most important instrument, and has been much improved by Mr. Ramsden, who has distinguished himself by the accuracy of his divisions, and by the manner in which he finishes the planes by working them in a vertical position. He places the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMB_LINE\">plumb-line</a> behind the instrument, that there may be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for removing it when we take an observation near the zenith. His manner of suspending the glass, and that of throwing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the object-glass and on the divisions at the same time, are new, and improvements that deserve to be noticed. Those of eight feet, which he has made for the observatories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a> and Vilna, have been examined by Dr. Maskelyne; and the greatest error does not exceed two seconds and a half. That of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> is in a very advanced state. The mural quadrant, of six feet, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLENHEIM\">Blenheim</a>, is a most admirable instrument. It is fixed to four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, which turn on two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PIVOTS\">pivots</a>, so that it may be put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and to the south in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. It was for this instrument Mr. Ramsden invented a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of rectifying the arc of 90 degrees, on which an able astronomer had started some difficulties; but by means of an horizontal line and a plumb-line, forming a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, without touching the circle, Quadrant showed him that there was not an error of a single second in the 90 degrees; and that the difference was occasioned by a mural quadrant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">Bird</a>, in which the arc of 90 degrees was too great by several seconds, and which had never been rectified by so nice a method as that of Mr. Ramsden.\n\nBut the quadrant is not the instrument which stands highest in Mr. Ramsden's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; it is the complete circle: and he has demonstrated to M. de la Lande, that the former must be laid aside, if we would arrive at the utmost exactness of which an observation is capable. His principal reasons are: 1. The least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in the centre is perceived by the two diametrically opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. 2. The circle being worked on the turn, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> is always of the greatest accuracy, which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to obtain in the quadrant. 3. We may always have two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the same arc, which will serve for the verification of each other. 4. The first point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> may be verified every day with the utmost facility. 5. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of the metal is uniform, and cannot produce any error. 6. This instrument is a meridian glass at the same time. 7. It also becomes a moveable azimuth circle by adding a horizontal circle beneath its axis, and then gives the refractions independent of the measurement of time.\n\n6. Hadley's quadrant is an instrument of vast utility both in navigation and practical astronomy. It derives its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from Mr. Hadley, who first published an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it, though the first thought originated with the celebrated Dr. Hooke, and was completed by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton (see Astronomy, No. 32, and also No. 17, and 22.). The utility of this quadrant arises from the accuracy and precision with which it enables us to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>; and to it is navigation much indebted for the very great and rapid advances it has made of late years. It is easy to manage, and of extensive use, requiring no peculiar steadiness of hand, nor any such fixed basis as is necessary to other astronomical instruments. It is used as an instrument for taking angles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> surveying, and with equal facility at the mast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> as upon the deck, by which its sphere of observation is much extended; for supposing many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> to be visible from the mast head, and only one from deck, no useful observation can be made by any other instrument. But by this, angles may be taken at the mast head from the one visible object with great exactness; and further, taking angles from heights, as hills, or a ship mast's head, is almost the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of describing exactly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of shoals.\n\nIt has been objected to the use of this instrument for surveying, that it does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the horizontal angles, by which alone a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> can be laid down. This objection, however true in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, may be reduced in practice by a little caution; and Mr. Adams has given very good directions for doing so.\n\nNotwithstanding, however, the manifest superiority of this instrument over those that were in use at the time of its publication, it was many years before the sailors could be persuaded to adopt it, and lay aside their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> and inaccurate instruments; so great is the difficulty to remove <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, and emancipate the mind from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> of opinion. No instrument has undergone, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, more changes\nQuadrant than the quadrant of Hadley; of the various alterations, many had no better foundation than the caprice of the makers, who by these attempts have often rendered the instrument more complicated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, and more difficult in use, than it was in its original state.\n\nIt is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of this instrument, derived from the laws of reflection, that half degrees on the arc answer to whole ones in the angles measured: hence an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTANT\">octant</a>, or the eighth part of a circle, or 45 degrees on the arch, serves to measure 90 degrees; and sextants will measure an angular distance of 120 degrees, though the arch of the instrument is no more than 60 degrees. It is from this property that foreigners <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> that instrument an octant, which we usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> a quadrant, and which in effect it is. This property reduces indeed considerably the bulk of the instrument: but at the same time it calls for the utmost accuracy in the divisions, as every error on the arch is doubled in the observation.\n\nAnother essential, and indeed an invaluable, property of this instrument, whereby it is rendered peculiarly advantageous in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> observations, is, that it is not liable to be disturbed by the ship's motion; for provided the mariner can see distinctly the two objects in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of his instrument, no motion nor vacillation of the ship will injure his observation.\n\nThirdly, the errors to which it is liable are readily discovered and easily rectified, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> and use of it is facile and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\n\nTo find whether the two surfaces of any one of the reflecting glasses be parallel, apply your eye at one end of it, and observe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of some object reflected very obliquely from it; if that image appear single, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-defined about the edges, it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the surfaces are parallel: on the contrary, if the edge of the reflected images appear mitted, as if it threw a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> from it, or separated like two edges, it is a proof that the two surfaces of the glass are inclined to each other: if the image in the speculum, particularly if that image be the sun, be viewed through a small telescope, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> will be more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>.\n\nTo find whether the surface of a reflecting glass be plane. Choose two distant objects, nearly on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with each other: hold the instrument in an horizontal position, view the left-hand object directly through the transparent part of the horizon-glass, and move the index till the reflected image of the other is seen below it in the silvered part; make the two images unite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> at the line of separation, then turn the instrument round slowly on its own plane, so as to make the united images move along the line of separation of the horizon-glass. If the images continue united without receding from each other, or varying their respective position, the reflecting surface is a good plane.\n\nTo find if the two surfaces of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or darkening glass are parallel and perfectly plane. This must be done by means of the sun when it is near the meridian, in the following manner: hold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEXTANT\">sextant</a> vertically, and direct the sight to some object in the horizon, or between you and the sky, under the sun; turn down the red glass and move the index till the reflected image of the sun is in contact with the object seen directly: fix then the index, and turn the red glass round in its square frame; view the sun's image and object immediately, and if the sun's image is neither raised nor depressed, but continues in Quadrant contact with the object below, as before, then the surfaces of the darkening glass are true.\n\nFor a more particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Hadley's quadrant, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of using it, see Navigation, Book II, chap. i.\n\nThis instrument has undergone several improvements since its first invention, and among these improvers must be ranked Mr Ramsden. He found that the essential parts of the quadrant had not a sufficient degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a>; the friction at the centre was too great, and in general the alidade might be moved several minutes without any change in the position of the mirror; the divisions were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> very inaccurate, and Mr Ramsden found that Abb\u00e9 de la Caille did not exceed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in estimating at five minutes the error to which an observer was liable in taking the distance between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> and a star; an error capable of producing a mistake of 50 leagues in the longitude. On this account Mr Ramsden changed the principle of construction of the centre, and made the instrument in such a manner as never to give an error of more than half a minute; and he has now brought them to such a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> it not more than six seconds in a quadrant of fifteen inches. Since the time of having improved them, Mr Ramsden has constructed an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; and in several which have been carried to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, the deficiency has been found no greater at their return than it had been determined by examinations before their being taken out. Mr Ramsden has made them from 15 inches to an inch and a half, in the latter of which the minutes are easily distinguishable; but he prefers for general use those of 10 inches, as being more easily handled than the greater, and at the same time capable of equal accuracy. See Sextant.\n\nA great improvement was also made in the construction of this quadrant by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Dollond, famous for his invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> telescopes. The glasses of the quadrants should be perfect planes, and have their surfaces perfectly parallel to one another. By a practice of several years, Mr Dollond found out methods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> them of this form to great exactness; but the advantage which should have arisen from the goodness of the glasses was often defeated by the index-glass being bent by the frame which contains it. To prevent this, Mr Dollond contrived the frame so that the glass lies on three points, and the part that presses on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of the glass has also three points opposite to the former. These points are made to confine the glass by three screws at the back, acting directly opposite to the points between which the glass is placed. The principal improvements, however, are in the methods of adjusting the glasses, particularly for the back-observation. The method formerly practised for adjusting that part of the instrument by means of the opposite horizons at sea, was attended with so many difficulties that it was scarcely ever used: for so little dependence could be placed on the observations taken this way, that the best Hadley's sextants made for the purpose of observing the distances of the moon from the sun or fixed stars have been always made without the horizon-glass for the back-observation; for want of which, many valuable observations of the sun and moon have been lost, when their distance exceeded 120 degrees.\nQuadrant, grees. To make the adjustment of the back-observation easy and exact, he applied an index to the back horizon-glas, by which it may be moved in a parallel position to the index-glas, in order to give it the two adjustments in the same manner as the fore-horizon-glas is adjusted. Then, by moving the index to which the back-horizon-glas is fixed exactly 90 degrees (which is known by the divisions made for that purpose), the glas will thereby be set at right angles to the index-glas, and will be properly adjusted for use; and the observations may be made with the same accuracy by this as by the fore-observation. To adjust the horizon-glasses in the perpendicular position to the plane of the instrument, he contrived to move each of them by a single screw, which goes through the frame of the quadrant, and is turned by means of a milled head at the back; which may be done by the observer while he is looking at the object. To these improvements also he added a method, invented by Dr Malkelyne, of placing darkening-glasses behind the horizon-glasses. These, which serve for darkening the object seen by direct vision, in adjusting the instrument by the sun or moon, he placed in such a manner as to be turned behind the fore horizon-glas, or behind the back horizon-glas: there are three of these glasses of different degrees of darkness.\n\nWe have been the more particular in our description and use of Hadley's quadrant, as it is undoubtedly the best hitherto invented.\n\n7. Horodical quadrant, a pretty commodious instrument, so called from its use in telling the hour of the day.\u2014Its construction is this: From the centre of the quadrant, C, fig. 3, whose limb AB is divided into 90\u00b0, describe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a> circles at intervals at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; and to these add the signs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZODIAC\">zodiac</a>, in the order represented in the figure. Then applying a ruler to the centre C and the limb AB, mark upon the several parallels the degrees corresponding to the altitude of the sun when therein, for the given hours; connect the points belonging to the same hour with a curve line, to which add the number of the hour. To the radius CA fit a couple of sights, and to the centre of the quadrant C tie a thread with a plummet, and upon the thread a bead to slide. If now the thread be brought to the parallel wherein the sun is, and the quadrant directed to the sun, till a visual ray <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the sights, the bead will show the hour; for the plummet, in this situation, cuts all the parallels in the degrees corresponding to the sun's altitude. Since the bead is in the parallel which the sun describes, and through the degrees of altitude to which the sun is elevated every hour there pass hour lines, the bead must show the present hour. Some represent the hour-lines by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of circles, or even by straight lines, and that without any sensible error.\n\n8. Sutton's or Collins's quadrant (fig. 4.) is a stereographic projection of one quarter of the sphere between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROPICS\">tropics</a>, upon the plane of the ecliptic, the eye being in its north pole: it is fitted to the latitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. The lines running from the right hand to the left are parallels of altitude; and those crossing them are azimuths. The lesser of the two circles, bounding the projection, is one-fourth of the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>; the greater is one-fourth of that of Cancer. The two ecliptics are drawn from a point on the left edge of the quadrant, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the signs Quadrant, upon them; and the two horizons are drawn from the same point. The limb is divided both into degrees and time; and, by having the sun's altitude, the hour of the day may be found here to a minute. The quadrantal arches next the centre contain the calendar of months; and under them, in another arch, is the sun's declination. On the projection are placed several of the most noted fixed stars between the tropics; and the next below the projection is the quadrant and line of shadows. To find the time of the sun's rising or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPLITUDE\">amplitude</a>, his azimuth, hour of the day, &c., by this quadrant: lay the thread over the day and the month, and bring the bead to the proper ecliptic, either of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> or winter, according to the season, which is called rectifying; then, moving the thread, bring the bead to the horizon, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the thread will cut the limb in the time of the sun's rising or setting before or after six; and at the same time the bead will cut the horizon in the degrees of the sun's amplitude.\u2014Again, observing the sun's altitude with the quadrant, and supposing it found 45\u00b0 on the fifth of May, lay the thread over the fifth of May, bring the bead to the summer ecliptic, and carry it to the parallel of altitude 45\u00b0; in which case the thread will cut the limb at 55\u00b0 15', and the hour will be seen among the hour-lines to be either 41' past nine in the morning, or 19' past two in the afternoon.\u2014Lastly, the bead among the azimuths shows the sun's distance from the south 50\u00b0 41'. But note, that if the sun's altitude be less than what it is at six o'clock, the operation must be performed among those parallels above the upper horizon, the head being rectified to the winter ecliptic.\n\n9. Sinical quadrant (fig. 5.) consists of several concentric quadrantal arches, divided into eight equal parts by radii, with parallel right lines crossing each other at right angles. Now any one of the arches, as BC, may represent a quadrant of any great circle of the sphere, but is chiefly used for the horizon or meridian. If then BC be taken for a quadrant of the horizon, either of the sides, as AB, may represent the meridian; and the other side, AC, will represent a parallel, or line of east and west: and all the other lines, parallel to AB, will be also meridians; and all those parallel to AC, east and west lines, or parallels.\u2014Again, the eight spaces into which the arches are divided by the radii, represent the eight points of the compass in a quarter of the horizon; each containing 11\u00b0 15'. The arch BC is likewise divided into 90\u00b0, and each degree subdivided into 12, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a>-wise. To the centre is fixed a thread, which, being laid over any degree of the quadrant, serves to divide the horizon.\n\nIf the sinical quadrant be taken for a fourth part of the meridian, one side thereof, AB, may be taken for the common radius of the meridian and equator; and then the other, AC, will be half the axis of the world. The degrees of the circumference, BC, will represent degrees of latitude; and the parallels to the side AB, assumed from every point of latitude to the axis AC, will be radii of the parallels of latitude, as likewise the fine complement of those latitudes.\n\nSuppose, then, it be required to find the degrees of longitude contained in 83 of the lesser leagues in the parallel of 48\u00b0; lay the thread over 48\u00b0 of latitude on the circumference, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> thence the 83 leagues on\nQuadrant AB, beginning at A; this will terminate in H, allowing every small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> four leagues. Then tracing out the parallel HE, from the point H to the thread; the part AE of the thread shows that 125 greater or equinoctial leagues make 65\u00b0 15'; and therefore that the 83 lesser leagues AH, which make the difference of longitude of the course, and are equal to the radius of the parallel HE, make 65\u00b0 15' of the said parallel.\n\nIf the ship sails an oblique course, such course, besides the north and south greater leagues, gives lesser leagues easterly and westerly, to be reduced to degrees of longitude of the equator. But these leagues being made neither on the parallel of departure, nor on that of arrival, but in all the intermediate ones, we must find a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> parallel between them. To find this, we have on the instrument a scale of cross latitudes. Suppose then it were required to find a mean parallel between the parallels of 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0; with your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a> take the middle between the 40th and 60th degree on this scale: the middle point will terminate against the 51st degree, which is the mean parallel required.\n\nThe principal use of the nautical quadrant is to form triangles upon, similar to those made by a ship's way with the meridians and parallels; the sides of which triangles are measured by the equal intervals between the concentric quadrants and the lines N and S, E and W; and every fifth line and arch is made deeper than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. Now, suppose a ship to have sailed 150 leagues north-east, one fourth north, which is the third point, and makes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 33\u00b0 44' with the north part of the meridian: here are given the course and distance sailed, by which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> may be formed on the instrument similar to that made by the ship's course; and hence the unknown parts of the triangle may be found. Thus, supposing the centre A to represent the place of departure, count, by means of the concentric circles along the point the ship sailed on, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, 150 leagues: then in the triangle AED, similar to that of the ship's course, find AE = difference of latitude, and DE = difference of longitude, which must be reduced according to the parallel of latitude come to.\n\n10. Gunner's quadrant (fig. 6.), sometimes called gunner's square, is that used for elevating and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> cannon, mortars, &c., and consists of two branches either of brafs or wood, between which is a quadrantal arch divided into 90 degrees, beginning from the shorter branch, and furnished with a thread and plummet, as represented in the figure.\u2014The use of the gunner's quadrant is extremely easy; for if the longest branch be placed in the mouth of the piece, and it be elevated till the plummet cut the degree necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> a proposed object, the thing is done. Sometimes on one of the surfaces of the long branch are noted the division of diameters and weights of iron bullets, as also the bores of pieces.\n\nQuadrant of Altitude, is an appendage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> globe, consisting of a lamina, or lip of brafs, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of a quadrant of one of the great circles of the globe, and graduated. At the end, where the division terminates, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> riveted on, and furnished with a foresight, by means whereof the instrument is fitted on the meridian, and moveable round upon the rivet to all points of the horizon.\u2014Its use is to serve as a scale in measuring altitudes, ampliudes, azimuths, &c. See A-Quadrantal Astronomy.\n\nQuadrantal, in Antiquity, the name of a vessel in use among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> for the measuring of liquids. It was at first called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHORA\">amphora</a>; and afterwards quadrantal, from its form, which was square every way like a die. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> was 80 hogsheads, or pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which made 48 sextaries, two urnae, or eight congi.\n\nQuadrat, a mathematical instrument, called also a Geometrical Square, and Line of Shadows: it is frequently an additional member on the face of the common quadrant, as also on those of Gunter's and Sutton's quadrants.\n\nQuadrat, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">Printing</a>, a piece of metal used to fill up the void spaces between words, &c.

Thus, the finding of a square, which shall contain just as much surface or area as a circle, an ellipse, a triangle, &c., is the quadrature of a circle, ellipse, &c. The quadrature, especially among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> mathematicians, was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>. The quadrature of rectilineal figures is easily found, for it is merely the finding their areas or surfaces, i.e. their squares; for the squares of equal areas are easily found by only extracting the roots of the areas thus found. The quadrature of curvilinear spaces is of more difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>; and in this respect extremely little was done by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, except the finding the quadrature of the parabola by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>. In 1657, Sir Paul Neill, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Brouncker, and Sir Christopher Wren, geometrically demonstrated the equality of some curvilinear spaces to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> spaces; and soon after the like was proved both at home and abroad of other curves, and it was afterwards brought under an analytical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>; the first specimen of which was given to the public in 1688 by Mercator, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of Lord Brouncker's quadrature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYPERBOLA\">hyperbola</a>, by Dr Wallis's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of a fraction into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> by division. Sir Isaac Newton, however, had before discovered a method of attaining the quantity of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> curves analytically by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> before 1668. It is disputed between Sir Christopher Wren and Mr Huygens which of them first discovered the quadrature of any determinate cycloidal space. Mr Leibnitz afterwards found that of another space; and in 1669 Bernoulli discovered the quadrature of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFINITY\">infinity</a> of cycloidal spaces both segments and sectors, &c.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the ace of spades and ace of clubs are not mentioned, is, because they are always trumps in whatever suit that is played. The ace of spades being always the first, and the ace of clubs the third trump, for the cards ranked according to their value when trumps stand in the following order.\n\nHearts and diamonds, spadill, or the ace of spades; manill, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> of the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> suits; basto, the ace of clubs; ponte, the ace of hearts and diamonds; king, queen, knave, deuce, three, four, five, six; in all 12. Spades and clubs, spadill, the ace of spades, manill, the deuce of spades and clubs, basto the ace of clubs, king, queen, knave, seven, six, five, four, three; in all 11. It is here to be observed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARD\">card</a> which is manill and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> trump, is always the lowest in its suit when not trumps; and that the ace of hearts or diamonds, which when trump is above the king, is below the knave when not trump.\n\nThere are three matadors; spadill, manill, and baflo; the privilege of which is, that when the player has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other trumps but them, and trumps are led, he is not obliged to play them, but may play what card he thinks proper, provided, however, that the trump led is of an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>; but if spadill should be led, he that has manill or baflo only is obliged to play it; Quadrille, it is the same of manill baflo, with respect to the superior matador always forcing the inferior. Though there are properly but three matadores, nevertheless, all those trumps which follow the three first without interruption, are likewise called matadores; but the three first only enjoy the privilege above mentioned.\n\nEach person is to play as he judges most convenient for his own game. He is not to encourage his friend to play; but each person ought to know what to do when it is his turn to play. The stakes consist of seven equal mils or contracts, as they are sometimes called, comprising the ten counters and fives, which are given to each player. A mil is equal to ten fifts, and each fifth to ten counters: the value of the fifth is according to the players agreement, as also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOURS\">tours</a>, which are generally fixed at ten, and marked by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the corners of a card.\n\nIf the cards should happen not to be dealt right, or that there should be two cards of the same fort, as two deuces of spades, for example, there must be a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>; provided it is discovered before the cards are all played. The cards must likewise be dealt over again in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> a card is turned in dealing, as it might be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> to him who should have it; and of course if there should be several cards turned. There is no penalty for dealing wrong, he who does so must only deal again.\n\nWhen each player has got his ten cards, he that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the right hand of the dealer, after examining his game, and finding his hand fit to play, asks if they play; or if he has not a good hand, he passes, and so the second, third, and fourth. All the four may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>; but he that has spadill, after having thrown or named it, is obliged to play by calling a king. Whether the deal is played in this manner, or that one of the players has asked leave, nobody choosing to play without calling, the eldest hand must begin the play, first naming the suit, and the king which he calls; he who wins the trick plays another card, and so of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> till the game is finished. The tricks then are counted; and if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMBRE\">ombre</a>, that is, he who stands the game, has together with him who is the king called, six tricks, they have won and are paid the game, the consolation, and the matadores, if they have them, and divide what is upon the game, and the beaufit if there are any. But if they make only five tricks, it is a remise, and they are beafled, what goes upon the game, paying to the other players the consolation and the matadores. If the tricks are equally divided betwixt them, they are likewise beafled; and if they make only four tricks between them, it is a remise; if they make less they lose codill (A), and in that case they pay to their adversaries what they should have received if they had won; that is, the game, the consolation, and the matadores, if they have them, and are beafled what is upon the game: they who win codill, divide the stakes. The beaufit and every thing else that is paid, is paid equally betwixt the two losers; one half by him that calls, and the other half by him that is called, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> in case of codill as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\n\n(a) Codill is when those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the pool make more tricks than they who stand the game; which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a>-\nQuadrille; unless the ombre does not make three tricks, in which case he that is called is not only exempted from paying half the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a>, but also the game, the consolation, and the matadores if there are any, which the ombre in that case pays alone; and as well in case of a codill as a remise. This is done in order to oblige players not to play games that are unreasonable. There is nevertheless, one case in which if the ombre makes only one trick, he is not beasted alone, and that is, when not having a good hand he passes, and all the other players have passed likewise; he having spadill is obliged to play. Here it would be unjust to oblige him to make three or four tricks; in this case, therefore, he that is called pays one half of the loosing. For which reason he that has spadill with a bad hand, should pass, that if he is afterwards obliged to play by calling a king (which is called forced spadill), he may not be beasted alone. He that has once passed cannot be admitted to play; and he that has asked leave cannot refuse to play, unless anyone should offer to play without calling.\n\nHe that has four kings, may call a queen to one of his kings, except that which is trump. He that wants one or more kings, may call one of those kings; but in that case, he must make six tricks alone, and consequently he wins or loses alone. The king of that suit in which he plays cannot be called. No one should play out of his turn, although he is not beasted for so doing. If he who is not the eldest hand has the king called, and plays spadill, marjill, or balto, or even the king called in order to show that he is the friend, having other kings that he fears the ombre should trump, he is not to be allowed to go for the vote; he is even beasted, if it appears to be done with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a>. It is not permitted to show a hand though codill may already be won; that it may be seen whether the ombre is beasted alone. If the ombre or his friend shows their cards before they have made six tricks, thinking that they have made them, and there appears a possibility of preventing their making them, the other players can oblige them to play their cards as they think proper.\n\nA player need only name his suit when he plays, without calling a king. He who plays without calling must make six tricks alone to win; for all the other players are united against him, and they are to do what they can to prevent his winning. He who plays without calling, is admitted to play in preference to him who would play with calling; however, if he that has asked leave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> play without calling, he has the preference of the other who would force him. These are the two methods of play without calling that are called forced.\n\nAs he who plays without calling does not divide the winnings with any person, he consequently, when he loses, pays all by himself; if he loses by remise he is beasted, and pays each of the other players the consolation, the fans appeller (which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a>, but improperly, called the fans prendre), and the matadores if there are any; if he loses codill he is likewise beasted and pays to each player what he would have received from each if he had won. They who win codill divide what there is; and if there are any counters remaining, they belong to him of the three who shall have spadill or the highest trump the next deal. It is the same with regard to him who calls one of his own Quadrille kings; he wins alone or loses alone as in the other case, except the fans appeller, which he does not pay if he loses, or receive if he wins, although he plays alone.\n\nIf he plays fans appeller, though he may have a sure game, he is obliged to name his suit; which if he neglects to do, and shows his cards, and says \"I play fans appeller;\" in that case either of the other players can oblige him to play in what suit he pleases, although he should not have one trump in that suit.\n\nHe who has asked leave is not permitted to play fans appeller, unless he is forced; in which case, as was said before, he has the preference of the other that forces him.\n\nA player is not obliged to trump when he has none of the suit led, nor play a higher card in that suit if he has it, being at his option although he is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> player, and the trick should belong to the ombre; but he is obliged to play in the suit led if he can, otherwise he renounces. If he separates a card from his game and shows it, he is obliged to play it, if by not doing it the game may be prejudiced, or if he can give any intelligence to his friend; but especially if it should be a matador.\u2014He that plays fans appeller, or by calling himself, is not subject to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. He may turn the tricks made by the other players, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> what has been played as often as it is his turn to play, but not otherwise. Instead of turning a player's tricks, he turns and see his game, or shows it to the other players, he is beasted, together with him whose cards he turned; and each of them must pay one half of the beat.\n\nIf any one renounces, he is beasted as often as he has renounced and it is detected; but a renounce is not made till the trick is turned. If the renounce is discovered before the deal is finished, and has been detrimental to the game, the cards must be taken up again, and the game replayed from that trick where the renounce was made; but if the cards are all played, the beat is still made, and the cards must not be replayed; except there should be several renounces in the same deal; then they are to be played again, unless the cards should be mixed. If several beats are made in the same deal, they all go together, unless it is otherwise agreed at the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>; and when there are several beats, the greatest always goes first.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> advantage accrues from being eldest hand at quadrille, which often renders it very disagreeable to the rest of the players, being obliged to pass with a good hand unless they choose to play alone; and when it happens that the eldest hand having asked leave, the second player has three matadores, several trumps in back, and all small cards, he cannot then even play alone; and having no chance of being called, he must pass with this good hand. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of which, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> has been thought expedient to remedy this defect of the game; each player having an opportunity of availing himself of the goodness of his game, by adding to the usual method of playing the game that of the mediateur, and the favourite suit.\n\nThe first thing to be observed is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> for places, which is done in this manner: One of the players takes four cards; a king, a queen, a knave, and an ace; each player draws one of these cards; and commonly he who comes in last, draws first. The per-\nQuadrille, son who draws the king sits where he pleases, the queen at his right hand, the knave next the queen, and the ace on the left of the king. The king draws the favourite suit. The number of cards and persons is the same at this game as the other, and is played in the same manner.\n\nThe favourite suit is determined by drawing a card out of the pack, and is of the same suit, during the whole party, of the card so drawn.\n\nA king is the mediateur, which is demanded of the others by one of the players, who has a hand he expects to make five tricks of; and through the assistance of this king he can play alone and make six tricks.\n\nIn return for the king received, he gives what card he thinks proper with a fish; but must give two fish if it is in the favourite suit. He who asks by calling in the favourite suit, has the preference to him who asks by calling in another; he who asks by calling the mediateur, has the preference to him who asks by calling in the favourite suit, and by playing alone is obliged to make six tricks to win. He who asks with the mediateur in the favourite suit, has the preference to him who asks with the mediateur in any other suit, and is obliged to play alone, and to make six tricks.\n\nIf fans prendre is played in any other suit than the favourite, he who plays it has the preference to him who asks only, or with the mediateur, or even he who plays in the favourite suit with the mediateur; and the fans prendre in the favourite suit has the preference to all other players whatever.\n\nThe only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between this method of playing the game and the other is, that when one of the players demands the mediateur he is obliged to play alone, and to make six tricks, as if he played fans prendre. In this case he should judge from the strength of his hand, whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of the king will enable him to play alone or not.\n\nWith the mediateur and without the favourite suit it is played in this manner. The game is marked and played the same as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, except that a fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> is given to him who plays the mediateur, and to him who plays fans prendre; that is, he who wins the mediateur receives 13 counters from each; and if he loses by remise he pays 12 to each; and 13 if by codill. The winner of fans prendre receives 17 counters from each; and if by remise he loses, he pays 16 to each, and 17 if by codill.\n\nThe vole with the mediateur receives one fish only, as at common quadrille. The beasts are also the same as the common game. The last game is generally played <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, and is called paulans; but for those who choose to play a higher game, they may play the double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which is called the Turk, and is double of the favourite suit. There is also a higher game than this, called the andale, which is paying whatever is agreed to him who happens to hold the two aces in his hand.\n\nWe have omitted many things respecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of marking the game, and playing the vole, because these are different in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and are to be learned only by practice.

The notes of the cock and hen quail are very different; and the sportman who expects to succeed in the taking them must be expert in both: for when the cock calls, the answer is to be made in the hen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; and when the hen calls, the answer is to be made in the cock's.

Sometimes, though only one quail answers to the call, there will three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> four come up; and then it is best to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, and not run to take up the first, but stay till they are all entangled, as they will soon be.\n\nThe quail is a neat cleanly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>, and will not run much into dirty or wet places: in dewy mornings, they will often fly instead of running to the call; and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it is best to let them go over the net, if it so happens that they fly higher than its top; and the sportman then changing sides, and calling again, the bird will come back, and then will probably be taken in the net.\n\nThe calls are to be made of a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> purse, about two fingers wide, and four fingers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and made in the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a>; this is to be stuffed half-full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, and at the end of it is to be placed a small whistle, made of the bone of a rabbit's leg, or some other such bone: this is to be about two inches long, and the end formed like a flageolet, with a little soft wax. This is to be the end fastened into the purse; the other is to be closed up with the same wax, only that a hole is to be opened with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, to make it give a distinct and clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. To make this sound, it is to be held full in the palm of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, with one of the fingers placed over the top of the wax; then the purse is to be pressed, and the finger is to shake over the middle of it, to modulate the sound it gives into a sort of shake. This is the most useful call; for it imitates the note of the hen quail, and seldom fails to bring a cock to the net if there be one near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\nThe call that imitates the note of the cock, and is used to bring the hen to him, is to be about four inches long, and above an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> thick; it is to be made of a piece of wire turned round and curled, and covered with leather; and one end of it must be closed up with a piece of flat wood, about the middle of which there must\nmust be a small thread or strap of leather, and at the other end is to be placed the same sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, made of bone, as is used in the other call.

An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writer* having found, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fancied, a similarity of sentiments among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRUIDS\">Druids</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Quakers, seems to think that Fox must have been nothing more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOOL\">tool</a> employed by certain deists to pave the way for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, by allegorizing the distinguishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>.\n\nIt must be confessed, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not allow it to be denied, that extremes in religion are very apt to beget each other; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the deists alluded to reformed from this fault, they could not have pitched upon a tool fitter for their purpose than George Fox. From his works still extant, he appears to have been one of the most extravagant and absurd enthusiasts that ever lived, and to have fancied himself, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTOLIC\">apostolic</a> character, something infinitely superior to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. In a book called *News coming out of the North*, (p. 15,) he says of himself, \"I am the Door that ever was, the same Christ yesterday, today, and for ever.\" And in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> to his *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">Battle</a>-door for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">Teachers</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">Professors</a>*, he says, \"All languages are to me <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than dust, who was before languages were.\" But one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> and blasphemous things that he ever wrote, is an answer to the Protector, who had required him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> not to disturb his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> as then established. It is as follows:\n\n\"I who am of the world called G: F: doth deny the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> any carnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> against any, or against thee O: C: or any man, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> I declare it, God is my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>, by whom I am moved to give this forth for the truth's sake, from him whom the world calls G: Fox, who is the son of God, who is sent to stand a witness against all violence and against the works of darkness, and to turn the people from darkness to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and to bring them from the occasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and from the occasion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>'s sword, which is a terror to the evil doer, which acts contrary to the light of the Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ;\n\nwhich is a praise to them that do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>; which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> to them that do well, and not the evil; and such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> as are put in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> accusers must be, no violence must do, but be content with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>; and that magistrate bears not the sword in vain, from under the occasion of that sword do I seek to bring people: my weapons are not carnal but spiritual, and my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> is not of this world; therefore with carnal weapon I do not fight, but am from those things dead, from him who is not of this world, called of the world by the name of G: F: and this I am ready to feel with my blood; this I am moved to give forth for the truth's sake, who a witness stands against all unrighteousness, and all ungodliness, who a sufferer is for the righteous seed's sake, waiting for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> of it, who a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> that is mortal seeks not, for that fades away; but in the light dwells which comprehends that crown, which light is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of all such, in which light I witness the crown that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a>, which fades not away from him who to all your souls is a friend, for establishing of righteousness, and clearing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of evil doers, and a witness against all the wicked inventions of man, and murderer's plots, which answer shall be with the light in all your consciences, which makes no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; to which light in you all I speak, and am clear, G: F: who a new name hath, which the world knows not.\" (A)\n\nThe Quakers, however, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> entrust the defense of their principles to such senseless enthusiasts as George Fox: They were joined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of learned, ingenious, and pious men, who new modelled their creed; and though they did not bring it to what is generally deemed the Christian standard, they so reformed it as that its tenets do not shock <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, nor the duties prescribed scandalize a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of these reformers were George Keith, the celebrated Penn, and our countryman Barclay. Keith was indeed excommunicated for the liberties which he took with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>; but we have not a doubt but his writings contributed to the moderation of Penn, and to the elegant and matterly apology of Barclay. From that apology we selected the summary of their opinions which was given in the former edition of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>; but they have lately published such a summary themselves, of which the reader will be pleased with the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>:\n\nThey tell us, that about the beginning of the 17th century, a number of men, dissatisfied with all the modes of religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> then known in the world, withdrew from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> of every visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> to seek the Lord in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>. Among these was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> elder George Fox, who being quickened by the immediate touches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, could not satisfy his apprehensions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> to God without directing the people where to find the like consolation and instruction. In the course of his\n\n---\n\n(A) We have transcribed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> from the theological works of Mr Leslie, where it is preserved in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> form. The Quakers, after the death of their apostle, expunged from their edition of it the words which we have printed in Italics; ashamed, as we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLASPHEMY\">blasphemy</a> imputed to them: but that Mr Leslie's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> is authentic, is thus attested by two of the friends, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Fox deliver it to the protector's messenger: \"We are witnesses of this testimony, whose names in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> are,\n\nTho. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>,\nRob. Craven.\nQuakers. his travels, he met with many seeking persons in circumstances similar to his own, and these readily received his testimony. They then give us a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their sufferings and different settlements; and with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of candour which does them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, they vindicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II. from the character of a persecutor; acknowledging, that though they suffered much during his reign, he gave as little countenance as he could to the levities of the legislature. They even tell us, that he exerted his influence to rescue their friends from the unprovoked and cruel persecutions of the New England <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FANATICS\">fanatics</a>; and they speak with becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> of the different acts passed in their favour during the reigns of William and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, and George I. They then proceed to give us the following account of their doctrine:\n\n\"We agree with other professors of the Christian name, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in one eternal God, the Creator and Preserver of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>; and in Jesus Christ his Son, the Messiah, and Mediator of the new covenant (Heb. xii. 24).\"\n\n\"When we speak of the gracious display of the love of God to mankind, in the miraculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, birth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, death, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, and ascension of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>, we prefer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of such terms as we find in Scripture; and, contented with that knowledge which divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> hath been meet to reveal, we attempt not to explain those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> which remain under the veil; nevertheless, we acknowledge and assert the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> of Christ, who is the wisdom and power of God unto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> (1 Cor. i. 24).\"\n\n\"To Christ alone we give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Word of God (John i. 1.) and not to the Scriptures; although we highly esteem these sacred writings, in subordination to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">Spirit</a> (2 Pet. i. 21.), from which they were given forth; and we hold, with the apostle Paul, that they are able to make wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim. iii. 15.).\"\n\n\"We reverence those most excellent precepts which are recorded in Scripture to have been delivered by our great Lord, and we firmly believe that they are practicable, and binding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> every Christian; and that in the life to come every man will be rewarded according to his works (Mat. xvi. 27.). And farther, it is our belief, that, in order to enable mankind to put in practice these sacred precepts, many of which are contradictory to the regenerate will of man (John i. 9.), every man coming into the world is endowed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the light, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, or good Spirit of Christ; by which, as it is attended to, he is enabled to distinguish good from evil, and to correct the disorderly passions and corrupt propensities of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> is altogether insufficient to overcome. For all that belongs to man is fallible, within the reach of temptation; but this divine grace, which comes by Him who hath overcome the world (John xvi. 33.), is to those who humbly and sincerely seek it, an all-sufficient and present help in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of need. By this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SNARES\">snares</a> of the enemy are detected, his allurements avoided, and deliverance is experienced through faith in its effectual operation; whereby the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> is translated out of the kingdom of darkness, and from under the power of Satan, into the marvellous light and kingdom of the Son of God.\n\n\"Being thus persuaded that man, without the Spirit of Christ inwardly revealed, can do nothing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of God, or to effect his own salvation; we think this influence especially necessary to the performance of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind is capable, even the worship of the Father of lights and of spirits, in spirit and in truth; therefore we consider as obstructions to pure worship, all forms which divert the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the mind from the secret influence of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> from the Holy One (1 John ii. 29, 27.). Yet, although true worship is not confined to time and place, we think it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> to meet often together (Heb. x. 25.) in testimony of their dependence on the heavenly Father, and for a renewal of their spiritual strength: nevertheless, in the performance of worship, we dare not depend, for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> with Him, on a formal repetition of the words and experiences of others; but we believe it to be our duty to cease from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and to wait in silence to have a true sight of our condition bestowed upon us: believing even a single sigh (Rom. viii. 26.) arising from such a sense of our infirmities, and of the need we have of divine help, to be more acceptable to God, than any performances, however specious, which originate in the will of man.\n\n\"From what has been said respecting worship, it follows, that the ministry we approve must have its origin from the same source: for that which is needful for a man's own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and for his acceptance with God (Jer. xxiii. 30., to 32.), must be eminently so to enable him to be helpful to others. Accordingly, we believe the renewed affluence of the light and power of Christ to be indispensably necessary for all true ministry; and that this holy influence is not at our command, or to be procured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, but is the free gift of God to his chosen and devoted servants.\u2014From hence arises our testimony against preaching for hire, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to Christ's positive command, \"Freely ye have received, freely give\" (Mat. x. 8.); and hence our conscientious refusal to support such ministry by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> or other means.\n\n\"As we dare not encourage any ministry but that which we believe to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from the influence of the Holy Spirit, so neither dare we attempt to restrain this influence to persons of any condition in life, or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> alone; but, as male and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> are one in Christ, we allow such of the female sex as we believe to be ended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> qualification for the ministry, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> their gifts for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> edification of the church: and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> we esteem to be a peculiar mark of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> dispensation, as foretold by the prophet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOEL\">Joel</a> (Joel ii. 28, 29.), and noticed by the apostle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> (Acts ii. 16, 17.).\n\n\"There are two ceremonies in use amongst most professors of the Christian name; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, and what is termed the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">Supper</a>. The first of these is generally esteemed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> means of initiation into the church of Christ; and the latter of maintaining communion with him. But as we have been convinced, that nothing short of his redeeming power, inwardly revealed, can set the soul free from the thraldom of sin, by this power alone we believe salvation to be effected. We hold that as there is one Lord and one faith (Eph. iv. 5.), so his baptism is one in nature and operation; that nothing short of it can make us living members of his mystical body; and that the baptism with water, admini-\nQuakers, ministered by his fore-runner John, belonged, as the latter confessed, to an inferior and decreasing dispensation (John iii. 30.).\n\n\"With respect to the other rite, we believe that communion between Christ and his church is not maintained by that nor any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> performance, but only by a real participation of his divine nature (2 Pet. i. 4.) through faith; that this is the supper alluded to in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a> (Rev. iii. 20.), \"Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me;\" and that where the subsistence is attained, it is unnecessary to attend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a>, which doth not confer grace, and concerning which opinions so different, and animosities so violent, have arisen.\n\n\"Now, as we thus believe that the grace of God, which comes by Jesus Christ, is alone sufficient for salvation, we can neither admit that it is conferred on a few only, whilst others are left without it; nor, thus, affecting its universality, can we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> its operation to a partial cleansing of the soul from sin, even in this life. We entertain worthier notions both of the power and goodness of our heavenly Father, and believe that he doth vouchsafe to afflit the obedient to experience a total surrender of the natural will to the guidance of his pure unerring Spirit; through whose renewed affluence they are enabled to bring forth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> unto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, and to stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> in their present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> (Mat. v. 48.; Eph. iv. 13.; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COL\">Col</a>. iv. 12.).\n\n\"There are not many of our tenets more generally known than our testimony against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> and against war. With respect to the former of these, we abide literally by Christ's positive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a>, delivered in his sermon on the mount, \"Swear not at all\" (Mat. v. *See Oath. 34.*).\n\nFrom the same sacred collection of the most excellent precepts of moral and religious duty, from the example of our Lord himself (Mat. ch. v. 39, 44., &c. ch. xxvi. 52, 53.; Luke xxii. 61.; John xviii. 11.), and from the correspondent convictions of his Spirit in our hearts, we are confirmed in the belief that wars and fightings are, in their origin and effects, utterly repugnant to the Gospel, which fill breathes peace and goodwill to men. We also are clearly of the judgment, that if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> of the Gospel were generally prevalent in the minds of men, it would effectually prevent them from oppressing, much more from enslaving, their brethren, (of whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>), for whom, as for themselves, Christ died; and would even influence their conduct in their treatment of the brute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, which would no longer groan the victims of their avarice, and of their false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\n\"Some of our tenets have in former times, as hath been shown, subjected our friends to much suffering from government, though to the salutary purposes of government our principles are a security. They inculcate submission to the laws in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> wherein <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> is not violated. But we hold, that as Christ's kingdom is not of this world, it is not the business of the civil magistrate to interfere in matters of religion; but to maintain the external peace and good order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. We therefore think <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, even in the mildest degree, unwarrantable. We are careful in requiring our members not to be concerned in illicit trade, nor in any manner to defraud the revenue.\n\n\"It is well known that the society, from its first appearance, has diffused those names of the months and days which, having been given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the heroes or false gods of the heathens, originated in their flattery or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of speaking to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLURAL\">plural</a> number (B), as having arisen also from motives of adulation. Compliments, superfluity of apparel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, outward shows of rejoicing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of days and times, we esteem to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the simplicity and sincerity of a Christian life; and public diversions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAMING\">gaming</a>, and other vain amusements of the world, we cannot but condemn. They are a waste of that time which is given us for nobler purposes, and divert the attention of the mind from the sober duties of life, and from the reproofs of instruction, by which we are guided to an everlasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>.\n\n\"To conclude, although we have exhibited the several tenets which distinguish our religious society, as objects of our belief, yet we are sensible that a true and living faith is not produced in the mind of man by his own effort; but is the free gift of God (Eph. ii. 8.) in Christ Jesus, nourished and increased by the progressive operation of his spirit in our hearts, and our proportionate obedience (John vii. 17.). Therefore, although, for the preservation of the testimonies given us to bear, and for the peace and good order of the society, we deem it necessary that those who are admitted into membership with us, should be previously convinced of those doctrines which we esteem essential; yet we require no formal subscription to any articles, either as the condition of membership, or to qualify for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the church. We prefer the judging of men by their fruits, in a dependence on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of Him who, by his prophet, hath promised to be \"a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment\" (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAIAH\">Isaiah</a> xxviii. 6.). Without this, there is a danger of receiving numbers into outward communion, without any addition to that spiritual theepold, whereof our blest Lord declared himself to be both the door and the shepherd (John x. 7., 11.), that is, such as know his voice, and follow him in the paths of obedience.\"\n\nSuch are the doctrines of this people as we find them stated in a small pamphlet lately presented by themselves to the public; and in the same tract they give the following account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>.\n\n\"In the practice of discipline, we think it indispensible that the order recommended by Christ himself be invariably observed: (Matth. xviii. 15. to 17.). 'If thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be\n\n(B) Speaking of this custom, Fox says: \"When the Lord sent me into the world, he forbade me to put off my hat to any; and I was required to thee and thou all men and women.\" Journal, p. 24.\nQuakers be established; and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church.\n\n\"To effect the salutary purposes of discipline, meetings were appointed, at an early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the society, which, from the times of their being held, were called quarterly meetings. It was afterwards found expedient to divide the districts of those meetings, and to meet more often; whence arose monthly meetings, subordinate to those held quarterly. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, in 1669, a yearly meeting was established, to superintend, afflit, and provide rules for the whole; previous to which, general meetings had been occasionally held.\n\n\"A monthly meeting is usually composed of several particular congregations, situated within a convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of each other. Its business is to provide for the subsistence of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of their offspring; to judge of the sincerity and fitness of persons appearing to be convinced of the religious principles of the society, and desiring to be admitted into membership; to excite due attention to the discharge of religious and moral duty; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> with disorderly members. Monthly meetings also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to such of their members as remove into other monthly meetings, certificates of their membership and conduct; without which they cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> membership in such meetings. Each monthly meeting is required to appoint certain persons under the name of overseers, who are to take care that the rules of our discipline be put in practice; and when any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of complaint or disorderly conduct comes to their knowledge, to see that private admonition, agreeable to the gospel rule before mentioned, be given previously to its being laid before the monthly meeting.\n\n\"When a case is introduced, it is usual for a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> to be appointed to visit the offender, to endeavour to convince him of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, and to induce him to forsake and condemn it. If they succeed, the person is by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> declared to have made satisfaction for the offence; if not, he is disowned as a member of the society.\n\n\"In disputes between individuals, it has long been the decided judgment of the society that its members should not sue each other at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. It therefore enjoins all to end their differences by speedy and impartial arbitration, agreeable to rules laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. If any refuse to adopt this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>, or, having adopted it, to submit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AWARD\">award</a>, it is the direction of the yearly meeting that such be disowned.\n\n\"To monthly meetings also belongs the allowing of marriages; for our society hath always scrupled to acknowledge the exclusive authority of the priests in the solemnization of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>. Those who intend to marry, appear together and propose their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to the monthly meeting; and if not attended by their parents or guardians, produce a written certificate of their consent, signed in the presence of witnesses. The meeting then appoints a committee to inquire whether they are clear of other engagements respecting marriage; and if at a subsequent meeting, to which the parties also come and declare the continuance of their intention, no objections are reported, they have the meeting's consent to solemnize their intended marriage. This is done in a public meeting for worship; towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> whereof the parties stand up, and solemnly take each other for husband and wife. A certificate of the proceedings is then publicly read, and signed by the parties, and afterwards by the relations and others as witnesses. Of such certificates the monthly meeting keeps a record; as also of the births and burials of its members. A certificate of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, of the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a>, and of its parents, signed by those present at the birth, is the subject of one of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>-mentioned records; and an order for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERMENT\">interment</a>, countersigned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>-maker, of the other. The naming of children is without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. Burials are also conducted in a simple manner. The body, followed by the relations and friends, is sometimes, previously to interment, carried to a meeting; and at the grave a paife is generally made; on both which occasions it frequently falls out that one or more friends present have somewhat to express for the edification of those who attend; but no religious rite is considered as an essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>.\n\n\"Several monthly meetings compose a quarterly meeting. At the quarterly meeting are produced written answers from the monthly meetings, to certain queries respecting the conduct of their members, and the meeting's care over them. The accounts thus received, are digested into one, which is sent, also in the form of answers to queries, by representatives, to the yearly meeting.\u2014Appeals from the judgment of monthly meetings are brought to the quarterly meetings; whose business also it is to assist in any difficult case, or where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> appears in the care of the monthly-meetings over the individuals who compose them.\n\n\"The yearly meeting has the general superintendence of the society in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in which it is established (c); and therefore, as the accounts which it receives discover the state of inferior meetings, as particular exigencies require, or as the meeting is impressed with a sense of duty, it gives forth its advice, makes such regulations as appear to be requisite, or excites to the observance of those already made; and sometimes appoints committees to visit those quarterly meetings which appear to be in need of immediate help. Appeals from the judgment of quarterly meetings are here finally determined; and a brotherly correspondence, by epistles, is maintained with other yearly meetings.\n\n\"In this place it is proper to add, that as we believe women may be rightly called to the work of the ministry, we also think, that to them belongs a share in the support of our Christian discipline; and that some parts of it, wherein their own sex is concerned, devolve on them with peculiar propriety. Accordingly they have monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings of their own sex, held at the same time and in the same place with those of the men; but separately, and without the power\n\n(c) There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> yearly meetings, viz. 1st, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, to which come representatives from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>; 2d, New-England; 3d, New-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>; 4th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a> and New-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>; 5th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARYLAND\">Maryland</a>; 6th, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>; 7th, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAROLINAS\">Carolinas</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEORGIA\">Georgia</a>.\"\nQuakers of making rules: and it may be remarked, that during the persecutions, which in the last century occasioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a> of so many of the men, the care of the poor often fell on the women, and was by them satisfactorily administered.\n\n\"In order that those who are in the situation of ministers may have the tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSEL\">counsel</a> of those of either sex, who, by their experience in the work of religion, are qualified for that service; the monthly meetings are advised to select such, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELDERS\">elders</a>. These, and ministers approved by their monthly meetings (D), have meetings peculiar to themselves, called meetings of ministers and elders; in which they have an opportunity of exciting each other to a discharge of their several duties, and of extending advice to those who may appear weak, without any needless exposure. These meetings are generally held in the compass of each monthly, quarterly, and yearly meeting. They are conducted by rules prescribed by the yearly meeting, and have no authority to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> or addition to them. The members of them unite with their brethren in the meetings for discipline, and are equally accountable to the latter for their conduct.\n\n\"It is to a meeting of this kind held in London, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>-meeting, that the revival of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> concerning our principles, previously to publication, is intrusted by the yearly meeting held in London; and also the granting, in the intervals of the yearly meeting, certificates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> to such ministers as are concerned to travel in the work of the ministry in foreign parts. When a visit of this kind doth not extend beyond Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, a certificate from the monthly meeting of which the minister is a member is sufficient; if to Ireland, the concurrence of the quarterly meeting is also required. Regulations of similar tendency obtain in other yearly meetings.\n\n\"The yearly meeting held in London, in the year 1675, appointed a meeting to be held in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, for the purpose of advising and afflicting in cases of suffering for conscience sake, which hath <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> with great use to the society to this day. It is composed of friends under the name of correspondents, chosen by the several quarterly meetings, and who reside in or near the city. The same meetings also appoint members of their own in the country as correspondents, who are to join their brethren in London on emergency. The names of all these correspondents, previous to their being recorded as such, are submitted to the approbation of the yearly meeting. Those of the men who are approved ministers are also members of this meeting, which is called the meeting for sufferers; a name arising from its original purpose, which is not yet become entirely obsolete.\n\n\"The yearly meeting has intrusted the meeting for sufferers with the care of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> and distributing books, and with the management of its stock; and Quakers, considered as a standing committee of the yearly meeting, it hath a general care of whatever may arise, during the intervals of that meeting, affecting the society, and requiring immediate attention: particularly of those circumstances which may occasion an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to government.\n\n\"There is not in any of the meetings which have been mentioned any presiding, as we believe that Divine Wisdom alone ought to preside; nor hath any member a right to claim pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>. The office of clerk, with a few exceptions, is undertaken voluntarily by some member; as is also the keeping of the records. Where these are very voluminous, and require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSIT\">deposit</a> (as is the case in London, where the general records of the society in Great Britain are kept), a clerk is hired to have the care of them; but except a few clerks of this kind, and persons who have the care of meeting houses, none receive any stipend or gratuity for their services in our religious society.\"\n\nIt is remarkable, that all the settlements of the Europeans in America, except the Quaker settlement of Pennsylvania, were made by force of arms, with very little regard to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> title in the natives. The kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, France, and Britain, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">States</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, then the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> powers, gave grants of such parts of America as their people could lay hold on, studying only to avoid interference with their European neighbours. But Mr Penn, being a Quaker, did not think his power from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Cha. II. a sufficient title to the country since called Pennsylvania: He therefore assembled the sachems or princes then in that country, and purchased from them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of land that he wanted. The government of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> is mostly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Quakers, who never have any quarrels with the natives. When they desire to extend their settlements, they purchase new lands of the sachems, never taking anything from them by force. How unlike is this conduct to that of the Spaniards, who murdered millions of the natives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, Terra Firma, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHILI\">Chili</a>, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">QUALITY</a> is a word which, as used in philosophical disquisitions, cannot be explained by any periphrasis. That which is expressed by it must be brought into the immediate view of the senses or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>, and the name properly applied, or he who is a stranger to the word will never be made to comprehend its meaning. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, who treated it as a general conception, second in order among the ten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-PREDICAMENTS\">predicaments</a> or categories (see CATEGORY), gives several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of it; but though they are all in some respects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, no man could from them, without other assistance, learn what quality is. Thus he tells us \"\u03a4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd;\" And again, \"\u038c\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03a3\u03cd\u03bb\u03b2. p. 44: \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6.\"\nWhen a man comprehends, by means of his senses and intellect, what it is which the word quality denotes, he will indeed perceive that the first of these characters is applicable to some qualities and not to others; that the second is more applicable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> than to quality; and that it is only the third which can with propriety be considered as the general characteristic of this predicament. Thus when we have learned by our sense of sight that whiteness is a quality of snow, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACKNESS\">blackness</a> of coal; and by means of observation and reflection, that wisdom is a quality of one man and folly of another\u2014we must admit that the sensible quality of the snow is contrary to that of the coal, and the intellectual quality of wisdom contrary to that of folly. There is, however, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> between wisdom and whiteness or blackness, nor between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> or softness and any particular colour; for sensible and intellectual qualities can never be compared; and it is not easy, if possible, to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between qualities perceptible only by different senses: Nay, among qualities perceptible by the same sense, we often meet with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> where there is no contrariety; for though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> is different from that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>, and the figure of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> from that of a circle, the sphere is not contrary to the cube, nor the circle to the square.\n\nHis second characteristic of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> is still less proper than the first. It is indeed true that some qualities admit of intensification and remission; for snow is whiter than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and one woman is handsomer than another; but of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of quality called figure we cannot predicate either more or less. A crown-piece may have as much of the circular quality in it as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of the equator, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a>-bullet as much of the spherical quality as the orb of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. It is indeed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of all quantity to admit of intensification and remission; and therefore this ought to have been given as the character not of the second but of the third category. See Quantity.\n\nThat it is only from a comparison of their qualities that things are denominated like or unlike, or that one thing cannot resemble another but in some quality, is indeed a just observation. We know nothing directly but qualities sensible and intellectual (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, No. 149, 150, 151, and 227); and as these have no resemblance to each other, we conclude that body or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, the subject of the former, is being unlike mind, the subject of the latter. Even of bodies themselves we can say, that one is like or unlike another only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of their qualities. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> resembles a ball of snow in its figure and colour, but not in its coldness or hardness; a ball of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> may resemble a ball of snow in its figure and coldness, but not in its colour; and a cube of ivory resembles not a ball of lead either in figure, colour, or coldness. The mind of a brute resembles that of a man in its powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> and perception, but does not resemble it in the powers of volition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>; or at least the resemblance, in this latter instance, is very slight. All bodies resemble one another in being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and extended, and all minds in being more or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. Likeness or unlikeness therefore is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> characteristic of the category quality.\n\nAristotle has other speculations respecting quality, which are worthy of notice. He distinguishes between qualities which are essential and those which are accidental; between qualities which are natural and those which are acquired; and he speaks of the qualities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> and those of completion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">Extension</a> and figure in general are qualities essential to all bodies: but a particular extension, such as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-ELL\">ell</a>, and a particular figure, such as a cube or a sphere, are qualities accidental to bodies. Among the natural qualities of glass it is one to transmit objects of vision; but to enlarge these objects is an adventitious or acquired quality. The same quality may be natural in one substance, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> in the magnet; and acquired in another, as the same attraction in the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>. Docility may be called a quality natural to the mind of man, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> an acquired one. To understand what he means by qualities of capacity and completion, it may be sufficient to observe that every piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> has the qualities of a razor in capacity, because it may be converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>, and formed into a razor: when it is so formed, it has, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the quality of a razor in completion. Among the qualities of capacity and completion, the most important, and what may lead to interesting speculations, is the reasoning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of man. A capacity of reasoning is essential to the human mind; but the completion of this capacity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> reasoning is not, otherwise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> and persons asleep would be excluded from the human species.\n\nMr Locke has puzzled his readers, and perhaps himself, with a question reflecting the species of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOT\">idiot</a> by Locke. Aristotle's distinctions; but we cannot help thinking, &c., that had the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> attended to the Stagyrite's account of qualities in capacity and qualities in completion, this perplexing question would never have been started. It is justly observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Human Understanding, that of real essences we know nothing; but that every man selects a certain number of qualities which he has always perceived united in certain beings; and forming these into one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a> conception, gives to this conception a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> name, which he applies to every being in which he finds those qualities united. This is undoubtedly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of the mind in strange forming genera and species; and as the excellent author confutes the name of man to the changeling, it is obvious this overname, must imply rationality or the actual exercise of reason. But this limitation will exclude many beings from the species man, whom Mr Locke certainly considered as men and women. Not to mention infants and persons in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, how shall we clasps those who, after having lived 30 or 40 years in the full exercise of reason, have been suddenly or by degrees deprived of it by some disorder in the brain?\n\nFrom Maribrough's eyes the streams of dotage flow;\nAnd Swift expiates a driveller and a show. JOHNSON.\n\nBut were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> in those deplorable circumstances excluded from the human species, and clasped between men and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>? No surely; they were both acknowledged to be men, because they were known to have the quality of reason in what Aristotle would have called capacity. Their dotage and drivelling originated from some disorder in their bodies, probably in the region of the brain; and Locke himself contends that no defect in body is sufficient to degrade a person from the rank\nQuality rank of manhood. Again, lunatics have the exercise of reason, except at new and full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. Are these unhappy beings sometimes men and sometimes a species by themselves between men and brutes?\n\nIt appears, therefore, that not the actual exercise of reason, but reason in capacity, ought to be included in the complex conception to which we give the specific name of man, as some of the greatest men that ever lived have been during parts of their lives deprived of the power of actual reasoning. This, however, it will be said, does not remove the difficulty; for the occasional exercise of reason in lunatics, and the great exertions of it in such men as Swift and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLBOROUGH\">Marlborough</a>, show that they had it in capacity at all times; whereas we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that changelings have even a capacity of reasoning at any time, since they never do a rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, nor ever utter a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> to the purpose. That we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and positive evidence of the minds of changelings being capable of reasoning, were they supplied with proper organs, must be granted; but the probabilities of their being so are many and great. We know by experience that the actual exercise of reason may be interrupted by an occasional and accidental pressure on the brain; and therefore we cannot doubt but that if this pressure were rendered permanent by any wrong configuration of the skull given to it in the womb, or in the act of being born into the world, an infant, with a mind capable of reasoning by means of proper organs, would by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> be rendered, through the whole of life, an idiot or changeling. That idiotism is caused by such accidents, and is not the quality of an inferior mind occasionally given to a human body, will at least seem probable from the following considerations.\n\nIt does not appear that an animal body can live and move but while it is actuated by some mind. Whence then does the unborn infant derive its mind? It must be either immediately from God, or ex traducie from its parents; but if the mind of man be immaterial, it cannot be ex traducie. Now, as idiots are very few in number when compared with the rational part of the human species, and as God in the government of this world acts not by partial but by general laws; we must conclude that the law which he has established reflecting the union of mind and matter, is, that human bodies shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> with minds endowed with a capacity of reasoning, and that those who never exert this capacity are prevented by some such accident as we have assigned.\n\nFor a further account of qualities, why they are supposed to inhere in some subject, together with the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> and secondary qualities of matter, see Metaphysics, Part II. chap. i.\n\nChemical Qualities, those qualities principally introduced by means of chemical experiments, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUMIGATION\">fumigation</a>, amalgamation, cupellation, volatilization, precipitation, &c.\n\nQuality, is also used for a kind of title given to certain persons, in regard of their territories, signories, or other pretensions.\n\nQuanga. See Capra.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUANG_PING\">Quang-ping</a>-fou, a city in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, is situated in the northern part of the province of Pe-tchehi, between the provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANG_TONG\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANG\">Chang</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TONG\">tong</a> and Ho-nan, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> cities of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> dependent on it; all its plains are well watered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. Among its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, there is one dedicated to those men who, as the Chinese Quang pretend, discovered the secret of rendering themselves immortal.\n\nQuangsi, a province of China, bounded on the north by Koe-Tcheau and Hu-Quang; on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, by Yunnan and Quantong; on the south, by the same and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONQUIN\">Tonquin</a>; and on the west, by Yun-nan. It produces great plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, being watered by several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> rivers; and containing 10,000,000 of inhabitants. The southern part is a flat country, and well cultivated; but the northern is full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> covered with trees. It contains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of all sorts; and there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>-mine lately opened. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> is Quie-ling.\n\nA very singular tree, says Grolier, grows in this province; instead of pith, it contains a soft pulp, which yields a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a>: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> made of it is said to be exceedingly good. Besides paroquets, hedgehogs, porcupines, and rhinoceroses, a prodigious number of wild animals, curious birds, and uncommon insects, are found here.\n\nThis province contains 12 villages of the first class, and 80 of the second and third.\n\nQuang-tong, a province of China, bounded on the east by Kiang-si and Fukien; on the south, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>; and on the west, by Tonquin. This province is diversified by valleys and mountains; and yields two crops of corn in a year. It abounds in gold, jewels, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, pearls, tin, quicksilver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, bras, iron, steel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EBONY\">ebony</a>, and several sorts of odoriferous wood; besides fruits of all sorts proper to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. They have a prodigious number of ducks, whose eggs they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCH\">hatch</a> in ovens; and a tree, whose wood is remarkably hard and heavy, and thence called iron-wood. The mountains are covered with a sort of oifers which creep along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and of which they make baskets, hurdles, mats, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>.\n\nAlthough the climate of this province is warm, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is pure, and the people are robust and healthy. They are very industrious; and it must be allowed that they possess in an eminent degree the talents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>: if they are only shown any of our European works, they execute others like them with the most surprising exactness. This province suffered much during the civil wars; but at present it is one of the most flourishing in the empire; and, as it is at a great distance from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, its government is one of the most important. This province is divided into ten districts, which contain ten cities of the first class, and 84 of the second and third. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> is the capital town.\n\nQuantity, as explained by the great English lexicographer, is that property of any thing which may be increased or diminished. This interpretation of the word is certainly just, and for the purposes of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> it is sufficiently determinate; but the man of science may expect to find in a work like ours a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of the thing signified. This, however, cannot be given him. A logical definition consists of the genus under which the thing defined is ranked, and the specific difference (see Logic, No 20, &c.) but quantity is ranked under no genus. In that school where such definitions were most valued, it was considered as one of the ten categories, or general conceptions, under which all the objects of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> were numbered, like soldiers in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> (see Category and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, No 22.). On this account, even Aristotle himself,\nQuantity himself, who delighted in definitions, and was not easily deterred from a favourite pursuit, could not consistently with his own rules attempt to define quantity. He characterizes it, however, in several parts of his works; and particularly in the 15th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the 4th book of his metaphysics, where he gives the following account of the three first categories: \u1f18\u03bd\u03b4\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd, \u1f45\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u1f02\u03bd \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9, \u1f45\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u1f02\u03bd \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9 \u1f22 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf. \"Things are the same of which the substance is one; similar, of which the quality is one; equal, of which the quantity is one. Again, he tells us*, that the chief characteristic of quantity is, that it may be denominated equal and unequal.\n\nThat any man can become wiser by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> such descriptions as these, none but an idolater of Aristotle will suppose. There is, indeed, no periphrasis by which we can explain what is meant by quantity to those who have not previously formed such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>.\u2014All that can be done by making the attempt is only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> language, by stating exactly the cases in which we use this word in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to general custom; for there is a laxness or carelessness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> in the language of most men, and our notions are frequently communicated by speech in a way by no means precise; so that it is often a great chance that the notions excited in the mind of the hearer are not exact counterparts of those in the mind of the speaker.\n\nThe understandings of men differ in nothing more remarkably than in their power of abstraction, and of rapidly forming conceptions to general and simple as not to be clogged with distinguishing circumstances, which may be different in different minds while uttering and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> the same words; and it is of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to a man of scientific habits, either to cultivate, if possible, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a>, or to supercede its use, by studiously forming to himself notions of the most important universals in his own course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, by careful abstraction of every thing extraneous. His language by this means becomes doubly instructive by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> precision; and he will even judge with greater certainty of notions intended to be communicated by the more flowery language of another person.\n\nWe cannot say that there is much ambiguity in the general use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> quantity: But here, as in all other cases, a love of refinement, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>, and frequently of vanity, and the wish of appearing ingenious and original, have made men take advantage of even the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> with which the careless use of the word will furnish them, to amuse themselves and the public by giving the appearance of science to empty sounds.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">Mathematics</a> is undoubtedly employed in discovering and stating many relations of quantity; and it is in this category alone that anything is contemplated by the mathematician, whether in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">algebra</a>. Hence mathematics has been called the science of quantity. The simplicity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the mathematician's contemplation, and the unparalleled distinctness with which he can perceive its modifications, have enabled him to erect a body of science, eminent not only for its certainty, but also for the great length to which he can carry his reasonings without danger of error; and the intimate connection which this science has with the arts of life, and the important services which it has performed, have procured it a most respectable place in the circle of the sciences. Ingenious men have availed themselves of this pre-eminence of mathematics, and have endeavoured to procure respect for their disquisitions on other subjects, by presenting them to the public as branches of mathematical science, and therefore susceptible of that accuracy and certainty which are its peculiar boast. Our moral affections, our sensations, our intellectual powers, are all susceptible of augmentation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>, are conceivable as greater, and less when stated together, and are familiarly spoken of as admitting of degrees of comparison. We are perfectly well understood when we say that one pain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, grief, kindness, is greater than another; and as this is the distinguishing characteristic of quantity, and as quantity is the subject of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a>, we suppose that these subjects may be treated mathematically. Accordingly, a very celebrated and excellent philosopher* has said, among many things of the same kind, that the greatness of a favour is in the direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the service performed and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the performer, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> ratio of the merit and rank of the receiver; that the value of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> properly rater is in the compound ratio of the talents and virtues introduced &c.; and he has delivered a number of formal proper fusions on the most interesting questions in morals, couched in this mathematical language, and even expressed by algebraic formulas. But this is mere play, and conveys no instruction. We understand the words; they contain no absurdity; and in as far as they have a sense, we believe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> to be true. But they give no greater precision to our sentiments than the more usual expressions would do. If we attend closely to the meaning of any one of such propositions, we shall find that it only expresses some vague and indistinct notions of degrees of those emotions, sentiments, or qualities, which would be just as well conceived by means of the expressions of ordinary language; and that it is only by a fort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> or resemblance that this mathematical language conveys any notions whatever of the subjects.\n\nThe object of contemplation to the mathematician is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> whatever is susceptible of greater and less, but what that mass is measurable; and mathematics is not the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, in its most abstracted and general acceptation, only quantity, but of magnitude which can be measured. It is, it seems, indeed the science of measure, and whatever is not measured in the way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a> is treated mathematically. Now, in the discourse of ordinary life and ordinary men, many things are called quantities which we cannot or do not measure. This is the case in the instances already given of the affections of the mind, pleasure, pain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, wisdom, honour, &c. We do not say that they are incapable of measure; but we have not yet been able to measure them, nor do we think of measuring them when we speak rationally and usefully about them. We therefore do not confine them mathematically; nor can we introduce mathematical precision into our disquisitions of these subjects till we can, and actually do, measure them. Persons who are precise in their expression will even avoid such phrases on these subjects as suppose, or strictly express, such measurement. We should be much embarrassed how to answer the question, How much pain does the toothache give you just now; and how much is it easier since yesterday?\nQuantity. yesterday? Yet the answer (if we had a measure) would be as easy as to the question, How many guineas did you win at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>? or how much land have you bought? Nay, though we say familiarly, \u201cI know well how much such a misfortune would affect you,\u201d and are underfoot when we say it, it would be awkward language to say, \u201cI know well the quantity of your grief.\u201d It is in vain, therefore, to expect mathematical precision in our discourse or conceptions of quantities in the most abstracted sense. Such precision is confined to quantity which may be and is measured (a). It is only trifling with the imagination when we employ mathematical language on subjects which have not this property.\n\nIt will therefore be of some service in science to discriminate quantities in this view; to point out what are susceptible of measure, and what are not.\n\nWhat is measuring? It is one of these two things: It is either finding out some known magnitude of the thing measured, which we can demonstrate to be equal to it; or to find a known magnitude of it, which being taken so many times shall be equal to it. The geometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the contents of a parabolic space when he exhibits a parallelogram of known dimensions, and demonstrates that this parallelogram is equal to the parabolic space. In like manner, he measures the solid contents of an infinitely extended hyperbolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a>, when he exhibits a cone of known dimensions, and demonstrates that three of these cones are equal to the spindle.\n\nIn this process it will be found that he actually subdivides the quantity to be measured into parts of which it consists, and states these parts as actually making up the quantity, specifying each, and affixing its boundaries. He goes on with it, piece by piece, demonstrating the respective equalities as he goes along, till he has exhausted the figure, or considered all its parts.\u2014When he measures by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUBMULTIPLE\">submultiple</a>, as when he shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of a sphere to be equal to four of its great circles, he stops, after having demonstrated the equality of one of these circles to one part of the surface: then he demonstrates that there are other three parts, each of which is precisely equal to the one he has minutely considered. In this part of the process he expressly assigns the whole surface into its distinct portions, of which he demonstrates the equality.\n\nBut there is another kind of geometrical measurement which proceeds on a very different principle. The geometer conceives a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> portion of his figure, whether line, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, surface, or solid, as known in respect to its dimensions. He conceives this to be lifted from its place, and again laid down on the adjoining part of the figure, and that it is equal to the part which it now covers; and therefore that this part together with the first is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of the first: he lifts it again, and lays it down on the next adjoining part, and affirms that this, added to the two former, make up a quantity triple of the first. He goes on in this way, making similar inferences, till he can demonstrate that he has in this Quantity, manner covered the whole figure by twenty applications, and that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> figure will cover no more; and he affirms that the figure is twenty times the part employed.\n\nThis mode is precisely similar to the manner of practical measurement in common life: we apply a foot-rule successively to two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and find that 30 applications exhaust the one, while it requires 35 to exhaust the other. We say therefore, that the one line is 30 and Euclid\u2019s the other 35 feet long; and that these two lines are to fourth each other in the ratio of 30 to 35. Having measured position, two shorter lines by a similar application of a stick of an inch long 30 times to the one and 35 times to the other, we say that the ratio of the two first lines is the same with that of the two last. Euclid has taken this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of demonstrating the fourth proposition of the first book of his celebrated elements.\n\nBut all this process is a fiction of the mind, and it is the fiction of an impossibility. It is even inconceivable, that is, we cannot in imagination make this application of one figure to another; and we presume to say, that, if the elements of geometry cannot be demonstrated in some other way, the science has not that title to pure, abstract, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> knowledge, which is usually allowed it. We cannot suppose one of the triangles lifted and laid on the other, without supposing something different from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> in abstracto. The individuality of such a triangle consists solely in its being in its precise place where it is, and in occupying that portion of space. If we could distinctly conceive otherwise, we should perceive that, when we have lifted the triangle from its place, and applied it to the other, it is gone from its former place, and that there is no longer a triangle there. This is inconceivable, and space has always been acknowledged to be immovable. There is therefore some logical defect in Euclid\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>. We apprehend that he is labouring to demonstrate, or rather illustrate, a simple apprehension. This indeed is the utmost that can be done in any demonstration (see Metaphysics, No. 82.) but the mode by which he guides the mind to the apprehension of the truth of his fourth proposition is not consistent either with pure mathematics or with the laws of corporeal nature. The real proofs, as laid down by him, seems to be this. We suppose something different from the abstract triangle; some thing that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with other properties, has the property of being triangular, with certain dimensions of two of its sides and the included angle. It has avowedly another property, not essential to, and not contained in, the abstract notion of a triangle, viz. mobility. We also suppose it permanent in shape and dimensions, or that although, during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, it does not occupy the same space, it continues, and all its parts, to occupy an equal space. In short, our conception is very mixed, and does not perceptibly differ from our conception of a triangular piece of matter, where\n\n(a) To talk intelligibly of the quantity of a pain, we should have some standard by which to measure it; some known degree of it so well ascertained, that all men, when talking of it, should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the same thing.\u2014And we should be able to compare other degrees of pain with this, so as to perceive distinctly, not only whether they exceed or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of it, but also how much, or in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>; whether by an half, or a fifth, or a tenth. Reid.\nthe triangle is not the subject, but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADJUNCT\">adjunct</a>, a quality. And when we suppose the application made, we are not in fact supposing two abstract triangles to coincide. This we cannot do with any thing like distinctness; for our distinct conception now is, not that of two triangles coinciding, but of one triangle being now exactly occupied by that moveable thing which formerly occupied the other. In short, it is a vulgar measurement, restricted by hypotheses which are inadmissible in all actual measurements in the present universe, in which no moveable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> thing is known to be permanent, either in shape or magnitude.\n\nThis is an undeniable consequence of the principle of universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>, and the compressibility of every kind of tangible matter with which we are acquainted. Remove the brafs rule but one inch from its place; its gravitation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and to the rest of the universe is immediately changed, and its dimensions change of consequence. A change of temperature will produce a similar effect; and this is attended to and considered in all nice measurements. We do the best we can to allure ourselves that our rule always occupies a sensibly equal space; and we must be contented with chances of error which we can neither perceive nor remove.\n\nWe might (were this a proper place) take notice of some other logical defects in the reasoning of this celebrated proposition: but they are beside our present purpose of explaining the different modes of mathematical measurement, with the view of discovering that circumstance in which they all agree, and which (if the only one) must therefore be the characteristic of mensuration.\n\nWe think that the only circumstance in which all modes of mensuration agree, or the only notion that is found in them all, is, that the quantity is conceived as consisting of parts, distinguishable from each other, and separated by assignable boundaries; so that they are at once conceived separately and jointly. We venture to assert that no quantity is directly measured which we cannot conceive in this way, and that such quantities only are the immediate objects of mathematical contemplation, and should be distinguished by a generic name. Let them be called Mathematical Quantities. Extension, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">Duration</a>, Number, and Proportion, have this characteristic, and they are the only quantities which have it. Any person will be convinced of the first assertion by attending to his own thoughts when contemplating these notions. He will find that he conceives every one of them as made up of its own parts, which are distinguishable from each other, and have assignable boundaries, and that it is only in consequence of involving this conception that they can be added to or subtracted from each other; that they can be multiplied, divided, and conceived in any proportion to each other.\n\nHe may perhaps find considerable difficulty in acquiring perfectly distinct notions of the mensurability, and the accuracy of the modes of mensuration. He will find that the way in which he measures duration is very similar to that in which he measures space or extension. He does not know, or does not attend to, anything which hinders the brafs foot-rule in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> from continuing to occupy equal spaces during his use of it, in measuring the distance of two bodies. In like manner he selects an event which nature or art can repeat continually, and in which the circumstances which contribute to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> are invariably the same, or Quantity, their variations and their effects are infensible. He concludes that it will always occupy an equal portion of time for its accomplishment, or always last an equal time. Then, observing that, during the event whose duration he wishes to measure, this standard event is accomplished $20\\frac{1}{3}$ times, and that it is repeated $365\\frac{1}{4}$ times during the accomplishment of another event, he affirms that the durations of these are in the ratio of $20\\frac{1}{3}$ to $365\\frac{1}{4}$. It is thus (and with the same logical defect as in the measuring a line by a brafs rod) that the astronomer measures the celestial revolutions by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of the earth round its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, or by the vibrations of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>.\n\nWe are indebted for most of the preceding observations to Dr Reid, the celebrated author of the Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense, and of the Essays on the Intellectual and Active Powers of Man. He has published a dissertation on this subject in the 45th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions, No 489, which we recommend to our philosophical readers as a performance eminent for precision and acuteness. If we presume to differ from him in any trivial circumstance, it is with that deference and respect which is due to his talents and his worth.\n\nDr Reid justly observes, that as nothing has proportion which has not either extension, duration, or number, the characters of mathematical quantity may be restricted to these three. He calls them proper quantities, and all others he calls improper. We believe that, in the utmost precision of the English language, this denomination is very apposite, and that the word quantity, derived from quantum, always supposes measurement: But the word is frequently used in cases where its original is not kept in view, and we use other words as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> with it, when all mensuration, whether possible or not, is out of our thoughts. According to practice, therefore, the jus et norma loquendi, there seems to be no impropriety in giving this name, in our language at least, to whatever can be conceived as great or little. There is no impropriety in saying that the pain occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> is greater than that of the toothache; and when we search for the category to which the affection may be referred, we cannot find any other than quantity. We may be allowed therefore to say, with almost all our scientific countrymen, that every thing is conceivable in respect of quantity which we can think or speak of as greater and less; and that this notion is the characteristic of quantity as a genus, while measurableless is the characteristic of mathematical quantity as a species.\n\nBut do we not measure many quantities, and consider them mathematically, which have not this characteristic of being made up of their own distinguishable parts? What else is the employment of the mechanician, when speaking of velocities, forces, attractions, repulsions, magnetic influence, chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>, &c. &c.? Are not these mathematical sciences? And if the precision and certainty of mathematics arise from the nature of their specific object, are not all the claims of the mechanician and physical astronomer ill-founded pretensions? These questions require and deserve a serious answer.\n\nIt is most certain that we consider the notions which are expressed by these terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, force, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>, and\nQuantity, the like, as susceptible of measure, and we consider them mathematically.\n\nSome of these terms are nothing but names for relations of measurable quantity, and only require a little reflection to show themselves such. **Velocity** is one of these. It is only a name expressing a relation between the space described by a moving body and the time which elapses during its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. Certain moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of motion are familiar to us. What greatly exceeds this, such as the flight of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> when compared with our walking, excites our attention, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> gets a name. A motion not so rapid as we are familiar with, or as we wish, also gets a name; because in this the excess or defect may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> us. We wish for the flight of the hawk; we chide the tardy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> of our messenger: but it is scientific curiosity which first considers this relation as a separate object of contemplation, and the philosopher must have a name for it. He has not formed a new one, but makes use of a word of common language, whose natural meaning is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of a great space with a short time. Having once appropriated it, in his scientific <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOCABULARY\">vocabulary</a>, to this very general use, it loses with him its true signification. Tardiness would have done just as well, though its true meaning is diametrically opposite; and there is no greater impropriety in saying the tardy of a cannon bullet than in saying the velocity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>-hand of a watch. Velocity is a quality or affection of motion, the notion of which includes the notions of space and duration (two mathematical quantities), and no other. It does not therefore express a mathematical quantity itself, but a relation, a combination of two mathematical quantities of different kinds; and as it is measurable in the quantities so combined, its measure must be a unit of its own kind, that is, an unit of space as combined with an unit of time.\n\n**Density** is another word of the same kind, expressing a combination of space with number. **Denfer arbores** means trees standing at a small distance from each other; and the word is used in the same sense when we say that quicksilver is denser than water. The expression always suggests to the reflecting mind the notions of particles and their distances. We are indeed so habituated to complicated views of things, that we can see remote connections with astonishing rapidity; and a very few circumstances are sufficient for leading forward the mind in a train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. Common discourse is a most wonderful instance of this. It is in this way that we say, that we found by weighing them that inflammable air had not the fifth part of the density of common air. Supposing all matter to consist of equal atoms equally heavy, and knowing that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a bladder of air is the sum of the weights of all the atoms, and also knowing that the vicinity of the atoms is in a certain proportion of the number contained in a given bulk, we affirm that common air is more than six times denser than inflammable air; but this rapid decision is entirely the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, which makes us familiar with certain groups of conceptions, and we instantaneously distinguish them from others, and thus think and discourse rationally. The Latin language employs the word *frequens* to express both the combination of space and number, and that of time and number.\n\nThere are perhaps a few more words which express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of mathematical quantities of different kinds; and the corresponding ideas or notions are therefore proper and immediate subjects of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>: But there are many words which are expressive of things, or at least of notions, to which this way of considering them will not apply. All those affections or qualities of external bodies, by which they are conceived to act on each other, are of this kind: **Impulsive Force**, **Weight**, **Centripetal and Centrifugal Force**, **Magnetical**, **Electrical**, **Chemical Attraction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">Repulsion</a>**; in short, all that we consider as the immediate causes of natural phenomena. These we familiarly measure, and consider mathematically.\n\nWhat was said on this subject in the article **Physics Forces** will give us clear conceptions of this process of the phenomena of contemplation, and are known only by and in the phenomena which we consider as their effects. The phenomenon is not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of the agency of any cause, and the characteristic of its kind, but the measure of its degree. The necessary circumstances in this train of human thoughts are, 1st, The notion of the force as something susceptible of augmentation and diminution. 2d, The notion of an inseparable connection of the force with the effect produced, and of every degree of the one with a corresponding degree of the other. From these is formed the notion that the phenomenon or effect is the proper measure of the force or cause. All this is strictly logical.\n\nBut when we are considering these subjects mathematically, the immediate objects of our contemplation are not the forces which we are thus treating. It is not their relations which we perceive, and which we combine with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of circumstances and certainty of inference as are known in all other sciences: by no means; they are the phenomena only, which are subjects of purely mathematical discussion. They are motions, which involve only the notions of space and time; and when we have finished an accurate mathematical investigation, and make our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> concerning the forces, we are certain of its truth, because we suppose the forces to have the proportions and relations, and no other, which we observe in the phenomena. Thus, after having demonstrated, by the geometrical comparison of the lines and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> and surfaces of an ellipse, that the momentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a> of the moon from the tangent of her orbit is the 3600th part of the simultaneous deflection of a stone from the tangent of its parabolic path; Newton affirms, that the force by which a particle of the moon is retained in her orbit is the 3600th part of the weight of a particle of the stone; and having farther shown, from fact and observation, that these momentary deflections are inversely as the squares of the distances from the centre of the earth, he affirms, that all this is produced by a force which varies its intensity in this manner.\n\nNow all this investigation proceeds on the two suppositions mentioned above, and the measures of the forces are in fact the measures of the phenomena. The whole of physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and indeed the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> philosophy, might be taught and understood, without ever introducing the word force, or the notion which it is supposed to express: for our mathematical reasonings are really about the phenomena, which are subjects purely mathematical.\n\nThe precision, therefore, that we presume to affirm to attend these investigations, arises entirely from the measurable\nQuantity, measurable nature of the quantities which are the real objects of our contemplation, and the suitability and propriety of the measures which we adopt in our comparisons.\n\nSince, then, the phenomena are the immediate subjects of our discussion, and the operating powers are only inferences from the phenomena considered as effects, the quantity ascribed to them must also be an inference from the quantity of the effect, or of some circumstance in the effect. The measure, therefore, of the cause, or natural power or force, cannot be one of its own parts; for the whole and the part are equally unperceived by us. Our measure, therefore, must be a measure of some interesting part, or of the only interesting part of the phenomenon. It is therefore in a manner arbitrary, and depends chiefly on the interest we take in the phenomenon. It must, however, be settled with precision, so that all men in using it may mean the same thing. It must be settled, therefore, by the description of that part or circumstance of the phenomenon which is characteristic of the natural power. This description is the definition of the measure.\n\nThus Newton affirms as his measure of the centripetal force, the momentary deviation from uniform rectilineal motion. Others, and sometimes Newton himself, affirms the momentary change of velocity, which again is measured by twice this deviation. These measures, being thus selected, are always proper in a mathematical sense; and if strictly adhered to, can never lead us into any paradoxism. They may, however, be physically wrong: there may not be that indissoluble connection between the phenomenon and the supposed cause. But this is no mathematical error, nor does it invalidate any of our mathematical inferences: it only makes them useless for explaining the phenomenon by the principle which we adopted; but it prepares a modification of the phenomenon for some more fortunate application of physical principles.\n\nAll that can be defined in the definitions or descriptions of these measures is, that they may not deviate from the ordinary use of the terms, because this would always create <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, and occasion mistakes. Dr. Reid has given an example of an impropriety of this kind, which has been the subject of much debate among the writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural philosophy</a>. We mean the measure of the force inherent in a body in motion. Descartes, and all the writers of his time, affirmed the velocity produced in a body as the measure of the force which produces it; and observing that a body, in consequence of its being in motion, produces changes in the state or motion of other bodies, and that these changes are in the proportion of the velocity of the changing body, they asserted that there is in a moving body a vis insita, an inherent force, and that this is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to its velocity; saying that its force is twice or thrice as great, when it moves twice or thrice as fast at one time as at another. But Leibnitz observed, that a body which moves twice as fast, rises four times as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, against the uniform action of gravity; that it penetrates four times as deep into a piece of uniform clay; that it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> four times as many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, or a spring four times as strong, to the same degree; and produces a great many effects which are four times greater than those produced by a body which has half the initial velocity. If the velocity be triple, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a>, &c., the effects are nine times, 16 times, &c., greater; Quantity, and, in short, are proportional, not to the velocity, but to its square. This observation had been made before by Dr. Hooke, who has enumerated a prodigious variety of important cases in which this proportion of effect is observed. Leibnitz, therefore, affirmed, that the force inherent in a moving body is proportional to the square of the velocity.\n\nIt is evident that a body, moving with the same velocity, has the same inherent force, whether this be employed to move another body, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> springs, to rise in opposition to gravity, or to penetrate a mass of soft matter. Therefore these measures, which are so widely different, while each is agreeable to a numerous class of facts, are not measures of this something inherent in the moving body which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> its force, but are the measures of its exertions when modified according to the circumstances of the case; or, to speak still more cautiously and securely, they are the measures of certain classes of phenomena consequent on the action of a moving body. It is in vain, therefore, to attempt to support either of them by a demonstration. The measure itself is nothing but a definition. The Cartesian calls that a double force which produces a double velocity in the body on which it acts. The Leibnitzian calls that a quadruple force which makes a quadruple penetration. The reasonings of both in the demonstration of a proposition in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">dynamics</a> may be the same, as also the results, though expressed in different numbers.\n\nBut the two measures are far from being equally proper: for the Leibnitzian measure obliges us to do continual violence to the common use of words. When two bodies moving in opposite directions meet, strike each other, and stop, all men will say that their forces are equal, because they have the best test of equality which we can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a>. Or when two bodies in motion strike the parts of a machine, such as the opposite arms of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a>, and are thus brought completely to rest, we and all men will pronounce their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> energies by the intervention of the machine to be equal. Now, in all these cases, it is well known that a perfect equality is found in the products of the quantities of matter and velocity. Thus a ball of two pounds, moving with the velocity of four feet in a second, will stop a ball of eight pounds moving with the velocity of one foot per second. But the followers of Leibnitz say, that the force of the first ball is four times that of the second.\n\nAll parties are agreed in calling gravity a uniform or invariable accelerating force; and the definition which they give of such a force is, that it always produces the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, that is, equal accelerations in equal times, and therefore produces augmentations of velocity proportional to the times in which they are produced. The only effect ascribed to this force, and consequently the only thing which indicates, characterizes, and measures it, is the augmentation of velocity. What is this velocity, considered not merely as a mathematical term, but as a phenomenon, as an event, a production by the operation of a natural cause? It cannot be conceived any other way than as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to move on forever at a certain rate, if nothing shall change it. We cannot conceive this very clearly. We feel ourselves forced to animate, as it were, the body, and give it not only a will and intention to move in this manner, but a real exertion of some faculty in consequence.\nQuantity consequence of this determination of mind. We are conscious of such a train of operations in ourselves; and the last step of this train is the exertion or energy of some natural faculty, which we, in the utmost propriety of language, call force. By such analogical conception, we suppose a something, an energy, inherent in the moving body; and its only office is the production and continuation of this motion, as in our own case. Scientific curiosity was among our latest wants, and language was formed long before its appearance: as we formed analogical conceptions, we contented ourselves with the words already familiar to us, and to this something we gave the name Force, which expressed that energy in ourselves which bears some resemblance (in office at least) to the determination of a body to move on at a certain rate. This sort of allegory pervades the whole of our conceptions of natural operations, and we can hardly think or speak of any operation without a language, which supposes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> of matter. And, in the present case, there are so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of resemblance between the effects of our exertions and the operations of nature, that the language is most expressive, and has the strongest appearance of propriety. By exerting our force, we not only move and keep in motion, but we move other bodies. Just so a ball not only moves, but puts other bodies in motion, or penetrates them, &c.\u2014This is the origin of that conception which forcibly obtrudes itself into our thoughts, that there is inherent in a moving body a force by which it produces changes in other bodies. No such thing appears in the same body if it be not in motion. We therefore conclude, that it is the production of the moving force, whatever that has been. If so, it must be conceived as proportional to its producing cause. Now this force, thus produced or exerted in the moving body, is only another way of conceiving that determination which we call velocity, when it is conceived as a natural event. We can form no other notion of it. The vis inlata, the determination to move at a certain rate, and the velocity, are one and the same thing, considered in different relations.\n\nTherefore the vis inlata corpori moventi, the determination to move at a certain rate, and the velocity, should have one and the same measure, or any one of them may be taken for the measure of the other. The velocity being an object of perception, is therefore a proper measure of the inherent force; and the propriety is more evident by the perfect agreement of this use of the words with common language. For we conceive and express the action of gravity as uniform, when we think and say that its effects are proportional to the times of its action. Now all agree, that the velocity produced by gravity is proportional to the time of its action. And thus the measure of force, in reference to its producing cause, perfectly agrees with its measure, independent of this consideration.\n\nBut this agreement is totally lost in the Leibnitzian doctrine; for the body which has fallen four times as far, and has sustained the action of gravity twice as long, is said to have four times the force.\n\nThe quaintest and continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARADOX\">paradox</a> of expression which this measure of inherent force leads us into, would have quickly exploded it, had it not been that its chief abettors were engaged in a keen and acrimonious warfare with the British mathematicians who supported the claims of Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a>. They rejoiced to find in the elegant writings of Huyghens a physical principle of great extent, such as this is, which could be set in comparison with some of the wonderful discoveries in Newton's Principia. The fact, that in the mutual action of bodies on each other the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of the masses and the squares of the velocities remain always the same (which they call the conservatio virium circumvallum) is of almost universal extent; and the knowledge of it enabled them to give ready and elegant solutions of the most abstruse and intricate problems, by which they acquired a great and deserved celebrity. Dr Robert Hooke, whose observation hardly anything escaped, was the first (long before Huyghens) who remarked *, that in all the cases of the gradual production and extinction of motion, the sensible phaenomenon is proportional to the square of the produce, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a>, &c., &c., &c.\n\nJohn Bernoulli brought all these facts together, and systematized them according to the principle advanced by Huyghens in his treatise on the centre of oscillation. He and Daniel Bernoulli gave most beautiful specimens of the prodigious use of this principle for the solution of difficult physical problems in their dissertations on the motion and impulse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion. It was however very early objected to them (we think by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">Marquis</a> Poleni), that in the collision of bodies perfectly hard there was no such conservatio virium circumvallum; and that, in this case, the forces must be acknowledged to be proportional to the velocities. The objections were unanswerable.\u2014But John Bernoulli evaded their force, by affirming that there were and could be no bodies perfectly hard. This was the origin of another celebrated doctrine, on which Leibnitz greatly prided himself, the Law of Continuity, viz. that nothing is observed to change abruptly, or per fallum. But no one will pretend to say that a perfectly hard body is an inconceivable thing; on the contrary, all will allow that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> and compressibility are adjunct ideas, and not in the least necessary to the conception of a particle of matter, nay totally incompatible with our notion of an ultimate atom.\n\nSir Isaac Newton never could be provoked to engage in this dispute. He always considered it as a wilful abuse of words, and unworthy of his attention. He guarded against all possibility of cavil, by giving the most precise and perspicuous definitions of those measures of forces, and all other quantities which he had occasion to consider, and by carefully adhering to them. And in one proposition of about 20 lines, viz. the 39th of the 1st book of the Principia, he explained every phenomenon adduced in support of the Leibnitzian doctrine, showing them to be immediate consequences of the action of a force measured by the velocity which it produces or extinguishes. There it appears that the heights to which bodies will rise in opposition to the uniform action of gravity are as the squares of the initial velocities: So are the depths to which they will penetrate uniformly resisting matter: So is the number of equal springs which they will bend to the same degree, &c., &c., &c. We have had frequent occasion to mention this proposition as the most extensively useful of all Newton's discoveries. It is this which gives the immediate application of mechanical principles to the explanation of natural phenomena. It is incessantly employed in...\nin every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> by the very persons who hold by the other measure of forces, although such conduct is virtually giving up that measure. They all adopt, in every investigation the two theorems \\( f = v \\) and \\( f' = v^2 \\); both of which suppose an accelerating force \\( f \\) proportional to the velocity \\( v \\) which it produces by its uniform action during the time \\( t \\), and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> \\( f' = v^2 \\) is the 39th 1. Princip. and is the conservatio virium vivorum.\n\nThis famous dispute (the only one in the circle of mathematical science) has led us somewhat aside. But we have little more to remark with respect to measurable quantity. We cannot say what varieties of quantity are susceptible of strict measure, or that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to give accurate measures of everything susceptible of augmentation and diminution. We affirm, however, with confidence, that pain, pleasure, joy, &c., are not made up of their own parts, which can be contemplated separately; but they may chance to be associated by nature with something that is measurable; and we may one day be able to align their degrees with as much precision as we now ascertain the degrees of warmth by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the fluid in the thermometer. There is one sense in which they may all be measured, viz numerically, as Newton measures density, \\( w \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATRIX\">matrix</a>, &c. We can conceive the pain of each of a dozen men to be the same. Then it is evident that the pain of eight of these men is to that of the remaining four as two to one; but from such mentalization we do not foresee any benefit likely to arise.\n\n**Quantity**, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, an affection of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>, whereby its measure, or the time wherein it is pronounced, is ascertained; or that which determines the syllable to be long or short.\n\nQuantity is also the object of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSODY\">prosody</a>, and distinguishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>; and the economy and arrangement of quantities, that is, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> of long and short syllables, makes what we call the number.

He was educated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; became a member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>; and was for some time cup-bearer to the queen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and chronologer to the city of London. It was probably on the run of her affairs that he went to Ireland as secretary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USHER\">Usher</a>; but the troubles in that kingdom forced him to return, and not finding affairs more at peace in England, some difficulties he met with were thought to have hastened his death, which happened in 1614. His works both in prose and verse are numerous, and were formerly in great esteem, particularly his Divine Emblems; but the obsolete quaintness of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> has caused them to fall into neglect, excepting among particular classes of readers.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of Quarles, says a late author, has been branded with more than common abuse, and he seems to have been censured merely from the want of being read. If his poetry failed to gain him friends and readers, his piety should at least have secured him peace and goodwill. He too often, no doubt, mistook the enthusiasm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of fancy; to mix the waters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELICON\">Helicon</a> in the same cup, was reserved for the hand of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>; and for him, and him only, to find the bays of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLIVET\">Olivet</a> equally verdant with those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a>. Yet, as the effusions of a real poetical mind, however thwarted by untowardness of subject, will be seldom rendered totally abortive, we find in Quarles original imagery, striking sentiment, fertility of expression, and happy combinations; together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of style that merits the observation of the writers of verse. Grofs deficiencies of judgement, and the infelicity of his subjects, concurred in ruining him. Perhaps no circumstance whatever can give a more complete idea of Quarles's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> than a late edition of his Emblems; the following passage is extracted from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>: 'Mr Francis Quarles, the author of the Emblems that go under his name, was a man of the most exemplary piety, and had a deep insight into the mysteries of our holy religion. But, for all that, the book itself is written in so old a language, that many parts of it are scarce intelligible in the present age; many of his phrases are so affected, that no person, who has any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for reading, can peruse them with the least degree of pleasure; many of his expressions are harsh, and sometimes whole lines are included in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENTHESIS\">parenthesis</a>, by which the mind of the reader is diverted from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> object. His Latin mottoes under each cut can be of no service to an ordinary reader, because he cannot understand them. In order, therefore, to accommodate the public with an edition of Quarles's Emblems properly modernized, this work was undertaken.' Such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of Quarles is chaining Columbus to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAR\">oar</a>, or making John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of Marlborough a train-band corporal.\"\n\n**Quarries**, a name <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> given to an extraordinary cavern under the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>\nence of which is known to few even of the inhabitants, and many of those who have heard of it consider the whole as an idle story. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> visited this cavern in 1784, having, with many others, obtained leave (which is very cautiously granted) to inspect it, accompanied by guides with torches. He gives the following account of it in the second volume of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> Transactions. \"At the entrance by the Observatoire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a>, the path is narrow for a considerable way; but soon we entered large and spacious streets, all marked with names, the same as in the city; different advertisements and bills were found, as we proceeded, pasted on the walls, so that it had every appearance of a large town swallowed up in the earth.\n\n\"The general height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> is about nine or ten feet; but in some parts not less than 30 and even 40. In many places there is a liquor continually dropping from it, which congeals immediately, and forms a species of transparent stone, but not so fine and clear as rock crystal. As we continued our peregrination, we thought ourselves in no small danger from the roof, which we found but indifferently propped in some places with wood much decayed. Under the houses, and many of the streets, however, it seemed to be tolerably secured by immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> set in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>; in other parts, where there are only fields or gardens above it, it was totally unsupported for a considerable space, the roof being perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, or a plane piece of rock. After traversing about two miles, we again descended about 20 steps, and here found some workmen in a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and damp place, propping up a most dangerous part, which they were fearful would give way every moment. The path here is not more than three feet in width, and the roof so low, that we were obliged to stoop considerably.\n\n\"On walking some little distance farther, we entered into a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALOON\">saloon</a> cut out of the rock, and said to be exactly under the \u00c9glise de St Jacques. This was illuminated with great taste, occasioned an agreeable surprise, and made us all ample amends for the danger and difficulty we had just before gone through. At one end was a representation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a> of some of the principal forts in the Indies, with the fortifications, draw-bridges, &c. Cannons were planted with a couple of soldiers to each ready to fire. Centinels were placed in different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a>, particularly before the governor's house; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGIMENT\">regiment</a> of armed men was drawn up in another place with their general in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>. The whole was made up of a kind of clay which the place affords, was ingeniously contrived, and the light that was thrown upon it gave it a very pretty effect.\n\n\"On the other side of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> was a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> set out with cold tongues, bread, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, and some of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a> I ever drank. Now everything was hilarity and mirth; our fears were entirely dispelled, and the danger we dreaded the moment before was now no longer thought of. In short, we were all in good spirits again, and proceeded on our journey about two miles farther, when our guides judged it prudent for us to ascend, as we were then got to the steps which lead up to the town. We here found ourselves safe at the Val de Grace, near to the English Benedictine convent, without the least accident having happened to any one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>. We imagined we had walked about two French leagues, and were absent from the surface of the earth betwixt four and five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>.\n\n\"There were formerly several openings into the quarries, but the two I have mentioned, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">Observatory</a> and the Val de Grace, are, I believe, the only ones left; and these the inspectors keep constantly locked, and rarely open them, except to strangers particularly introduced, and to workmen who are always employed in some part by the king. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> thought it a necessary precaution to secure all the entrances into this cavern, from its having been formerly inhabited by a famous gang of robbers, who infested the country for many miles round the city of Paris.\n\n\"As to the origin of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a>, I could not, on the strictest inquiry, learn any thing satisfactory; and the only account I know published is the following contained in the Tableaux de Paris, nouvelle edition, tome premier, chapitre 5me, page 12me.\n\n\"For the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of Paris it was necessary to get the stone in the environs; and the consumption of it was very considerable. As Paris was enlarged, the suburbs were indefinably built on the ancient quarries, so that all that you see without is essentially wanting in the earth for the foundation of the city; hence proceed the frightful cavities which are at this time found under the houses in several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. They stand upon abysses. It would not require a very violent shock to throw back the stones to the place from whence they have been raised with so much difficulty. Eight men being swallowed up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> of 150 feet deep, and some other less known accidents, excited at length the vigilance of the police and the government, and, in fact, the buildings of several quarters have been privately propped up, and by this means a support given to these obscure subterraneous places which they before wanted.\n\n\"All the suburbs of St James's, Harps-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, and even the street of Tournon, stand upon the ancient quarries; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> have been erected to support the weight of the houses. What a subject for reflections, in considering this great city formed and supported by means absolutely contrary! These towers, these steeples, the arched roofs of these temples, are so many signs to tell the eye that what we now see in the air is wanting under our feet.\"","sp":228,"ep":242},{"h":"QUARRY","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, out of which are got marble, freestone, slate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">limestone</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other matters proper for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">STRATA</a>.\n\nSome limestone quarries in Fife are highly worthy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the curious, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of an amazing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of organized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> productions found in them. One of this kind was opened about the year 1759, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> called Endersteel, in the neighbourhood of Kirkaldy, belonging to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> St Clair.\n\nThe flakes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, which are of unequal thickness, most of them from eight to ten inches, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> horizontally, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. Each of these flakes, when broken, presents to our view an amazing collection of petrified sea bodies, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of fishes, stalks of sea-weed, vast quantities of shells, such as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> found on those coasts, besides several others of very uncommon figures. In some places the shells are so numerous, that little else is to be seen but prodigious clusters or concretions of them. In the uppermost stratum the shells are so entire, that the outer crust or plate may be scraped off with the finger; and the stalks of the sea-weed have a darkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, not that glossy whiteness which they have in the heart of\nQuarry. The smallest rays or veins of the shells are deeply indented on the stone, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> upon wax. In short, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> spot at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> could exhibit a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sea-bodies than are to be found in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock; for we have the skeletons of several fishes, the antennae or feelers of lobsters, the roots and stalks of sea-weeds, with the very capsules which contain the seed. The place where all these curiosities are found is on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> about an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> from the sea; and as the ground is pretty steep the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, it may be 200 feet higher at least.\n\nThere are two or three things to be remarked here.\n\n1. That among all the bodies we have mentioned, there are none but what are specifically heavier than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. This holds so constantly true, that the sea-weed, which floats in water when the plant is entire, has been stripped of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> leaves, which make it buoyant, before it has been lodged here.\n\n2. The shells have been all empty; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> ones, as those of the flat kind, are always found single, or with one side only.\n\n3. The rock seems to have been gradually deserted by the sea, and for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, walked with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>; for the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> is all eaten, and hollowed in many places like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>-comb, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as we observe in flat rocks exposed every tide to the access and recess of the waters. See the article Sea.\n\nQuarry, or Quarral, among glaziers, a pane of glass cut in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> form.\n\nQuarries are of two kinds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> and long; each of which are of different sizes, expressed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the pieces that make a foot of glass, viz. eighths, tenths, eighteenths, and twentieths: but all the sizes are cut to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> in the square quarrels being $77^\\circ 19'$, and $67^\\circ 21'$ in the long ones.\n\nQuarry, among hunters, is sometimes used for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the entrails of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> taken, given by way of reward to the hounds.\n\nQuarry, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALCONRY\">falconry</a>, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> which the hawk is in pursuit of, or has killed.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">Quart</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, being the fourth part of some other measure. The English quart is the fourth part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLON\">gallon</a>, and contains two pints. The quart of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> was the fourth part of their congius. The French have various quarts, besides their quart or pot consisting of two pints, and are distinguished by the whole of which they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>; as quart de maud, and quart de boisseau.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTAN\">Quartan</a>, a measure containing the fourth part of some other measure.\n\nQuartan, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of intermittent fever. See Medicine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTATION\">Quartation</a>, is an operation by which the quantity of one thing is made equal to a fourth part of the quantity of another thing. Thus when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> alloyed with silver is to be parted, we are obliged to facilitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the aquafortis, by reducing the quantity of the former of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> to one fourth part of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>; which is done by sufficiently increasing the quantity of the silver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it be necessary. This operation is called quartation, and is preparatory to the parting; and even many authors extend this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> to the operation of parting. See Ores, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a> of.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">Quarter</a>, the fourth part of any thing, the fractional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for which is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nQuarter, in weights, is generally used for the fourth part of an hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> avoirdupois, or 28 lb.\n\nUsed as the name of a dry measure, quarter is the fourth part of a ton in weight, or eight bushels.\n\nQuarter, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANEGE\">manege</a>. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> from quarter to quarter, is to ride a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> three times in upon the first of the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of a square; then changing your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, to ride him three times upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; and so to the third and fourth; always changing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and observing the same order.\n\nQuarters, with respect to the parts of a horse, is used in various senses: thus the shoulders and fore-legs are called the fore-quarters, and the hips and hinder-legs the hind quarters. The quarters of a horse's foot are the sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>, comprehending between the toe and the heel; the inner quarters are those opposite to one another, facing from one foot to the other; and these are always weaker than the outside quarters, which lie on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> sides of the coffin. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">False</a> quarters, are a cleft in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> of a horse's hoof, extending from the coronet to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a>. A horse is said to be quarter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a> when for any disorder in the coffin we are obliged to cut one of the quarters of the hoof.\n\nQuarter, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, the fourth part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>: thus, from the new moon to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> is the first quarter; from this to full moon, the second quarter, &c.\n\nQuarter, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, is applied to the parts or members of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of a coat that is quartered, or divided into four quarters.\n\nFranc Quarter, in Heraldry, is a quarter single or alone; which is to possess one fourth part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>. It makes one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> ordinaries of a coat.\n\nQuarter of a Ship, that part of a ship's side which lies towards the stern; or which is comprehended between the aftmost end of the main chains and the sides of the stern, where it is terminated by the quarter-pieces.\n\nAlthough the lines by which the quarter and bow of a ship, with respect to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, are only imaginary, yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> appears sufficiently to have ascertained their limits: so that if we were to divide the ship's sides into five equal portions, the names of each space would be readily enough expressed. Thus the first, from the stern, would be the quarter; the second, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABAFT\">abaft</a> the midships; the third, the midships; the fourth, before the midships; and the fifth, the bow. Whether these divisions, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> are somewhat arbitrary, are altogether improper, may be readily discovered by referring to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> situation or approach of two adjacent vessels. The enemy boarded us on the larboard side! Whereabouts? Abaft the midships, before the midships, &c.\n\nFig. 1. represents a geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> of a quarter of a 74 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> ship.

See the article HEAD.\n\nAs the marks, by which vessels of different constructions are distinguished from each other, are generally more conspicuous on the stern or quarter than any other part, we have represented some of the quarters, which assume the most different shapes, and form the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> with each other. Fig. 2 shows the stern and quarter of a Dutch flight. Fig. 3, the stern and quarter of a cat. Fig. 4 is the stern and quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLEY\">galley</a>. Fig. 5 exhibits the quarter of a first-rate galley, otherwise called a galleass. Fig. 6, the quarter of a Dutch dogger, or galliot. Fig. 7 represents the stern and quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLOOP\">sloop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\n\nThe quarters of all other ships have a near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to those above exhibited. Thus all ships of the line, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indiamen, are formed with a quarter little differing from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in this plate. Xebecs have quarters nearly resembling those of galleasses, only somewhat higher. Haggboats and pinks approach the figure of cats, the former being a little broader in the stern, and the latter a little narrower; and the sterns and quarters of cats seem to be derived from those of fly-boats. The sterns of Dutch doggers and galliots are indeed singular, and like those of no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> vessel: they have nevertheless a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> resemblance to the ships of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Grecians, as represented in medals and other monuments of antiquity.\n\nOn the Quarter, may be defined an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, contained between the line prolonged from the ship's stern and any distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, ships, &c. Thus if the ship's keel lies on an east and west line, the stern being westward, any distant object perceived on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west or south-west, is said to be on the larboard or starboard quarter.\n\nQuarter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">Bill</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a>, containing the different stations, to which all the officers and crew of the ship are quartered in the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, and the names of all the persons appointed to those stations.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> is to mark the marches and encampments of an army: he should know the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> perfectly well, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, plains, marshes, woods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, defiles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, &c. even to the smallest brook. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">Prior</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, he receives the order and route from the commanding general, and appoints a place for the quarter-masters of the army to meet him next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, Quarter, with whom he marches to the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>; where being come, and having viewed the ground, he marks out to the regimental quarter-masters the ground allowed each regiment for their camp; he chooses the head-quarters, and appoints the villages for the generals of the army's quarters: he appoints a proper place for the encampment of the train of artillery: he conducts foraging parties, as likewise the troops to cover them against assaults, and has a share in regulating the winter-quarters and cantonments.\n\nQuarter Netting, a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-work, extended along the rails on the upper part of a ship's quarter. In a ship of war these are always double, being supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> cranes, placed at proper distances. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> is sometimes filled with cork, or old sails; but chiefly with the hammocks of the sailors, so as to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> to prevent the execution of the enemy's small arms in battle.\n\nQuarter-Sessions, a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> held quarterly by the justices of peace of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. This court is Comment, appointed by stat. 2 Hen. V. c. 4. to be in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MICHAELMAS\">Michaelmas</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; the first week after the Epiphany; the first week after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a>; and in the week after the translation of Saint Thomas \u00e0 Becket, or the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>. The court is held before two or more justices of the peace, one of whom must be of the quorum. The jurisdiction of this court by 34 Ed. III. c. 1. extends to the trying and determining of all felonies and trespasses whatsoever, though they seldom, if ever, try any greater offence than small felonies within the benefit of clergy, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> providing, that if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of difficulty arises, they shall not proceed to judgment, but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of one of the justices of the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMON_PLEAS\">common pleas</a>, or one of the judges of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSIZE\">assize</a>. And therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MURDERERS\">murderers</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> felons are usually remitted for a more solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> to the assizes. They cannot also try any new created offence, without express power given them by the statute which creates it. But there are many offences, and particular matters, which by particular statutes belong properly to this jurisdiction, and ought to be prosecuted in this court; as, the smaller misdemeanors against the public or commonwealth, not amounting to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELONY\">felony</a>, and especially offences relating to the game, highways, alehouses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> children, the settlement and provision for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, vagrants, servants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, apprentices, and \u043f\u043e\u043fish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECUSANTS\">recusants</a>. Some of these are proceeded upon by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>, and others in a summary way by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and order thereupon; which order may, for the most part, unless guarded against by particular statutes, be removed into the court of king's bench, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CERTIORARI\">certiorari</a> facias, and be there either qualified or confirmed. The records or rolls of the sessions are committed to the custody of a special officer, denominated the curios rotulorum. In most corporation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> there are quarter-sessions kept before justices of their own, within their respective limits, which have exactly the same authority as the general quarter-sessions of the county, except in very few instances: one of the most considerable of which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of appeals from orders of removal of the poor, which, though they be from the orders of corporation justices, must be to the sessions of the county, by 8 and 9 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">Will</a>. III. c. 30. In both corporations\nrations and counties at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, there is sometimes kept a special or petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a>, by a few justices, for dispatching smaller business in the neighbourhood between the times of the general sessions, as for licensing alehouses, passing the accounts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>-officers, and the like.\n\nQuarter-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">Staff</a>, a long staff borne by foresters, parkkeepers, &c., as a badge of their office, and occasionally used as a weapon.\n\nQuarters, a name given at sea to the several stations where the officers and crew of a ship of war are posted in action. See Naval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TACTICS\">Tactics</a>.\n\nThe number of men appointed to manage the artillery is always in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the guns, and the number and condition of the ship's crew. They are, in general, as follow, when the ship is well manned, so as to fight both sides at once occasionally:\n\n| Pounder | No. of men | Pounder | No. of men |\n|---------|------------|---------|------------|\n| To a 42 | -          | To a 9  | -          |\n| 32      | -          | 6       | -          |\n| 24      | -          | 11      | -          |\n| 18      | -          | 9       | -          |\n| 12      | -          | 7       | -          |\n\nThis number, to which is often added a boy to bring powder to every gun, may be occasionally reduced, and the guns nevertheless well managed.

The master superintends the movements of the ship, and whatever relates to the sails. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOATSWAIN\">boatswain</a>, and a sufficient number of men, are stationed to repair the damaged rigging; and the gunner and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTER\">carpenter</a>, wherever necessary, according to their respective offices.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINES\">marines</a> are generally quartered on the poop and forecastle, or gang-way, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of their officers; although, on some occasions, they assist at the great guns, particularly in distant cannonading.\n\nQuarters, at a siege, the encampment upon one of the principal piazzas round a place besieged, to prevent relief and convoys.\n\nHead Quarters of an Army, the place where the commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> has his quarters. The quarters of generals of horse are, if possible, in villages behind the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and left wings, and the generals of foot are often in the same place; but the commander in chief should be near the centre of the army.\n\nQuarters of Refreshment, the place or places where troops that have been much harassed are put to recover themselves during some part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a>.\n\nIntrenched Quarters, a place fortified with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a> and parapet to secure a body of troops.\n\nWinter Quarters, sometimes means the space of time included between leaving the camp and taking the field; but more properly the places where the troops are quartered during the winter.\n\nThe first business, after the army is in winter-quarters, is to form the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of troops to cover the quarters well: which is done either behind a river, under cover of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of strong posts, or under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of fortified towns. Hussars are very useful on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\n\nIt should be observed, as an invariable maxim in winter-quarters, that your regiments be disposed in brigades, to be always under the eye of a general officer; and, if possible, let the regiments be so distributed, as to be each under the command of its own chief.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTILE\">Quartile</a>, an aspect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a> when they are at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of 90\u00b0 from each other, and it is denoted by the character \u25a1.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERING\">Quartering</a>, in heraldry, is dividing a coat into four or more quarters, or quarterings, by parting, couping, &c., that is, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> lines, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTO_DECIMANS\">Quarto-decimans</a>, an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> in the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, who taught that Easter should always be celebrated according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Jews, on the fourteenth day of the moon in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of March, whosoever that day fell out. And hence they derived their name quarto-decimani, q. d. Fourteenethers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIANS\">Arians</a> were mightily attached to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, pretending that it was built on the authority of St John, who was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a>; and Pope Victor could never bring them to obedience in this article, though he was upon the point of excommunicating them: but it is more probable he contented himself with menaces. See Easter.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTZ\">Quartz</a>, a mineral composed chiefly of siliceous earths.

In a contract there must be the mutual consent of both parties, but in a quasi-contract one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> may be bound or obligated to the other, without having given his consent to the act whereby he is obliged. For example: I have done your business, in your absence, without your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCURATION\">procuration</a>, and it has succeeded to your advantage. I have then an action against you for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of what I have disbursed, and you an action against me to make me give an account of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a>, which amounts to a quasi-contract.\n\nQuasi-Crime, or Quasi-delict, in the civil law, the action of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who does damage, or evil, involuntarily.

This may be looked upon as a kind of suburb; and between this and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> street is a very steep ascent, in which they have made steps for the foot passengers to go up. This may be called the Upper Town, wherein is the bishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>; and between two large squares is a fort where the governor lodges. The Recollets have handsome houses over-against it, and on the right is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> church; over-against this is the Jesuits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, and between them are well built houses; from the fort runs two streets, which are crossed by a third, and between these is a church and a convent. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> square are two descents to the river of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOTEL\">Hotel</a> Dieu is in the midway; and from thence are small houses, which reach to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENDANT\">intendant</a>. On the other side of the Jesuits college, where the church stands, is a pretty long street in which is a nunnery. Almost all the houses are built of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and there are about 7000 inhabitants; the fort is a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, but not quite finished. Quebec is not regularly fortified; but it cannot be easily taken; for the harbour is flanked with two bastions, which at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> are almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>.

To the left of the harbour, on the side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, there are large batteries of cannon, and some mortars; besides these, there are several other fortifications not very easy to be described. In 1711 the British fitted out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to conquer Canada, which failed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the rashness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>; who, contrary to the advice of his pilot, went too near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">Seven</a> Isles, and so lost his largest ships, and 3000 of his best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>.

This species furnishes that useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> cork; it being the bark of the tree, which becoming of a thick fungous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, under which, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, is formed a new bark, and the old being detached for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, the tree still lives, and the succeeding young bark becomes also of the same thick spongy nature in five or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years, fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARKING\">barking</a>, having likewise another fresh bark forming under it, becoming cork like the others in the like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of time; and in this manner these trees wonderfully furnish the cork for our use, and of which is made the corks for bottles, bungs for barrels, and numerous other useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>. The tree grows in great plenty in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, and from these countries we receive the cork.

But all the larger growing kinds, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECIDUOUS\">deciduous</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVERGREENS\">evergreens</a>, demand esteem principally as first-rate forest-trees for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>. The English oak, however, claims <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> as a timber-tree, for its prodigious height and bulk, and superior worth of its wood. Every possessor of considerable estates ought therefore to be particularly affiduous in raising woods of them, which is effected by sowing the acorns either in a nursery and the plants transplanted where they are to remain, or sowed at once in the places where they are always to stand. All the sorts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> prosper in any middling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and open situation, though in a loamy soil they are generally more prosperous; however, there are but few soils in which oaks will not grow; they will even thrive tolerably in gravelly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>, and clayey <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, as may be observed in many parts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of the common oak.\n\nThe oak is of the utmost importance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, and its cultivation deserves the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. Much, therefore to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for encouraging Arts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">Manufactures</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, they have excelled particular attention to it; and many excellent observations, drawn from practice, will be found in their Transactions.\n\nThe propagation of the striped-leaved varieties of the common oak, and any particular variety of the other species, must be effected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAFTING\">grafting</a>, as they will not continue the same from seed: the grafting may be performed upon any kind of oakling stocks raised from the acorns, and train them for standards like the Quercus others.\n\nThe oak is remarkable for its slowness of growth, bulk, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a>. It has been remarked that the trunk has attained to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> only of 14 inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and of some to 20, in the space of fourscore years. As to bulk, we have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of an oak belonging to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Powis, growing in Broomfield wood, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUDLOW\">Ludlow</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>, in the year 1764, the trunk of which measured 68 feet in girth, 23 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and which, reckoning 90 feet for the larger branches, contained in the whole 1455 feet of timber, round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, or 29 loads and five feet, at 50 feet to a load.\n\nThe Greendale oak, &c., we have already mentioned (see Oak). In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of many, the Cowthorpe oak near Wetherby in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> is the father of the forest. Dr Hunter, in his edition of Evelyn, has given an engraving of it. Within three feet of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> he says it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> 16 yards, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> 26. In 1776, though in a ruined condition, it was 85 feet high, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> limb extended 16 yards from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLE\">bole</a>. The foliage was very thin. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this measurement were taken as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> of the stem, the size of this tree would be enormous; but, like most very large trees, its stem is short, spreading wide at the base, the roots rising above the ground like buttresses to the trunk, which is similar not to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> but to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUSTUM\">frustum</a> of a cone.

There is a large circumference at five and six feet that would render the measure unfair. In 1778, this tree was increased half an inch in ten years. It does not appear to be hollow, but by the trifling increase I conclude it not found.\" These dimensions, however, are exceeded by those of the Boddington oak. It grows in a piece of rich grassland, called the Old Orchard Ground, belonging to Boddington-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">Manor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">Farm</a>, lying near the turnpike-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHELTENHAM\">Cheltenham</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEWKESBURY\">Tewkesbury</a>, in the Vale of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>. The stem is remarkably collected at the root, the sides of its trunk being much more upright than those of large trees in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>; and yet its circumference at the ground is about 20 paces; measuring with a two-foot rule, it is more than 18 yards. At three feet high it is 43 feet, and where flatted, i.e., from five to fix feet high, it is 36 feet. At six feet it swells out larger, and forms an enormous head, which has been furnished with huge, and probably extensive, arms. But time and the fury of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> have robbed it of much of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>; and the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> in 1783 was eight yards from the stem.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for May 1794 we have an account of an oak tree growing in Penhurst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">park</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, together with an engraving. It is called the Bear or Bare oak, from being supposed to resemble that which Camden thought gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> at Penhurst is that it is the very tree planted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> that the celebrated Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYDNEY\">Sydney</a> was born. \"Some late writers (says Mr\nMr Rawlet) have questioned this, and think that to have been a different tree, which was cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> some years ago, and was indeed much larger than this. I remember being once in the hollow of the present oak with the late Sir John Cullum; and his opinion then was, that its antiquity was greater than the period assigned. But, I assure you, the tradition of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> is constant for this tree; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of it, an old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> of 94 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, now living, has told me, that all the tenants used to furnish themselves with boughs from this tree, to stick in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, whenever they went to meet the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>, as was always the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> to do at the end of the park when they came to reside at their seat here. This fine old oak stands upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> about 500 yards from their venerable manor, near a large piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> called Lancewood. Ben Jonson and Waller have particularly noticed it; and from the distinguished owners of this place, it may be truly said to stand on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASSIC\">classic</a> ground. Within the hollow of it there is a seat, and it is capable of containing five or six persons with ease. The bark round the entrance was so much grown up, that it has lately been cut away to facilitate the access. The dimensions of the tree are these:\n\n| Girth close to the ground | Feet. Inches |\n|--------------------------|-------------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a> one foot from ditto | 35 6        |\n| Ditto five feet from ditto | 27 6        |\n| Height taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a>    | 24 0        |\n| Girth of lowest, but not largest, limb | 73 0 |\n\nWith respect to longevity, Linnaeus gives account of an oak 260 years old; but we have had traditions of some in England (how far to be depended upon we know not) that have attained to more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that age. Mr Marshall, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Thomas Beever, Esq., Bath Papers, vol. i. p. 79, makes some very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> calculations on the age of trees, and concludes from the increase of the Bentley oak, &c., that the Fortworth chestnut is 1100 years old.\n\nBesides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> purposes to which the timber is applied in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, and the bark in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TANNING\">tanning</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, there are other uses of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, to which the different parts of this tree have been referred. The Highlanders use the bark to dye their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YARN\">yarn</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, or, mixed with copperas, of a black colour. They call the oak the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of all the trees in the forest; and the herdsmen would think himself and his flock unfortunate if he had not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> of it. The acorns are a good food to fatten swine and turkeys; and, after the severe winter of the year 1799, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> people in France were miserably constrained to eat them themselves. There are, however, acorns produced from another species of oak, which are eaten to this day in Spain and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, with as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> as chestnuts, without the dreadful compulsion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>.\n\n**Quercus Marina**, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a> Oak, in Botany, the name of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>-leaved dichotomous sea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUCUS\">fucus</a>. It is not agreed, among the late botanists, what was the sea-oak of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>; and the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> botanists, Clusius and Cesalpinus, suppose it to have been a species of the shrubby coralline; but that seems by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, since Theophrastus says his sea-oak had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, thick, and flabby <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>; whence we may much more naturally conclude it to have been of the fucus clas.\n\n**Queria**, a genus of plants, belonging to the triandra clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 2nd order, Caryophylli.

He contributed to the defeating of the naval power of Spain before Gattari; was dangerously wounded before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a> in 1642, and on other occasions: he went into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the Swedes, and became vice-admiral; gave the Danes an entire defeat, killed their admiral, and took his ship. He was recalled into France in 1647, and commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a> sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>. The sea-affairs of France being much fallen, he fitted out <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> ships for the relief of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> that blocked up Bordeaux; which was the principal cause of the surrender of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>. He was very fortunate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> wars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the Dutch thrice, and De Ruyter was killed. He also obliged the Algerines to sue for peace from France in a very humble manner.

They had the keeping of the decrees of the senate: and hence came the two officers of *questor principis*, or *augusti*, sometimes called *candidatus principis*, whose office resembled in most respects that of our secretaries of state, and the *questor palatii*, answering in a great measure to our lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUEUE\">Queue</a>**, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, signifies the tail of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>; thus, if a lion be borne with a forked tail, he is blazoned double-queued.\n\n**Queue d'Aronde**, or Swallows Tail, in Fortification, a detached or outwork, the sides of which open towards the champaign, or draw closer towards the gorge.

Quevedo wrote some heroic, lyric, and facetious poems. He also composed several treatises on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> subjects, and has translated some authors into Spanish. He died in 1644. The most known of his works are, 1. The Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARNASSUS\">Parnassus</a>. 2. The Adventurer Buffon. 3. Visions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">Hell</a> Reformed, &c.\n\nQuevedo was one of the greatest scholars and most eminent poets of his time. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> was spent in the service of his country in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, where he distinguished himself with the utmost sagacity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>.

As a poet, he excelled both in the serious and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLESQUE\">burlesque</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, and was singularly happy in that particular turn we have since admired in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTLER\">Butler</a> and Swift.

After promising that we have successfully repeated the experiment, we shall give the account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in his own words.\n\n\"Every one of you, I think, will allow that fences are material objects to be attended to in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; you must also be convinced that there is no plant in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of which they can so properly be made as the Crataegus oxyacantha Linnei, or common white thorn. In consequence of my being convinced of this, I have been induced to make a few experiments to effect the better propagation of that valuable plant; the result of which, along with specimens of my success, I beg leave to submit to your inspection.\n\n\"In the year 1801, I had occasion to purchase a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of thorns, and finding them very dear, I was determined to try some experiments, in order if possible to raise them at a less expense. I tried to propagate them from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTINGS\">cuttings</a> of the branches, but with little or no success. I likewise tried if pieces of the root would grow; and I cut from the thorns which I had purchased about a dozen of such roots as pleased me, and planted them in a border along with those I had bought. To my great astonishment, not one of them died; and in two years they became as good thorns as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of those I had purchased. The thorns I purchased were three years old when I got them. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1802, I had occasion to move a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a>, from which I procured as many roots of thorns as made me upwards of two thousand cuttings, of which I did not lose five in the hundred.\n\n\"In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of 1803, I likewise planted as many cuttings of thorn roots as I could get. In 1804, I did the same; and this year I shall plant many thousands.\n\n\"I have sent for your inspection specimens of the produce of 1802, 1803, and 1804, raised after my method, with the best I could get of those raised from haws in the common way, which generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> one year in the ground before they vegetate. They are exactly one, two, and three years old, from the day they were planted.\u2014I was so pleased with my success in raising so valuable an article to the farming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of this kingdom, at so trifling an expense, (for it is merely that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the roots into lengths and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> them), that I was determined to make it known to the world, and could think of no better method than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> it to your society; and should you so far approve of this method of raising thorns, as to think me entitled to any honorary reward, I shall receive it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, but shall feel myself amply repaid for any trouble I have been at, should you think it worthy a place in the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of your Transactions.\n\n\"The method of raising the thorns from roots of the plant, is as follows.\n\n\"I would advise every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> to purchase a hundred or a thousand thorns, according to the size of his farm, and plant them in his orchard or garden, and when they have attained the thickness of my three-year-old specimens, which is the size I always prefer for planting in fences, let him take them and prune the roots in the manner I have pruned the specimen sent you, from which he will upon an average get ten or twelve cuttings from each plant, which is as good as thorns of the same thickness; so that you will easily perceive that in three years he will have a succession of plants fit for use, which he may if he pleases increase tenfold every time he takes them up.\n\n\"The spring (say in all April) is the best time to plant the cuttings, which must be done in rows half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> asunder, and about four inches from each other in the row; they ought to be about four inches long, and planted with the top one-fourth of an inch out of the ground, and well fattened; otherwise they will not succeed so well.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why I prefer spring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> for planting the roots, is, that were they to be planted in autumn, they would not have got sufficient hold of the ground before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> set in, which would raise them all from the ground; and, if not entirely destroy the plants, would oblige the farmer to plant them afresh.\n\n\"I have attached the produce of my three-year-old specimen to the plants it came from, cut in the way I always practise; on the thick end of the root I make two, and on the other end one cut, by which means the proper end to be planted uppermost, which is the thick one, may easily be known.\n\n\"Although I recommend the roots to be planted in April,\nApril, yet the farmer may, where he pleases, take up the thorns he may want, and put the roots he has pruned off into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or mould, where they will keep until he has leisure to cut them into proper lengths for planting; he will likewise keep them in the same way until planted.\n\n\"The great advantage of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> is: first, that in case any one has raised from haws a thorn with remarkably large prickles, of vigorous growth, or pollarding any other qualification requisite to make a good fence, he may propagate it far better and sooner, from roots, than any other way. Secondly, in three years he may raise from roots a better plant than can in six years be raised from haws, and with double the quantity of roots; my three-year-old specimen would have been half as big again, had I not been obliged to move all my cuttings the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year after they were planted.\n\n\"It would not be a bad way, in order to get roots, to plant a hedge in any convenient place, and on each side trench the ground two yards wide, and two grafts deep; from which, every two or three years, a large quantity of roots might be obtained, by trenching the ground over again, and cutting away what roots were found, which would all be young and of a proper thickness.\"","sp":247,"ep":251},{"h":"QUET","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> given by the Chinese to a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> found in many parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>.

But Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, in his notes upon Newmann, says, that Cramer supposes that Hoffman only meant five times instead of 50; but neither the Latin nor the English edition of this author expresses any such thought; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the contrary, he adopts the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; and only adds, that mercury is much more frequently met with than is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> believed; but being so volatile in the fire, it often flies off in the roasting of ores, and escapes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of metallurgists.\n\nAccording to Newmann, the mines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IDRIA\">Idria</a> have produced at the rate of 231,778 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of mercury per annum; but those of Almaden in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> produce much more. The chemists of Dijon inform us, that their annual produce is five or six thousand quintals, or between five and six hundred thousand pounds weight. In the year 1717 there were upwards of 2,500,000 pounds of quicksilver sent from them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, for the amalgamation of the gold and silver ores of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.\n\nAt Guanacavelica in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> the annual produce of the mines, according to Bomare, amounts to one million of pounds, which are carried overland to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMA\">Lima</a>, thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and lastly to Potosi for the same purpose.\n\nBesides these mines there are others in Brazil near Villa Rica, where such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of cinnabar, and native running mercury are found near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> flaves often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> it in good quantities, and sell it for a trifling price to the apothecaries; but none of these mines have ever been worked or taken notice of by the owners. Gold naturally amalgamated with mercury is likewise met with in the neighbourhood of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; and it is said that almost all the gold mines of that country are worked out by simply washing them out with running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, after reducing into powder the hard ores, which are sometimes imbedded in quartzose and rocky matrices.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Deux Ponts and in the Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> the quicksilver flows from a chitofe or stony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATRIX\">matrix</a>, and is probably, says Mr Kirwan, mixed with some other metal, as its globules are not perfectly spherical. The mines of Friuli are all in similar beds or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>. The metal is likewise found visibly diffused through masses of clay or very heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, or blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> kind are the mines of Spain, some of Idria, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>. Malacagni found fluid quicksilver, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as native cinnabar and mineral ethiops, near the lake of Travale in the duchy of Siena; but the quantity was so small as not to be worth the expense of working. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the following mines afford profits to the owners after clearing all expenses, viz. those at Kremnitz in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>; at Horowitz in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>; Zorge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>; Wolfstien, Stahlberg, and Moeschfeld in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALATINATE\">Palatinate</a>. Mercury is also brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies; but the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of what is sold in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> as Japan cinnabar is said to be manufactured in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>.\n\nLemery, Pomel, and others, lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> marks by which those places are distinguished where there are mines of quicksilver, viz. thick vapours like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> arising in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> and May; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> being much larger and greener than in other places; the trees seldom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> or fruit, and putting forth their leaves more slowly than in other places; but, according to Neumann, these marks are far from being certain. They are not met with in all places where there is quicksilver, and are observed in places where there is none. Abundance of these cloudy exhalations are met with in the Hartz forest in Germany, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> mercury has ever been found there; to which we may add, that though vast quantities of mercurial ores are found at Almaden in Spain, none of the above-mentioned indications are there to be met with.\n\nNative mercury was formerly sought from the mines of Idria with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> avidity by the alchemists for the purpose of making gold; and others have showed as ridiculous an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the Hungarian cinnabar, supposing it to be impregnated with gold; nay, we are informed by Neumann, that not only the cinnabar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> of Hungary, but even the vine trees of that country were thought to be impregnated with the precious metal. Not many years ago a French chemist advertised that he had obtained a considerable quantity of gold from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> of vine twigs and stems, as well as of the garden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> where they grew: but the falsehood of these assertions was demonstrated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Lauragais to the satisfaction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe reduction of mercury into a solid state, so that\nQuicksilver it might be employed like silver, was another favourite alchemical pursuit. But all processes and operations of this kind, says Newmann, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they have mercury in them, are no other than hard amalgams. When melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> or tin are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> becoming consiftent after fusion, if a stick be thrust into the metal, and the hole filled with quicksilver, as soon as the whole is cold, the mercury is found solid. Macquer informs us, that mercury becomes easily solid by being exposed to the fumes of lead. Maurice Hoffman, as quoted by Newmann, even gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> for reducing mercury, thus coagulated, to a state of malleability, viz. by repeatedly melting and quenching it in linseed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. Thus, he tells us, we obtain a metal which can be formed into rings and other utensils. But here the mercury is entirely dissipated by the repeated fusions, and nothing but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> lead is left. Valerius, after mentioning strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-leys, or caustic lye, and some other liquors proper for fixing quicksilver, tells us, that by means of a certain gradatory water, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of which he learned from Creuling de Aurea Vellere, he could make a coagulum of mercury whenever he pleased, of such consistency that great part of it would resist cupellation; but what this gradatory water was, he has not thought proper to lay before the public.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUICK_MATCH\">QUICK-<a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">MATCH</a>,** among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a> men, a kind of combustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> formed of three cotton strands drawn into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and dipped in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> composition of white-wine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, and mealed powder. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> it is taken out hot, and laid in a trough where some mealed powder, moistened with spirits of wine, is thoroughly incorporated into the twists of the cotton, by rolling it about therein.

In this state, the soul no longer needs prayers, hymns, &c., being laid, as it were, in the bosom and between the arms of its God, in whom it is in a manner swallowed up.\n\nMolinos, a Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, is the reputed author of *Quietism,* though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILLUMINATI\">Illuminati</a> in Spain had certainly taught something like it before. The sentiments of Molinos were contained in a book which he published at Rome in the year 1681, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the *Spiritual Guide,* for which he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into prison in 1683, and where he publicly renounced the errors of which he was accused. This solemn recantation, however, was followed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>, and he died in prison in the year 1696. Molinos had numerous disciples in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, Spain, France, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>. One of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> patrons and propagators of Quietism in France was Marie Bouvi\u00e8res de la Mothe Guyon, a woman of fashion, remarkable for goodness of heart and regularity of manners; but of an unsettled temper, and subject to be drawn away by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a> of a warm and unbridled fancy. She derived all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> from the feelings of her own heart, and described its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to others as she <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> it herself. Accordingly her religious sentiments made a great noise in the year 1687; and they were declared unfounded, after accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, by several men of eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and learning, and professedly confuted, in the year 1697, by the celebrated Boffuet. Hence arose a controversy of greater moment between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> last mentioned and Fenelon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Cambrai, who seemed disposed to favour the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of Guyon, and who in 1697 published a book containing several of her tenets. Fenelon's book, by means of Boffuet, was condemned in the year 1699, by Innocent XII. and the sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> was read by Fenelon himself at Cambrai, who exhorted the people to respect and obey the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>. Notwithstanding this seeming acquiescence, the archbishop persisted to the end of his days in the sentiments, which, in obedience to the order of the pope, he retracted and condemned in a public manner.\n\nA fact similar to this had appeared at Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHOS\">Athos</a> in Thessaly, near the end of the 14th century, called *Helychaft,* meaning the same with Quietists. They were a branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTICS\">mystics</a>, or those more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONKS\">monks</a>, who, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>, endeavoured to arrive at a tranquillity of mind free from every degree of tumult and perturbation.

To such as inquired what kind of light this was, they replied, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of illustration, that it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of God, the same celestial radiance that surrounded Christ during his transfiguration on the Mount.

After this they begin to leave a small opening, which they increase by degrees; till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, when they are about three weeks old, the mouth of the hole is left wholly open that they may go out; for they are at that time grown big enough to take care of themselves, and to feed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> grass.\n\nPeople who keep rabbits tame for profit, breed them in hutches; but these must be kept very neat and clean, else they will be always subject to diseases. Care must be taken also to keep the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKS\">bucks</a> and does apart till the latter\nRabbit have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> kindled; then they are to be turned to the bucks again, and to remain with them till they run and run from them.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> for the choosing of tame rabbits is, to pick the largest and fairest; but the breeder should remember that the skins of the silver-haired ones sell better than any other. The food of the tame rabbit may be colewort and cabbage-leaves, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARROTS\">carrots</a>, parsnips, apple-rinds, green corn, and vetches, in the time of the year; also vine-leaves, grass, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, oats, and oatmeal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>-thistles, sow-thistles, and the like: but with these moist foods they must always have a proportionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the dry foods, as hay, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, oats, bran, and the like, otherwise they will grow pot-bellied, and die. Bran and grains mixed together have been also found to be very good food. In winter they will eat hay, oats, and chaff, and these may be given them three times a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; but when they eat green things, it must be observed that they are not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> at all, for it would throw them into a droopy. At all other times a very little drink serves their turn, but that must always be fresh. When any green herbs or grass are cut for their food, care must be taken that there be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a> among it; for though they will eat this greedily among other things when offered to them, yet it is sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> to them.\n\nRabbits are subject to two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> infirmities. First, the rot, which is caused by giving them too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a quantity of greens, or from giving them fresh gathered with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> hanging in drops upon them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">Excess</a> of moisture always causes this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. The greens therefore are always to be given dry; and a sufficient quantity of hay, or other dry food, intermixed with them, to take up the abundant moisture of their juices. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> the very best food that can be given them, is the shortest and sweetest hay that can be got, of which one load will serve 200 couples a year; and out of this flock of 200, 200 may be eaten in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, 200 sold in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>, and a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of accidents.\n\nThe other general disease of these creatures is a sort of madness: this may be known by their wallowing and tumbling about with their heels upwards, and hopping in an odd manner into their boxes. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> is supposed to be owing to the rankness of their feeding; and the general cure is the keeping them low, and giving them the prickly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a> called tare thistle to eat.\n\nThe general computation of males and females is, that one buck-rabbit will serve for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> does: some allow 10 to one buck; but those who go beyond this always suffer for it in their breed.\n\nWild rabbits are either to be taken by small cur-dogs, or by spaniels bred up to the sport; and the places of hunting those who straggle from their burrows, is under close hedges or bushes, or among corn-fields and fresh pastures. The owners <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to course them with small greyhounds; and though they are seldom killed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, yet they are driven back to their burrows, and are prevented from being a prey to others. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> is by nets called purse-nets, and ferrets. The ferret is sent into the hole to fetch them out; and the purse-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> being spread over the hole, takes them as they come out. The ferrets' mouths must be muffled, and then the rabbit gets no harm. For the more certain taking of them, it may not be improper to pitch up a hay-net or two, at a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the burrows that are intended to be hunted: thus very few of the number that are attempted will escape.\n\nSome who have no ferrets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> the rabbits out of their holes with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> brimstone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a>. This certainly brings them out into the nets; but then it is a very troublesome and offensive method, and is very detrimental to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, as no rabbit will for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time afterwards come near the burrows which have been fum\u00e8d with such ingredients.\n\nThe following observations on the breeding and management of rabbits and some other animals appear to us to be of such importance, that we shall give them a place in the words of the author.\n\n\"In my travels through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>,\" says the author, \"I have often been surprized that no attempt has been made to introduce, for the purpose of propagation, that useful little animal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARREN\">warren</a> rabbit, of such vast importance to the hat manufactory of England. It is chiefly owing to the fur of this animal that the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a> are so much esteemed abroad. It is a fact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known amongst the hatters, that a hat composed of one half of coney <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, one-sixth old coat beaver, one-sixth pelt beaver, and one-sixth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a> wool, will wear far preferable to one made all of beaver, as it will keep its shape better, feel more firm, and wear bright and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> much longer.\n\n\"The value of the coney wool, the produce of the united <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> only, is not less, I will venture to say, than 250,000l. per annum; but the quantity is much diminished, owing to the banishment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> they meet with on every side, and so many small warrens taken in for grain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which it is time that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> should be afforded, if possible, to that important branch of British manufacture (in which coney wool is used) from suffering any inconvenience in the want of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> an article, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> I conceive perfectly easy.\n\n\"General Observations.\u2014When I speak of the warren rabbit, I have to observe, that there are in England, as well as in most parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, three other kinds, viz. the tame rabbit, of various colours, the fur of which is of little value, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; the shuck rabbit, which has a long shaggy fur of little value; the bult rabbit, like those of America, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> fits as a hare, and the fur of which is of a rotten inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>.\n\n\"To return to the warren rabbit.\u2014There are two sorts in respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, that is, the common gray, and the silver gray, but little or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in respect to the strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELTING\">felting</a> qualities of the fur. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of this animal is to burrow deep in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and there live in families, nor will they suffer one from a neighbouring family to come amongst them without a severe contest, in which the intruders are generally glad to retire with the loss of part of their coat, unless when pursued by an enemy, when they find protection.\n\n\"It is scarcely worth while for me to mention a thing so generally known, viz. that rabbits, particularly those of the warren, are the most prolific of all other four-footed animals in the world; nor do I apprehend any difficulty would attend the exporting this little quadruped with safety to any distance, provided it was...\"\nRabbit was kept dry, and regularly supplied with clean sweet food, and a due regard to the cleanliness of the boxes or places of confinement.\n\n\"Twelve or fifteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of these valuable animals taken to Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANADA\">Canada</a>, and there enclosed within a small space of ground suitable to their nature, but furnished with a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> burrows at the first by way of a nursery, spread over those now useless plains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, and peninsulas, so well calculated to their nature, would, I will make bold to say, the eighth year after their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a>, furnish the British market with a valuable raw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a>, amounting to a large sum, increasing every year with astonishing rapidity, so as to become, in a few years, one amongst the first of national objects.\n\n\"It may be supposed by some, that the above project is magnified beyond possibility, or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>; but the serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> I have paid to the subject, these many years past, as to all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> for and against, leaves no room to accuse myself of being too sanguine; for, if properly managed a few years at the first, I cannot find a single thing likely to interrupt their progress.\n\n\"Some idea of the astonishing increase of the rabbit may be had from the following facts:\n\n- An old doe rabbit will bring forth young nine times in one year, and from four to ten each time; but to allow for casualties, state the number at five each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITTER\">litter</a>.\n\nIn nine months\n\n| The females of the first litter will bring forth five times, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of which is 24 females produce | 62 |\n| Thoef of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> litter four times produce | 50 |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">Ditto</a> of ditto third ditto three ditto ditto | 37 |\n| Ditto of ditto second ditto two ditto ditto | 25 |\n\nTotal in one year from one pair - 219\n\n\"The third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a>, and the second of the first litter, seldom breed the first year, but are early breeders in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> following, when we might expect an increase of the whole in proportion to the first pair, if properly attended to and protected.\n\n\"It is generally allowed, that hares are not more than one-fourth as prolific as rabbits, notwithstanding, agreeable to an experiment tried by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Ribbledeale, who enclosed a pair of hares for one year, the offspring was (as I have been credibly informed) 68: these animals could they be exported to Upper Canada with safety, and there protected within enclosures for a few years, would soon after spread over a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>: the fur is nearly as valuable as that of the rabbit.\n\n\"In that part of Upper Canada within the 45 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a>, and the southern and western boundaries, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is nearly the same as that of England, a little hotter a few days in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, and a little colder a few days in winter, agreeable to Fahrenheit's thermometer, which I have paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> attention to for some years, comparing the same with the observations of the English.\n\n\"The increase of most animals appears much greater in proportion in America than in England, mankind not excepted: that of sheep is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to those that pay attention to their breeding stock, which gives me hopes, that in a few years we shall be able to pay for our woollen cloths in wool. Finding the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and climate so salutary to sheep, &c., it may be reasonably supposed, that rabbits will answer the most sanguine expectations, as I understand the wool of the sheep retains all its nature the same as in England, particularly its strength, and felting qualities among the hatters, which assures me that rabbit wool from those bred in Upper Canada will do the same; and there are some millions of acres within the latitude and boundaries which I have before described, fitted to the nature of the warren rabbit; nor do I apprehend that the wolves, foxes, &c., of Upper Canada will be half so destructive as the poachers in England.\n\n\"The guanaco, or camel sheep of South America, no doubt will be a national object at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. This is a tame, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animal, very hardy, and used with much cruelty by the natives in travelling over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> with their burdens; it bears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">fleece</a> of wool of from 2lb. to 3lb., which is of dusky <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> on the back; on the sides inclined to white, and under the belly quite white; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> is very fine, yet strong; its felting qualities very powerful, and is worth, when ready for use, from five to fifteen shillings per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a>. This animal would no doubt thrive, and do well in England, Upper Canada, and in particular I should suppose in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>.\n\n\"The beaver might be propagated to great advantage in Scotland, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, and northern parts of England. It is an animal, when tamed, very familiar, and will eat bread and milk, willow sticks, elm bark, &c., and no doubt might be imported with safety; but as these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>-mentioned animals are not likely to be attended to immediately, I shall say no more respecting them for the present.\"\n\n*Trans. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RABIRIUS\">RABIRIUS</a>, C. a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> an immense sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> Auletes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>.

He had a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> for the belles lettres, and became one of the first poets of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. He produced his Th\u00e9baide when but very young, and afterward other pieces, which met with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> success, though they appeared when Corneille was in his highest reputation. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>, however, he did not fail to meet with all that opposition which envy and cabal are ever ready to set up against a superior genius. It was partly owing to a chagrin from this circumstance that he took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to quit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> for ever; although his genius was still in full vigour, being not more than 38 years of age.

In the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, he resolved not only to write <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more plays, but to do a rigorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> for those he had written; and he actually formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of becoming a Carthusian friar.

And would he be a minister of state, because he is a great poet?\" These words hurt Racine greatly; he conceived dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the king's displeasure; and his chagrin and fears brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a fever, of which he died the 22d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1699.\n\nThe king, who was sensible of his great merit, and always loved him, sent often to him in his illness; and finding after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> that he had more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, settled a handsome pension upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>.\u2014There is nothing in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> written with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> than his pieces in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a>.

In 1599, private matches between gentlemen, who were their own jockeys and riders, were very common; and in the reign of James I., public races were established at various places, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of preparing the horses for running, &c., were much the same as they are now.

By this circumstance it is distinguished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a>; in the former of which the drops are so small that they are quite invisible; and in the latter, though their size be larger, they seem to have very little more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity than the atmosphere itself, and may therefore be reckoned hollow spherules rather than drops. Some of the more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> facts relative to the phenomena of rain have been already given under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>. We shall here add some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the speculations of philosophers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the same subject, in attempting to account for those phenomena.\n\nIt is universally agreed, that rain is produced by the water previously absorbed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> otherwise, from the terraqueous globe, into the atmosphere; but very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> difficulties occur when we begin to explain why the water, once so closely united with the atmosphere, begins to separate from it. We cannot ascribe this separation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, since rain often takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in very warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; and though we should suppose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> owing to the superior cold of the higher regions, yet there is a remarkable fact which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not allow us to recur to this supposition. It is certain that the drops of rain increase in size considerably as they descend. On the top of a hill, for instance, they will be small and inconsiderable, forming only a drizzling shower; but at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the same hill the drops will be excessively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, descending in an impetuous rain; which shows that the atmosphere is disposed to condense the vapours, and actually does so, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> where it is warm as where it is cold.\n\nFor some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the suppositions concerning the cause of rain were exceedingly insufficient and unsatisfactory. It was imagined, that when various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGERIES\">congeries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> were driven together by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the winds, they mixed, and run into one body, by which means they were condensed into water. The coldness of the upper parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> also was thought to be a great means of collecting and condensing the clouds into water; which, being heavier than the air, must necessarily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> through it in the form of rain. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why it falls in drops, and not in large quantities, was said to be the resistance of the air; whereby being broken, and divided into smaller and smaller parts, it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> arrives to us in small drops. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> is entirely contrary to almost all the phenomena: for the weather, when coldest, that is, in the time of severe frosts, is generally the most serene; the most violent rains also happen where there is little or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> cold to condense the clouds; and the drops of rain, instead of being divided into smaller and smaller ones as they approach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, are plainly increased in size as they descend.\n\nDr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERHAM\">Derham</a> accounted for the precipitation of the drops of rain from the vesiculae being full of air, and meeting with an air colder than they contained, the air they contained was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> contracted into a smaller space; and consequently the watery shell rendered thicker, and thus specifically heavier, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> atmosphere. But it has been shown, that the vesiculae, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> such they are, of vapour, are not filled with air, but with fire, or heat; and consequently, till they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> with this latent heat, the vapour cannot be condensed. Now, cold is not always sufficient to effect this, since in the most severe frosts the air is very often serene, and parts with little or none of its vapour for\nfor a very considerable time. Neither can we admit the winds to have any considerable agency in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, since we find that blowing upon vapour is so far from condensing it, that it unites it more closely with the air, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> is found to be a great promoter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>.\n\nAccording to Rohault, the great cause of rain is the heat of the air; which, after continuing for some time near the earth, is raised on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> by a wind, and there thawing the snowy vili or flocks of half-frozen vesiculae, reduces them to drops; which, coalescing, descend. Here, however, we ought to be informed by what means these vesiculae are suspended in their half-frozen state; since the thawing of them can make but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in their specific gravity, and it is certain that they ascended through the air not in a frozen but in an aqueous state.\n\nDr Clarke and others ascribe this descent of the rain rather to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of the atmosphere than of the vesiculae; and suppose it to arise from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> force of the air. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, which, they say, depends chiefly or wholly upon terrene exhalations, being weakened, the atmosphere sinks under its burden, and the clouds fall. Now, the little vesicles being once upon the descent, will continue therein, notwithstanding the increase of resistance they every moment meet with. For, as they all tend to the centre of the earth, the farther they fall, the more coalitions they will make; and the more coalitions, the more matter will there be under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>; the surface increasing only as the squares, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SOLIDITY\">solidity</a> as the cubes; and the more matter under the same surface, the less resistance will there be to the same matter. Thus, if the cold, wind, &c., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> early enough to precipitate the ascending vesicles before they are arrived at any considerable height, the coalitions being but few, the drops will be proportionably small; and thus is formed a dew. If the vapours be more copious, and rise a little higher, we have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a> or fog. A little higher still, and they produce a small rain; if they neither meet with cold nor wind, they form a heavy thick dark sky. This hypothesis is equally unsatisfactory with the others; for, granting that the descent and condensation of the vapours are owing to a diminution of the atmosphere's elasticity, by what is this diminution occasioned? To lay that it is owing to terrene exhalations, is only solving one difficulty by another; since we are totally unacquainted both with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and operation of these exhalations. Besides, let us suppose the cause to be what it will, if it acts equally and at once upon all the vapour in the air, then all that vapour must be precipitated at once; and thus, instead of gentle showers continuing for a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time, we should have the most violent waterspouts, continuing only for a few minutes, or perhaps seconds, which, instead of refreshing the earth, would drown and lay waste everything before them.\n\nSince philosophers have admitted the electric fluid to such a large share in the operations of nature, almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> phenomena have been accounted for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of that fluid; and rain, among others, has been reckoned an effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>. But this word, unless it is explained, makes us no wiser than we were before; the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> electricity having been explained on principles which could scarce apply in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> to the electricity of nature; and therefore all the solution we can obtain of the natural appearances of which we speak, comes to this, that rain is occasioned by a moderate electrification, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a> and snow by one more violent, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> by the most violent of all; but in what manner this electrification is occasioned, has not yet been explained. The principles of electricity necessary to be attended to in the solution of the phenomena under consideration are the following:\n\n1. The electric fluid and solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> are the same substances in two different modifications.\n\n2. Electricity is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the fluid when running, or attempting to run, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> stream from one place to another; heat is when the fluid has no tendency but to vibrate outwards and inwards to and from a centre; or at least when its streams converge to a point or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>.\n\n3. The fluid acting as electricity, like water, or any other fluid, always tends to the place where there is least resistance.\n\nOn these three principles may the phenomena of atmospherical electricity, and the descent of rain by its means, be explained as follows:\n\n1. The light or heat of the sun, acting in that peculiar manner which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> heat, unites itself with the moisture of the earth, and forms it into vapour, which thus becomes specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than air, and of consequence ascends in the atmosphere to a certain height.\n\n2. Besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of light which is thus united to the water, and forms it into vapour, a very considerable quantity enters the earth, where it affumes the nature of electric fluid.\n\n3. As the earth is always full of that fluid, every quantity which enters must displace an equal quantity which is already there.\n\n4. This quantity which is displaced must escape either at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the place where the other enters, or very near it.\n\n5. At whatever place a quantity of electric matter escapes, it must electrify the air above that place where it has escaped; and as a considerable quantity of light must always be reflected from the earth into the atmosphere, where it does not combine with the aqueous vapour, we have thence another source of electricity to the air; as this quantity must undoubtedly affume the action of electric fluid, especially after the action of the sun has ceased. Hence the reason why in serene weather the atmospherical electricity is always strongest, and rather more so in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\n6. From these considerations, we see an evident reason why there must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> be a difference between the electricity of the earth and that of the atmosphere, excepting when an earthquake is about to ensue. The consequence of this must be, that as the action of the solar light continues to bring down the electric matter, and the earth continues to discharge an equal quantity of it into the atmosphere, some part of the atmosphere must at last become overloaded with it, and attempt to throw it back into the earth. This attempt will be vain, until a vent is found for the electricity at some other place; and as soon as this happens, the electrified atmosphere begins to throw off its superfluous electricity, and the earth to receive it. As the atmosphere itself\nRain is a bad conductor, and the more so the drier it is, the electric matter attacks the small aqueous particles which are detained in it by means of the latent heat. These being unable to bear the impetus of the fluid, throw out their latent heat, which easily escapes, and thus makes a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> in the electrified part of the atmosphere. The consequences of this are, that the aqueous particles being driven together in large quantity, at last become visible, and the sky is covered with clouds; at the same time a wind blows against these clouds, and, if there is no resistance in the atmosphere, will drive them away.\n\n7. But if the atmosphere all round the cloud is exceedingly electrified, and the earth is in no condition to receive the superfluous fluid excepting in that place which is directly under the cloud, then the whole electricity of the atmosphere for a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> round will tend to that part only, and the cloud will be electrified to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> degree. A wind will now blow against the cloud from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, more and more of the vapour will be extricated from the air by the electric matter, and the cloud will become darker and thicker, at the same time that it is in a manner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, as being acted upon by opposite winds; though its size is enlarged with great rapidity by the continual supplies of vapour brought by the winds.\n\n8. The vapours which were formerly suspended invisibly by means of the latent heat are now suspended visibly by the electric fluid, which will not let them fall to the earth, until it is in a condition to receive the electric matter descending with the rain.\u2014It is easy to see, however, that thus every thing is prepared for a violent storm of thunder and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> as well as rain. The surface of the earth becomes electrified from the atmosphere: but when this has continued for some time, a zone of earth considerably below the surface acquires an electricity opposite to that of the clouds and atmosphere; of consequence the electricity in the cloud being violently pressed on all sides, will at last burst out towards that zone where the resistance is least, as explained under the article Lightning.\u2014The vapours now having lost that which supported them, will fall down in rain, if there is not a sufficient quantity of electric matter to keep them in the same state in which they were before: but if this happens to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the cloud will instantly be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> again, while little or no rain will fall; and hence very violent thunder sometimes takes place without any rain at all, or such as is quite inconsiderable in quantity.\n\n9. When the electricity is less violent, the rain will descend in vast quantity, especially after every flash of lightning; and great quantities of electric matter will thus be conveyed to the earth, insomuch that sometimes the drops have been observed to shine as if they were on fire, which has given occasion to the reports of fiery rain having fallen on certain occasions. If the quantity of electric matter is smaller, so that the rain can convey it all gradually to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, there will be rain without any thunder; and the greater the quantity of electricity the more violent will be the rain.\n\nFrom this account of the causes of rain, we may see the reason why in warm climates the rains are excessive, and for the most part accompanied with thunder; for there the electricity of the atmosphere is immensely greater than it is with us. We may also see why in certain places, according to the situation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, seas, &c., the rains will be greater than in others, and likewise why some parts of the world are exempted from rain altogether; but as a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of these would necessarily include an explanation of the causes and phenomena of Thunder, we shall for this reason refer the whole to be treated of under that article.\n\nWhether this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, however, it would be too flattering in us to say. It may admit of dispute, for we must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> that in the very best systems, though an occurrence so frequent, the theory of rain is but very imperfectly understood. Dr Hutton, whose speculations are always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, though generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, and much out of the common way, has given a new theory of rain in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. It is well known that atmospheric air is capable of dissolving, with a certain degree of heat, a given quantity of water. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> ascertains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the dissolving power of air, in relation to water, in different degrees of heat; and shows, that by mixing a portion of transparent humid warm air with a portion of cold air, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> becomes opake, and part of the water will be precipitated; or, in other words, the vapour will be condensed into rain. The ratio which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, however, does not appear to us to be supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. Whether the electricity of the air changes in consequence of its depositing the water dissolved in it, or the change is a cause of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a>, must remain uncertain; but, in either view, there must be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> different from heat and cold, since the changes in these respects do not in other operations change the state of electricity. Dr Hutton supposes that heat and solution do not increase by equal increments; but that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, if heat be supposed to increase by equal increments along a straight line, solution will be expressed by ordinates to a curve whose convex side is turned towards that line. That the power of solution is not increased in the same ratio with heat, is, however, hypothetical, except when we rise pretty high in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>, when its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> increase is a little doubtful; and it is not, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, supported by experiment. The condensation of the breath in air is not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> in point, except in air already saturated with vapour. It can amount, in any view, to no more than this, that to render it visible, the heat must be diminished in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> than can be compensated by the power of solution in the body of air, in which the portion expired is at first immersed. To explain rain from this cause, we must always suppose a constant diminution of heat to take place at the moment of the condensation of the vapour; but we actually find that the change from a state of vapour to the fluid state is attended with heat; so that rain must at once oppose its own cause, and continued rains would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, without calling in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of other causes. From his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, Dr Hutton endeavours to explain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> seasons of rain, either reflecting the generality of its appearance, or the regularity of its return. And to obviate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> exceptions of the theory, from the generality of rain, he explains the proportional quantities of rain, and adds a comparative estimate of climates, in relation to rain, with the meteorological observations made in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>.\nclimate. As his principle is at least insufficient, and we think erroneous, it would be useless, even were this a proper place for it, to pursue these various branches, which must partake of the errors of the system. In these branches we ought to observe, that there are several just observations, mixed with errors, because evaporation and condensation must at last be the great basis of every theory; the mistakes arise from not being aware of all the causes, and misrepresenting the operation of those which do exist.\n\nIn a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Thoughts on Meteorology, vol. ii. M. de Luc considers very particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> phenomenon of rain, and the numerous circumstances connected with it. He examines the several hypotheses with considerable care; but thinks them, even if admissible, utterly insufficient to account for the formation of rain. The grand question in this inquiry is, what becomes of the water that rises in vapour into the atmosphere; or what state it subsists in there, between the time of its evaporation and its falling down again in rain. If it continues in the state of watery vapour, or such as is the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of evaporation, it must possess the distinctive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to that fluid: it must make the hygrometer move towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a>, in proportion as the vapour is more or less abundant in the air: on a diminution of heat, the humidity, as shown by the hygrometer, must increase; and on an increase of the heat the humidity must diminish; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of other hygroscopic substances, drier than the air, must have the same effect as an augmentation of heat. These are the properties of watery vapour, on every hypothesis of evaporation; and therefore all the water that exists in the atmosphere without possessing these properties, is no longer vapour, but must have changed its nature. M. de Luc shows, that the water which forms rain, though it has ever been considered and reasoned upon as producing humidity, does not possess these properties, and must therefore have passed into another state. As he thinks that the vapour passes into an invisible state in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between evaporation and its falling again in rain, and that in that state it is not sensible to the hygrometer, he considers the laws of hydrology as insufficient for explaining the formation of rain; but he does not pretend to have discovered the immediate cause of the formation of clouds and rain. If it is not in the immediate product of evaporation that rain has its source; if the vapours change their nature in the atmosphere, so as no longer to be sensible to the hygrometer, or to the eye; if they do not become vapour again till clouds appear; and if, when the clouds are formed, no alteration is perceived in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the air\u2014we must acknowledge it to be very probable, that the intermediate state of vapour is no other than air\u2014and that the clouds do not proceed from any distinct fluid contained in the atmosphere, but from a decomposition of a part of the air itself, perfectly similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>.\n\nIt appears, to us at least, that M. de Luc's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on this subject agrees better with the phenomena than Dr Hutton's. The Doctor, however, thinks differently, and published answers to the objections of M. de Luc with regard to his theory of rain; to which M. de Luc replied in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> which was printed in the Appendix to the first volume of the Monthly Review: but it would extend our article beyond its due bounds, to give a view of this controversy.\n\nAs to the general quantity of rain that falls, and its proportion in several places at the same time, and in the same place at several times, we have many observations, journals, &c. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the French Academy, the Philosophical Transactions, &c. Upon measuring, then, the rain falling yearly, its depth, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a>, and its proportion in several places, is found as in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>:\n\n| Location          | Year | Depth in Inches |\n|-------------------|------|----------------|\n| Townley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCASHIRE\">Lancashire</a> |      |                |\n| Upminster, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>   | 1700 | 19             |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZURICH\">Zurich</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>| 1701 | 18             |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>        | 1702 | 20             |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, France      | 1703 | 23             |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LILLE\">Lille</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>    | 1704 | 15             |\n|                   | 1705 | 16             |\n\n| Location          | Year | Depth in Inches |\n|-------------------|------|----------------|\n| Paris             |      |                |\n|                   | 1700 | 21             |\n|                   | 1701 | 27             |\n|                   | 1702 | 17             |\n|                   | 1703 | 18             |\n|                   | 1704 | 21             |\n|                   | 1705 | 14             |\n\nFrom the Meteorological Journal of the Royal Society, kept by order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, it appears that the whole quantity of rain at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, in each of the years specified below, was as follows, viz.,\n\n| Year | Depth in Inches |\n|------|----------------|\n| 1774 | 26             |\n| 1775 | 24             |\n| 1776 | 20             |\n| 1777 | 25             |\n| 1778 | 20             |\n| 1779 | 26             |\n| 1780 | 17             |\n\nThe quantity of rain in the four following years at London was\n\n| Year | Depth in Inches |\n|------|----------------|\n| 1789 | 21             |\n| 1790 | 16             |\n| 1791 | 15             |\n| 1792 | 19             |\n\nProportion of the Rain of the several Seasons to one another.\n\n| Season | Depth in Inches |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| Jan.   | 6.41            |\n| Feb.   | 3.28            |\n| Mar.   | 2.65            |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>  | 1.25            |\n| May    | 3.33            |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>   | 4.90            |\n\n| Season | Depth in Inches |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>   | 0.20            |\n| Aug.   | 2.27            |\n| Sept.  | 7.21            |\n| Oct.   | 5.33            |\n| Nov.   | 0.13            |\n| Dec.   | 0.00            |\n\nHalf Year\n\n| Depth in Inches |\n|-----------------|\n| 21              |\n| 8.2             |\n| 10              |\n| 6.7             |\n| 17              |\n| 3.1             |\n\nHalf Year\n\n| Depth in Inches |\n|-----------------|\n| 14              |\n| 9.4             |\n| 8               |\n| 5.7             |\n| 15              |\n| 3.5             |\n\nSee Philosophical Transactions abridged, vol. iv. part ii. p. 81, &c. and also Meteorological Journal of the Royal Society, published annually in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nAs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of rain, we may observe, that it moistens\nRains and softens the earth, and thus fits it for affording nourishment to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>; by falling on high mountains, it carries down with it many particles of loose earth, which serve to fertilize the surrounding valleys, and purifies the air from noxious exhalations, which tend in their return to the earth to meliorate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; it moderates the heat of the air; and is one means of supplying fountains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. However, vehement rains in many countries are found to be attended with barrenness and poorness of the lands, and miscarriage of the crops in the succeeding year; and the reason is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>; for these excessive storms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> away the fine mould into the rivers, which carry it into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> recovers itself again. The remedy to the famine, which some countries are subject to from this sort of mischief, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> large orchards and groves of such trees as bear succulent fruit; for it is an old observation, that in years, when grain succeeds worst, these trees produce most fruit of all. It may partly be owing to the thorough moistening of the earth, as deep as their roots go by these rains, and partly to their trunks stopping part of the light mould carried down by the rains, and by this means furnishing themselves with a coat of new earth.\n\nPreternatural RAINS. We have numerous accounts, in the historians of our own as well as other countries, of preternatural rains; such as the raining of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, of dust, of blood, nay, and of living animals, as young frogs, and the like. We are not to doubt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of what those who are authors of veracity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> relate to us of this kind, so far as to suppose that the falling of stones and dust never happened; the whole mistake is, the supposing them to have fallen from the clouds; but as to the blood and frogs, it is very certain that they never fell at all, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> has been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> deception of the eyes. Men are extremely fond of the marvellous in their relations; but the judicious reader is to examine strictly whatever is reported of this kind, and is not to suffer himself to be deceived.\n\nThere are two natural methods by which quantities of stones and dust may fall in certain places, without their having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the clouds or fallen as rain. The one is by means of hurricanes: the wind which we frequently see tearing off the tiles of houses, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> them to considerable distances, being equally able to take up a quantity of stones, and drop them again at some other place. But the other, which is much the most powerful, and probably the most usual way, is for the eruptions of volcanoes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> mountains to toss up, as they frequently do, a vast quantity of stones, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, and cinders, to an immense height in the air: and these, being hurried away by the hurricanes and impetuous winds which usually accompany these eruptions, and being in themselves much lighter than common stones, as being half calcined, may easily be thus carried to vast distances; and there falling in places where the inhabitants know nothing of the occasion, they cannot but be supposed by the vulgar to fall on them from the clouds. It is well known, that, in the great eruptions of \u00c6tna and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, showers of ashes, dust, and small cinders, have been seen to obscure the air, and overspread the surface of the sea for a great way, and cover the decks of ships; and this at such a distance, as it should appear scarce conceivable that they should have been carried to: and probably, if the accounts of all the showers of these substances mentioned by authors be collected, they will all be found to have fallen within such distances of volcanoes; and if compared as to the time of their falling, will be found to correspond in that also with the eruptions of those mountains. We have known instances of the ashes from Vesuvius having been carried thirty, nay, forty leagues, and peculiar accidents may have carried them yet farther. It is not to be supposed that these showers of stones and dust fall for a continuance in the manner of showers of rain, or that the fragments or pieces are as frequent as drops of water; it is sufficient that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of stones, or a quantity of dust, fall at once on a place, where the inhabitants can have no knowledge of the part from whence they came, and the vulgar will not doubt their dropping from the clouds. Nay, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERNE\">Berne</a> in Switzerland, the inhabitants accounted it a miracle that it rained earth and sulphur upon them at a time that a small volcano terrified them; and even while the wind was so boisterous, and hurricanes so frequent, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> almost every moment the dust, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and little stones torn up from the surface of the earth in whirlwinds, and carried to a considerable height in the air, they never considered that both the sulphur thrown up by the volcano, and the dust, &c., carried from their feet must fall soon after somewhere. It is very certain that in some of the terrible storms of large hail, where the hailstones have been of many inches round, on breaking them there have been found what people have called stones in their middle; but these observers needed only to have waited the dissolving of one of these hailstones, to have seen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> in its centre disintegrate also, it being only formed of the particles of loose earthy matter, which the water, exhaling by the sun's heat, had taken up in extremely small molecules with it; and this only having served to give an opaque hue to the inner part of the congelation, to which the freezing of the water alone gave the apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> of stone.\n\nThe raining of blood has been ever accounted a more terrible sight and a more fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OMEN\">omen</a> than the other preternatural rains already mentioned. It is very certain that nature forms blood nowhere but in the vessels of animals; and therefore showers of it from the clouds are by no means to be credited. Those who suppose that what has been taken for blood has been actually seen falling through the air, have had recourse to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> insects for its origin, and suppose it the eggs or dung of certain butterflies discharged from them as they were high up in the air. But it seems a very wild conjecture, as we know of no butterfly whose excrements or eggs are of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, or whose abode is so high, or their flocks so numerous, as to be the occasion of this.\n\nIt is most probable that these bloody waters were never seen falling; but that people seeing the standing waters blood-coloured, were assured, from their not knowing how it should else happen, that it had rained blood into them. A very memorable instance of this took place at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a> in the year 1670. Swammerdam, who relates it, tells us, that one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> was in an uproar on finding their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and ditches full of blood, as they thought; and having been certainly full of water the night before, they agreed it must have rained blood in the night: but a certain physician\nfician went down to one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, and taking home a quantity of this blood-coloured water, he examined it by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, and found that the water was water full, and had not at all changed its colour; but that it was full of prodigious swarms of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> animals, all alive, and very nimble in their motions, whose colour and prodigious number gave a red tinge to the whole body of the water they lived in, on a less accurate inspection. The certainty that this was the case, did not however persuade the Hollanders to part with the miracle: they prudently concluded, that the sudden appearance of such a number of animals was as great a prodigy as the raining of blood would have been; and are assured to this day, that this portent foretold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV, afterwards brought into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, which had before enjoyed 40 years of uninterrupted peace.\n\nThe animals which thus colour the water of lakes and ponds are the pulices arborecentes of Swammerdam, or the water-fleas with branched horns. These creatures are of a reddish-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> colour: they live about the sides of ditches, under weeds, and among the mud; and are therefore the least visible, except at a certain time, which is in the end or beginning of June: it is at this time that these little animals leave their recesses to float loose about the water, to meet for the propagation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and by that means become invisible in the colour they give the water. This is visible, more or less, in one part or other of almost all standing waters at this season; and it is always at this season that the bloody waters have alarmed the ignorant.\n\nThe raining of frogs is a thing not least wonderful in the accounts of authors who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> the marvellous, than those of blood or stones; and this is supposed to happen so often, that there are multitudes who pretend to have been eye-witnesses of it. These rains of frogs always happen after very dry seasons, and are much more frequent in the hotter countries than in the cold ones. In Italy they are very frequent; and it is not uncommon to see the streets of Rome swarming both with young frogs and toads in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> in a shower of rain; they hopping everywhere between the people's legs as they walk, though there was not the least appearance of them before. Nay, they have been seen to fall through the air down upon the pavements. This seems a strong circumstance in favour of their being rained down from the clouds; but, when strictly examined, it comes to nothing: for these frogs that are seen to fall, are always found dead, lamed, or bruised by the fall, and never hop about as the rest; and they are never seen to fall, except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> under the walls of houses, from the roofs and gutters of which they have accidentally flipped down. Some people, who love to add to strange things yet stranger, affirm that they have had the young frogs fall into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a> in the midst of an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>; but this is idle, and wholly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>.\n\nOthers, who cannot agree to their falling from the clouds, have tried to solve the difficulty of their sudden appearance, by supposing them hatched out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, or spawn, by these rains. Nay, some have supposed them made immediately out of the dust; but there are unanswerable arguments against all these suppositions. Equivocal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> production of animals out of dust, is now wholly exploded. The fall from the clouds must destroy and kill these tender and soft-bodied animals; and they cannot be at this time hatched immediately out of eggs; because the young frog does not make its appearance from the egg in form, but has its hinder legs enveloped in a skin, and is what we call a tadpole; and the young frogs are at least 100 times larger at the time of their appearance, than the egg from which they should be hatched.\n\nIt is beyond a doubt, that the frogs which make their appearance at this time, were hatched and in being long before; but that the dry seasons had injured them, and kept them sluggishly in holes or coverts; and that all the rain does, is the enlivening them, giving them new spirits, and calling them forth to seek new habitations, and enjoy the element they were destined in great part to live in. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>, the greatest of all the naturalists of antiquity, has affirmed the same thing. We find that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of supposing these creatures to fall from the clouds was as early as that author's time; and also that the truth, in regard to their appearance, was as early known; though, in the ages since, authors have taken care to conceal the truth, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> down to us the error. We find this venerable sage, in a fragment of his on the generation of animals which appear on a sudden, bantering the opinion, and afflicting that they were hatched and living long before. The world owes, however, to the accurate Signor Redi the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this truth, which Theophrastus only has affirmed: for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, dissecting some of these new-appearing frogs, found in their stomachs herbs and other half-digested food; and, openly showing this to his credulous countrymen, asked them whether they thought that nature, which engendered, according to their opinion, these animals in the clouds, had also been so provident as to engender grubs there for their food and nourishment?\n\nTo the raining of frogs we ought to add the raining of grasshoppers and locusts, which have sometimes appeared in prodigious numbers, and devoured the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the earth. There has not been the least pretence for the supposing that these animals descended from the clouds, but that they appeared on a sudden in prodigious numbers. The naturalist, who knows the many accidents attending the eggs of these and other like animals, cannot but know that some seasons will prove particularly favourable to the hatching them, and the prodigious number of eggs that many insects lay could not but every year bring us such abundance of the young, were they not liable to many accidents, and had not provident nature taken care, as in many plants, to continue the species by a very numerous stock of seeds, of which perhaps not one in 500 need take root in order to continue an equal number of plants. As it is thus also in regard to insects, it cannot but happen, that if a favourable season encourage the hatching of all those eggs, a very small number of which alone was necessary to continue the species, we must, in such seasons, have a proportionate abundance of them. There appeared about 50 years ago, in London, such a prodigious swarm of the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEETLE\">beetle</a> called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>-cow, that the very posts in the streets were everywhere covered with them. But thanks to the progress of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> among us, we had nobody to assert that it rained cow-ladies, but contented ourselves with saying that it had been a favourable season for their eggs. The prodigious number of a fort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRUB\">grub</a> which did vast mischief about the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>\nperiod among the corn and grass by eating off their roots, might also have been supposed to proceed from its having rained grubs by people fond of making every thing a prodigy; but our knowledge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> assured us, that these were only the hexapode <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> of the common hedge-beetle called the cockchafer.\n\nThe raining of fish has been a prodigy also much talked of in France, where the streets of a town at some distance from Paris, after a terrible hurricane in the night, which tore up trees, blew down houses, &c. were found in a manner covered with fishes of various sizes. Nobody here made any doubt of these having fallen from the clouds; nor did the absurdity of fish, of five or six inches long, being generated in the air, at all startle the people, or shake their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in the miracle, till they found, upon inquiry, that a very well stocked fish-pond, which stood on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> in the neighbourhood, had been blown dry by the hurricane, and only the great fish left at the bottom of it, all the smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRY\">fry</a> having been tossed into their streets.\n\nUpon the whole, all the supposed marvellous rains have been owing to substances naturally produced on the earth, and either never having been in the air at all, or only carried thither by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>.\n\nIn Silexia, after a great dearth of wheat in that country, there happened a violent storm of wind and rain, and the earth was afterwards covered, in many places, with small round seeds. The vulgar cried out that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> had sent them food, and that it had rained millet; but these were, in reality, only the seeds of a species of veronica, or speedwell, very common in that country; and whose seeds being just ripe at that time, the wind had dislodged them from their capsules, and scattered them about. In our own country, we have histories of rains of this marvellous kind, but all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a>. It was once said to rain wheat in Wiltsire; and the people were all alarmed at it as a miracle, till Mr Cole showed them, that what they took for wheat was only the seeds or kernels of the berries of ivy, which being then fully ripe, the wind had dislodged from the sides of houses, and trunks of trees, on which the ivy that produced them crept.\n\nAnd we even once had a raining of fishes near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a> in a terrible hurricane, with thunder and lightning. The people who saw small sprats strewed all about afterwards, would have it that they had fallen from the clouds; but those who considered how far the high winds have been known to carry the sea-water, did not wonder that they should be able to carry small fish with it so small a part of the way.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1782 we have the following account of a preternatural kind of rain by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> de Gioeni: \"The morning of the 24th instant there appeared here a most singular phenomenon. Every place exposed to the air was found wet with a coloured cretaceous gray water, which, after evaporating and diluting away, left every place covered with it to the height of two or three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>; and all the ironwork that was touched by it became rusty.\n\n\"The public, inclined to the marvellous, fancied various causes of this rain, and began to fear for the animals and vegetables.\n\n\"In places where rain-water was used, they abstained from it; some suspecting vitriolic principles to be mixed with it, and others predicting some epidemical disorder.\n\n\"Those who had observed the explosions of Etna 20 days and more before, were inclined to believe it originated from one of them.\n\n\"The shower extended from N. \u00bc N. E. to S. \u00bc S. W. over the fields, about 70 miles in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of Etna.\n\n\"There is nothing new in volcanoes having thrown up sand, and also stones, by the violent expansive force generated within them, which sand has been carried by the wind to distant regions.\n\n\"But the colour and subtlety of the matter occasioned doubts concerning its origin; which increased from the remarkable circumstance of the water in which it came incorporated; for which reasons some other principle or origin was suspected.\n\n\"It became, therefore, necessary by all means to ascertain the nature of this matter, in order to be convinced of its origin, and of the effects it might produce. This could not be done without the help of a chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>. To do this then with certainty, I endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> this rain from places where it was most probable no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> matter would be mixed with it. I therefore chose the plant called brassica capitata, which having large and turned-up leaves, they contained enough of this coloured water: many of these I emptied into a vessel, and left the contents to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> till the water became clear.\n\n\"This being separated into another vessel, I tried it with vegetable alkaline liquors and mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>; but could observe no decomposition by either. I then evaporated the water in order to reunite the substances that might be in solution; and touching it again with the aforeaid liquors, it showed a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a> with the acids. When tried with the syrup of violets, this became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> green; so that I was persuaded it contained a calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>. With the decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLS\">galls</a> no precipitation was produced.\n\n\"The matter being afterwards dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, it appeared a very subtle fine earth, of a cretaceous colour, but inert, from having been diluted by the rain.\n\n\"I next thought of calcining it with a slow fire, and it assumed the colour of a brick. A portion of this being put into a crucible, I applied to it a stronger heat; by which it lost almost all its acquired colour. Again, I exposed a portion of this for a longer time to a very violent heat (from which a vitrification might be expected); it remained, however, quite soft, and was easily bruised, but returned to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> dusty colour.\n\n\"From the most accurate observations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> from the three calcinations, I could not discover either colour or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> that indicated any arsenical or sulphureous mixture.\n\n\"Having therefore calcined this matter in three portions, with three different degrees of fire, I presented a good magnet to each: it did not act either on the first or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>; a slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> was visible in many places on the third: this persuaded me, that this earth contains a martial principle in a metallic form, and not in a vitriolic substance.\n\n\"The nature of these substances then being discovered, their volcanic origin appears; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, the more it\nis exposed to violent calcination, the more it is divided by the laws of its phlogistic principle; which cannot naturally happen but in the great chimney of a volcano. Calcaceous salt, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> salt combined with a calcareous substance by means of violent heat, cannot be otherwise composed than in a volcano.\n\n\"As to their dreaded effects on animals and vegetables, every one knows the advantageous use, in medicine, both of the one and the other, and this in the same form as they are thus prepared in the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a> of nature.\n\n\"Vegetables, even in flower, do not appear in the least macerated, which has formerly happened from only showers of sand.\n\n\"How this volcanic production came to be mixed with water may be conceived in various ways.\n\n\"Aetna, about its middle regions, is generally surrounded with clouds that do not always rise above its summit, which is 2900 paces above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea. This matter being thrown out, and descending upon the clouds below it, may happen to mix and fall in rain with them in the usual way. It may also be conjectured, that the thick smoke which the volcanic matter contained might, by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>, be carried in the atmosphere by the winds over that tract of country; and then cooling so as to condense and become specifically heavier than the air, might descend in that coloured rain.\n\n\"I must, however, leave to philosophers (to whom the knowledge of natural agents belongs) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> and explanation of such phenomena, confining myself to observation and chemical experiments.\"\n\nRain, a well built and fortified town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>, one of the keys of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTORATE\">electorate</a>, on the Lech, 20 miles west of Ingolstadt.

Mr Sturges.\n\n\"On the evening of the 9th of July 1792, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> and eight o'clock, at Alverstoke, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPORT\">Gosport</a>, on the sea-coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, there came up, in the south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, a cloud with a thunder shower; while the sun shone bright, low in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west.\n\n\"In this shower two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> rainbows appeared, A.B and A.C, not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCENTRIC\">concentric</a>, but touching each other at A, in the south part of the horizon; with a secondary bow to each, D.E. and D.F (the last very faint, but discernible), which touched likewise at D. Both the primary were very vivid for a considerable time, and at different times nearly equally so; but the bow A.B was most permanent, was a larger segment of a circle, and at last, after the other had vanished, became almost a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>; the sun being near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a>. It was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a>, and the sea was as smooth as glass.\n\n\"If I might venture to offer a solution of this appearance, it would be as follows: I consider the bow A.B as the true one, produced by the sun itself; and the other, A.C, as produced by the reflection of the sun from the sea, which, in its perfectly smooth state, acted as a speculum. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the sea, between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Wight and the land, was to the north-west in a line with the sun, as it was then situated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> reflected from the water, having its rays issuing from a rainbow point lower than the real sun, and in a line coming from beneath the horizon, would consequently form a bow higher than the true one A.B. And the shores, by which that narrow part of the sea is bounded, would before the sun's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> setting intercept its rays from the surface of the water, and cause the bow A.C, which I suppose to be produced by the reflection, to disappear before the other.\"\n\nThe marine or sea bow is a phenomenon which may be frequently observed in a much agitated sea, and is occasioned by the wind sweeping part of the waves, and carrying them aloft; which when they fall down are refracted by the sun's rays, which paint the colours of the bow just as in a common shower. These bows are often seen when a vessel is sailing with considerable force, and dashing the waves around her, which are raised partly by the action of the ship and partly by the force of the wind, and, falling down, they form a rainbow; and they are also often occasioned by the dashing of the waves against the rocks on shore.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions, it is observed by F. Bourzes, that the colours of the marine rainbow are less lively, less distinct, and of shorter continuance, than those of the common bow; that there are scarcely above two colours distinguishable, a dark yellow on the side next the sun, and a pale green on the opposite side. But they are more numerous, there being sometimes 20 or 30 seen together.\n\nTo this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of bows may be referred a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> or colourless rainbows, which Mentzelius and others affirm to have been seen at noon-day. M. Marlotte, in his fourth Essai de Physique, says, these bows are formed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, as the others are in showers; and adds, that he has seen several both after sunrise and in the night. The want of colours he attributes to the smallness of the vapours which compose the mist; but perhaps it is rather from the exceeding tenuity of the little vesicles of the vapour, which being only little watery pellicles bloated with air, the rays of light undergo but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFRACTION\">refraction</a> in passing out of air into them; too little to separate the differently coloured rays, &c. Hence the rays are reflected from them, compounded as they came, that is, white. Rohault mentions * coloured rainbows on * Trait\u00e9 de la grise; formed by the refractions of the sun's rays in Physique, the morning dew. Rainbows have been also produced by the reflection of the sun from a river; and in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. i. p. 294, we have an account of a rainbow, which must have been formed by the exhalations from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of London, when the sun had been set 20 minutes, and consequently the centre of the bow was above the horizon. The colours were the same as in the common rainbow, but fainter.\n\nIt has often been made a subject of inquiry among the curious how there came to be no rainbow before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, which is thought by some to have been the case from its being made a sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a> which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> was pleased to make with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> after that event. Mr Whitehurst, in his Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the Earth, p. 173, &c. endeavours to establish it as a matter of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> at least, that the antediluvian atmosphere was so uniformly temperate as never to be subject to storms, tempests, or rain, and of course it could never exhibit a rainbow. For our own part, we cannot see how the earth at that period could\nRainbow. do without rain any more than at present; and it appears to us from Scripture equally probable that the rainbow was seen before the flood as after it. It was then, however, made a token of a certain covenant; and it would unquestionably do equally well for that purpose if it had existed before as if it had not.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">Lunar</a> Rainbow. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> sometimes also exhibits the phenomenon of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRIS\">iris</a> or rainbow by the refraction of her rays in drops of rain in the night time. This phenomenon is very rare. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1783, however, we have an account of three seen in one year, and all in the same place, communicated in two letters by Marmaduke Tunstall, Esq. The first was seen 27th February 1782, at Greta <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, between seven and eight at night, and appeared \"in tolerably distinct colours, similar to a solar one, but more faint: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> colour seemed to predominate. It happened at full moon; at which time alone they are said to have been always seen. Though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> is said to have observed two, and some others have been seen by Snellius, &c. I can only find two described with any accuracy; viz. one by Plot, in his History of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, seen by him in 1675, though without colours; the other seen by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a> gentleman at Glapwell, near Chesterfield, described by Thoreby, and inserted in No. 331. of the Philosophical Transactions: this was about Christmas, 1710, and said to have had all the colours of the Iris Solaris. The night was windy; and though there was then a drizzling rain and dark cloud, in which the rainbow was reflected, it proved afterwards a light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>.\"\n\nTwo others were afterwards seen by Mr Tunstall; one on July the 30th, about 11 o'clock, which lasted about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, without colours. The other, which appeared on Friday <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 18, was \"perhaps the most extraordinary one of the kind ever seen. It was first visible about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> o'clock, and continued, though with very different degrees of brilliancy, till past two. At first, though a strongly marked bow, it was without colours; but afterwards they were very conspicuous and vivid in the same form as in the solar, though fainter; the red, green, and purple, were most distinguishing. About twelve it was the most splendid in appearance; its arc was considerably a smaller segment of a circle than a solar; its south-east limb first began to fail, and a considerable time before its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> extinction: the wind was very high, nearly due west, most part of the time, accompanied with a drizzling rain. It is a singular circumstance, that three of these phenomena should have been seen in so short a time in one place, as they have been esteemed ever since the time of Aristotle, who is said to have been the first observer of them, and saw only two in 50 years, and since by Plot and Thoreby, almost the only two English authors who have spoke of them, to be exceeding rare. They seem evidently to be occasioned by a refraction in a cloud or turbid atmosphere, and in general are indications of stormy and rainy weather: so bad a season as the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> having, I believe, seldom occurred in England. Thoreby, indeed, says, the one he observed was succeeded by several days of fine serene weather. One particular, rather singular, in the second, viz. of July the 30th, was its being five days after the full of the moon; and the last, though of so long a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, was three days before the full: that of the 27th of February was exactly at the full, which used to be judged the only time they could be seen, though in the Encyclopedia there is an account that Weidler observed one in 1719, in the first quarter of the moon, with faint colours, and in very calm weather. No lunar iris, I ever heard or read of, lasted near so long as that on the 18th instant, either with or without colours.\"\n\nIn the Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> for August 1788 we have an account of a lunar rainbow by a correspondent who saw it. \"On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> evening the 17th of August (says he), after two days, on both of which, particularly the former, there had been a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of rain, together with lightning and thunder, just as the clocks were striking nine, 23 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> after full moon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through my window, I was struck with the appearance of something in the sky, which seemed like a rainbow. Having never seen a rainbow by night, I thought it a very extraordinary phenomenon, and hastened to a place where there were no buildings to obstruct my view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>: here I found that the phenomenon was no other than a lunar rainbow; the moon was truly 'walking in brightness,' brilliant as she could be; not a cloud was to be seen near her; and over against her, toward the north-west, or perhaps rather more to the north, was a rainbow, a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>, perfect in all its parts, not interrupted or broken as rainbows frequently are, but unremittingly visible from one horizon to the other. In order to give some idea of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, it is necessary to say, that as I stood toward the western extremity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Stoke Newington, it seemed to take its rise from the west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMPSTEAD\">Hampstead</a>, and to end, perhaps, in the river Lea, the eastern boundary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOTTENHAM\">Tottenham</a>; its colour was white, cloudy, or greyish, but a part of its western leg seemed to exhibit tints of a faint sickly green. I continued viewing it for some time, till it began to rain; and at length the rain increasing, and the sky growing more hazy, I returned home about a quarter or 20 minutes past nine, and in ten minutes came out again; but by that time all was over, the moon was darkened by clouds, and the rainbow of course vanished.\"\n\nMarine Rainbow, or Sea-bow.

The difference between raisins dried in the sun and those dried in ovens, is very obvious: the former are sweet and pleasant, but the latter have a latent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDITY\">acidity</a> with the sweetness that renders them much less agreeable.\n\nThe common way of drying grapes for raisins, is to tie two or three bunches of them together while yet on the vine, and dip them into a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIXIVIUM\">lixivium</a> of woodashes, with a little of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of olives in it. This dries them to shrink and wrinkle; and after this they are left on the vine three or four days separated on sticks in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> situation, and then dried in the sun at leisure, after being cut from the tree.

He was a handsome <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and remarkable for his gentility of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>.\n\nThe queen admitted him to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and employed him first as an attendant on the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> Simier on his return home, and afterwards to escort the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Anjou to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>. During this excursion he became personally known to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>; from whom, at his return, he brought special acknowledgments to the queen, who now frequently conversed with him. But the inactive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of a courtier did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of Mr. Raleigh. In the year 1583, he embarked with his brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> expedition to Newfoundland, in a ship called the Raleigh, which he built at his own expense; but was obliged to return on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of an infectious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>. He was, however, so little affected by this disappointment, that he now laid before the queen and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> a proposal for exploring the continent of North America; and in 1584 obtained a patent empowering him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> such countries as he should discover in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the globe. Accordingly Mr. Raleigh fitted out two ships at his own expense, which sailed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, and returned to England about the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, reporting that they had discovered and taken possession of a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> called Windangooca, to which the queen gave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. About this time he was elected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of the shire for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Devon, and soon after received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>; and to enable him to carry on his designs abroad, the queen granted him a patent for licensing the vendors of wine throughout the kingdom. In 1585 he sent a fleet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> ships to Virginia, commanded by his relation Sir Richard Greenville, who left a colony at Roanah of 107 persons, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Mr. Lane; and by the establishment of this colony he first imported <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> into England. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOTIANA\">NICOTIANA</a>. In the same year Sir Walter Raleigh obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of 12,000 acres of the forfeited lands in the county of Corke in Ireland.\u2014About the same time he was made seneschal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Cornwall, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDEN\">warden</a> of the flanneries; and grew into such favour with the queen, that even Leiceller was jealous of his influence.\n\nIn 1587, he sent another colony of 150 men to Virginia, with a governor, Mr. John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a>, and 12 assistants. About this time we find our knight distinguished by the titles of Captain of the queen's guards, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> of Cornwall. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> to the year 1594, he was continually engaged in projecting new expeditions, sending succours to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> abroad, defending the kingdom from the insults of the Spaniards, and transacting parliamentary business, with equal ability and resolution. Whilst thus employed, he was publicly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBEL\">libel</a> written by the infamous Jesuit Parsons, with being an Atheist; a groundless and ridiculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPUTATION\">imputation</a>. In 1594, he obtained from the queen a grant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANOR\">manor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHERBORNE\">Sherborne</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DORSETSHIRE\">Dorsetshire</a>, where he built a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>: but Sir Walter fell under the queen's displeasure on account of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTRIGUE\">intrigue</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, one of the maids of honour; however, he married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, and lived with her in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> conjugal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>.\nRALPH. During his disgrace at court, he projected the conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUIANA\">Guiana</a> in South America, and in 1595 failed for that country; of which having taken possession, after defeating the Spaniards who were settled there, he returned to England the same year, and soon after published an account of his expedition. In the following year he was one of the admirals in the successful expedition against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>, under the command of Howard and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a>; and in 1597 he failed with the same commanders against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AZORES\">Azores</a>. Soon after these expeditions, we find him assiduously engaged in parliamentary business, and a distinguished performer in jousts and tournaments. In 1600 he was sent on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> embassy with Lord Cobham to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, and at his return made governor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERSEY\">Jersey</a>.\n\nQueen Elizabeth died in the beginning of the year 1603; and with her Raleigh's glory and felicity sunk, never to rise again. Upon the accession of James, Sir Walter lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> at court, was stripped of his preferments, and accused of a plot against the king. He was arraigned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>, and, on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, inflicted with the most shocking brutality by the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">attorney-general</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> vociferation influenced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICT\">convict</a> him without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of guilt. After a month's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>, however, in daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of his execution, he was reprieved, and sent to the Tower; and his estates were given to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-CAR\">Car</a>, earl of Somerset, the king's favourite. During this confinement, he wrote many of his most valuable pieces, particularly his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the World. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, 1615, after 16 years imprisonment, he obtained his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, and immediately began to prepare for another voyage to Guiana. In August 1616, the king granted him a very ample commission for that purpose; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> the year following, he sailed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLYMOUTH\">Plymouth</a>; but, strange as it may appear, it is most certain that the whole scheme was revealed to the Spaniards by the king himself, and thus necessarily rendered abortive.\n\nHe returned to England in 1618, where he was soon after seized, imprisoned, and beheaded; not for any pretended misdemeanor on the late expedition, but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his former attainder. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is, he was sacrificed by the pusillanimous monarch to appease the Spaniards; who, whilst Raleigh lived, thought every part of their dominions in danger. He was executed in Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">Palace</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-YARD\">Yard</a>, and buried in St Margaret's adjoining, in the 66th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. His behaviour on the scaffold was manly, unaffected, cheerful, and easy. Being asked by the executioner which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> he would lay his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, he answered, \"So the heart be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> matter which way the head lies.\" He was a man of admirable parts, extensive knowledge, undaunted resolution, and strict honour and honesty.

The front between the village of Ramillies and Autr'Eglise was covered by a small stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which rendered the meadows in some places marshes, and also by several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> covered with hedges; which difficulties prevented our cavalry of the right wing from coming to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. As fast as the army of the allies arrived it was ranged in order of battle; with the left towards Bonnef, and the right towards Folz, and every thing was disposed in order to attack. To this end, four battalions were detached to attack the village of Franquenies, and 12 battalions to attack the village of Ramillies, which were to be supported by the whole infantry.\n\nOur artillery began to cannonade the enemy at one; at about two, the attack began with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> of Franquenies, where our infantry had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to drive the enemy from the hedges, where they were advantageously posted, and at the same time all the cavalry of our left wing advanced to attack that of our enemy's right; soon after all was in action. Whilst the cavalry were engaged, the village of Ramillies was likewise attacked, and forced after a vigorous resistance.\n\nThe battle lasted about two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, and was pretty obstinate; but so soon as our cavalry had gained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> enough to attack the enemy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANK\">flank</a>, they began to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; at the same time all their infantry were put in disorder, so that the whole retreated, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>. The cavalry of their left wing formed a little upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> ground, between Offuz and Mount St Andrew, to favour their retreat; but after the infantry and cavalry of our right wing had filed off between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the village of Ramillies and Offuz, the whole army marched in several columns to attack the enemy anew; but they gave way before we could come up with them, and retired in great confusion, some towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFILE\">defile</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> De la Ram\u00e9e and towards Dongelberge, others towards Judogne, and others again towards Hougaarda. They were pursued all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> to clothe that they were obliged to abandon all their artillery and baggage, part of which was found at Judogne and at Hougaarda, with their chests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMUNITION\">ammunition</a>.\n\nThe enemy lost above 30,000 men, 60 cannon, eight mortars, standards, colours, baggage, &c.; we about 3000. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> was spent in the sieges of Oltend, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MENIN\">Menin</a>, and Aeth. In fourteen days the duke defeated and dispersed the best appointed army the French ever had, and recovered all Spanish Brabant, the marquisate of the holy Roman empire. The army of the enemy consisted of 76 battalions and 142 squadrons, including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> troops (La Maison du Roi); and the army of the allies was 74 battalions and 123 squadrons. Considering the importance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, the loss of the allies was very small, not above 1100 being killed, and 2600 wounded.","sp":274,"ep":274},{"h":"RAMISSERAM","t":"a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> about 20 miles from that of Manar, and the nearest channel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between Ceylon and the continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>.

He remained at Leadhills till he reached his fifteenth year; and as we have been assured by the relations of some very old persons who were the contemporaries of Ramsay, and who died not many years ago, he was employed in washing, preparing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> ore for smelting, and other operations about the works in which the children of miners and young persons are usually occupied. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of his residence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> his native spot is fixed by himself in the following descriptive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> which are part of a petition addressed to a Club in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> to be admitted a member.\n\nOf Crawford Moor, born in Leadhill,\nWhere mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> Glengoner fill,\nWhich joins sweet-flowing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a>.\n\nNative of Clydesdale's upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a>,\nBred fifteen summers there.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of Ramsay's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, it may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> be presumed, did not exceed what he could derive from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> schoolmaster; and even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of what little could thus be obtained, from the circumstances that attended his early life, must have been often and greatly interrupted.\n\nIn 1701, when he was in his 15th year, he was bound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> to a wigmaker in Edinburgh, and it appears from the record of his children's birth in the parish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> that he continued in the same humble profession till the year 1716: for in that register his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGNATION\">designation</a> is wigmaker. One of the earliest of Ramsay's productions now known, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to the most happy members of the Eayl Club, appeared in 1712, when he was 26 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and three years after he was humorously appointed their poet laureat. Many of his poems about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> were published in the form of separate pamphlets. When he had followed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of a wigmaker for a considerable time, he at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> abandoned it for that of a bookbinder, as being more congenial to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> turn of his mind. His detached pamphlets were afterwards published by him in the year 1721, in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> 4to, which was encouraged by a very liberal subscription. It was advertised as follows in the Edinburgh Evening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURANT\">Courant</a>. \"The Poems of Allan Ramsay, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quarto volume; fairly printed, with notes, and a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLOSSARY\">glossary</a>, (as promised to the subscribers) being now finished; all who have generously contributed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> for their copies as soon as they please, from the author, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>, opposite to Niddry's wynd, Edinburgh.\" The first volume of his well-known collection, \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">Tea</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> Miscellany,\" was published in 1724, after which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volume soon made its appearance; a third in 1727, and a fourth after another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of time. He soon after published what is called the Evergreen, being a collection of Scots poems written by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the year 1600. In 1725 appeared his Gentle Shepherd, part of which, called Patie and Roger, was printed in 1721, and Jenny and Meggy in 1723, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> success of\nof which induced him to form them afterwards into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAMA\">drama</a>.\n\nIn the year 1728, he published a second volume of his poems, which was afterwards reprinted in 8vo. These performances so rapidly enlarged the circle of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> and reputation, that in 1731, an edition of his poetical works was published by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOOKSELLERS\">booksellers</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and two years after they appeared at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>. He held an extensive correspondence with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> poets, among whom we find the facetious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> of Gilbertfield, and the celebrated author of the Chace sent him two epistles. From his shop opposite to Niddry street, he removed to one at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> end of the Luckenbooths. In this shop he continued to sell and lend out books till he was far advanced in years; and we are informed that he was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who established a circulating library in Scotland. His collection of Fables appeared in 1730, after which period he may be said to have almost discontinued the occupation of an author.\n\nSuch, however, was his enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, that he built at his own expense, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> for dramatical performances ever known in Edinburgh, which took place in what is called Carubber's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, in the year 1736; but he did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enjoy his character of manager, for the magistrates of Edinburgh required him to shut it up, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> prohibited all such amusements without a special licence and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>'s letters patent. It is generally understood that he relinquished the trade of a bookseller about the year 1755, being then 69 years of age, and lived the remainder of his days in a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> erected by himself on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> side of the Castle-hill. A florid complaint attended with excruciating pain, deprived him of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and after corroding one of his jaw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>, put a period to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> on the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1758, in the 71st year of his age.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMSEY\">Ramsey</a> possessed a considerable share of poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>: Of this his Gentle Shepherd, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> continue to be admired as long as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> in which it is written shall be understood, and especially by the natives of North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, to whom only the peculiarities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a> by which it is distinguished can be familiar, affords the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>. Some of his songs may contain far-fetched allusions and childish conceits; but many of them are equal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not superior for their pastoral simplicity, to productions of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in any other language. Some of the imitations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> by this poet are extremely happy, in particular Horace's Ode Vide ut alia fiet nive &c.; and some of his tales have all the excellencies of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>. But of a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of his other productions, it may be pronounced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> that they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> profane compositions filled with the most commonplace observations, and destitute even of the ornament of smooth versification and correct rhimes.\n\nRamsay, Andrew Michael, generally known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEVALIER\">Chevalier</a> Ramsey, was a polite Scots writer, born of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AYR\">Ayr</a> in 1686. His good parts and learning recommended him to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to the son of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Wemyss; after which, conceiving a disgust at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> in which he had been educated, he in the same ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> reviewed other Christian churches; and, finding none to his liking, retired for a while in Deism. While he was in this uncertain state of mind, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>; where, falling into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of one Poiret a mystic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>, he received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> of mysticism: which prompted him to consult M. Fenelon, the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Cambrai, who had imbibed principles of the same nature; and who gained him over to the Catholic religion in 1709. The subsequent course of his life received its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> from his friendship and connections with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a>; and being appointed governor to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> de Chateau Thierry, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> de Turenne, he was made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of the order of St Lazarus. He was sent for to Rome by the chevalier de St George, to undertake the education of his children; but he found so many intrigues and dissensions on his arrival there in 1724, that he obtained the chevalier's leave to return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. He died in 1743, in the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENDANT\">intendant</a> to the duke of Bouillon, prince de Turenne. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> is the Travels of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a>, which has been several times printed in English.\n\nRamsay, The Reverend James, so justly celebrated for his philanthropy, was born on the 25th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1733, at Fraserburgh, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Aberdeen, North Britain. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>, being, through his father, from the Ramsays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELROSE\">Melrose</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BERWICKSHIRE\">Berwickshire</a>, and through his mother, from the Ogilvies of Purie in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGUS\">Angus</a>. His parents were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> the most respectable, but in circumstances by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means affluent. From his earliest years he discovered a serious disposition, and a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> for knowledge; and after passing through the course of a Scotch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> school education, he was inclined to pursue the studies requisite to fit him for the profession of a clergyman; an inclination with which the wishes of his mother, a woman of eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, powerfully concurred. Several circumstances, however, conspired to divert him for a time from his favourite pursuit.\n\nHe was educated in the episcopal persuasion; and having been unhappy enough to lose his father while yet very young, he found, upon his advancing towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> of manhood, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> fortunes of himself and his mother could not bear the expense of a regular education in either of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, which he doubtless thought absolutely necessary to one who aspired to respectability in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of England. Yielding therefore to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, he resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURGERY\">surgery</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a>; and was with this view bound apprentice to Dr Findlay, a physician (A) in Fraserburgh. But though obliged to relinquish for a time his favourite studies, he did not think <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> excusable in a surgeon more than in a clergyman, or conceive that he could ever become eminent in the profession in which circumstances had placed him, merely by skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> a bone or compounding a medicine. He determined therefore, with the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, who\n\n(A) In the remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of Scotland the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> generally acts in the triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of physician, surgeon, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHECARY\">apothecary</a>.\nwho very soon discovered his talents for literature, to make himself acquainted with at least the outlines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERAL_ARTS\">liberal arts</a> and sciences; and with this view he repaired in 1750 to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> and university of Aberdeen, where he obtained one of the bursaries or exhibitions which are there annually bestowed upon such candidates for them as display the most accurate knowledge of the Latin language. The small sum of five pounds, however (which none of these bursaries exceed), was still inadequate to the expense of residence in college; but our young student was soon to obtain a more valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a>, and to obtain it likewise by his own merit.\n\nDuring the long vacation he returned to his master Dr. Findlay, and was by him intrusted with a very desperate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in surgery, of which his management may be said to have laid the foundation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> fortunes. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of one of the judges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">Session</a>, who, when the court was not sitting, resided in the neighbourhood of Fraserburgh, had been so dreadfully gored by a bull, that hardly any hopes were entertained of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>; but Mr. Ramsay, to whose care she was entirely left, treated the wound with such skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, that, contrary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, his patient recovered. This attracted the judge's notice, who having informed himself of the young man's circumstances and character, recommended him to effectually to Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain, that he presented him with a bursary of 15 pounds a-year, which commenced at the next session or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, in the same college.\n\nHe now prosecuted his studies with comfort; and though he was detained in college a year longer than is usual, being obliged, upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> of a second bursary, to begin his course anew, he always considered this as a fortunate circumstance, because it gave him the celebrated Dr. Reid three years for his preceptor. To that great and amiable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> he so recommended himself by his talents, his industry, and his virtues, that he was honoured with his friendship to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of his death. Nor was it only to his masters that his conduct recommended him; Sir Alexander Ramsay whom he visited during some of the vacations, was so well pleased with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>, that he promised him another bursary, in his gift, of 25l. a-year, to commence immediately on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of that which he enjoyed. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> he performed in the beginning of the year 1755; and at the solicitation of Dr. Findlay, even paid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> per advance to enable the exhibitor to travel for the purpose of improving himself in his profession.\n\nThus provided, Mr. Ramsay went to London, and studied surgery and pharmacy under the auspices of Dr. Macaulay; in whose family he lived for two years, carefully and esteemed both by him and by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>. Afterwards, having passed the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> at Surgeons-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>, he served in his medical capacity for several years in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>; but how long he was continued in the station of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a>, or when and by whom he was first appointed surgeon, we have not been able to learn. We can say, however, upon the best authority, that by his humane and diligent discharge of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> in every station, he endeared himself to the seamen, and acquired the esteem of his officers.\n\nOf his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> there is indeed one memorable instance, which must not be omitted. Whilst he acted as surgeon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a>, then commanded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> (now Vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>) Middleton, a slave-ship on her passage from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> to the West Indies fell in with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> to which the Arundel belonged. An epidemic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in such vessels, had swept away not only a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, but also many of the ship's crew, and among others the surgeon. In this distressing situation the commander of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a> ship applied to the English commodore for medical assistance; but not a surgeon or surgeon's mate in the whole fleet, except Mr. Ramsay, would expose himself to the contagion of so dangerous a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>. Prompted, however, by his own innate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, and fully authorized by his noble beneficent commander, the surgeon of the Arundel, regardless of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> danger, and trusting in that God to whom mercy is more acceptable than sacrifice, went on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> the infected ship, visited all the patients, and remained long enough to leave behind him written directions for their future treatment. If a cup of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> be entitled to a reward, how much more such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> as this? But the rewards of Christianity are not immediate. Mr. Ramsay indeed escaped the contagion; but on his return to his own ship, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as he had got on the deck, he fell and broke his thigh-bone; by which he was confined to his apartment for ten months, and rendered in a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> lame through the remainder of his life.\n\nThe fearless humanity which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> on this occasion gained him the friendship and esteem of Sir Charles Middleton, which no future action of his life had the smallest tendency to impair; but the fracture of his thigh-bone and his subsequent lameness determined him to quit the navy, and once more turn his thoughts towards the church. Accordingly, while the Arundel lay at St Christopher's, he opened his views to some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> inhabitants of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, by whom he was so strongly recommended to the bishop of London, that on his coming home with Sir Charles Middleton, who warmly joined in the recommendation, he was admitted into orders; after which he immediately returned to St Christopher's, where he was presented by the governor to two rectories, valued at 700l. a-year.\n\nAs soon as he took possession of his livings, in 1763, he married Miss Rebecca Akers, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a planter of the best family-connections in the island, and began to regulate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> on the pious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> inculcated in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on the Treatment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">Conversion</a> of the African Slaves in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">Colonies</a>. He summoned all his own slaves daily to the prayers of the family, when he took an opportunity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out to them their duty in the plainest terms, reproving those that had done amiss, and commending such as had shown any thing like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; but he confessed that his occasions for reproof were more frequent than for commendation. As became his office and character, he inculcated upon others what he practised himself, and knew to be equally the duty of all. \"On his first settlement as a minister in the West Indies, he made some public attempts to instruct slaves. He began to draw up some easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> discourses for their instruction. He invited them to attend on Sundays, at particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. He appointed hours at home to instruct such sensible slaves...\"\nas would of themselves attend. He repeatedly exhorted their masters to encourage such in their attendance. He recommended the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, of beginning and ending work by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>. But inconceivable is the littlest-ness with which he was heard, and bitter was the censure heaped on him in return. It was quickly suggested, and generally believed, that he wanted to interrupt the work of slaves, to give them time, forsooth, to say their prayers; that he aimed at the making of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, to render them incapable of being good slaves. In one word, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, a rebel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICT\">convict</a> against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> and majesty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTERSHIP\">plantership</a>. And as the Jews say, that in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, with which they have been proved, since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, there has been an ounce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOREB\">Horeb</a>; so might he say, that in every instance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> (and they were not a few) with which, till within a year or two of his departure from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he was exercised, there was an ounce of his fruitless attempts to improve the minds of slaves. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIDDING\">bidding</a> prayer, he had inserted a petition for the conversion of those persons. But it was deemed so disagreeable a momento, that several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> people, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of it, left off attending divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. He was obliged to omit the prayer entirely, to try and bring them back. In short, neither were the slaves, at that time, deafuous of being taught, nor were their masters inclined to encourage them.\n\nThat he was hurt by this neglect cannot be questioned, for he had a mind benevolent, warm, and irritable; but he still retained many friends amongst the most worthy members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>; and as he was conscious of having done nothing more than his duty, he consoled himself with reflecting, that those are \"blest whom men revile, and persecute, and speak all manner of evil against falsely, for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>.\"\n\nAlthough his serious studies were now theological, he considered himself as answerable to God, his country, and his own family, for a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of every branch of knowledge which he possessed. He therefore took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of several plantations around him in the capacity of a medical practitioner; and attended them with unremitting diligence, and with great success. Thus he lived till the year 1777, when relinquishing the practice of physic entirely, he paid a visit to the place of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, which he had not seen since 1755. His mother, whose latter days he had made comfortable by a handsome annuity, had been dead for some years; but he rewarded all who had been attentive to her, or in early life serviceable to himself; and he continued the pension to a sister who had a numerous family, for which her husband was unable to provide.\n\nAfter remaining three weeks in Scotland, and near a year in England, during which time he was admitted into the confidence of Lord George Germaine, secretary of state for the American department, Mr. Ramsay was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a> to Admiral Barrington, then going out to take a command in the West Indies. Under this gallant officer, and afterwards under Lord Rodney, he was present at several engagements, where he displayed a fortitude and zeal for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of his country which would not have disgraced the oldest admiral. To the navy, indeed, he seems to have been strongly attached; and he wrote, at an early period of his life, an Essay on the Duty and Qualifications of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>-officer, with such a knowledge of the service as would have done honour to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of the most experienced commander. Of the first edition of this essay the profits were by its benevolent author appropriated to the Magdalen and British lying-in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, as those of the second and third (which last was published about the period of which we now write) were to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> school, or, in the event of its failure, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>.\n\nAlthough cared for by both the admirals under whom he served, and having such influence with the latter as to be able to render <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> services to the Jews and other persons whom he thought harshly treated at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTURE\">capture</a> of St. Eustatius, Mr. Ramsay once more quitted the sea-service, and retired to his pastoral charge in the island of St. Christopher's. There, however, though the former animosities against him had entirely subsided, and though his friendship was now solicited by every person of consequence in the island, he remained but a little while. Sick of the life of a planter and of the prospect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> around him, he resigned his livings, bade adieu to the island, and returned to England with his wife and family in the end of the year 1781. Immediately on his arrival, he was, through the intercess of his steady friend Sir Charles Middleton, presented to the livings of Telton and Nettlestead in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>.\n\nHere he was soon determined, by the advice of those whom he most respected, to publish an Essay, which had been written many years before, on the Treatment and Conversion of African Slaves in the British Sugar Colonies. The controversy in which this publication involved him, and the acrimony with which it was carried on, are so fresh in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of all our readers, that no man who thinks of the narrow limits within which our biographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> must be confined, will blame us for not entering into a detail of the particulars. Torrents of obloquy were poured upon the benevolent author by writers who were unfair enough to conceal their names; and it must be confessed, that his replies abounded with sarcasms, which the most rational friends to the cause which he supported would not have been sorry to see blotted from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>. The provocation, however, which he received was great; and Mr. Ramsay, though an amiable, virtuous, and pious man, had a warmth of temper, which, though not deserving of praise, will be censured by none who reflect on the frailties of our common nature. That the particular calumnies propagated against him on this occasion were wholly groundless, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to doubt, if we admit him to have been possessed of common understanding. When some years ago a story was circulated, of Swift's having, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREBENDARY\">prebendary</a> of Kilroot, been convicted before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of an attempt to commit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAPE\">rape</a> on the body of one of his parishioners, it was thought a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALUMNY\">calumny</a> to put the retailer of it in mind, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of St. Patrick's, though defeated by the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, lampooned without dread, and with great severity, the dean of Ferns for the very crime, of which, had this anecdote been true, he must have been conscious that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> knew himself to be guilty! Such conduct cannot be reconciled to common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. Had Swift been a ruffian, though he might have been penitent, and reasoned in general terms against giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to such licentious passions, he would never have satisfied\nRamsey, a particular person for the crime of which he himself was found convicted. In like manner, had Mr Ramsey been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> to his own slaves, though he might have argued against slavery in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> basis of virtue and religion, he never could have arraigned for similar cruelty a number of individuals in the very island which witnessed his own enormities.\n\nBut the melancholy part of the narrative is behind. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> given to his mind by these calumnies, and the fatigues he underwent in his endeavours to rescue from misery the most helpless portion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, contributed to shorten a life in no common degree useful. He had been for some time afflicted with a pain in his stomach, for which he was prevailed upon, though with great reluctance, to try the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, by attempting a journey of 100 miles. But in London, being seized with a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOMITING\">vomiting</a> of blood, he was unable either to proceed or to be removed home; and in the house of Sir Charles Middleton he ended his days, on the 20th of July 1789, amidst the groans of his family, and the tears of many friends.\u2014Thus died a man, of whom it is not too much to say, that \"the bleeding of many that were ready to perish came upon him;\" for whatever be the fate of the slave-trade (see Slavery), it is certain that his writings have contributed much to meliorate the treatment of slaves. He left behind him a widow and three daughters; and his works, besides those to which we have alluded, consist of a volume of Sermons, preached on board his majesty's ship the Prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, which show him to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a> eloquence; and a Treatise on Signals, which was certainly written, and we think printed, though we know not whether it was ever published.\n\nRAMSDEN's Machine for Dividing Mathematical Instruments, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> by which these divisions can be performed with exceeding great accuracy, such as would formerly have been deemed incredible. On discovering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of constructing this machine, its inventor, Mr Ramsden of Piccadilly, received \u00a3150 from the commissioners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a>; engaging himself to instruct a certain number of persons, not exceeding ten, in the method of making and using this machine from the 28th October 1775 to the 28th October 1777; also binding himself to divide all octants and sextants by the same engine, at the rate of three shillings for each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTANT\">octant</a>, and six shillings for each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEXTANT\">sextant</a>, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONIUS\">Nonius</a>'s divisions to half minutes, for as long time as the commissioners should think proper to let the engine remain in his possession. Of this sum of \u00a3150 paid to Mr Ramsden, \u00a3300 was given him as a reward for the improvement made by him in discovering the engine, and the remaining \u00a3120 for his giving up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of it to the commissioners. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the engine, is that given upon oath by Mr Ramsden himself.\n\n\"This engine consists of a large wheel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-metal, supported on a mahogany stand, having three legs which are strongly connected together by braces, so as to make it perfectly steady. On each leg of the stand is placed a conical friction pulley, whereon the dividing-wheel rests; to prevent the wheel from sliding off the friction-pulleys, the bell-metal centre under it turns in a socket on the top of the stand.\n\n\"The circumference of the wheel is ratched or cut (by a method which will be described hereafter) into 2160 teeth, in which an endless screw acts. Six revolutions of the screw will move the wheel a space equal to one degree.\n\n\"Now a circle of brass being fixed on the screw arbor, having its circumference divided into 60 parts, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> will consequently answer to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the wheel of 10 seconds, five of them will be equal to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, &c.\n\n\"Several different arbors of tempered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> are truly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> into the socket in the centre of the wheel. The upper parts of the arbors that stand above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> are turned of various sizes, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the centres of different pieces of work to be divided.\n\n\"When any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> is to be divided, the centre of it is very exactly fitted on one of these arbors; and the instrument is fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the plane of the dividing wheel, by means of screws, which fit into holes made in the radii of the wheel for that purpose.\n\n\"The instrument being thus fitted on the plane of the wheel, the frame which carries the dividing-point is connected at one end by finger-screws with the frame which carries the endless screw; while the other end embraces that part of the steel arbor, which stands above the instrument to be divided, by an angular notch in a piece of hardened steel; by this means both ends of the frame are kept perfectly steady and free from any shake.\n\n\"The frame carrying the dividing-point, or tracer, is made to slide on the frame which carries the endless screw to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the centre of the wheel, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> of the instrument to be divided may require, and may be there fastened by tightening two clamps; and the dividing-point or tracer being connected with the clamps by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>-jointed frame, admits a free and easy motion towards or from the centre for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the divisions, without any lateral shake.\n\n\"From what has been said, it appears, that an instrument thus fitted on the dividing-wheel may be moved to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> by the screw and divided circle on its arbor, and that this angle may be marked on the limb of the instrument with the greatest exactness by the dividing-point or tracer, which can only move in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line tending to the centre, and is altogether freed from those inconveniences that attend cutting by means of a straight edge. This method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> will also prevent any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> that might arise from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the metal during the time of dividing.\n\n\"The screw-frame is fixed on the top of a conical pillar, which turns freely round its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, and also moves freely towards or from the centre of the wheel, so that the screw-frame may be entirely guided by the frame which connects it with the centre: by this means any eccentricity of the wheel and arbor would not produce any error in the dividing; and, by a particular contrivance (which will be described hereafter), the screw when pressed against the teeth of the wheel always moves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to itself; so that a line joining the centre of the arbor and the tracer continued, will always make equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the screw.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">Figure</a> 1. represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> view of the engine.\n\n\"Fig. 2. is a plan, of which fig. 3. represents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> on the line A.A.\n\n\"The large wheel A is 45 inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and...\"\nRAM\n\nRamfien's has ten radii, each being supported by edge-bars, as represented in fig. 3. These bars and radii are connected by the circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> B, 24 inches in diameter and three deep; and, for greater strength, the whole is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> in one piece in bell-metal.\n\nAs the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the wheel A rests on its ring B, the edge-bars are deepest where they join it; and from thence their depth diminishes, both towards the centre and the circumference, as represented in fig. 3.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> of the wheel A was worked very even and flat, and its circumference turned true. The ring C, of fine brass, was fitted very exactly on the circumference of the wheel; and was fastened thereon with screws, which, after being screwed as tight as possible, were well riveted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of a large chuck being turned very true and flat in the lathe, the flattened surface A of the wheel was fastened against it with holdfasts; and the two surfaces and circumference of the ring C, a hole through the centre and the plane part round (b) it, and the lower edge of the ring B, were turned at the same time.\n\nD is a piece of hard bell-metal, having the hole, which receives the steel-arbor d, made very straight and true. This bell-metal was turned very true on an arbor; and the face, which rests on the wheel at b, was turned very flat, so that the steel arbor d might stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the plane of the wheel: this bell-metal was fastened to the wheel by six steel screws l.\n\nA brass socket Z is fastened on the centre of the mahogany stand, and receives the lower part of the bell-metal piece D, being made to touch the bell-metal in a narrow part near the mouth, to prevent any obliquity of the wheel from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> the arbor: good fitting is by no means necessary here; since any fluke in this socket will produce no bad effect, as will appear hereafter when we describe the cutting frame.\n\nThe wheel was then put on its stand, the lower edge of the ring B resting on the circumference of three conical friction-pulleys W, to facilitate its motion round its centre. The axis of one of these pulleys is in a line joining the centre of the wheel and the middle of the endless screw, and the other two placed so as to be at equal distances from each other.\n\nF is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of wood strongly fastened to one of the legs of the stand; the piece g is screwed to the upper side of the block, and has half holes, in which the transverse axis h turns: the half holes are kept together by the screws i.\n\nThe lower extremity of the conical pillar P terminates in a cylindrical steel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> k, which passes through and turns in the transverse axis h, and is confined by a cheek and screw.\n\nTo the upper end of the conical pillar is fastened the frame G, in which the endless screw turns: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PIVOTS\">pivots</a> of the screw are formed in the manner of two frustums of cones joined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, as represented at X. These pivots are confined between half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, which press only on the conical parts, and do not touch the cylindric parts: the half holes are kept together by screws a, which may be tightened at any time, to prevent the screw from shaking in the frame.\n\nOn the screw-arbor is a small wheel of brass K, having its outside edge divided into 60 parts, and numbered at every 6th division with 1, 2, &c., to 10. The Ramfien's motion of this wheel is shown by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> y on the screw-frame G.\n\nH represents a part of the stand, having a parallel slit in the direction towards the centre of the wheel, large enough to receive the upper part of the conical brass pillar P, which carries the screw and its frame: and as the resistance, when the wheel is moved by the endless screw, is against that side of the slit H which is towards the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, that side of the slit is faced with brass, and the pillar is pressed against it by a steel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> on the opposite side: by this means the pillar is strongly supported laterally, and yet the screw may be easily pressed from or against the circumference of the wheel, and the pillar will turn freely on its axis to take any direction given it by the frame L.\n\nAt each corner of the piece I are screws n of tempered steel, having polished conical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>: two of them turn in conical holes in the screw-frame near o, and the points of the other two screws turn in holes in the piece Q; the screws p are of steel, which being tightened, prevent the conical pointed screws from unturning when the frame is moved.\n\nL is a brass frame, which serves to connect the endless screw, its frame, &c., with the centre of the wheel: each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of this frame is terminated by a steel screw, that may be passed through any of the holes q in the piece Q, as the thickness of work to be divided on the wheel may require, and are fastened by the finger-nuts r.\n\nAt the other end of this frame is a flat piece of tempered steel b, wherein is an angular notch: when the endless screw is pressed against the teeth on the circumference of the wheel, which may be done by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the finger-screw S, to press against the spring t, this notch embraces and presses against the steel arbor d. This end of the frame may be raised or depressed by moving the prismatic slide u, which may be fixed at any height by the four steel-screws v.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of this slide has a notch k, whose plane is parallel to the endless-screw; and by the point of the arbor d resting in this notch, this end of the frame is prevented from tilting. The screw S is prevented from unturning, by tightening the finger-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> w.\n\nThe teeth on the circumference of the wheel were cut by the following method:\n\nHaving considered what number of teeth on the circumference would be most convenient, which in this engine is 2165, or 360 multiplied by 6, I made two screws of the same dimensions, of tempered steel, in the manner hereafter described, the interval between the threads being such as I knew by calculation would come within the limits of what might be turned off the circumference of the wheel: one of the screws, which was intended for ratcheting or cutting the teeth, was notched across the threads, so that the screw, when pressed against the edge of the wheel and turned round, cut in the manner of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>. Then having a segment of a circle a little greater than 60 degrees, of about the same radius with the wheel, and the circumference made true, from a very fine centre, I described an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> near the edge, and set off the chord of 60 degrees on this arch. This segment was put in the place of the wheel, the edge of it was ratched, and the number of revolutions...\nRamden's revolutions and parts of the screw contained between Machine.\n\nthe interval of the 60 degrees were counted. The radius was corrected in the proportion of 360 revolutions, which ought to have been in 60 degrees, to the number actually found; and the radius, so corrected, was taken in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of bear-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>: while the wheel was on the lathe, one foot of the compasses was put in the centre, and with the other a circle was described on the ring; then half the depth of the threads of the screw being taken in dividers, was set from this circle outwards, and another circle was described cutting this point; a hollow was then turned on the edge of the wheel of the same curvature as that of the screw at the bottom of the threads: the bottom of this hollow was turned to the same radius or distance from the centre of the wheel, as the outward of the two circles before-mentioned.\n\n\"The wheel was now taken off the lathe; and the bell-metal piece D was screwed on as before directed, which after this ought not to be removed.\n\n\"From a very exact centre a circle was described Fig. 1, 2, 3 on the ring C, about four-tenths of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> within where the bottom of the teeth would come. This circle was divided with the greatest exactness I was capable of, first into five parts, and each of these into three. These parts were then biflected four times: (that is to say) supposing the whole circumference of the wheel to contain 2160 teeth, this being divided into five parts, each would contain 432 teeth; which being divided into three parts, each of them would contain 144; and this space biflected four times would give 72, 36, 18, and 9: therefore each of the last divisions would contain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> teeth. But, as I was apprehensive some error might arise from quinquiesction and trification; in order to examine the accuracy of the divisions, I described another circle on the ring C, one-tenth of an inch within the former, and divided it by continual biflections, as 2160, 1080, 540, 270, 135, 67\u00bd, and 33\u00bd; and as the fixed wire (to be described presently) crossed both the circles, I could examine their agreement at every 135 revolutions; (after ratcheting, could examine it at every 33\u00bd): but, not finding any sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the two sets of divisions, I, for ratcheting, made choice of the former; and, as the coincidence of the fixed wire with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> could be more exactly determined than with a dot or division, I therefore made use of intersection in both circles before described.\n\n\"The arms of the frame L were connected by a thin piece of brass of three-fourths of an inch broad, having a hole in the middle of four-tenths of an inch in diameter; across this hole a silver wire was fixed exactly in a line to the centre of the wheel; the coincidence of this wire with the intersections was examined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>-tenths of an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, fixed in a tube which was attached to one of the arms L (A). Now a handle or winch being fixed on the end of the screw, the division marked on the end of the screw, the division marked 10 on the circle K was set to its index, and, by means of a clamp and adjusting screw for that purpose, the intersection marked 1 on the circle C was set exactly to coincide with the fixed wire; the screw was then carefully pressed against the circumference of the wheel, by turning the finger-screw S; then, removing the clamp, I turned the screw by its handle nine revolutions, till the intersection marked 240 came nearly to the wire; then, unturning the finger-screw S, I released the screw from the wheel, and turned the wheel back till the intersection marked 2 exactly coincided with the wire, and, by means of the clamp before-mentioned, the division 10 on the circle being set to its index, the screw was pressed against the edge of the wheel by the finger-screw S; the clamps were removed, and the screw turned nine revolutions till the intersection marked 1 nearly coincided with the fixed wire; the screw was released from the wheel by unturning the finger-screw S as before, the wheel was turned back till the intersection 3 coincided with the fixed wire; the division 10 on the circle being set to its index, the screw was pressed against the wheel as before, and the screw was turned nine revolutions, till the intersection 2 nearly coincided with the fixed wire, and the screw was released; and I proceeded in this manner till the teeth were marked round the whole circumference of the wheel. This was repeated three times round, to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of the screw deeper. I then ratched the wheel round continually in the same direction without ever disengaging the screw; and, in ratching the wheel about 300 times round, the teeth were finished.\n\n\"Now it is evident, if the circumference of the wheel was even one tooth or ten minutes greater than the screw would require, this error would in the first instance be reduced to one part of a revolution, or two seconds and a half; and these errors or inequalities of the teeth were equally distributed round the wheel at the distance of nine teeth from each other. Now, as the screw in ratching had continually hold of several teeth at the same time, and, these constantly changing, the above-mentioned inequalities soon corrected themselves, and the teeth were reduced to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> equality. The piece of brass which carries the wire was now taken away, and the cutting screw was also removed, and a plain one (hereafter described) put in its place: on one end of the screw is a small brass circle, having its edge divided into 60 equal parts, and numbered at every fifth division, as before-mentioned. On the other end of the screw is a ratchet-wheel C, having 60 teeth, covered by the hollowed circle d, which carries two Fig. 5 clicks that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> upon the opposite sides of the ratchet when the screw is to be moved forwards. The cylinder S turns on a strong steel arbor F, which passes through and is firmly screwed to the piece Y: this piece, for greater firmness, is attached to the screw-frame G by the braces v; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> or thread Fig. 4 is cut on the outside of the cylinder S, which serves both for holding the spring, and also giving motion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> J on its centre by means of a steel tooth n, that works between the threads of the spiral. To the lever is attached a strong steel pin m, on which a brass socket r turns: this socket passes through a slit in\n\n(a) The intersections are marked for the sake of illustration, though properly invisible, because they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> under the brass plate.\nRAM\n\nRamden's in the piece p, and may be tightened in any part of Machine, the fit by the finger-nut f; this piece serves to regulate the number of revolutions of the screw for each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> of the treadle R.\n\nFig. 1.\n\n\"T is a brass box containing a spiral spring; a strong gut is fastened and turned three or four times round the circumference of this box, the gut then passes several times round the cylinder S, and from thence down to the treadle R. Now, when the treadle is pressed down, the string pulls the cylinder S round its axis, and the clicks catching hold of the teeth on the ratchet carry the screw round with it, till, by the tooth n working in the spiral groove, the lever J is brought near the wheel d, and the cylinder flopped by the screw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> x striking on the top of the lever J; at the same time the spring is wound up by the other end of the gut passing round the box T. Now, when the foot is taken off the treadle, the spring unbending itself pulls back the cylinder, the clicks leaving the ratchet and screw at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> till the piece t strikes on the end of the piece p: the number of revolutions of the screw at each tread is limited by the number of revolutions the cylinder is allowed to turn back before the stop strikes on the piece p.\n\nWhen the endless screw was moved round its axis with considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, it would continue that motion a little after the cylinder S was flopped: to prevent this, the angular lever v was made; that when the lever J comes near to stop the screw x, it, by a small chamfer, presses down the pin z of the angular lever; this brings the other end a of the same lever forwards, and flops the endless screw by the steel pin \u00b5 striking upon the top of it; the foot of the lever is raised again by a small spring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> on the brace v.\n\nFig. 1 & 4.\n\n\"D, two clamps, connected by the piece z, slide one on each arm of the frame L, and may be fixed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> by the four finger-screws s, which press against steel springs to avoid spoiling the arms: the piece q is made to turn without shake between two conical pointed screws j, which are prevented from unturning by tightening the finger-nuts N.\n\nThe piece M is made to turn on the piece q by the conical pointed screws f resting in the hollow centers e.\n\nAs there is frequent occasion to cut divisions on inclined planes, for that purpose the piece y, in which the tracer is fixed, has a conical axis at each end, which turns in half holes: when the tracer is set to any inclination, it may be fixed there by tightening the steel screws \u03b2.\n\nDescription of the Engine by which the endless screw of the Dividing Engine was cut.\n\nFig. 9 represents this engine of its full dimensions seen from one side.\n\nFig. 8. The upper side of the same as seen from above.\n\nA represents a triangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of steel, to which the triangular holes in the pieces B and C are accurately fitted, and may be fixed on any part of the bar by the screws D.\n\nE is a piece of steel wherein the screw is intended to be cut; which, after being hardened and tempered, has its pivots turned in the form of two frustums of cones, as represented in the drawings of the dividing engine (fig. 5). These pivots were exactly fitted to the half holes F, and T, which were kept together by the Ramden's Machine, Ramley.\n\n\"H represents a screw of untempered steel, having a pivot I, which turns in the hole K. At the other end of the screw is a hollow centre, which receives the hardened conical point of the steel pin M. When this point is sufficiently pressed against the screw, to prevent its flanking, the steel pin may be fixed by tightening the screws Y.\n\nN is a cylindric nut, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> on the screw H; which, to prevent any shake, may be tightened by the screws O. This nut is connected with the saddle-piece P by means of the intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> joint W, through which the arbor of the screw H passes. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> view of this piece, with the section across the screw arbor, is represented at X. This joint is connected with the nut by means of two steel slips S, which turn on pins between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> T on the nut N. The other ends of these slips S turn in like manner on pins a. One axis of this joint turns in a hole in the cock b, which is fixed to the saddle-piece; and the other turns in a hole c, made for that purpose in the same piece on which the cock b is fixed. By this means, when the screw is turned round, the saddle-piece will slide uniformly along the triangular bar A.\n\nK is a small triangular bar of well-tempered steel, which slides in a groove of the same form on the saddle-piece P. The point of this bar or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTER\">cutter</a> is formed to the shape of the thread intended to be cut on the endless screw. When the cutter is set to take proper hold of the intended screw, it may be fixed by tightening the screw e, which presses the two pieces of brass G upon it.\n\nHaving measured the circumference of the dividing-wheel, I found it would require a screw about one thread in a hundred coarser than the guide-screw H. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> on the guide-screw arbor H, and that on the steel E, on which the screw was to be cut, were proportioned to each other to produce that effect, by giving the wheel L 198 teeth, and the wheel Q 200. These wheels communicated with each other by means of the intermediate wheel R, which also served to give the threads on the two screws the same direction.\n\nThe saddle-piece P is confined on the bar A by means of the pieces g, and may be made to slide with a proper degree of tightness by the screws n.\"\n\nFor Ramden's equatorial or portable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>, No 89, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, No 364.

Near it are several small ones, known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the bishop and his clerks. It is four miles west of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>'s, and 17 north-east of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD_HAVEN\"><a class=\"xre</a>f\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD\">Milford</a> haven. It belongs to the bishopric of St David's, and was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, says Camden, famous for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, a most holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, who retiring hither from Brittany, in that age rich in saints, and devoting himself entirely to God, lived a long while in solitude, and being at last murdered by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> was enrolled among the martyrs. W. Long. 5. 20. N. Lat. 51. 55.\n\nRamsey, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of Man, to the north, a most noted and spacious haven, in which the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> may ride at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> with safety enough from all winds but the north-east, and in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> they need not be embayed.

The town is situated in the cove of a chalky cliff. It was formerly but an obscure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, but since the year 1688 has been improved and enlarged by a successful trade to Russia and the east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. But what renders it most worthy of notice, and attracts multitudes of strangers, is the new harbour, which is one of the most capacious in England, if not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. It was begun in the year 1750, but delayed by various interruptions. It consists of two piers; that to the east is built wholly of Purbeck <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and extends itself into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a> near 800 feet before it forms an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>; its breadth on the top is 26 feet, including a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> wall, which runs along the outside of it. The other to the west is constructed of wood as far as the low-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> mark, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> is of stone. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, of which there are five in each pier, consist of 160 feet each, with octagons at the end of 60 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, leaving an entrance of 200 feet into the harbour, the depth of which admits of a gradual increase of 18 to 36 feet. E. Long. 1. 20. N. Lat. 51. 22.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAMTRUT\">Ramtrut</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a> worshipped by the Ranazins of Hindostan, where he has a celebrated temple at Onor. He is represented as more resembling a monkey than a man.\n\nRamus, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, denotes a branch of any thing, as of a tree, an artery, &c. In the anatomy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> it means the first or lateral branches, which go off from the petiolum, or middle rib of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>. The subdivisions of these are called furculi; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> divisions into the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> of all, are by some called capillamenta; but both kinds are generally denominated furculus.\n\nRamus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, was one of the most famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of the 16th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. He was born in Picardy in 1515. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> for learning prompted him to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> when very young, and he was admitted a fervent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of Navarre. Spending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in waiting on his masters, and the greatest part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, he made such surprising progress, that, when he took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of arts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, he offered to maintain a quite opposite doctrine to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>. This raised him many enemies; and the two first books he published, Institutiones Dialecticae, and Aristotelicae Animadversiones, occasioned great disturbances in the university of Paris; and the opposition against him was not a little heightened by his detesting the Romish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and professing that of the Reformed. Being thus forced to retire from Paris, he visited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of Germany, and received great honours wherever he came. He returned to France in 1571, and lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> miserably in the horrible massacre of St Bartholomew's day. He was a great orator, a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> learning, and endowed with very fine moral qualities. He published many books, which Teissier enumerates. Ramus's merit in his opposition to Aristotle, and his firmness in undermining his authority, is unquestionably great. But it has been doubted, and with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, whether he was equally successfully in his attempts after a new logical institute. We have the following general outline of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> in Dr Enfield's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>. \"Considering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECTICS\">dialectics</a> as the art of deducing conclusions from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>, he endeavours to improve this art, by uniting it with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>. Of the several branches of rhetoric, he considers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> and disposition as belonging equally to logic. Making Cicero his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> guide, he divides his treatise on dialectics into two parts, the first of which treats of the invention of arguments, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> of judgments. Arguments he derives not only from what the Aristotelians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> middle terms, but from any kind of proposition, which, connected with another, may serve to prove any assertion. Of these he enumerates various kinds. Judgments he divides into axioms, or self-evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, diaconia, or deductions by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of arguments. Both these he divides into various classes; and illustrates the whole by examples from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> orators and poets.\n\n\"In the logic of Ramus, many things are borrowed from Aristotle, and only appear under new names; and many others are derived from other Grecian sources, particularly from the dialogues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, and the logic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOICS\">Stoics</a>. The author has the merit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> from the futile speculations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> to forensic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>; but his plan is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> in confining the whole dialectic art to the single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of disputation, and in omitting many things, which respect the general culture of the understanding and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Notwithstanding the defects of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, we cannot, however, subscribe to the severe cen-\nsure which has been passed upon Ramus by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a> and others; for much is, we think, due to him for having so much firmness and perseverance affected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> freedom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> understanding. The logic of Ramus obtained great authority in the schools of Germany, Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and France; and long and violent contests arose between his followers and those of the Stagyrite, till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> vanished before that of Descartes.\"","sp":282,"ep":288},{"h":"RANAI","t":"one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> discovered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cooke, is about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles distant from MOWEE and MOROTOI, and is situated to the south-west of the passage between those two isles.

Also the stealing away a woman from her parents or guardians, and debauching her, is equally penal by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a>, whether the consent or is forced.

But our English law does not enter-\n\n---\n\n**Rape.**\n\nRape was punished by the Saxon laws, particularly those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHELSTAN\">Athelstan</a>, with death; which was also agreeable to the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> or Scandinavian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. But this was afterwards thought too hard; and in its stead another severe, but not capital, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> was inflicted by William the Conqueror, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASTRATION\">castration</a> and loss of eyes; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till after Bracton wrote, in the reign of Henry III. But in order to prevent malicious accusations, it was then the law, (and, it seems, still continues to be so in appeals of rape), that the woman should, immediately after, go to the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a>, and there make discovery to some credible persons of the injury she has suffered; and afterwards should acquaint the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> of the hundred, the coroners, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, with the outrage. This seems to correspond in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> with the laws of Scotland and Arragon, which require that complaint must be made within 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>: though afterwards by statute Westm. i. c. 13. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of limitation in England was extended to 40 days. At present there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> time of limitation fixed: for, as it is usually now punished by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of the king, the maxim of law takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, that \"nullum tempus occurrat regi:\" but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> will rarely give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> complaint. During the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> also it was held for law, that the woman (by consent of the judge and her parents) might redeem the offender from the execution of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>, by accepting him for her husband; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he also was willing to agree to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, but not otherwise.\n\nIn the 3 Edw. I. by the statute Westm. i. c. 13. the punishment of rape was much mitigated: the offence itself, of ravishing a damsel within <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, (that is, twelve years old) either with her consent or without, or of any other woman against her will, being reduced to a trespass, if not prosecuted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> within 40 days, and subjecting the offender only to two years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>.\nment, and a fine at the king's will. But this lenity being productive of the most terrible consequences, it was, in ten years afterwards, 13 Edw. I. found necessary to make the offence of forcible rape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELONY\">felony</a> by statute Welfm. 2. c. 34. And by statute 18 Eliz. c. 7. it is made felony without benefit of clergy: as is also the abominable wickedness of carnally knowing or abusing any woman-child under the age of ten years; in which case the consent or non-consent is immaterial, as by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of her tender years she is incapable of judgment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. Sir Matthew Hale is indeed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that such profligate actions committed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> under the age of twelve years, the age of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> discretion by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law, either with or without consent, amount to rape and felony; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> since as before the statute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>: but that law has in general been held only to extend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> under ten; though it should seem that damsel between ten and twelve are still under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of the statute Welfm. 1. the law with respect to their seduction not having been altered by either of the subsequent statutes.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> infant, under the age of fourteen years, is presumed by law incapable to commit a rape, and therefore it seems cannot be found guilty of it. For though in other felonies \"malitia supplet actum,\" yet, as to this particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of felony, the law supposes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMBECILITY\">imbecility</a> of body as well as mind.\n\nThe civil law seems to suppose a prostitute or common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARLOT\">harlot</a> incapable of any injuries of this kind: not allowing any punishment for violating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHASTITY\">chastity</a> of her, who hath indeed no chastity at all, or at least hath no regard to it. But the law of England does not judge so hardly of offenders, as to cut off all opportunity of retreat even from common strumpets, and to treat them as never capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMENDMENT\">amendment</a>. It therefore holds it to be felony to force even a concubine or harlot; because the woman may have forsaken that unlawful course of life: for, as Bracton well observes, \"licet meretrici fuerit antea, certe tunc temporis non fuit, cum reclamando nequitie ejus confertire noluit.\"\n\nAs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> facts requisite to be given in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> and proved upon an indictment of rape, they are of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, that, though necessary to be known and settled, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a> of the guilty and preservation of the innocent, and therefore are to be found in such criminal treatises as discourse of these matters in detail, yet they are highly improper to be publicly discussed, except only in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. We shall therefore merely add upon this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> a few remarks from Sir Matthew Hale, with regard to the competency and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CREDIBILITY\">credibility</a> of witnesses; which may, salvo pudore, be considered.\n\nAnd, first, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> ravished may give evidence upon oath, and is in law a competent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>; but the credibility of her testimony, and how far forth the is to be believed, must be left to the jury upon the circumstances of fact that concur in that testimony. For instance: if the witness be of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>; if the presently discovered the offence, and made search for the offender; if the party accused fled for it; these and the like are concurring circumstances, which give greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> to her evidence. But, on the other side, if she be of evil fame, and stand unsupported by others; if she concealed the injury for any considerable time after she had opportunity to complain; if the place, where the fact was alleged to be committed, was where it was possible she might have been heard, and she made no outcry; these and the like circumstances carry a strong, but not conclusive, presumption that her testimony is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> or feigned.\n\nMoreover, if the rape be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> to be committed on an infant under 12 years of age, she may still be a competent witness, if she hath been and understanding to know the nature and obligations of an oath, and, even if she hath not, it is thought by Sir Matthew Hale, that she ought to be heard without oath, to give the court <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>; though that alone will not be sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICT\">convict</a> the offender. And he is of this opinion, first, Because the nature of the offence being secret, there may be no other possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> fact; though afterwards there may be concurrent circumstances to corroborate it, proved by other witnesses: and secondly, Because the law allows what the child told her mother, or other relations, to be given in evidence, since the nature of the case admits frequently of no better proof; and there is much more reason for the court to hear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a> of the child herself, than to receive it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> from those who swear they heard her say so. And indeed it seems now to be settled, that in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> infants of any age are to be heard; and, if they have any idea of an oath, to be also sworn: it being found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that infants of very tender years often give the clearest and truest testimony. But in any of these cases, whether the child be sworn or not, it is to be wished, in order to render her evidence credible, that there should be some concurrent testimony of time, place, and circumstances, in order to make out the fact; and that the conviction should not be grounded singly on the unsupported <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> of an infant under years of discretion. There may be therefore, in many cases of this nature, witnesses who are competent, that is, who may be admitted to be heard; and yet, after being heard, may prove not to be credible, or such as the jury is bound to believe. For one excellence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> by jury is, that the jury are triers of the credit of the witnesses, as well as of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the fact.\n\n\"It is true (says this learned judge), that rape is a most detestable crime, and therefore ought severely and impartially to be punished with death; but it must be remembered, that it is an accusation easy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the party accused, though innocent.\" He then relates two very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> cases of malicious prosecution for this crime, that had happened within his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>; and concludes thus: \"I mention these instances, that we may be the more cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, wherein the court and jury may with so much ease be imposed upon, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> care and vigilance; the heinousness of the offence many times transporting the judge and jury with so much indignation, that they are over-hastily carried to the conviction of the persons accused thereof, by the confident testimony of sometimes false and malicious witnesses.\"","sp":289,"ep":290},{"h":"RAPHAEL","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> REPHAIM, (Moses), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> signifying Giants, as they really were, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> people too, situated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASHAN\">Bashan</a> or Batanaea, beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a>, separated from the Zanzumim by the river Jabbok.

The History of Janenfim. 5. Several works on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> subjects. The best edition of his Latin poems is that of Paris in 1723, in 3 vols. 12mo.\n\nRAPIN de Thoyras, Paul de, a celebrated historian, was the son of James de Rapin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of Thoyras, and was born at Castras in 1661. He was educated at first under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> in his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and afterwards sent to Puylauriens, and thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAMUR\">Samur</a>. In 1679 he returned to his father, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to apply himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and was admitted an advocate; but some time after, reflecting that being a Protestant would prevent his advancement at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, he resolved to quit the profession of the law, and apply himself to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>; but his father would not consent to it. The revocation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> of Nantes in 1685, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father, which happened two months after, made him resolve to come to England; but as he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> hopes of any settlement here, his stay was but short. He therefore soon after went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and fitted himself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of French volunteers at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTRECHT\">Utrecht</a>, commanded by M. Rapin his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german. He attended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> into England in 1688: and the following year the lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGSTON\">Kingston</a> made him an ensign in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGIMENT\">regiment</a>, with which he went into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, where he gained the esteem of his officers at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRICKFERGUS\">Carrickfergus</a>, and had soon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>. He was present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOYNE\">Boyne</a>, and was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> through the shoulder at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMERICK\">Limerick</a>. He was soon after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of the company in which he had been ensign; but, in 1693, resigned his company to one of his brothers, in order to be tutor to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Portland's son. In 1699, he married Marianne Teftard; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> neither abated his care of his pupil, nor prevented his accompanying him in his travels. Having finished this employment, he returned to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, which he had settled at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAGUE\">Hague</a>; and here he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> some years. But as he found his family increase, he resolved to retire to some cheap <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and accordingly removed, in 1707, to Wefel, where he wrote his History of England, and some other pieces. Though he was of a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, yet 17 years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> (for so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> was he in composing the history <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned) entirely ruined his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. He died in 1725. He wrote in French, 1. A Dissertation on the Whigs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORIES\">Tories</a>. 2. His History of England, printed at the Hague in 1726 and 1727, in 9 vols 4to, and reprinted at Trevoux in 1728, in 10 vols 4to. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> edition is more complete than that of the Hague. It has been translated into English, and improved with Notes, by the reverend Mr Tindal, in 2 vols folio. This performance, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of a foreigner, is deservedly esteemed as the fullest and most impartial collection of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> transactions extant.

Thus a first-rate has six lieutenants, six master's mates, twenty-four midshipmen, and five surgeon's mates, who are considered as gentlemen: besides the following petty officers; quarter-masters and their mates, fourteen; boatwain's mates and yeomen, eight; gunner's mates and assistants, six; quarter-gunniers, twenty-five; carpenter's mates, two, besides fourteen...\nfourteen assistants; with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> and steward's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a> to the purser.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the dimensions of all ships of the same rate were equal, it would be the simplest and most perspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> them into one point of view in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>: but as there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> invariable rule for the general dimensions, we must content ourselves with but a few remarks on ships of each rate, so as to give a general idea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between them.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">Victory</a>, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> built of our first rates, is 222 feet 6 inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to the stern; the length of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>, 157 feet 3 inches; that of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-deck, or lower deck, 186 feet; her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> breadth is 57 feet 10 inches; her depth in the hold, 21 feet 6 inches; her burden, 2162 tons; and her poop reaches 6 feet before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIZEN\">mizen</a>-mast.\n\nShips of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> rate carry 90 guns upon three decks, of which those on the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a> are 32-pounders; those on the middle, 18-pounders; and those on the quarter-deck, 6-pounders, which usually amount to four or five. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> of men is 750, in which there are six lieutenants, four master's mates, 24 midshipmen, and four surgeon's mates, 14 quarter-masters and their mates, eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOATSWAIN\">boatswain</a>'s mates and yeomen, five gunner's mates and yeomen, with 22 quarter-gunners, two carpenter's mates, with 10 assistants, and one steward and steward's mate.\n\nShips of the third rate carry from 64 to 82 cannon, which are 31, 18, and 9 pounders. The 82-gun ships, however, begin to grow out of repute, and to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to those of 74, 70, &c., which have only two whole batteries; whereas the former have three, with 28 guns planted on each, the cannon of their upper deck being the same as those on the quarter-deck and fore-castle of the latter, which are 9-pounders. The complement in a 74 is 650, and in a 64, 500 men; having, in peace, four lieutenants, but in war, five; and when an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a> is aboard six. They have three master's mates, 16 midshipmen, three surgeon's mates, 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUARTER_MASTER\">quarter-master</a>, and their mates, six boatswain's mates and yeomen, four gunner's mates and yeomen, with 18 quarter-gunners, one carpenter's mate, with eight assistants, and one steward and steward's mate under the purser.\n\nShips of the fourth rate mount from 60 to 50 guns, upon two decks, and the quarter-deck. The lower tier is composed of 24-pounders, the upper tier of 12-pounders, and the cannon on the quarter-deck and fore-castle are 6-pounders. The complement of a 50 gun ship is 350 men, in which there are three lieutenants, two master's mates, 10 midshipmen, two surgeon's mates, eight quarter-masters and their mates, four boatswain's mates and yeomen, one gunner's mate and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YEOMAN\">yeoman</a>, with 12 quarter-gunners, one carpenter's mate and six assistants, and a steward and steward's mate.\n\nAll vessels of war, under the fourth rate, are usually comprehended under the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of frigates, and never appear in the line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. They are divided into the fifth and sixth rates; the former mounting from 40 to 32 guns, and the latter from 28 to 20. The largest of the fifth rate have two decks of cannon, the lower battery being of 18-pounders, and that of the upper deck of 9-pounders; but those of 36 and 32 guns have one complete deck of guns, mounting 12-pounders, besides the quarter-deck and fore-castle, which carry 6-pounders. The complement of a ship of 44 guns is 280 men; and that of a frigate of 36 guns, 240 men. The first has three, and the second two lieutenants; and both have two master's mates, six midshipmen, two surgeon's mates, six quarter-masters and their mates, two boatswain's mates, and one yeoman, one gunner's mate and one yeoman, with 10 or 11 quarter-gunners, and one purser's steward.\n\nFrigates of the 6th rate carry 9 pounders, those of 28 guns having 3 pounders on their quarter-deck, with 200 men for their complement; and those of 24, 160 men: the former has two lieutenants, the latter, one; and both have two master's mates, four midshipmen, one surgeon's mate, four quarter-masters and their mates, one boatswain's mate and one yeoman, one gunner's mate and one yeoman, with six or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> quarter-gunners, and one purser's steward.\n\nThe flops of war carry from 18 to 8 cannon, the largest of which have six-pounders; and the smallest, viz. those of 8 or 10 guns, four-pounders. Their officers are generally the same as in the 6th rates, with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>; and their complements of men are from 120 to 60, in proportion to their force or magnitude. N.B. Bomb-vessels are on the same establishment as sloops; but fire-ships and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> ships are on that of fifth rates.\n\nNothing more evidently manifests the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> art, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> to which it has arrived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, than the facility of managing our first rates; which were formerly esteemed incapable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, unless in the most favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.\n\nShips of the second rate, and those of the third, which have three decks, carry their tails remarkably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>, and labour very little at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. They are excellent in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, or in cannonading a fortress. Those of the third rate, which have two tiers, are fit for the line of battle, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the convoys and squadrons of ships of war in action, and in general to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the different exigencies of the naval service.\n\nThe fourth-rates may be employed on the same occasions as the third-rates, and may be also destined amongst the foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, or on expeditions of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>; since these vessels are usually excellent for keeping and sustaining the sea.\n\nVessels of the fifth rate are too weak to suffer the shock of a line of battle; but they may be destined to lead the convoys of merchant ships, to protect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> in the colonies, to cruise in different stations, to accompany squadrons, or be sent expeditiously with necessary intelligence and orders. The same may be observed of the sixth rates.\n\nThe frigates, which mount from 28 to 38 guns upon one deck, with the quarter-deck, are extremely proper for cruising against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIVATEERS\">privateers</a>, or for short expeditions, being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and usually excellent sailors.","sp":293,"ep":294},{"h":"RATIBOR","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of Germany, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, with a castle.

Therefore any quantity, as antecedent, divided by any quantity as a consequent, gives the ratio of that antecedent to the consequent.\n\nThus the ratio of A to B is $\\frac{A}{B}$, but the ratio of B to A is $\\frac{B}{A}$; and, in numbers, the ratio of 12 to 4 is $\\frac{12}{4} = 3$, or triple; but the ratio of 4 to 12 is $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3}$, or subtriple.\n\nAnd here note, that the quantities thus compared must be of the same kind; that is, such as by multiplication may be made to exceed one the other, or as these quantities are said to have a ratio between them, which, being multiplied, may be made to exceed one another.

It is the first city of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> of Swabia, and contains at present within its walls five different free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the empire; namely, the bishop, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of St Emmeran, the abbesses of the Low and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> Munich, and the city. The inhabitants of Ratibon have the privilege not to be cited before other tribunals, unless for actions above 400 florins. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> is composed of 17 members, and there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of 10, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the state.

The magistrates and officers of the city are all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>; and it is to be remarked, that although there are about 22 Catholic churches, yet there are very few Catholic citizens, the magistracy not allowing the freedom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> to be given to Catholics living there. As this city is large, elegant, and full of magnificent houses, it has been chosen many years for the place of holding the diet, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the conveniency, to many neighbouring princes and states, of sending their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> expense. The town-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, in the midst of which the diet meets, is extremely magnificent. In the year 1749, however, when there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in Germany, the diet met at Frankfort <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the Main, till after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> VII.

When he was seized for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, he was very loofely guarded; all were permitted to speak with him who pleased; and it was thought\nthought very remarkable that a Jesuit should say to him, \"Friend, take care, whatever you do, that you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">don</a>'t <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> honest people.\" He was removed next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Elperton to the Conciergerie, the proper prison of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> with which he did the murder being fastened in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it was first burnt in a slow fire; then the fleshly parts of his body were torn with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot pincers, and melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, pitch, and rosin, poured into the wounds, and through a clay funnel into his bowels by the navel. The people refused to pray for him; and when, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> pronounced upon him, he came to be dragged to pieces by four horses, one of those that were brought appearing to be but weak, one of the spectators offered his own, with which the criminal was much moved: he is said to have then made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, which was so written by the greffier Voisin, that not so much as one word of it could ever be read. He was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a>, which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFESSOR\">confessor</a> refused, unless he would reveal his accomplices; \"Give it me conditionally (said he), upon condition that I have told the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>,\" which they did. His body was so robust, that it resisted the force of the horses; and the executioner was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> obliged to cut him into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, which the people dragged through the streets. The house in which he was born was demolished, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a> erected; his father and mother were banished from Angoul\u00eame, and ordered to quit the kingdom upon pain of being hanged, if they returned, without any form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>; his brothers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>, uncles, and other relations, were commanded to lay aside the name of Ravilliac, and to assume some other. Such was the fate of this execrable monster, who, according to his own account, suffered himself to be impelled to such a fact by the sedulous sermons and books of the Jesuits, whom Henry, rather out of fear than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, had recalled and caressed, and to whom he had bequeathed his heart.\n\nNeither the dying words of Ravilliac, nor so much of his process as was published, were credited by his contemporaries. Regnat the historian says, that there were two different opinions concerning this affaision; one, that it was conducted by some grandees, who sacrificed that monarch to their old resentments; the other, that it was done by the emissaries of the Spaniards. Letters from Bruxelles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MECHLIN\">Mechlin</a>, and other places, were received before the 15th of May, with a report of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Though nothing occurs in the examinations of Ravilliac that were first published, in reference to his journey to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and other places; yet as these are set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as certain truths by good authors, so there are probable grounds to believe that they were not fictitious. It appears from Sir Ralph Winwood's Memorials, that Ravilliac had been not long before at Bruxelles. Amongst other circumstances that created a very great doubt, whether the affaision spoke truth, were the things found in his pocket at the time he was seized; amongst which was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAPLET\">chaplet</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a heart made in cotton, in the centre of which he said there was a bit of the true cross, but when cut there was none, which he affirmed was given him by a canon at Angoul\u00eame, a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> with the arms of France painted upon it, another full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and a third containing verses for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITATION\">meditation</a> of a criminal going to execution. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVOST\">provost</a> of Pluviers, or Petiviers, in Beauce, about six miles from Paris, had said openly on the day that Henry IV. was murdered, \"This day the king is either slain or dangerously wounded.\" After the king's death was known, he was seized and sent prisoner to Paris; but, before he was examined, he was found hanged in the strings of his drawers. His body was, notwithstanding, hung up by the heels on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> gibbet on the 19th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. What increased the suspicions grounded on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s end, was his having two sons Jesuits, and his being a dependent on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Monseigneur d'Entraigues.","sp":296,"ep":297},{"h":"RAY","t":"John, a celebrated naturalist, was the son of Mr Roger Ray a blacksmith, and was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Notley.\nNotly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a> in 1628.

In 1660 he published his Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nacentium, and the same year was ordained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEACON\">deacon</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>. In 1661 he accompanied Francis Willoughby, Esq., and others in search of plants and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> curiosities, in the north of England and Scotland; and the next year made a western tour from Chester, and through Wales, to Cornwall, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DORSETSHIRE\">Dorsetshire</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, Wiltshire, and other counties.

In 1672, his intimate and beloved friend Mr Willoughby died in the 37th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, at Middleton Hall, his seat in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>; \u201cto the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> and unspeakable los and grief (says Mr Ray) of myself, his friends, and all good men.\u201d There having been the closest and sincerest friendship between Mr Willoughby and Mr Ray, who were men of similar natures and tastes, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of their being fellow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGIANS\">collegians</a>, Mr Willoughby not only confided in Mr Ray, in his lifetime, but also at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>: for he made him one of the executors of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> him with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of his sons Francis and Thomas, leaving him also for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> \u00a36l. per annum.\n\nThe eldest of these young gentlemen, not being four years of age, Mr Ray, as a faithful trustee, betook himself to the instruction of them; and for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> composed his Nomenclator Claviger, which was published this very year, 1672. Francis the eldest dying before he was of age, the younger became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Middleton. Not many months after the death of Mr Willoughby, Mr Ray lost another of his best friends, Bishop Wilkins; whom he visited in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> the 18th of November 1672, and found near expiring by a total suppression of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> for eight days. As it is natural for the mind, when it is hurt in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, to seek relief from another; so Mr Ray, having lost some of his best friends, and being in a manner left destitute, conceived thoughts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>; and accordingly, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1673, did actually marry a gentlewoman of about 20 years of age, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Mr Oakley of Launton in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>. Towards the end of this year, came forth his \u201cObservations Topographical, Moral, &c.\u201d made in foreign countries; to which was added his Catalogus Stirpium in exterris regionibus observatorum; and about the same time, his Collection of unusual or local English words, which he had gathered up in his travels through the counties of England. After having published many books <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> subjects foreign to his profession, he at length resolved to publish in the character of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as in that of a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>: in which view he published his excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of the being and attributes of God, entitled The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">Wisdom</a> of God manifested in the Works of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">Creation</a>, 8vo, 1697.

Their value and excellence chiefly consisted in assigning to each member his proper employment. Among them it was that Raynal acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for literature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, and by them he was afterwards expelled, but for what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> is not certainly known, although the abb\u00e9 Barruel attributes it to impiety. Soon after this event he associated with Voltaire, D'Alembert, and Diderot, by whom it is said, he was employed to furnish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a> for the Encyclop\u00e9die; but he employed the abb\u00e9 Yvon to furnish them for him, whom Barruel allows to have been an inoffensive and upright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\n\nHis first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, which is justly regarded as an eminent performance, is entitled \u201c<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">Political</a> and Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the European Settlements in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> and West Indies.\u201d The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of this work is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>; it contains many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> reflections both of a political and philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and has been translated into every European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. We believe this performance was followed by a small tract in the year 1780, entitled \u201cThe Revolution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>,\u201d in which he pleads the cause of the colonists with much zeal, censures the conduct of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, and discovers an acquaintance with the principles of the different factions, which has induced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that he had been furnished with materials by those who knew the merits of the dispute much better than any foreigner could reasonably be supposed to do.\n\nThe French government instituted a prosecution against him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his history of the East and West Indies; but with so little severity was it conducted, that sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was allowed him to retire to the dominions of his Prussian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>, by whom he was protected, notwithstanding he had treated the character of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> with very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. Even the most despotic princes showed him much kindness, although he always animadverted on their conduct without reserve; and he lived in the good graces of the em-\nRaynal, press of Russia. At one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons shewed him a veryingular mark of respect. The speaker having been informed that Raynal was a spectator in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>, public business was instantly suspended, and the stranger was conducted to a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> situation. But when a friend of Dr Johnson's asked him respecting the same personage, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">Will</a> you give me leave, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>, to introduce to you the abbe Raynal?\" he turned on his heel, and said, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sir.\"\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> trait in Raynal's character, of which he gave no proper or accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> in his earlier writings; but when he beheld the abuse of liberty in the progress of the French Revolution, he nobly attempted to retrieve its errors. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of May 1791, he addressed to the Constituent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> the most eloquent, argumentative, and impressive, that perhaps was ever composed upon any subject whatever.

In every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of speech, and should be those expressions of countenance and gesture with which it is generally attended, we may be considered to be all interested ways in one of the two following situations: First, de-speaking, uttering our before sentiments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> circumstances which relate to ourselves or others; or, secondly, repeating something that was spoken on a certain occasion for the amusement\namusement or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of an auditor. Now, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we observe the deliveries <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to these two situations, we shall find, that the first may be accompanied with every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which can manifest itself in us, from the lowest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> to the most violent and energetic of the superior passions; while the latter, from the speaker's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> business being to repeat what he heard with accuracy, discovers only a faint <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of those signs of the emotions which we suppose agitated him from whom the words were first borrowed.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of manner is evident; and if we are attentive to these natural signs of expression, we shall find them conforming with the greatest nicety to the slightest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> movements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>.\n\nThis repetition of another's words might be supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the mouth of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; and in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, since they were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> and eye witnesses of him who first spoke them, their manner of delivery would want the advantage necessarily arising from an immediate idea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> one; hence, on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, this would be a still less lively representation than that of the first repeater. But as, from a daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of every variety of speech and its associated signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a>, mankind soon become pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> acquainted with them, and this in different degrees, according to their discernment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, &c., experience shows us that these latter repeaters (as we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> them) might conceive and use a manner of delivery which, though less characteristic perhaps, would on the whole be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> inferior to the first, as to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> natural expression proper for their situation. It appears, therefore, that repeaters of every degree may be esteemed upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a>, and that our twofold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> above contains accurately enough the whole variety of ordinary delivery\u2014i.e., we say ordinary, because\n\nThere is another very peculiar kind of delivery sometimes used in the person of a repeater, of which it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> be necessary to take some notice. What we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> here is mimicry; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> which, when perfectly and properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a>, never fails of yielding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. But since this pleasure chiefly results from the principle of imitation respecting manner, and not from the purport of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> communicated; since, comparatively speaking, it is only attainable by few persons, and practised only on particular occasions;\u2014on these accounts it must be refused a place among the modes of useful delivery taught us by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and esteemed a qualification purely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANOMALOUS\">anomalous</a>.\n\nThese distinctions with regard to a speaker's situation of mind premised, let us see to which of them an author and his reader may most properly be referred, and how they are circumstanced with regard to one another.\n\nThe matter of all books is, either what the author lays in his own person, or an acknowledged recital of the words of others; hence an author may be esteemed both an original speaker and a repeater, according as what he writes is of the first or second kind. Now a reader must be supposed either actually to personate the author, or one whose office is barely to communicate what he has said to an auditor. But in the first of these suppositions he would, in the delivery of what is the author's own, evidently commence mimic; which being, as above observed, a character not acknowledged by general nature in this department, ought to be rejected as generally improper. The other supposition therefore must be accounted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>; and then, as to the whole matter of the book, the reader is found to be exactly in the situation of a repeater, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> that he takes what he delivers from the page before him instead of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. It follows then, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of our initial proposition, that, if we are directed by nature and propriety, the manner of our delivery in reading ought to be inferior in warmth and energy to what we should use, were the language before us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> effusions of our own hearts in the circumstances of those out of whose mouths it is supposed to proceed.\n\nEvident as the purport of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> is, it has not so much as been glanced at by the writers on the subject we are now entered upon, or any of its kindred ones; which has occasioned a manifest want of accuracy in several of their rules and observations. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, this precept has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> reverberated from author to author as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> standard for propriety in reading, \"Deliver yourselves in the same manner you would do, were the matter your own original sentiments uttered directly from the heart.\" As all kinds of delivery must have many things in common, the rule will in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> be undoubtedly right; but, from what has been said above, it must be as certainly faulty in respect to several others; as it is certain nature never confounds by like signs two things so very different, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> and an original, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMANATION\">emanation</a> darted immediately from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and its weaker appearance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> reflection.\n\nThe precepts we have to offer for improving the above-mentioned rule, shall be delivered under the heads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a>, emphasis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODULATION\">modulation</a>, expression, pauses, &c.\n\nI. Accent.\u2014In attending to the affections of the Accent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> when we speak, it is easy to observe, that, independent of any other consideration, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it differs from another, in stress, energy, or force of utterance. In words we find one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> differing from another with respect to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>; and in sentences one or more words as frequently vary from the rest in a similar manner. This stress with regard to syllables is called accent, and contributes greatly to the variety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of language. Reflecting words, it is termed emphasis; and its chief office is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIX\">affix</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, force, or perspicuity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>\u2014of which more under the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\n\n\"Accent (as described in the Lectures on Elocution) is made by us two ways; either by dwelling longer upon one syllable than the rest, or by giving it a smarter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERCUSSION\">percussion</a> of the voice in utterance. Of the first of these we have instances in the words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, father, holy; of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, borrow. So that accent with us is not referred to tune, but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; to the more equable or precipitate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the voice, not to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the notes or inflexions.\"\n\nIn theatric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>, in order to give it more pomp and solemnity, it is usual to dwell longer than common upon the unaccented syllables; and the author now quoted has endeavoured to prove (p. 51, 54.) the practice faulty, and to show (p. 55.) that \"though it (i.e., true solemnity) may demand a slower utterance than usual, yet (it) requires that the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> in point\nof quantity be observed in the syllables, as there is in musical notes when the same tune is played in quicker or slower time.\" But that this deviation from ordinary speech is not a fault, as our author affirms; nay, that on the contrary it is a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> when kept under proper regulation, the following observations it is hoped will sufficiently prove.\n\n(I.) It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the most obvious nature, that those things which on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to their proper senses have a power of raising in us certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and emotions, are ever differently modified in their constituent parts when different effects are produced in the mind: and also (II.) that, within proper bounds, were we to suppose these constituent parts to be proportionally increased or diminished as to quantity, this effect would still be the same as to quality.\u2014For instance: The different ideas of strength, swiftness, &c., which are raised in us by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of animals, is owing to the different form of their corresponding parts; the different effects of music on the passions, to the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRS\">airs</a> and movements of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a>; and the different expressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> speech, to a difference in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a>, speed, &c., of the voice. And these peculiar effects would still remain the same, were we to suppose the animals above alluded to, to be greater or lesser, within their proper bounds; the movement of the music quicker or slower, provided it did not palpably interfere with that of some other species; and the pitch of the voice higher or lower, if not carried out of the limits in which it is observed on similar occasions naturally to move. Further (III.) since, respecting the emotions more especially, there are no rules to determine a priori what effect any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> or modification of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> will have upon a percipient, our knowledge of this kind must evidently be gained from experience. Lastly, (IV.) In every art imitating nature we are pleased to see the characteristic members of the pattern heightened a little farther than perhaps it ever was carried in any real example, provided it be not bordering upon some ludicrous and disagreeable provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>.\n\nNow for the application of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a>.\u2014To keep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> and be consistent with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the tragic muse, the delivery of her language should necessarily be dignified; and this it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> from observation (I.) cannot be accomplished otherwise than by something different in the manner of it from that of ordinary speech; since dignity is essentially different from familiarity. But how must we discover this different manner? By attending to nature: and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> she tells us, that besides using a slower delivery, and greater distinctness of the words (which every thing merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> requires, and gravity is a concomitant of dignity, though not its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a>), we must dwell a little longer upon the unaccented syllables than we do in common. As to what our author observes in the above quotation, of dignity's only requiring a slower utterance than ordinary, while the proportion of the syllables as to quantity continues the same; it is apprehended the remark (II.) respecting quickness and slowness of movement will show it to be not altogether true. For since the delivery is not altered in form, its expression must be full of the same kind, and perhaps what may be rightly suggested by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> grovelling familiar.\n\nBut something farther may be yet said in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> delivery, as our author calls it. Is not the movement of any thing, of whatever species, when Reading: dignified or solemn, in general of an equable and deliberate nature (as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUET\">minuet</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> step, &c.)? And in theatrical declamation, is not the propensity to introduce this equability too strong, that it is almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to avoid it wholly, were we ever so determined to do it? If these two queries be answered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATIVE\">affirmative</a> (as we are persuaded they will), while the first supports our argument for the propriety of the manner of delivery in question, the second discovers a kind of necessity for it. And that this manner may be carried a little farther in quantity on the stage than is usual in real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, the principle (IV.) of heightening nature will justify, provided fashion (which has ever something to do in these articles) give it a sanction; for the precise quantity of several heightenings may be varied by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> almost at will.\n\nII. Emphasis.\u2014As emphasis is not a thing annexed to particular words, as accent is to syllables, but owes its rise chiefly to the meaning of a passage, and must therefore vary its seat according as that meaning varies, it will be necessary to explain a little farther the general idea given of it above.\n\nOf <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s first disobedience, and the fruit Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> Brought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> into the world, and all our woe, &c. Sing heav'nly muse, &c.\n\nSupposing, in reference to the above well-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, that originally other beings, besides men, had disobeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circumstance were well known to us, there would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> an emphasis upon the word man's in the first line, and hence it would be read thus;\n\nOf man's first disobedience, and the fruit, &c.\n\nBut if it were a notorious truth, that mankind had transgressed in a peculiar manner more than once, the emphasis would fall on first, and the line be read,\n\nOf man's first disobedience, &c.\n\nAgain, admitting death (as was really the case) to have been an unheard of and dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> brought upon man in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his transgression; on that supposition the third line would be read,\n\nBrought death into the world, &c.\n\nBut if we were to suppose mankind knew there was such an evil as death in other regions, though the place they inhabited had been free from it till their transgression; the line would read thus,\n\nBrought death into the world, &c.\n\nNow from a proper delivery of the above lines, with regard to any one of the suppositions we have chosen, out of several others that might in the same manner have been imagined, it will appear that the emphasis they illustrate is effected by a manifest delay in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a>, and a tone something fuller and louder than is used in ordinary; and that its office is solely to determine the meaning of a sentence with reference to something said before, presupposed by the author as general knowledge, or in order to remove an ambiguity where a passage is capable of having more senses given it than one.\n\nBut,\nBut, supposing in the above example, that none of the senses there pointed out were precisely the true one, and that the meaning of the lines were no other than what is obviously suggested by their simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; in that case it may be asked, if in reading them there should be no word dignified with the emphatic accompaniments above described?\u2014The answer is, Not one with an emphasis of the same kind as that we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> been illustrating; yet it is nevertheless true, that on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> these lines well read, we shall find some words distinguished from the rest by a manner of delivery bordering a little upon it (A). And these words will in general be such as seem the most important in the sentence, or on other accounts to merit this distinction. But as at best it only enforces, graces, or enlivens, and not fixes the meaning of any passage, and even caprice and fashion (B) have often a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> in determining its place and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, it cannot properly be reckoned an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> of delivery. However, it is of too much moment to be neglected by those who would wish to be good readers; and, for the sake of distinction, we may not unaptly denominate both the kinds of energies in question, by the terms emphasis of sense, and emphasis of force (C).\n\nNow from the above account of these two species of emphasis it will appear, \u201cthat in reading, as in speaking, the first of them must be determined entirely by the sense of the passage, and always made alike: But as to the other, taste alone seems to have a right of fixing its situation and quantity.\u201d\u2014Farther: Since the more essential of these two energies is solely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of nature (as appears by its being constantly found in the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of people of all kinds of capacities and degrees of knowledge), and the most ignorant person never fails of using it rightly in the effusions of his own heart, it happens very luckily, and ought always to be remembered, that provided we understand what we read, and give way to the dictates of our own feeling, the emphasis of sense can scarce ever avoid falling spontaneously upon its proper place.\n\nHere it will be necessary to say something by way of reply to a question which will naturally occur to the mind of every one. As the rule for the emphasis of sense requires we should understand what we read before it can be properly used, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> upon us never to attempt to read what we have not previously studied for that purpose? In answer to this, it must be observed, that though such a step will not be without its advantages; yet, as from the fairness of printed types, the well-known pauses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNCTUATION\">punctuation</a>, and a long acquaintance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASEOLOGY\">phraseology</a> and construction of our language, &c., experience tells us it is possible to comprehend the sense at the first reading, a previous perusal of what is to be read does not seem necessary to all; though, if they would wish to appear to advantage, it may be expedient to many; and it is this circumstance which makes us venture upon extemporary reading, and give it a place among our amusements.\u2014Similar remarks might be made with regard to modulation, expression, &c. did not what is here observed naturally anticipate them.\n\nIII. Modulation (D.) Every person must have observed, that\n\n(A) The following lines will illustrate both these kinds of stresses: For, to convey their right meaning, the word ANY is evidently to be pronounced louder and fuller than those with the accents over them.\n\nGet wealth and place, if possible with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>;\nIf not, by ANY means get wealth and place.\u2014POPE.\n\nThis couplet is accented in the manner we find it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Elocution by Mason. And if, according to the judgement of this author, the words thus distinguished are to have an emphatical stress, it must be of the inferior kind above-mentioned, and which a little farther on we call emphasis of force; while the word ANY in a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYPE\">type</a> alone possesses the other sort of energy, and which is there contradistinguished by the term emphasis of sense.\n\n(B) Among a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people who have had proper opportunities of learning to read in the best manner it is now taught, it would be difficult to find two, who, in a given instance, would use the emphasis of force alike, either as to place or quantity. Nay some scarcely use any at all; and others will not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to carry it much beyond anything we have a precedent for in common discourse; and even now and then throw it upon words so very trifling in themselves, that it is evident they do it with no other view, than for the sake of the variety it gives to the modulation.\u2014This practice, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a> of discords into music, may without doubt be indulged now and then; but were it too frequent, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> of these energies would manifestly either be destroyed or rendered dubious.\n\n(C) The first of these terms answers to the simple emphasis described in the Lectures on Elocution, and the second nearly to what is there called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a>. The difference lies in this. Under complex emphasis the author seems (for he is far from being clear in this article) to include the tones simply considered of all the emotions of the mind; as well the tender and languid, as the forcible and exciting. Our term is intended to be confined to such modes of expression alone as are marked with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> stress or increase of the voice.\n\n(D) The author of the Introduction to the Art of Reading, not allowing that there is any variation of tone, as to high and low, in the delivery of a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> or sentence, places modulation solely in the diversification of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> and the variety of syllables, as to long or short, swift or slow, strong or weak, and loud or soft. As we are of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, our idea of modulation is confined purely to harmonious inflections of voice. These qualities of words, it is true, add greatly both to the force and beauty of delivery; yet, since some of them are fixed and not arbitrary (as long and short), and the others (of swift and slow, strong and weak, loud and soft) may be considered as modes of expression which do not affect the modulation as to tone, it will agree best with our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> to esteem\nved, that, in speaking, the voice is subject to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, which in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> resembles the movement of a tune. These sounds, however, are evidently nothing like so much varied as those that are strictly musical; and we have attempted to show in the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, that, besides this, they have an essential difference in themselves. Nevertheless, from the general similitude of these two articles, they possess several terms in common; and the particular we have now to examine is in both of them called modulation.\n\nThis affection of the voice, being totally arbitrary, is differently characterized in different parts of the world; and, through the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, every place is inclined to think their own the only one natural and agreeable, and the rest affected with some barbarous twang or ungainly variation (E). It may be observed, however, that though there is a general uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> or fashion of modulation peculiar to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, yet it by no means follows that there is or can be anything fixed in its application to particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>; and therefore we find different people will, in any given instance, use modulations something different, and nevertheless be each of them equally agreeable.\n\nBut, quitting these general remarks, we shall (as our purpose requires it) consider the properties of modulation a little more minutely.\n\nFirst, then, we may observe, that, in speaking, there is a particular sound (or key-note, as it is often called) in which the modulation for the most part runs, and to which its occasional inflexions, either above or below, may in some respects be conceived to have a reference, like that which common music has to its key-note. Yet there is this difference between the two kinds of modulation, that whereas the first always concludes in the key-note, the other frequently concludes a little below it (F). This key-note, in speaking, is generally the sound given at the outset of every complete sentence or period; and it may be observed on some occasions to vary its pitch through the limits of a musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of a considerable magnitude. The tones, that fall a little lower than the key at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of a sentence or period, are called cadences. These cadences, if we are accurate in our distinctions, will, with respect to their offices, be found of two kinds; though they meet so frequently together, that it may be best to conceive them only as answering a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> purpose. One of these offices is to affix the sense, and the other to decorate the modulation. An account of the first may be seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> on Pauses; and the latter will be found to show itself pretty frequently in every thing grave and plaintive, or in poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> and other highly ornamented language, where the mind is by its influence brought to feel a placid kind of dignity and satisfaction. These two cadences, therefore, may be conveniently distinguished by applying to them respectively the epithets significant and ornamental.\n\nWe have already observed, that reading should in some things differ from speaking; and the particular under consideration seems to be one which ought to vary a little in these arts. For,\n\nModulation in reading serves a twofold purpose. At the same time that it gives pleasure to the ear on the principles of harmony, it contributes through that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> to preserve the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. And since written language (when not purely dramatical) is in general more elegant in its construction, and musical in its periods, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> one; and since many interesting particulars are wanting in reading, which are present in speaking, that contribute greatly to fix the regard of the hearer; it seems reasonable, in order to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to the language, and in part to supply the incitements of attention just alluded to, that in the former of these two articles a modulation should be used something more harmonious and artificial than in the latter. Agreeably to this reasoning, it is believed, we shall find every reader, on a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, adopt more or less a modulation thus ornamented: though, after all, it must be acknowledged there are better grounds to believe, that\n\nesteeem these properties as respectively belonging to the established laws of pronunciation and the imitative branch of expression mentioned in the end of the ensuing head.\n\n(E) From what accounts we have remaining of the modulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, it appears to have been highly ornamented, and apparently something not unlike our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> recitative; particularly that of their theoric declamation was music in its strictest sense, and accompanied with instruments. In the course of time and the progress of refinement, this modulation became gradually more and more simple, till it has now lost the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of music, and is entirely regulated by taste. At home here, every one has heard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SONG\">song</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANT\">cant</a>, as it is called, of\n\nTi ti dum dum, ti ti dum ti dum de,\nTi dum ti dum, ti dum ti dum dum de;\n\nwhich, though disagreeable now to all but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> rustics on account of its being out of fashion, was very probably the favourite modulation in which heroic verses were recited by our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. So fluctuating are the taste and practices of mankind! But whether the power of language over the passions has received any advantage from the change just mentioned, will appear at least very doubtful, when we recollect the stories of its former triumphs, and the inherent charms of musical sounds.\n\n(F) As musical sounds have always an harmonical reference to a key or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> note, and to which the mind is still secretly attending, no piece of music would appear perfect, that did not close in it, and so naturally put an end to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. But as the tones used in speech are not musical, and therefore cannot refer harmonically to any other sound, there can be no necessity that this terminating sound (and which we immediately below term the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADENCE\">cadence</a>) should either be used at all, or follow any particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> as to form, &c., farther than what is imposed by taste and custom.\nthe practice has hitherto directed intuitively by nature, than that it was discovered by the inductions of reason. We shall conclude this head with a rule for modulation in reading. \"In every thing dramatic, colloquial, or of simple narrative, let your modulation be the same as in speaking; but when the subject is flowery, solemn, or dignified, add something to its harmony, diversify the key-note, and increase the frequency of cadences in proportion to the merit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.\"\n\nIt will readily be seen, that the precepts here drawn from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> between speaking and reading, would be very inadequate, were they left destitute of the affluence of taste, and the opportunity of frequently hearing and imitating masterly readers. And indeed, to these two great auxiliaries we might very properly have referred the whole matter at once, as capable of giving sufficient directions, had we not remembered that our plan required us to found several of our rules as much on the principles of a philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, as on those more familiar ones which will be found of greater efficacy in real practice.\n\nIV. Expression. 1. There is no composition in music, however perfect as to key and melody, but, in order to do justice to the subject and ideas of the author, will require, in the performing, something more than an exact adherence to tune and time. This something is of a nature, too, which perhaps can never be adequately pointed out by any thing graphic, and results entirely from the taste and feeling of the performer. It is that which chiefly gives music its power over the passions, and characterizes its notes with what we mean by the words sweet, harsh, dull, lively, plaintive, joyous, &c. for it is evident every sound, considered abstractedly, without any regard to the movement, or high and low, may be thus modified. In practical music, this commanding particular is called Expression; and as we find certain tones analogous to it frequently coalescing with the modulation of the voice, which indicate our passions and affections (thereby more particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out the meaning of what we say) the term is usually applied in the same sense to speaking and reading.\n\nThese tones are not altogether peculiar to man.\u2014Every animal, that is not dumb, has a power of making several of them. And from their being able, unassisted by words, to manifest and raise their kindred emotions, they constitute a kind of language of themselves. In this language of the heart man is eminently conversant; for we not only understand it in one another, but also in many of the inferior creatures subjected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\n\nThe expression here illustrated is one of the most essential articles in good reading, since it not only gives a finishing to the sense, but, on the principles of sympathy and antipathy, has also a peculiar efficacy in interesting the heart. It is likewise an article of most difficult attainment; as it appears from what follow, that a masterly reader ought not only to be able to incorporate it with the modulation properly as to quality, but in any degree as to quantity.\n\nEvery thing written being a proper imitation of speech, expressive reading must occasionally partake of all its tones. But from what was said above, of the difference between reading and speaking, it follows, Reading, that these signs of the emotions should be less strongly characterized in the former article than in the latter. Again, as several of these tones of expression are in themselves agreeable to the mind, and raise in us agreeable emotions (as those of pity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, or whatever indicates <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> and goodness of heart), and others disagreeable (as those of a boisterous, malevolent, and depraved nature, &c.) it farther appears, since reading is an art improving and not imitating nature, that, in whatever degree we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> the expressions of the tones above alluded to in the first case, it would be eligible to make a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABATEMENT\">abatement</a> in the latter. But as to the quantities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> magnitudes of these abatements, they, like many other particulars of the same nature, must be left solely to the taste and judgment of the reader.\n\nTo add one more remark, which may be of service on more accounts than in suggesting another reason for the doctrine above. Let it be remembered, that though in order to acquire himself agreeably in this article of expression, it will be necessary every reader should feel his subject as well as understand it; yet, that he may preserve a proper ease and matterliness of delivery, it is also necessary he should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against discovering too much emotion and perturbation.\n\nFrom this reasoning we deduce the following rule, for the tones which indicate the passions and emotions.\n\n\"In reading, let all your tones of expression be borrowed from those of common speech, but something more faintly characterized. Let those tones which signify any disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of the mind, be still more faint than those which indicate their contrary; and preserve yourself so far from being affected with the subject, as to be able to proceed through it with that peculiar kind of ease and matterliness, which has its charms in this as well as every other art.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this section with the following observation, which relates to speaking as well as reading. When words fall in our way, whose \"sounds seem an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECHO\">echo</a> to the sense,\" as squirr, buzz, hum, rattle, lift, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAR\">jar</a>, &c., we ought not to pronounce them in such a manner as to heighten the imitation, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and ludicrous subjects. For instance, they should not in any other case be sounded squir-r-r\u2014buzz-z-z\u2014hum-m-m\u2014r-r-rattle, &c. On the contrary, when the imitation lies in the movement, or flow and structure of a whole passage (which frequently happens in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>), the delivery may always be allowed to give a heightening to it with the greatest propriety; as in the following instances, out of a number more which every experienced reader will quickly recollect.\n\nIn these deep solitudes and awful cells,\nWhere heav'nly pensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">Contemplation</a> dwells,\nAnd ever-musing Melancholy reigns\u2014\n\nPope's Eloisa to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABELARD\">Abelard</a>.\n\nWith easy course\nThe vessels glide unless their speed be stopp'd\nBy dead calms, that oft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on these smooth seas.\n\nDyer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">Fleece</a>.\n\nSofly sweet in Lydian measure,\nSoon he footh'd her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> to pleasure.\n\nDryden's Ode on St Cecilia's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\nStill gathering force it smokes, and, urg\u2019d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMAIN\">amain</a>,\nWhirls, leaps, and thunders <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> impetuous to the plain.\n\nPOPE\u2019s Iliad, b. 13.\n\nFor who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\nThis pleasing anxious being ere resign\u2019d,\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\nNor cast one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGING\">longing</a> ling\u2019ring look behind?\n\nGRAY\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGY\">Elegy</a>.\n\n2. Besides the particular tones and modifications of voice above described, which always accompany and express our inward agitations, nature has in these cases endowed us with another language, which, instead of the ear, addresses itself to the eye, thereby giving the communications of the heart a double advantage over those of the understanding, and us a double chance to preserve so ineffinable a blessing. This language is what arises from the different, almost involuntary, movements and configurations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> and body in our emotions and passions, and which, like that of tones, every one is formed to understand by a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTUITION\">intuition</a>.\n\nWhen men are in any violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of mind, this co-operating expression (as it is called) of face and gesture is very strongly marked, and totally free from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of anything which has a regard to gracefulness, or what appearance they may make in the eyes of others. But in ordinary conversation, and where the emotions are not so warm, fashionable people are perpetually infusing into their countenance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, whatever they imagine will add to the ease and elegance of their deportment, or impress on the spectator an idea of their amiableness and breeding. Now, though the above mentioned natural ornamental signs of the emotions should accompany everything spoken, yet from what was observed in the introductory part of this article (like the tones we have just treated upon), they should in reading be much less strongly expressed, and those suffer the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> that are in themselves the most ungainly. And as it was in the last section recommended to the reader to preserve himself as far from being affected in all passionate subjects as to be able to keep a temperate command over the various affections of the voice, &c. so under the sanction of this subordinate feeling he may accompany his delivery more frequently with any easy action or change of face, which will contribute to set off his manner, and make it agreeable on the principles of art.\n\nAs these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> decorations of action (as we may call them) are not altogether natural, but have their rise from a kind of intuition, they must be modelled by the practices of the polite. And though mankind differ from one another scarce more in any particular than in that of talents for adopting the graceful actions of the body, and hence nothing determinate can be said of their nature and frequency, yet even those, most happily calculated to acquit themselves well in their use, might profit by considering that it is better greatly to abridge the display, than to over-do it ever so little. For the peculiar modelly of deportment with which the inhabitants of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> are endowed, makes us in common endeavour to suppress many signs of an agitated mind; and in such cases the bodily ones in particular are very sparingly used. We have also a natural and rooted dislike to any kind of affectation; and to no species, that we can recollect, a greater, than to that which is seen in a person who pretends to ministry and courtly gesture, without possessing the advantages and talents they require; and of which not many people, comparatively speaking, have any remarkable share.\n\nThe inference of this is too obvious to need <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> out, and we would particularly recommend it to the consideration of those readers who think the common occurrences of a newspaper, &c. cannot be properly delivered without a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELBOW\">elbow</a>-room.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to come to particulars in any directions of this kind, yet there is one article of our present subject on which a serviceable remark may be made. In ordinary discourse, when we are particularly preying and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> in what we say, the eye is naturally thrown upon those to whom we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> ourselves; and in reading, a turn of this organ now and then upon the hearers, when anything very remarkable or interesting falls in the way, has a good effect in gaining it a proper attention, &c. But this should not be too frequently used; for if so, besides its having a tendency to confound the natural importance of different passages, it may not be altogether agreeable to some to have their own reflections broken in upon by a signal, which might be interpreted to hint at their wanting regulation.\n\nOne observation more, and then we shall attempt to recapitulate the substance of this section in the form of a precept. Though it is, when strictly examined, insufficient, both in speaking and reading, to imitate with action what we are describing, yet as in anything comic such a practice may suggest ideas that will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with those of the subject, it may there be now and then indulged in either of these articles.\n\n\"In a manner similar to that directed with regard to tones, moderate your bodily expressions of the signs of the emotions. And in order to supply, as it were, this deficiency, introduce into your carriage such an easy gracefulness, as may be consistent with your acquirements in these particulars, and the necessary dread which should ever be present of falling into any kind of affectation or grimace.\"\n\nV. Pauses. Speech consisting of a succession of distinct words, must naturally be liable (both from a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, and a difficulty there may be in beginning certain sounds or portions of phrases immediately on the ending of certain others) to several small intermissions of voice; of which, as they can have no meaning, nothing farther need here be said. There are, however, some pauses, which the sense necessarily demands; and to these the substance of this section is directed.\n\nThe pauses are in part to distinguish the members of sentences from one another, the terminations of complete periods, and to afford an opportunity for taking breath. Besides this, they have a very grateful effect in the modulation, on the same account they are so essential in music.\u2014In both articles, like blank spaces in pictures, they set off and render more conspicuous whatsoever they disjoin or terminate.\n\nWere language made up of nothing but short colloquial sentences, these pauses, though they might do no harm, and would generally be graceful, would however be superfluous as to use by the completeness and narrowness,\nReading, rownefs, as we may fay, of the meaning. But in more\ndifficult language, composed of several detached sen-\ntences, and which require some degree of attention in\norder to take in the sentence, the intermissions of voice\nunder consideration are of the greatest service, by fig-\nuring to the mind the progress and completion of the\nwhole passage. Now, though in extensive and dif-\nferently formed periods there may be members whose\ncompleteness of sentence might be conceived of various de-\ngrees, and hence might seem to require a set of pauses\nequally numerous; yet, since the sentence does not alto-\ngether depend upon these intermissions, and their ra-\ntios to one another, if capable of being properly de-\nfined, could not be accurately observed, grammarians\nhave ventured to conceive the whole clas of pauses as\nreducible to the four or five kinds now in use, and\nwhose marks and ratios are well known (c); presum-\ning that under the eye of taste, and with the affil-\niace of a particular to be next mentioned, they would\nnot fail in all cases to suggest intermissions of voice\nsuitable to the sentence. But in many of these extensive\nand complex periods, rounded with a kind of redun-\ndancy of matter, where the full sentence is long suspended,\nand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> words are not very important, there would\nbe some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> of a misapprehension of the termina-\ntion, had we not more evident and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> notice of\nit than that which is given by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>. This notice\nis the cadence, referred to in the section on Modulation;\nwhich, as is there observed, besides the ornamental\nvariety it affords, appears from these remarks to be a\nvery necessary and serviceable article in perspicuous de-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVERY\">livery</a>.\n\nAs this cadence naturally accompanies the end of\nevery entire sentence, circumstanced as above-mentioned,\nit may sometimes fall before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICOLON\">semicolon</a>, but more\ngenerally before the colon, as well as the period: For\nthese marks are often found to terminate a complete\nsentence; and in these cases, the relation what follows has\nto what went before, is signified to the mind by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\nlative shortness of the stop, and the form of introduc-\ning the additional matter. Nor can any bad conse-\nquence arise from thus founding distinctions on ratios\nof time, which it may be said are too nice to be often\nrightly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> upon: for if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> should happen be-\ntween that of the colon and period, there is perhaps so\ntrifling a difference between the nature of the passages\nthey succeed, as to make a small inaccuracy of no con-\nsequence. And as to the rests of the semicolon and\nperiod, it will not be easy to mistake about them, as\ntheir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> is that of two to one. Add to this the\npower which the matter and introduction of the sub-\nsequent passages have to rectify any slight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> here\nmade, and we shall be fully satisfied, that the pauses\nas usually explained, with the cadence above described,\nand a proper knowledge of the language, will convey\nsufficient information to the understanding of the con-\nstructive nature of the passages after which they are\nfound.\n\nIt may be observed, that in natural speech, accord-\ning to the warmth and agitation of the speaker, the rests\nare often short and injudiciously proportioned, and hence\nthat every thing thus delivered cannot be so graceful as it\nmight have been from a proper attention to their mag-\nnitude and effects.\n\nPauses then, though chiefly subjected to the sentence\nare, as was remarked at the outset, serviceable in\nbeautifying the modulation, &c. And since books\nare often inaccurately printed as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, and peo-\nple's tastes differ some little about their place and va-\nlue, it appears, that, \"although in reading great atten-\ntion should be paid to the stops, yet a greater\nshould be given to the sentence, and their correspondent\ntimes occasionally lengthened beyond what is usual in\ncommon speech;\" which observation contains all that\nwe shall pretend to lay down by way of rule for the\nmanagement of pauses in the delivery of written lan-\nguage.\n\nAs there are two or three species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, which\nhave something singular in them, and with regard\nto the manner in which they should be read, a\nfew particular remarks seem necessarily required, we\nshall conclude this article with laying them before the\nreader:\n\n1. Of Plays, and such like conversation-pieces.\nWritings of this kind may be considered as intended for\ntwo different purposes; one to unfold subject matter for\nthe exercise of dramatic powers; and the other to convey\namusement, merely as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> replete with pleasing inci-\ndents and characteristic manners. Hence there appears\nto be great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> for the display of a consistent delivery\nof these performances: for while, on one hand, a good\nreader of very inferior talents for mimicry may be heard\nwith a tolerable degree of pleasure; on the other, if any\nperson is qualified to give a higher degree of life and\nforce to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> by delivering them\nas an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a>, he must be fully at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to start from the\nconfinement of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> to a posture and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>-\ned to his abilities; and, if he be not deceived in himself,\nhis hearers will be considerable gainers by the change.\u2014\nThe next article is,\n\n2. Sermons or other orations, which in like man-\nner may be conceived intended for a double purpose.\nFirst, as matter for the display of oratorical powers;\nand, secondly, as persuasive discourses, &c. which may\n\n(c) Supposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMA\">comma</a> (,) one time, the semicolon (;) will be two; the colon (: ) three, and the period (. ) as also the marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERROGATION\">interrogation</a> (?) and admiration (!) four of these times. The blank line (\u2014 or ---), and\nthe breaks between paragraphs, intimate still greater times; and by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> may be reckoned a double\nand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> period respectively. Now and then these blank lines are placed immediately after the ordinary\npoints, and then they are conceived only as separating for the eye the different natures of the matter\u2014as a\nquestion from an answer,\u2014precept from example,\u2014premises from inferences, &c., in which case their import is\nevident. But of late some authors have not scrupled to confound these distinctions; and to make a blank serve\nfor all the pauses universally, or the mark of an indefinite rest, the quantity of which is left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>\nof the reader's taste. A practice, it is imagined, too destructive of the intended precision of these typical notices\nto be much longer adopted.\nbe read like any other book. Therefore it appears (for reasons similar to those above) that according as clergymen are possessed of the talents of elocution, they may consistently either rehearse their sermons, in the manner of an extemporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a>, or deliver them in the more humble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of one who is content to entertain and instruct his hearers with reading to them his own or some other person's written discourse.\n\nThat either of these manners of delivery (or a mixture of them), in either of the cases above-mentioned, is agreeable, we find on a careful examination. For this will show us how frequently they run into one another; and that we are so far from thinking such transitions wrong, that, without a particular attention that way, we scarce ever perceive them at all.\n\n3. Poetry is the next and last object of our present remarks. This is a very peculiar kind of writing, and as much different from the language of ordinary discourse as the movements of the dance are from common walking. To ornament and improve whatever is subservient to the pleasures and amusements of life, is the delight of human nature. We are also pleased with a kind of excess in anything which has a power to amuse the fancy, inspire us with enthusiasm, or awaken the soul to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of its own importance and dignity. Hence one pleasure, at least, takes its rise, that we feel in contemplating the performances of every art; and hence the language of poetry, consisting of a measured rhythm, harmonious cadences, and an elevated picturesque diction, has been studied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, and found to have a powerful influence over the human breast in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and region. There is such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between this language and music, that they were in the earlier ages never separated; and though modern refinement has in a great measure destroyed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>, yet it is with some degree of difficulty in rehearsing these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> compositions we can forget the ringing of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>.\n\nFrom these considerations (and some kindred ones mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. iii.) in repeating verses, they are generally accompanied with a modulation rather more ornamented and musical than is used in any other kind of writing. And accordingly, as there seems to be the greatest propriety in the practice, the rule for this particular in the section just referred to, will allow any latitude in it that can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the sanction of taste and pleasure.\n\nRhymes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> and more soothing provinces of poetry are found to have a good effect; and hence (for reasons like those just suggested) it is certainly absurd to endeavour to smother them by a feeble pronunciation, and running one line precipitately into another, as is often affected to be done by many of our modern readers and speakers. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> they not only destroy one source of pleasure intended by the composer (which though not great is nevertheless genuine), but even often supply its place with what is really disagreeable, by making the rhymes, as they are interruptedly perceived, appear accidental blemishes of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, arising from an unmeaning recurrence of similar sounds. With regard then to reading verses terminated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHYME\">rhyme</a>, the common rule, which directs to pronounce the final words full, and to distinguish them by a slight pause even where there is none required by the sense, seems the most rational, and consequently most worthy, of being followed. See Declamation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">Narration</a>, and Oratory.\n\nReading, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a> in England, pleasantly seated on the river Kennet, near its confluence with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>. It had once a fine rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a>, of which there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> ruins remaining. It had also a castle built by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Henry I. but it was afterwards levelled with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>. It is a corporation, enjoys several privileges, and sends two members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. The two navigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> render it a fit place for trade. W. Long. i. c. N. Lat. 51\u00b0 25'.\n\nReadings, or Various Readings, in criticism, are the different manners of reading the texts of authors in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a>, where a diversity has arisen from the corruption of time, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of copyists. A great part of the business of critics lies in settling the readings by confronting the various readings of the several manuscripts, and considering the agreement of the words and sense.\n\nReadings are also used for a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> or gloss on a law, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>, passage, or the like, to show the sense an author takes it in, and the application he conceives to be made of it.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE_AGGRAVATION\">Re-aggravation</a>, in the Romish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> law, the last monitory, published after three admonitions, and before the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>. Before they proceed to fulminate the last excommunication, they publish an aggravation, and a re-aggravation. Fevret observes, that in France the minister is not allowed to come to re-aggravation, without the permission of the bishop or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OFFICIAL\">official</a>, as well as that of the lay judge. See Excommunication.\n\nReal, C\u00e9sar Vichard de St., a polite French writer, son of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> of Chambery in Savoy. He came young to France, distinguished himself at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by several ingenious productions, and resided there a long time without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> or dignity, intent upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> pursuits. He died at Chambery in 1692, advanced in years, though not in circumstances. He was a man of great parts and penetration, a lover of the sciences, and particularly fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. A complete edition of his works was printed at Paris, in 3 vols 4to, 1745, and another in 6 vols 12mo.\n\nReal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">Presence</a>.

Under the Realists are included the Scotists, Thomists, and all excepting the followers of Ocham. Their distinguishing tenet is, that universals are realities, and have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> out of an idea or imagination; or, as they express it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, a parte rei; whereas the nominalists contend, that they exist only in the mind, and are only ideas, or manners of conceiving things.\u2014Dr. Odo, or Oudard, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of St. Martin de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAY\">Tournay</a>, was the chief of the sect of the realists.

After having finished his early studies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his birth, he began a course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POITIERS\">Poitiers</a>, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a> at Reaumur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURGES\">Bourges</a>; but soon relinquished the latter, to apply himself, according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, physics, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>.

His experiments on the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> obtained him a pension of 12,000 livres; and this reward was to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to the Academy to support the expense which might accrue in this art.\n\nHe continued his inquiries on the art of making tin and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> \u2020, and endeavoured to render our thermometers more useful than those of former times; he composed a curious history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> dust is found in France; and gave so simple and easy a detail of the art of gathering this dust, that persons have been employed for that purpose.\n\nHe also made curious and important observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of flints, on the banks of fossil shells, from whence is obtained in Touraine an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; as likewise on birds and their preservation, on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> nests; on insects; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of other subjects, not less curious than useful.\n\nHe imagined at first, that a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> would keep eggs fresh; but the waste of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, &c. showed him the inconveniences of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. He afterwards adopted the method practised for time immemorial in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHIPELAGO\">Archipelago</a>, which is to steep or immerse eggs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, or melted fat; by this means, not being exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> preserved, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>. Another experiment still more important, made by our author, was to introduce into France the art of hatching fowls and birds, as practised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, without covering the eggs. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">Active</a>, industrious, and attentive, he was early in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, often at six in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. Exact in his experiments and observations, he let no circumstance escape him. His writings must be of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> philosophers. In society, he was distinguished through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> for his modest and agreeable behaviour. His probity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, goodness of heart, and other amiable qualities, as well natural as acquired, endeared him to his countrymen. He died in the 76th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, on the 18th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1757, and left this world filled with sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, which happened at the castle of Barnardiere on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a>, where he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> his vacation. He bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences his\nReaumur his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> and all his natural productions. His works are, 1. A very great number of memoirs and observations on different parts of natural history; they are printed in the collections of the Academy of Sciences. 2. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> printed separately in 6 vols in 4to, intitled, A Natural History of Insects. This important work contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of vast numbers of caterpillers, moths, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a> insects, flies with two and four wings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> birds, and those ephemeron flies which live only in that form a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; and lastly, of those singular and wonderful insects which are called polyptes, which being cut into several pieces, each piece lives, grows, and becomes an insect, and affords to our eyes a great number of prodigies*. The works of M. de Reaumur are exact, curious, interesting, and very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>. They are written with much candour, clearness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>; but it must be acknowledged his manner is somewhat too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a>. But we must not deceive the reader; he often raises our expectations, and does not give us all the satisfaction we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> ourselves from his writings. His method of raising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, in particular, rather disappoints us. He spared neither care, time, nor expense, to render it practicable: he flattered himself and his countrymen with the greatest hopes; but notwithstanding his assiduous industry, and vast charges, it proved abortive. The late M. l'Advocat recommended him to obtain better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> from Egypt on the subject; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> possible to procure a person versed in the art to instruct him in it; but his death prevented the completion of the scheme. If the native of Egypt had arrived, showed M. de Reaumur a better method than his own, and practised it with success, as in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> would have been benefited; on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> he would have seen, had it failed, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of France was not proper for such experiments. M. Maillet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, to whom Monsieur the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> had written to obtain the art, offered to send over a native of Egypt, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> would pay the expense of his voyage, and allow him a pension of 1500 livres. M. Maillet rightly judged, when he preferred this method of proceeding. M. de Reaumur was not ignorant of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>; but he flattered himself, that his efforts would be successful without further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a>, and thought he should acquire some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. He certainly had great talents, industry, sagacity, and every other requisite which are necessary in such attempts; but it is morally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> that a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, in a different climate, can attain such knowledge in an art as those who live in a more favourable country, and have had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of many ages to profit by: however M. de Reaumur may have been unsuccessful, posterity is indebted to him for his repeated trials. He has removed some difficulties in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and those that travel it may discover what he only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>.\n\nREAUMURI\u00c1, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the pentandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, Succulentae.

A common recovery is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> or fictitious: and in it the lands are recovered against the tenant of the freehold; which recovery, being a supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADJUDICATION\">adjudication</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, binds all persons, and vests a free and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> fee-simple in the recoverer. To explain this as clearly and concisely as possible, let us, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, suppose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Edwards to be tenant of the freehold, and desirous to suffer a common recovery, in order bar all entails, remainders, and reversions, and to convey the same in fee-simple, to Francis Golding. To effect this, Golding is to bring an action against him for the lands; and he accordingly files out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a> called a praecipe quod reddat, because there were its initial or most operative words when the law proceedings were in Latin. In this writ the defendant Golding alleges, that the defendant Edwards (here called the tenant) has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>; but that he came into possession of it after one Hugh Hunt had turned the demandant out of it. The subsequent proceedings are made up into a record or recovery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a>, in which the writ and complaint of the demandant are first recited: whereupon the tenant appears, and calls upon one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Morland, who is supposed, at the original purchase, to have warranted the title to the tenant; and thereupon he prays, that the said Jacob Morland may be called in to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the title which he so warranted. This is called the voucher, \"vocatio,\" or calling of Jacob Morland to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANTY\">warranty</a>; and Morland is called the vouchee. Upon this Jacob Morland, the vouchee, appears, is impleaded, and defends the title. Whereupon Golding the demandant desires leave of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> to impale, or confer with the vouchee in private; which is (as usual) allowed him. And soon afterwards the demandant Golding returns to court; but Morland the vouchee disappears, or makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFAULT\">default</a>. Whereupon judgment is given for the demandant Golding, now called the recoverer, to recover the lands in question against the tenant Edwards, who is now the recoveree: and Edwards has judgment to recover of Jacob Morland lands of equal value, in recompense for the lands so warranted by him, and now lost by his default; which is agreeable to the doctrine of warranty mentioned in the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>. This is called the recompense, or recovery in value. But Jacob Morland having no lands of his own, being usually the crier of the court, who, from being frequently thus vouched, is called the common vouchee, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that Edwards has only a nominal recompense for the lands so recovered against him by Golding; which lands are now absolutely vested in the said recoverer by judgment of law, and feif thereof is delivered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>. So that this collusive recovery operates merely in the nature of a conveyance in fee-simple, from Edwards the tenant in tail to Golding the purchaser.\n\nThe recovery here described, is with a single voucher only; but sometimes it is with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, treble, or farther voucher, as the exigency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> may require. And indeed it is now usual always to have a recovery with double voucher at the least: by first conveying an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> of freehold to any indifferent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, against whom the praecipe is brought; and then he vouches the tenant in tail, who vouches over the common vouchee. For, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a recovery be had immediately against tenant in tail, it bars only such estate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREMISES\">premises</a> of which he is then actually seised; whereas if the recovery be had against another person, and the tenant in tail be vouched, it bars every latent right and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> which he may have in the lands recovered. If Edwards therefore be tenant of the freehold in possession, and John Barker be tenant in tail in remainder, here Edwards doth first vouch Barker, and then Barker vouches Jacob Morland the common vouchee; who is always the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> person vouched, and always makes default; whereby the defendant Golding recovers the land against the tenant Edwards, and Edwards recovers a recompense of equal value against Barker the first vouchee; who recovers the like against Morland the common vouchee, against whom such ideal recovery in value is always ultimately awarded.\n\nThis supposed recompense in value is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> in tail is held to be barred by a common recovery. For, if the recoveree should obtain a recompense\nRecovery, pense in lands from the common vouches (which there is a possibility in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of law, though a very improbable one, of his doing), these lands would supply the place of those so recovered formed by him by collusion, and would descend to the issue in tail. The reason <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> also hold with equal force as to most remainders and reverions, to whom the possibility will remain and revert, as a full recompense for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> which they were otherwise entitled to; but it will not always hold; and therefore, as Pigott says, the judges have been even *glutii*, in inventing other reasons to maintain the authority of recoveries. And, in particular, it hath been said, that though the estate-tail is gone from the recoveries; yet it is not destroyed, but only transferred, and still subsists; and will ever continue to subsist (by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of law) in the recoverer, his heirs and assigns; and as the estate-tail so continues to subsist for ever, the remainders or reverions expectant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of such estate-tail can never take place.\n\nTo such awkward shifts, such subtile refinements, and such strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, were our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> obliged to have recourse, in order to get the better of that stubborn statute *de donis*. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> for which these contrivances were set on foot, was certainly laudable; the unvetting the fetters of estates tail, which were attended with a legion of mischiefs to the commonwealth; but, while we applaud the end, we cannot but admire the means. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> have indeed adopted a more manly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of treating the subject; by considering common recoveries in no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> than as the formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of conveyance by which tenant in tail is enabled to alienate his lands. But, since the ill consequences of fettered inheritances are now generally seen and allowed, and of course the utility and expediency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> them at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, it hath often been wished that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of this conveyance was shortened, and rendered less subject to niceties, by either totally repealing the statute *de donis*; which perhaps, by reviving the old doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a> fees, might give birth to many litigations; or by vesting in every tenant in tail, of full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the same absolute fee-simple at once, which now he may obtain whenever he pleases, by the collusive fiction of a common recovery; though this might possibly bear hard upon those in remainder or reverions, by abridging the chances they would otherwise frequently have, as no recovery can be suffered in the intervals between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> and term, which sometimes continue for near five months together; or, lately, by empowering the tenant in tail, to bar the estate-tail by a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, to be made in term-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and enrolled in some court of record; which is liable to neither of the other objections, and is warranted not only by the usage of our American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, but by the precedent of the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 19, which, in the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANKRUPT\">bankrupt</a> tenant in tail, empowers his commissioners to fell the estate at any time, by deed indented and enrolled. And if, in so national a concern, the emoluments of the officers concerned in passing recoveries are thought to be worthy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, those might be provided for in the fees to be paid upon each enrollment.\n\n2. The force and effect of common recoveries may appear, from what has been said, to be an absolute bar not only of all estates tail, but of remainders and reverions expectant on the determination of such estates. Recovery So that a tenant in tail may, by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of assurance, convey the lands held in tail to the recoverer, his heirs and assigns, absolutely free and discharged of all conditions and limitations in tail, and of all remainders and reverions. But, by statute 34 and 35 H. VII. c. 20, no recovery had against tenant in tail of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s gift, whereof the remainder or reverion is in the king, shall bar such estate-tail, or the remainder or reverion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. And by the statute 11 H. VII. c. 20, no woman, after her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, shall suffer a recovery of lands settled on her by her husband, or settled on her husband and her by any of his ancestors. And by statute 14 Eliz. c. 8, no tenant for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, of any sort, can suffer a recovery so as to bind them in remainder or reverion. For which reason, if there be tenant for life, with remainder in tail, and other remainders over, and the tenant for life is desirous to suffer a valid recovery, either he, or the tenant to the praecipe by him made, must vouch the remainder-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in tail, otherwise the recovery is void; but if he does vouch such remainder-man, and he appears and vouches the common vouches, it is then good; for if a man be vouched and appears, and suffers the recovery to be had, it is as effectual to bar the estate-tail as if he himself were the recoverer.\n\nIn all recoveries, it is necessary that the recoverer, or tenant to the praecipe, as he is usually called, be actually seised of the freehold, else the recovery is void. For all actions to recover the seizin of lands must be brought against the actual tenant of the freehold, else the suit will lose its effect; since the freehold cannot be recovered of him who has it not. And, though these recoveries are in themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> and fictitious, yet it is necessary that there be *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> fabulie*, properly qualified. But the nicety thought by some modern practitioners to be requisite in conveying the legal freehold, in order to make a good tenant to the praecipe, is removed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> of the statute 14 Geo. II. c. 20, which enacts, with a retrospective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> rule of law, that, though the legal freehold be vested in lessees, yet those who are entitled to the next freehold estate in remainder, or reverion, may make a good tenant to the praecipe; and that, though the deed or fine which creates such tenant be subsequent to the judgement of recovery, yet if it be in the same term, the recovery shall be valid in law; and that though the recovery itself do not appear to be entered, or be not regularly entered on record, yet the deed to make a tenant to the praecipe, and declare the uses of the recovery, shall after a petition of 20 years be sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> on behalf of a purchaser for valuable consideration, that such recovery was duly suffered.\n\nRecovery of persons drowned, or apparently dead.

It is divided into two gulfs; that to the east was called the Atlantic gulf; from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADEN\">Aden</a> at the north end of it; and that to the west the Heroopolitic, from the city of Heroopolis; the former of which belongs to Arabia, and the latter to Egypt.\n\nMr Bruce has made many observations on this sea, which are worthy of notice.\u2014With regard to the name, he says it was certainly derived from Edom or Esau the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>; though in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> he says, he wonders that writers have not rather supposed it to have got the epithet of Red, from the colour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> on its coasts, than for other reasons they have alleged. With regard to any redness in the water itself, or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, which some have asserted, our traveller affirms that there is no such thing. It is more difficult to assign a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> name of it, which signifies the Sea of Weeds; as he never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a weed throughout the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of it. \"Indeed,\" (says he) upon the slightest consideration, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> occur to any one, that a narrow gulf, under the immediate influence of the monsoons, blowing from contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> six months each year, would have too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> to produce such vegetables, seldom found but in stagnant waters, and seldom, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> ever, found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> ones. My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> then is, that it is from the large trees or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> coral, spread everywhere over the bottom of the Red Sea, perfectly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of plants on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, that the sea has obtained this name.\u2014I saw one of these, which, from a root nearly central, threw out ramifications of an almost circular form, measuring 26 feet every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>.\"\n\nOur author has also made many useful observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> of this sea. \"All the western shore (he says) is bold, and has more depth of water than the east; but on this side there is neither anchoring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> nor shoals. It is rocky, with a considerable depth of water everywhere; and there are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> ofunken rocks, which, though not visible, are sufficiently near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a> to destroy a large ship.\" The cause of this, in Mr Bruce's opinion, is, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> on the side of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a> and Egypt are all of hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, porphyry, many different kinds of marble, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, alabaster, and balastes. These being all composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> materials, therefore, can part with very little dust or sand, which might otherwise be blown from them into the sea. On the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, viz. that of Elejaz and Tahamah, on the Arabian side, the whole consists of moving sands; a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of which is blown from the south-east by the dry winter monsoons; which being lodged among the rocks on that side, and confined there by the north-east or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> monsoon, which is in a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, hinders them from coming over to the Egyptian side. Hence the western coast is full of sunk rocks for want of sand to cover them, with which they would otherwise become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. They are naked and bare all round, with sharp points like spears; while, on the east side, every rock becomes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, and every two or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THREE_ISLANDS\">three islands</a> become an harbour. On the ends of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> the people have piled up great heaps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> to serve as signals: \"and it is in these (says Mr Bruce) that the large vessels from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JIDDA\">Jidda</a>, equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> to our large 74-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> ships (but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CISTERNS\">cisterns</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHON\">mahon</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> built within for holding water, I suppose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>), after navigating their portion of the channel in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, come safely and quietly to about four o'clock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>; and in these little harbours <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the channel again next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>.\"\n\nThe western channel of the Red sea was chosen, in the days of the Ptolemies, for the track of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> and African <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. These monarchs erected a great number of cities all along the western coast; and notwithstanding the dangers of the navigation, we do not hear that it was ever abandoned on account of them.\n\nFrom the observations made by our author on the navigation of the Red sea, he undertakes to point out a safe passage for large ships to the gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEZ\">Suez</a>, so that they may be able to judge of the propriety of their own course themselves, without trifling implicitly to the pilots they meet with, who are often very ignorant of their profession. This sea, according to Mr Bruce, may be divided into four parts, of which the channel occupies two, till near the latitude of 26\u00b0, or that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">Coffin</a>. On the west it is deep water, with many rocks; and on the east it is full of islands, as has been already mentioned. Between these islands there are channels and harbours of deep water, where ships may be protected in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>; but a pilot is necessary in sailing among these from Mocha to Suez, and the voyage besides can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> only during part of the day. Ships bound to Suez without the consent of the sherif of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>, that is, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of selling their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARGO\">cargo</a> at Jidda, or paying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> there, ought to take in their fresh water at Mocha; or if there be any reason against this, a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> will carry them to Azab or Saba on the Abyssinian coast, where they may be plentifully supplied: but it must be remembered, \"that the people here are Galla, the most treacherous and villainous wretches on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>.\" Here not only water may be procured, but plenty of sheep, goats, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MYRRH\">myrrh</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a> in the proper season.\u2014Great caution, however, must be used in dealing with the people, as even those of Mocha, who are absolutely necessary to them in their commercial dealings, cannot trust them without surety or hostages. Not many years ago, the surgeon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-ELGIN\">Elgin</a> East Indiaman, with several other sailors, were murdered by these savages as they went ashore to purchase myrrh, though they had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of safe conduct from the sheik.\n\nTo such as do not want to be known, our author recommends a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> island on the coast of Arabia, named Camaran, in latitude 15\u00b0 30'. It is distinguished by a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> or fortres on the west end of it; where water is to be had in still greater plenty than at Azab; but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, or such only as are very bad, can be procured. If it is necessary not to be seen at all on the coast, the island of Fooft is recommended by our author as having excellent water, with a saint or monk, whose office is to keep the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> clean. This is one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of islands which stretches almost across\nacross the gulf from Lochea to Mafuah, and from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> by Mr Bruce, is found to be situated in N. Lat. 14\u00b0 59' 43\", E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 42\u00b0 47'. From this to Yambo there is a safe watering-place; and there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for having a pilot before you come to Ras Mahomet; because over the \u00c6lantic gulf, the mountains of Aucha, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">cape</a> itself, there is often a thick haze; which lasts for many days together, and a number of ships are lost by mistaking the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> or \u00c6lantic gulf for the entrance of the gulf of Suez; the former has a ridge of rocks nearly across it. After reaching Shedan, a large island, about three leagues farther in a north-west direction, there is a bare rock distinguished by no particular name; but so situated that ships ought not to come within three leagues of it. This rock is to be left to the westward at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned; after passing which you meet with shoals forming a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> channel, with soundings from 15 to 30 fathoms; and again, on standing directly for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOR\">Tor</a>, there are two other oval sands with sunk rocks in the channel, between which you are to steer. Tor may be known at a distance by two hills that stand near the water side; which, in clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, may be seen five leagues off. Just to the south-east of these is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> and harbour, where there are some palm trees about the houses, the more remarkable, as being the first that are seen on the coast. The foundations in the way to Tor harbour are clean and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a>; \"and, by giving the beacon a small birth on the larboard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, you may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAUL\">haul</a> in a little to the northward, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> in five or six fathom.\" In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> water at Tor nearly about 12 o'clock; in the middle of the gulf there is no perceptible tide, but at the sides it runs at the rate of more than two knots in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. Tor itself is but a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a>, with a convent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONKS\">monks</a> belonging to those of Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SINAI\">Sinai</a>. It was taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> John de Castro, and fortified soon after its discovery by the Portuguese; but has never since been a place of any consideration; serving now only for a watering place to the ships trading to or from Suez.\u2014From this place there is a distinct view of Mounts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOREB\">Horeb</a> and Sinai, which appear above and behind the others, with their tops frequently covered with snow in the winter.\n\nMr Bruce next proceeds to consider some questions which may be reckoned matters of curiosity rather than anything else. One of these is concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the water of this sea itself, which has been supposed several feet above that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>. \"To this (says our author) I answer, that the fact has been supposed to be so by antiquity, and alleged as a reason why <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>'s canal was made from the bottom of the Heroopolitic gulf rather than brought due north across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> of Suez; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it was feared it would submerge a great part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\"><a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>. But who has ever attempted to verify this by experiment? or who is capable of settling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of levels, amounting, as supposed, to some feet and inches, between two points 120 miles distant from each other, over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> that has no settled surface, but is changing its height every day? Besides, since all seas are in fact but one, what is it that hinders the Indian ocean to flow to its level? What is it that keeps the Indian ocean up? Till this last branch of the question is resolved, I shall take it for granted that no such difference of level exists, whatever Ptolemy's engineers might have pretended to him; because, to suppose it fact, is to suppose the violation of one very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\"\n\nThe next thing considered by our author is the passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a> through the Red sea. At the place where he supposes the passage to have been, the sea is not quite four leagues broad, so that it might easily have been crossed in one night without any miracle. There is about 14 fathom water in the channel, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> at the sides, with good anchorage everywhere; the farthest side is a low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> coast, and a very easy landing place. \"The draught of the bottom of the gulf (says he) given by Dr Pococke, is very erroneous in every part of it. It was proposed to Mr Niebuhr, when in Egypt, to inquire upon the spot, whether there were not some ridges of rocks where the water was shallow, so that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> at particular times might pass over? Secondly, whether the Etesian winds, which blow strongly all summer from the north-west, could not blow violently against the sea, as to keep it back on a heap, so that the Israelites might have passed without a miracle? And a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of these queries was left for me to join my inquiries likewise. But I must confess, however learned the gentlemen were who proposed these doubts, I did not think they merited any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to solve them. If the Etesian winds, blowing from the north-west in summer, could heap up the sea as a wall on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or to the south, of fifty feet high, still the difficulty would remain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the wall on the left hand or to the north. Besides, water standing in that position for a day, must have lost the nature of a fluid. Whence came that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of particles that hindered that wall to escape at the sides? This is as great a miracle as that of Moses. If the Etesian winds had done this once, they must have repeated it many a time before and since, from the same causes. Yet Diodorus Siculus says, the Troglodytes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGENOUS\">indigenous</a> inhabitants of that very spot, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> from father to son, from their very earliest and remotest ages, that once this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the sea did happen there; and that, after leaving the bottom some time dry, the sea again came back and covered it with great fury. The words of this author are of the most remarkable kind. We cannot think this heathen is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> in favour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>. He knew not Moses, nor says a word about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a> and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a>; but records the miracle of the division of the sea in words nearly as strong as those of Moses, from the mouths of unbiased undefining pagans.\"\n\nRED-Shank.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">METAPHYSICS</a>.\n\nREFLECTORS for Light-Houses, have of late years been very successfully adopted instead of coal fires. They are composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> pane glass mirrors, similar to those which, it is said, were employed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> fire to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>. The mirrors are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> square, and are disposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to each other in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> of a parabolic segment, formed of stucco, or any other substance which retains them in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Stucco, however, is found to answer sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>, and is employed in the reflectors of all the light-houses which have been erected round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Scotland.\n\nThe parabolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> are from three to five or six feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and in the centre of each there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> shallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> of tin plate, filled with whale <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>. There are six cotton wicks in each lamp, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to each other, and so disposed as to stand in no need of trimming for the space of six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>. The light is reflected from each mirror spread over the concave surface, and is as it were multiplied by the number of mirrors. Tin plate covers the back of the stucco moulding, from which a tube, immediately over the lamp, proceeds to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the light-room, and answers the purpose of a funnel, through which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> passes without soiling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the mirrors. The light-room is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> of from eight to twelve sides, entirely made of glass, fixed in frames of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and roofed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. The reflectors with their lamps are placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> circular benches passing round the inside of this lantern, at about 18 inches from the glass frames, so that the concave surfaces of two or three of the reflectors from every point of the compass, and throw a blaze of light in all directions.\n\nThere is a hole in the roof, directly over the centre of the room, through which all the funnels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, and by which fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is also conveyed to the lamps. This light-room is fixed in such a manner on the top of a round tower, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> can move it; and the number of the reflectors, and the height of the tower, are greater or less, according as the light is intended to be seen at a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>.\n\nIt has been proposed to make the concave surface of the parabola one speculum of metal, instead of covering it over with a number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> glass mirrors, or to diminish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of each mirror, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are preferred to the metallic speculum. It must be obvious to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who knows anything of optics, that either of these alterations would be improper. The brightest metal does not reflect so much light as plain clear glass, and if the size of the mirrors was diminished, the number of joinings would be increased, in each of which some light is lost.\n\nA man wholly guided by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, would be ready to condemn light-houses of this description; because a violent storm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> shake the firmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, would throw the whole rays of light into the air, and thus mislead the bewildered mariner. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a>, however shows, that such apprehensions are groundless, and that light-houses with lamps and reflectors, are in all respects preferable to those with fires burning in the open air. They are less expensive; they give a more brilliant light, and are seen at a greater distance, and cannot be obscured by smoke, or driven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEE\">lee</a>-side by the most violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>. If to this we add, that the lamps do not stand in need of trimming so often as fires require <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, and that the light-man is never exposed to the weather, we must allow that light-houses with reflectors are not so liable to be neglected in stormy weather as those with open fires, which alone must give the former a preference over the latter.\n\nIt has been asserted, and particularly stated, in the supplement to the third edition of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, that Mr Smith of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>, and we believe now the sole contractor for managing and keeping in repair the light-houses round the coast of Scotland, is the first who conceived the idea of illuminating light-houses by means of lamps and reflectors. We do not understand that Mr Smith himself ever claimed the merit of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; but it appears that reflectors, such as are described above, were invented by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a> Walker of Lynn Regis, who says, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> dated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1804, and addressed to the editor of the Monthly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>*, that such reflectors were made and fixed up under his direction, in a light-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, in the year 1799; and adds farther, that in the year p. 402, 1787, at the request of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> appointed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> for erecting four light-houses on the northern coast of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, he instructed Mr Smith in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of constructing light-houses.

In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> it is applied both to politics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and may innocently be applied.\nto any endeavours to change an establishment from worse to better. But it appears at present to have been chiefly made a pretence for designs which could not fairly or safely be avowed.\n\nA reform in religion and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> (see Parliament), has, we know, been most loudly called for by men whose religious notions are immensely different from what has been generally reckoned christianity, and whose designs, as has been legally proved, went to the overthrow of all civil order. For infidels' purposes like these, the word reform is a good cloak; especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any thing can be fixed upon, either in the religion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the state, which, with the help of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTORTION\">distortion</a>, can be represented to the weak and unthinking as extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> and erroneous.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of these men seems to be, that having picked up a set of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> notions which flatter their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and the pride of those who listen to them, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> allow nothing to the arguments of their opponents or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of mankind. They think so often and so much upon their ideal reforms, that while they imagine their notions are liberal and extensive, they become contracted beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; while their judgements, of course, are warped with the most inveterate prejudices (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">Prejudice</a>). They see, or think they see, the propriety of their schemes; but they seldom, perhaps never, reflect, that that may be true in speculation or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which cannot possibly be reduced to practice. They will not take the world as it is, and allow it to profit by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and experience of ages; but they will reform it according to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> which they have learned from their own speculations and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a> theories; seldom considering what may be done, they are determined to do what they think ought to be done. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">Liberty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, and liberty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, have been claimed by them as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INALIENABLE\">inalienable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; and so we ourselves are disposed to think them: nor have we heard that in this country they have been denied to any man, or set of men, so far as has been thought consistent with the safety of the state, and that of the other individuals who compose it. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the very same men hesitate not to blame, with acrimony the most violent, and to the utmost of their power to restrain, the actions and opinions of those who, with equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>, often on better grounds, and generally with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, differ from them.\n\nAmidst that excessive ardour, too, with which they propagate their opinions, they forget the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> danger of withdrawing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, who must earn their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> by the sweat of their brow, from their proper occupations, to the tempestuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> debate, for which their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> cannot possibly have qualified them. It requires but very little penetration, however, to be able to see, that it can be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> either to the individuals themselves, or to the community at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, in whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> we look upon it. Indeed, to make those the judges of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and the reformers of the legislature, who have all their lives been employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour, is the extreme of folly; and yet it is what some men of considerable abilities, and from whom we had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to expect better things, have more than once attempted. The effect of such a mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a>, (and it deserves no better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>), when it shall become general, instead of serving the purposes of a real reform, must be to annihilate all civil order. Dissatisfaction is the most powerful check to honest industry; and dissatisfaction and idleness must be the effect of the wanderings of such men in the labyrinths of politics; which, for uncultivated minds especially, paves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of vice, and gradually ripens them for any wickedness, however atrocious. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of these remarks, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of mankind from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> to the present time: and we would seriously request the sober friends of reform, and many such, we doubt not, there are, to reflect, that in the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> we have more to fear from licentiousness than from despotism; from reform carried to an extreme than from the pretended attempts either of kings or ministers to annihilate our real liberty.\n\nIt may also be worth their while to consider, that times of public danger are not generally the best adapted to attempt changes of government; because what might satisfy one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> would probably be thought too little by another, and divisions at such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> are most dangerous. When, therefore, attempts are made for reform which appear to be inconsistent with the safety of the state, restrictions must be used, which may by speculative men be thought severe and unnecessary, but of which they themselves are the causes. These restrictions too will be patiently submitted to by the wiser part of the community, when in more peaceable times they would neither have been thought of nor allowed.\n\nSpeculative reasoners may speak as much as they will of enlightening the minds of men, and of reforming government by the dictates of a refined and dispassionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; but when they come to apply their notions to practice, they will either find their representations little better than empty sounds, and therefore ineffectual; or, as is more generally found to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, these schemes which in theory appeared to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a>, will in practice, when combined with the malignant and ambitious passions of men, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to ruin and disorder. The first institution of government, except among the Jews, was unquestionably the effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> combined; and this passion and this interest, restrained within due bounds, is productive of much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. That government, we believe, too, will be best supported, and most productive of happiness, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> passions and interests of the individuals who compose it are so equally poised as to support one another, and to promote each the ends and success of the other: and this by the ablest reasoners and the best men has been thought to be the case with the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> favourers of reform should think this an unstable support, if they will consider the world as it ever has been, and as it is, they will find it the only one we have, except religion; and they will thence be inclined to make the best of it. If, after all, however, they should be disposed to doubt the position, we have only further to request them, with the sincerity of men and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, to consult their own breasts, and seriously to consider the probable motives of those who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with them. They will then perhaps see, and they surely ought to acknowledge, that few\nfew men have acted more according to the impulse of\npassion, interest, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>, than those who have for\nsome time past founded the doctrine of reform.","sp":319,"ep":321},{"h":"REFORMATION","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of reforming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> correcting an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> or abuse in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, or the like.

It is sufficient to observe, that, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the Reformation, the Pope had in the most audacious manner declared himself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> of the whole world. All the parts of it which were inhabited by those who were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, he accounted to be inhabited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a>-body; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> Christians took it into their heads to possess any of those countries, he gave them full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> upon the inhabitants without any provocation, and to treat them with no more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> than they would have treated wild beasts. The countries, if conquered, were to be parcelled out according to the pope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; and dreadful was the situation of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> who refused to obey the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the holy pontiff, of which many instances will occur to the reader in the various historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\u2014In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> authority which the pope had assumed, he at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> granted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> all the countries to the eastward of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Non in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and to the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> all the countries to the westward of it. In this, according to the opinions of some, was completed in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> the character of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTICHRIST\">Antichrist</a> sitting in the temple of God, and showing himself as God*. He had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before, say they, assumed the supremacy belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> himself in spiritual matters; and now he assumed the same supremacy in worldly matters also, giving the extreme regions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> to whom he pleased. The Reformation, therefore, they consider as the immediate effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> power taking vengeance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this and all other deviations from the system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; while others consider it merely as an effect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> causes, and which might have been foreseen and prevented, without abridging the papal power in any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>.\n\nBe this as it will, however, the above-mentioned partition was the last piece of insolence which the pope ever had, or in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> ever will have, in his power to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, in the way of parcelling out the globe to his adherents. Everything was quiet, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERETIC\">heretic</a> exterminated, and the whole Christian world happily acquiesced in the enormous absurdities which were inculcated upon them; when, in 1517, the empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> began to decline, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to do so ever since. The person who made the first attack on the extravagant superstitions then prevailing was Martin Luther; the occasion of which is fully related under the article LUTHER. By some it is pretended, that the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> which Luther had in beginning the Reformation was his enmity to the Dominican friars, who had excluded his order (the Augustins) from all share in the gainful traffic of indulgences. But this does not seem at all probable, if we consider that such a motive would not naturally have led him to deny the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of indulgences, as such conduct could not but exclude him for ever from any chance of a share in the traffic, which otherwise perhaps he might have obtained.\n\nBesides, the extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> of this traffic to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> and honesty was so great, that we cannot wonder at finding one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in the world who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> enough to discern it, and virtue enough to oppose such an infamous practice. In all probability, however, the insignificance of the first reformer was the reason why he was not persecuted and exterminated at his first beginning, as others had been before him. Another reason probably might be, that he did not at once attack the whole errors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a>, but brought about his reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to himself, and as we have related in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\n\nThe Reformation began in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Wittemberg in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, but was not long confined either to that city or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. In 1520 the Franciscan friars, who had the care of promulgating indulgences in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, were opposed by Zwinglius, a man not inferior in understanding and knowledge to Luther himself. He proceeded with the greatest vigour, even at the very beginning, to overturn the whole fabric of Popery; but his opinions were declared erroneous by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUVAIN\">Louvain</a>. Notwithstanding this, the magistrates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZURICH\">Zurich</a> approved of his proceedings; and that whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">canton</a>, together with those of Bern, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a>, and Chaffausen, embraced his opinions.\n\nIn Germany, Luther continued to make great advances, without being in the least intimidated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> censures which were thundered against him from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, he being continually protected by the German princes either from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> motives, so that his adversaries could not accomplish his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> as they had done that of others. The princes, who were upon bad terms with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Rome, took advantage of the success of the new doctrines; and in their own dominions easily overturned a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> which had lost all the respect and veneration of the inferior ranks. The court of Rome had disdained some of the smaller princes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of Germany, whom the pope probably thought too insignificant to be worth the managing, and they universally established the Reformation in their own dominions. Melanchthon, Carloadius, and other men of eminence, also greatly forwarded the work of Luther; and in all probability the Papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a> would have soon come to an end, in the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> at least, had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V., given a severe check to the progress of reformation in Germany. In order to carry out the schemes dictated by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>, he thought it necessary to ingratiate himself with the pope; and the most effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of doing this was by destroying Luther. The pope's legates insisted that Luther ought to be condemned by the diet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a> without either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a>; as being a most notorious, avowed, and incorrigible heretic. However, this appeared unjust to the members of the diet, and he was summoned to appear; which he accordingly did without hesitation*. There is not the least doubt that his appearance there had been his last in this world, ther had not the astonishing respect that was paid him, and\nthe crowds who came daily to see him, deterred his judges from delivering the church from the author of such a pestilent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>; which they were strongly solicited by the pope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> to do. He was therefore permitted to depart with a safe conduct for a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; after which he was in the state of a proscribed criminal, to whom it was unlawful to perform any of the offices of humanity.\n\nDuring the confinement of Luther in a castle near Warburg, the Reformation advanced rapidly; almost every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions. At this time an alteration in the established forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a> was first ventured upon at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITTENBERG\">Wittenberg</a>, by abolishing the celebration of private masses, and by giving the cup as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. In a short time, however, the new opinions were condemned by the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, and a refutation of them was attempted by Henry VIII., of England. But Luther was not to be thus intimidated. He published his animadversions on both with as much acrimony as if he had been refuting the meanest adversary; and a controversy managed by such illustrious antagonists drew a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and the Reformers daily gained new converts both in France and England.\n\nBut while the efforts of Luther were thus everywhere crowned with success, the divisions began to prevail which have since so much agitated the reformed churches. The first dispute was between Luther and Zwingli concerning the manner in which the body and blood of Christ were present in the eucharist. Luther and his followers, though they had rejected the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of transubstantiation, were nevertheless of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the body and blood of Christ were really present in the Lord's supper, in a way which they could not pretend to explain. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARLSTADT\">Carlstadt</a>, who was Luther's colleague, first suggested another view of the subject, which was afterwards confirmed and illustrated by Zwingli, namely, that the body and blood of Christ were not really present in the eucharist; and that the bread and wine were no more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> symbols to excite the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of Christ's sufferings in the minds of those who received it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the utmost obstinacy; and, by their divisions, first gave their adversaries an argument against them, which to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the Catholics urge with great force; namely, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> are so divided, that it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to know who is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or wrong; and that there cannot be a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> than these divisions, that the whole doctrine is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>.\n\nTo these intestine divisions were added the horrors of a civil war, occasioned by oppression on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and enthusiasm on the other. In 1525, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sedulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FANATICS\">fanatics</a> arose on a sudden in different parts of Germany, took arms, united their forces, and made war against the empire, laying waste the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> with fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and committing everywhere the greatest cruelties. The greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this furious mob was composed of peasants and vagrants, who groaned under heavy burdens, and declared that they were no longer able to bear the despotic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of their chiefs; and hence this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEDITION\">sedition</a> had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the rustic war, or the war of the peasants. At first this rabble declared, that they had no other motives than the redress of their grievances; but no sooner had the enthusiastic Munzer, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, the anabaptist, put himself at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of things was entirely changed, and the civil commotions in Saxony and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THURINGIA\">Thuringia</a> exceedingly increased, of which an account is given under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANABAPTISTS\">ANABAPTISTS</a>.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time Frederic, farnamed the Wise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of Saxony, and Luther's great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, departed this life, and was succeeded by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> John. Frederic, though he had protected and encouraged Luther, yet was at no pains to introduce the reformed religion into his dominions. But with his successor it was otherwise; he convinced that Luther's doctrine must soon be totally destroyed and suppressed unless it received a speedy and effectual support, ordered Luther and Melanchthon to draw up a body of laws relating to the form of ecclesiastical government, the method of public worship, &c., which was to be proclaimed by heralds throughout his dominions. This example was followed by all the princes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Germany who renounced the papal supremacy; and a like form of worship, discipline, and government, was thus introduced into all the churches which differed from that of Rome. This open renunciation of the Romish jurisdiction soon changed the face of affairs; and the patrons of Popery soon intimated, in a manner not at all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIGUOUS\">ambiguous</a>, that they intended to make war on the Lutheran party; which would certainly have been put in execution, had not the troubles that took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in Europe disconnected their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. On the other hand, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHERANS\">Lutherans</a>, apprised of these hostile intentions, began also to deliberate on a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> against that superstitious violence with which they were in danger of being attacked. The resolutions of the empire assembled at Spire, in the year 1526; at the diet where the emperor's ambassadors were defined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> all their utmost endeavours to suppress all disputes about the religion, and to inflict upon the rigorous execution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> which had been pronounced against Luther and his followers at Worms. The greatest part of the German princes opposed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> with the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, declaring that they could neither execute that sentence, nor come to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> with regard to the doctrines by which it had been occasioned, before the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> was submitted to the decision of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> lawfully assembled; alleging farther, that the decision of controversies of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> belonged properly to it, and to it alone. This opinion, after long and very warm debates, was adopted by a great majority, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> consented to by the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>: for it was unanimously agreed to protest a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to the emperor, intreating him to assemble, without delay, a free and general council; while in the mean time it was also agreed, that the princes of the empire should, in their respective dominions, be at liberty to manage ecclesiastical affairs in the manner they should think most proper; yet so as to be able to give to God and the emperor a proper account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> when it should be required of them.\n\nThese resolutions proved extremely favourable to the cause of reformation; neither had the emperor any leisure for some time to give disturbance to the reformed. The war, which at this time ensued between him and the pope, gave the greatest advantage to the friends of the reformed, and considerably augmented their number. Several princes, whom the fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>\npunishment had hitherto prevented from lending their affiance, publicly renounced the Romish superstition, and introduced among their subjects the same forms of religious worship, and the same system of doctrine, that had been received in Saxony. Others, though placed in such circumstances as discouraged them from acting in an open manner against the interests of the Roman pontiff, were, however, far from discovering the smallest opposition to those who withdrew the people from his despotic yoke; nor did they molest the private assemblies of those who had separated themselves from the church of Rome. And in general, all the Germans who, before these resolutions of the diet of Spire, had rejected the papal discipline and doctrine, were now, in consequence of the liberty they enjoyed, wholly employed in bringing their schemes and plans to a certain degree of confidence, and in adding vigour and firmness to the cause in which they were engaged. But this tranquillity and liberty was of no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. In 1529, a new diet was assembled at the same place by the emperor, after he had quieted the troubles in various parts of his dominions, and concluded a peace with the pope. The power which had been granted to princes of managing ecclesiastical affairs till the meeting of a general council, was now revoked by a majority of votes; and every change declared unlawful that should be introduced into the doctrine, discipline, or worship of the established religion, before the determination of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> council was known. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> was considered as iniquitous and intolerable by the elector of Saxony, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANDGRAVE\">landgrave</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HESSE\">Hesse</a>, and other members of the diet, who were persuaded of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a reformation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of speedily assembling a general council, they looked upon to be an artifice of the church of Rome; well knowing, that a free and lawful council would be the last thing to which the pope would consent. When, therefore, they found that all their arguments and remonstrances made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon Ferdinand the emperor's brother, who presided in the diet, Charles himself being then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCELONA\">Barcelona</a>, they entered a solemn protest against this decree on the 16th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, and appealed to the emperor and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> council. Hence arose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of Protestants, which from this period has been given to those who separated from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> of the church of Rome.\n\nThe princes of the empire who entered this protest, were John elector of Saxony; George elector of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDENBURG\">Brandenburg</a>; Ernest and Francis dukes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNENBURG\">Lunenburg</a>; the landgrave of Hesse; and the prince of Anhalt. These were seconded by 13 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULM\">Ulm</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUREMBERG\">Nuremberg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCE\">Constance</a>, Rottengen, Windheim, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEMMINGEN\">Memmingen</a>, Nortlingen, Lindau, Kempton, Heilbronn, Wittenburg, and St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">Gall</a>.\n\nThe dissenting princes, who were the protectors and heads of the reformed churches, had no sooner entered their protest, than they sent proper persons to the emperor, who was then upon his passage from Spain to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, to acquaint him with their proceedings in this matter. The ministers employed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> executed it with the greatest intrepidity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of mind; but the emperor, exasperated at the audacity of those who presumed to differ from him, caused the ambassadors to be arrested. The news of this violent step made the Protestant princes conclude, that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> safety, and the success of their cause, depended entirely upon their own courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a>. They determined, therefore, to enter into a solemn confederacy: for which purpose they held several meetings at Rot, Nuremberg, Smalcald, and other places: but so different were their opinions and views, that they could determine upon nothing.\n\nOne great obstacle to the intended confederacy was the dispute which had arisen between Luther and Zwingli concerning the real presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper. To terminate this dispute, if possible, Zwinglius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>, landgrave of Hesse, invited, in the year 1529, to a conference at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARBURG\">Marburg</a>; Luther and Zwinglius, together with several other of the more eminent doctors who adhered to the respective parties of these contending chiefs: but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> was not attended with the salutary effects which were expected from it. The divines disputed for four days in presence of the landgrave. Luther attacked Oecolampadius, and Zwinglius was attacked by Melanchthon. Zwinglius was accused of heresy, not only on account of his explanation of the nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the Lord's Supper, but also in consequence of the false notions he was supposed to have adopted concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> of Christ, the efficacy of the divine word, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> sin, and some other parts of the Christian doctrine. This illustrious reformer, however, cleared himself from the greatest part of these charges with the most triumphant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, and in such a manner as appeared satisfactory even to Luther himself: but their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> concerning the manner of Christ's presence in the eucharist still remained; nor could either of the contending parties be prevailed upon to abandon, or even to modify, their opinions on that matter. The only advantage, therefore, which resulted from the meeting was, that the jarring doctors formed a kind of truce, by agreeing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLERATION\">toleration</a> of their sentiments, and leaving to the disposal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> the cure of their divisions.\n\nIn the mean time news were received that the emperor designed to come into Germany, with a view to terminate all religious differences at the approaching diet of Augsburg. Having foreseen some of the consequences of these disputes, and, besides, taken the advice of men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, sagacity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, he became at certain times more cool in his proceedings, and more impartial in his opinions both of the contending parties and the merits of the cause. He, therefore, in an interview with the pope at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, insisted, in the most serious and urgent manner, on the necessity of a general council. His remonstrances and expostulations, however, could not move the pontiff; who maintained with zeal the papal prerogatives, reproached the emperor with an ill-judged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>, and alleged that it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of that prince to support the church, and to execute speedy vengeance upon that obstinate heretical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> who dared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> in question the authority of Rome and its pontiff. To this discourse the emperor paid no regard; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon it as a most iniquitous thing, and a measure directly opposite to the laws of the empire, to condemn unheard a set of men who had always approved themselves good citizens, and deserved well of their country in several respects. Hi origin of thereto indeed it was not easy for the emperor to form a clear idea of the matters in debate, since there was no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> Augsburg.\nReformation regular system as yet composed, by which it might be known with certainty what were the true causes of Luther's opposition to the pope. The elector of Saxony, therefore, ordered Luther, and other eminent divines, to commit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> articles of their religious system, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in which they differed from the church of Rome. Luther, in compliance with this order, delivered to the elector at Torgau 17 articles which had been agreed upon in a conference at Sultzbach in 1529; from whence these received the name of the articles of Torgau. But though these were deemed by Luther a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the sentiments of the reformers, yet it was judged proper to enlarge them, in order to give perspicuity to their arguments, and strength to their cause. In this work Melanchthon was employed; in which he showed a proper deference to the counsels of Luther, and expressed his sentiments and doctrine with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and perspicuity; and thus came forth to view the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">Confession</a> of Augsburg.\n\nOn the 15th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1530, Charles arrived at Augsburg, and the diet was opened five days after. The Protestants received a formal permission to present an account of their tenets to the diet on the 25th of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; in consequence of which, at the time appointed, Christian Bayer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of Saxony, read, in the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, before the emperor and the princes assembled, the confession of Augsburg above-mentioned. It contained 28 chapters, of which 21 were employed in representing the religious opinions of the Protestants, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out the errors and superstitions of the church of Rome. The princes heard it with the deepest attention and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> of mind: it confirmed some in the principles they had embraced; surprized others; and many, who before this time had little or no idea of the religious sentiments of Luther, were now not only convinced of their innocence, but delighted with their purity and simplicity. The copies of this Confession, which after being read were delivered to the emperor, were signed by John elector of Saxony, George <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of Brandenburg, Ernest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Lunenburg, Philip landgrave of Hesse, Wolfgang prince of Anhalt, and by the imperial cities of Nuremberg and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REUTLINGEN\">Reutlingen</a>.\n\nThe creatures of the church of Rome who were present at this diet employed John Faber, afterwards bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a>, together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECKIUS\">Eckius</a>, and another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> named Cochleus, to draw up a refutation of the Protestant confession: which refutation having been publicly read, the emperor required the Protestant members to acquiesce in it, and put an end to the religious disputes by an unlimited submission to the opinions and doctrines contained in this answer. But this demand was far from being complied with. The Protestants declared on the contrary, that they were by no means satisfied with the reply of their adversaries: and earnestly desired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of it, that they might more fully demonstrate its extreme insufficiency and weakness. But this reasonable request was refused by the emperor; who interposed his supreme authority to prevent any farther proceedings in this matter, and solemnly prohibited the publication of any new writings or declarations that might contribute to lengthen out these religious debates. This, however, did not reduce the Protestants to silence. The divines of that communion, who had been present at the diet, endeavoured to recollect the arguments and objections employed by Faber, and had again recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> of Melanchthon, who refuted them in an ample and satisfactory manner, in a piece which was presented to the emperor on the 22d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, but which Charles refused to receive. This answer was afterwards enlarged by Melanchthon, when he had obtained a copy of Faber's reply; and was published in the year 1531, with the other pieces that related to the doctrine and discipline of the Lutheran church, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of A Defence of the Confession of Augsburg.\n\nMatters now began to draw towards a crisis. There were only three ways of bringing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> these religious differences. 1. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> the Protestants a toleration and privilege of serving God as they thought proper: 2. To compel them to return to the church of Rome by the violent methods of persecution: or, 3. That a reconciliation should be made, upon fair, candid, and equitable terms, by engaging each of the parties to temper their zeal with moderation, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> reciprocally the rigour of their pretensions, and remit something of their respective claims. The third expedient was most generally approved of, being peculiarly agreeable to all who had at heart the welfare of the empire; nor did the pope seem to look upon it either with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> or contempt. Various conferences therefore were held between persons eminent for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and learning on both sides; and nothing was omitted that might have the least tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> the animosities and heal the divisions which reigned between the contending parties. But the differences were too great to admit of a reconciliation; and therefore the votaries of Rome had recourse to the powerful arguments of imperial edicts, and the force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>. On the 19th of November, a severe decree was issued out by the express order of the emperor (during the absence of the Hessian and Saxon princes, the Protestants who were the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> of the Protestant cause), in which every thing was manifestly adapted to deject the friends of religious liberty, excepting only a faint and dubious promise of engaging the pope to assemble a general council about six months after the separation of the diet. In this decree the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and excellence of the Popish religion were extolled beyond measure, a new degree of severity and force was added to that which had been published at Worms against Luther and his adherents, the changes which had been introduced into the doctrine and discipline of the Protestant churches were severely censured, and a solemn order was addressed to the princes, cities, and states, who had thrown off the Papal yoke, to return to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Rome, on pain of incurring the indignation and vengeance of the emperor as the patron and protector of the church. Of this formidable decree the elector of Saxony and confederated princes were no sooner informed than they assembled in order to deliberate on the measures proper to be taken in such a crisis. In the years 1530 and 1531 they met, first at Smalcald, and afterwards at Frankfort, where they formed a solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> and confederacy, called with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of defending vigorously their religion and liberties against the dangers and encroachments with which they were threatened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> of Augsburg, without attempting, however, anything offensive against the votaries of Rome; and into this confederacy they invited.\nvited the kings of England, France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, &c., leaving no means unemployed that might corroborate and cement this important alliance.\n\nThis confederacy was at first opposed by Luther, from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of the calamities and troubles which it might produce; but at last, perceiving the necessity of it, he consented; though he uncharitably, as well as imprudently, refused to comprehend in it the followers of Zwinglius among the Switz, together with the German states and cities who had adopted the sentiments and confession of Bucer. In the invitation addressed to Henry VIII. of England, whom the confederate princes were willing to declare the head and protector of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, the following things, among others, were expressly stipulated: That the king should encourage, promote, and maintain, the true doctrine of Christ as it was contained in the confession of Augsburg, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the same at the next general council: that he should not agree to any council summoned by the bishop of Rome, but protest against it; and neither submit to its decrees, nor suffer them to be respected in his dominions: that he should never allow the Roman pontiff to have any pre-eminence or jurisdiction in his dominions; that he should advance 100,000 crowns for the use of the confederacy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> that sum if it became necessary: all which articles the confederate princes were equally obliged to observe on their part.\n\nTo these demands the king replied, that he would maintain and promote the true doctrine of Christ; but, at the same time, as the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of that doctrine lay only in the holy Scriptures, he would not accept at any one's hand what should be his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, or that of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; and therefore desired that they would lend over two learned men to confer with him, in order to promote a religious union between him and the confederates. However, he declared himself of their opinion with regard to the meeting of a free general council, and promised to join with them in all such councils for the defense of the true doctrine; but thought the regulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONIAL\">ceremonial</a> part of religion, being a matter of indifference, ought to be left to the choice of each sovereign for his own dominions. After this the king gave them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> answer more full and satisfactory; but after the execution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, this negotiation came to nothing. On the one hand, the king grew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> when he perceived that the confederates were no longer of use to him in supporting the validity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>; and, on the other hand, the German princes became sensible that they could never succeed with Henry unless they allowed him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> dictatorship in matters of religion.\n\nWhile every thing thus tended to an open war between the two opposite parties, the elector Palatine, and the elector of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>, offered their mediation, and endeavored to procure a reconciliation. The emperor himself, for various reasons, was at this time inclined to peace: for, on the one hand, he stood in need of succours against the Turks, which the Protestant princes refused to grant as long as the edicts of Worms and Augsburg remained in force; and, on the other, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of his brother Ferdinand to the dignity of king of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, which had been carried by a majority of votes at the diet of Cologne in 1631, was by the same princes contested, as being contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> laws of the empire. In consequence of all this after many negotiations and projects of reconciliation, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> of peace was concluded at Nuremberg in 1532, between the emperor and the Protestant princes, on the following conditions; viz. That the latter should furnish a subsidy for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on the war against the Turks, and acknowledge Ferdinand lawful king of the Romans; and that Nuremberg the emperor on his part should abrogate and annul the concluded edicts of Worms and Augsburg, and allow the Lutherans the free and undisturbed exercise of their religious doctrine and discipline, until a rule of faith was fixed either in the free general council that was to be assembled in the space of six months, or in a diet of the empire.\n\nSoon after the conclusion of the peace at Nuremberg died John elector of Saxony, who was succeeded by his son John Frederic, a prince of invincible fortitude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>, but whose reign was little better than one continued train of disappointments and calamities. The religious truce, however, gave new vigour to the reformation. Those who had hitherto been only secret enemies to the Roman pontiff, now publicly threw off his yoke; and various cities and provinces of Germany enlisted themselves under the religious standards of Luther. On the other hand, as the emperor had now no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> of terminating the religious disputes but by the meeting of a general council, he repeated his requests to the pope for that purpose. The pontiff (Clement VII.), whom the history of past councils filled with the greatest councils proceeded, endeavoured to retard what he could not with pious decency refuse. At last, in 1533, he made a proposal by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGATE\">legate</a> to assemble a council at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>, or Bologna; but the Protestants refused their consent to the nomination of an Italian council, and insisted that a controversy which had its rise in the heart of Germany, should be determined within the limits of the empire. The pope, by his usual artifices, eluded the performance of his own promise; and, in 1534, was cut off by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, in the midst of his stratagems. His successor Paul III. seemed to throw his reluctance to the assembling a general council, and in the year 1535 expressed his inclination to convolve one at Mantua; and, the year following, actually sent circular letters for that purpose through all the states and kingdoms under his jurisdiction. This council was summoned by a bull issued out on the 2d of June 1536, to meet at Mantua the following year: but several obstacles prevented its meeting; one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> of which was, that Frederic duke of Mantua had no inclination to receive at once so many guests, some of them very turbulent, into the place of his residence. On the other hand, the Protestants were firmly persuaded that, as the council was assembled in Italy, and by the authority of the pope alone, the latter must have had an undue influence in that assembly; of consequence, that all things must have been carried by the votaries of Rome. For this reason they assembled at Smalcald in the year 1537, where they solemnly protested against this partial council, and, at the same time, had a new summary of their doctrine drawn up by Luther, in order to present it to the assembled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> if it should be required of them. This summary, which had the title of The Articles of Smalcald, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> joined with the creeds and confessions of the Lutheran church.\n\nAfter the meeting of the general council in Mantua fruitless was thus prevented, many schemes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> were proposed both by the emperor and the Protestants; but\nbut, by the artifices of the church of Rome, all of them came to nothing. In 1541, the emperor appointed a conference at Worms on the subject of religion, between persons of piety and learning chosen from the contending parties. This conference, however, was, for certain reasons, removed to the diet which was to be held at Ratibon that same year, and in which the principal subject of deliberation was a memorial presented by a person unknown, containing a project of peace. But the conference produced no other effect than a mutual agreement of the contending parties to refer their matters to a general council, or, if the meeting of such a council should be prevented, to the next German diet.\n\nThis resolution was rendered ineffectual by a variety of incidents, which widened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>, and put off to a farther day the deliberations which were deemed to heal it. The pope ordered his legate to declare to the diet of Spire, assembled in 1542, that he would, according to the promise he had already made, assemble a general council, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> should be the place of its meeting, if the diet had no objection to that city. Ferdinand, and the princes who adhered to the cause of the pope, gave their consent to this proposal; but it was vehemently objected to by the Protestants, both because the council was summoned by the authority of the pope only, and also because the place was within the jurisdiction of the pope; whereas they desired a free council, which should not be biased by the dictates, nor awed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a>, of the pontiff. But this protestation produced no effect. Paul III., perceiving in his purpose, and illusing his circular letters for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> of the council, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of the emperor. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to this pontiff, however, it must be observed, that he showed himself not to be adverse to every reformation. He appointed four cardinals, and three other persons eminent for their learning, to draw up a plan for the reformation of the church in general, and of the church of Rome in particular. The reformation proposed in this plan was indeed extremely superficial and partial, yet it contained some particulars which could scarcely have been expected from those who composed it. They complained of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the bishops, and proposed that none should receive orders but learned and pious men; and that therefore care should be taken to have proper matters for the instruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>. They condemned translations from one benefice to another, grants of reservation, non-residence, and pluralities. They proposed that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> should be abolished; that the liberty of the prelates should be restrained and limited; that the colloquies of Erasmus should be suppressed; that no ecclesiastic should enjoy a benefice out of his own country; that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> should have a bishopric; that the confessors of St Anthony and several other saints should be abolished; and, which was the best of all their proposals, that the effects and personal estates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a> should be given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. They concluded with complaining of the prodigious number of indigent and ragged priests who frequented St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s church; and declared, that it was a great scandal to see the whores lodged so magnificently at Rome, and riding through the streets on fine mules, while the cardinals and other ecclesiastics accompanied them in the most courteous manner.\u2014This plan of reformation was turned into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> by Luther and Sturmus; and indeed it left unredressed the most intolerable grievances of which the Protestants complained.\n\nAll this time the emperor had been laboring to persuade the Protestants to consent to the meeting of the war council at Trent; but when he found them fixed in their views, the opposition to this measure, he began to listen to the fanatical measures of the pope, and resolved to terminate the disputes by force of arms. The elector of Saxony and landgrave of Hesse, who were the chief supporters of the Protestant cause, upon this took proper measures to prevent their being surprised and overwhelmed by a superior force; but, before the horrors of war commenced, the great reformer Luther died in peace at Arolsen, the place of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">nativity</a>, in 1546.\n\nThe emperor and the pope had mutually resolved on the destruction of all who should dare to oppose the council of Trent. The meeting of it was to serve as a signal for taking up arms; and accordingly its deliberations were scarcely begun in 1546, when the Protestants perceived undoubted signs of the approaching storm, and a formidable union between the emperor and pope, which threatened to crush and overwhelm them at once. This year indeed there had been a new conference at Ratibon upon the old subject of accommodating differences in religion; but from the manner in which the debates were carried on, it plainly appeared that these differences could only be decided in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. The council of Trent, in the mean time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMULGATED\">promulgated</a> their decrees; while the reformed princes, in the diet of Ratibon, protested against their authority, and were on that account proscribe by the emperor, who raised an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> to reduce them to obedience. See Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent, and our articles Father Paul, and Trent.\n\nThe elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hesse led their forces into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a> against the emperor, and cannonaded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> at Ingolstadt. It was supposed that this would bring on an engagement, which would probably have been advantageous to the cause of the reformed; but this was prevented, chiefly by the perfidy of Maurice duke of Saxony, who invaded the dominions of his uncle. Divisions were also fomented among the confederate princes, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSIMULATION\">dissimulation</a> of the emperor; and France failed in paying the subsidy which had been promised by its monarch: all which so discouraged the heads of the Protestant party, that their army soon dispersed, and the elector of Saxony was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> homewards. But he was pursued by the emperor, who made several forced marches, with a view to destroy his enemy before he should have time to recover his vigour. The two armies met near Mulberg, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELBE\">Elbe</a>, on the 24th of April 1547; and, after a bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, the elector was entirely defeated, and himself taken prisoner.\u2014Maurice, who had so basely betrayed him, was now declared elector of Saxony; and by his intrigues Philip landgrave of Hesse, the other chief of the Protestants, was persuaded to throw himself on the mercy of the emperor, and to implore his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>. To this he consented, relying on the promise of Charles for obtaining forgiveness, and being restored to liberty; but, notwithstanding these expectations, he was unjustly detained prisoner, by a scandalous violation of the most solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a>. It is said that the emperor retracted his promise, and disdained this unhappy prince by the ambiguity\nambiguity of two German words. History indeed can scarcely afford a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the perfidious, mean-spirited, and despotic behaviour of the emperor in the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. After having received in public the humble submission of the prince on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, and after having set him at liberty by a solemn treaty, he had him arrested anew without any reason, nay, without any pretence, and kept him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> prisoner for several years. When Maurice remonstrated against this new confinement, the emperor answered, that he had never promised that the landgrave should not be imprisoned anew, but only that he should be exempted from perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPRISONMENT\">imprisonment</a>; and, to support this assertion, he produced the treaty, into which his ministers had perniciously foisted *enigere gefangen*, which signifies \"perpetual prison,\" instead of *enigere gefangen*, which signifies \"any prison.\" This, however, is contested by some historians.\n\nThe affairs of the Protestants now seemed to be desperate. In the diet of Augsburg, which was soon after called, the emperor required the Protestants to leave the decision of these religious disputes to the wisdom of the council which was to meet at Trent. The greatest part of the members consented to this proposal, being convinced by the powerful argument of an imperial army, which was at hand to dispel the darkness from the eyes of such as might otherwise have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> to the force of Charles's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. However, this general submission did not produce the effect which was expected from it. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> which broke out, or was said to do so, in the city, caused the greatest part of the bishops to retire to Bologna; by which means the council was in effect dissolved, nor could all the intreates and remonstrances of the emperor prevail upon the pope to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-assemble it without delay. During this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, therefore, the emperor judged it necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon some method of accommodating the religious differences, and maintaining peace until the council so long expected should be finally obtained. With this view he ordered Julius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PELAGIUS\">Pelagius</a>, bishop of Naumberg, Michael Sidonius, a creature of the pope, and John Agricola, a native of Ayfelberg, to draw up a formulary which might serve as a rule of faith and worship, till the council should be assembled: but as this was only a temporary expedient, and had not the force of a permanent or perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, it thence obtained the name of the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERIM\">Interim</a>*.\n\nThis project of Charles was formed partly with a design to vent his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> against the pope, and partly to answer other political purposes. It contained all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> doctrines of the church of Rome, though considerably softened by the artful terms which were employed, and which were quite different from those employed before and after this period by the council of Trent. There was even an affected ambiguity in many of the expressions, which made them susceptible of different senses, and applicable to the sentiments of both communions. The consequence of all this was, that the imperial creed was reproached by both parties. However, it was promulgated with great solemnity by the emperor at Augsburg. The elector of Mentz, without even asking the opinion of the princes present, gave a sanction to this formula, as if he had been commissioned to represent the whole diet. Many kept silence through fear, and that silence was interpreted as a tacit consent. Some had the courage to oppose it, and these were reduced by force of arms; and the most deplorable scenes of bloodshed and violence were acted throughout the whole empire. Maurice, elector of Saxony, who had hitherto kept neutral, now assembled the whole of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> and clergy, in order to deliberate on this critical affair.\n\nAt the head of the latter was Melanchthon, whose word was respected as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> among the Protestants. But this man had not the courage of Luther; and was therefore reluctant on all occasions ready to make concessions, and to promote schemes of accommodation. In the present case, therefore, he gave it as his opinion, that the whole of the book called *Interim* could not by any means be adopted by the Protestants; but at the same time he declared, that he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> no reason why this book might not be approved, adopted, and received, as an authoritative rule in things that did not relate to the essential parts of religion, and which he accounted indifferent. But this scheme, instead of cementing the differences, made them worse than ever; and produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> among the Protestants themselves, which might have overthrown the Reformation entirely, if the emperor and pope had seized the opportunity.\n\nIn the year 1549, the pope (Paul III.) died; and a new was succeeded by Julius III., who, at the repeated solicitations of the emperor, consented to the re-assembling of a council at Trent. A diet was again held at Augsburg under the cannon of an imperial army, and Charles laid the matter before the princes of the empire. Most of those present gave their consent to it, and among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> Maurice elector of Saxony; who consented on the following conditions: 1. That the points of doctrine which had already been decided there, should be re-examined. 2. That this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> should be made in presence of the Protestant divines. 3. That the Saxon Protestants should have a liberty of voting as well as of deliberating in the council. 4. That the pope should not pretend to preside in that assembly, either in person or by his legates. This declaration of Maurice was read in the diet, and his deputies insisted upon its being entered into the registers which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Mentz obstinately refused. The diet was concluded in the year 1551; and, at its breaking up, the emperor desired the assembled princes and states to prepare all things for the approaching council, and promised to use his utmost endeavours to procure moderation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>, impartiality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>, in the transactions of that assembly.\n\nOn the breaking up of the diet, the Protestants took such steps as they thought most proper for their own safety. The Saxons employed Melanchthon, and the Wurtembergers Brengius, to draw up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONFESSIONS_OF_FAITH\">Confessions of Faith</a> to be laid before the new council. The Saxon divines, however, proceeded no farther than Nuremberg, having received secret orders from Maurice to stop there: For the elector, perceiving that Charles had formed designs against the liberties of the German princes, resolved to take the most effectual measures for crushing his ambition at once. He therefore entered with the utmost secrecy and expedition into an alliance with the king of France, and several of the German princes, for the security of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and liberties of the empire; after which, assembling a powerful army to the number of 15,520, he marched against the emperor, who lay with a handful of troops at Innsbruck, and expected no such thing. By this sudden and unforeseen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> Charles the elector was so much dispirited, that he was willing to make peace\npeace almost on any terms. The consequence of this was, that he concluded a treaty at Passau, which by the Protestants is considered as the basis of their religious liberty. By the first three articles of this treaty it was agreed, that Maurice and the confederates should lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> their arms, and lend their troops to Ferdinand to assist him against the Turks; and that the landgrave of Hesse should be set at liberty. By the fourth it was agreed, that the Rule of Faith called the Interim should be considered as null and void; that the contending parties should enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion, until a diet should be assembled to determine amicably the present disputes (which diet was to meet in the space of six months); and that this religious liberty should continue always, in case it should be found impossible to come to an uniformity in doctrine and worship. It was also determined, that all those who had suffered banishment, or any other calamity, on account of their having been concerned in the league or war of Smalcald, should be reinstated in their privileges, possessions, and employments; that the imperial chamber at Spire should be open to the Protestants as well as to the Catholics; and that there should always be a certain number of Lutherans in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> court.\u2014To this peace Albert, marquis of Brandenburg, refused to subscribe; and continued the war against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>, committing such ravages in the empire, that a confederacy was at last formed against him. At the head of this confederacy was Maurice elector of Saxony, who died of a wound he received in a battle fought on the occasion in 1553.\n\nThe assembling of the diet promised by Charles was prevented by various incidents; however, it met at Augsburg in 1555, where it was opened by Ferdinand in name of the emperor, and terminated those deplorable calamities which had so long depopulated the empire. After various debates, the following acts were passed, on the 25th of September: That the Protestants who followed the Confession of Augsburg should be for the future considered as entirely free from the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff, and from the authority and superintendence of the bishops; that they were left at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> liberty to enact laws for themselves relating to their religious sentiments, discipline, and worship; that all the inhabitants of the German empire should be allowed to judge for themselves in religious matters, and to join themselves to that church whose doctrine and worship they thought the most pure and consonant to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of true Christianity; and that all those who should injure or persecute any person under religious pretences, and on account of their opinions, should be declared and proceeded against as public enemies of the empire, invaders of its liberty, and disturbers of its peace.\n\nThus was the Reformation established in many parts of the German empire, where it continues to this day; nor have the efforts of the Papal powers at any time been able to suppress it, or even to prevent it from gaining ground. It was not, however, in Germany alone that a reformation of religion took place. Almost all the kingdoms of Europe began to open their eyes to the truth about the same time. The reformed religion was propagated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, soon after Luther's rupture with the church of Rome, by one of his disciples named Olaus Petri. The zealous efforts of this missionary were seconded by Gustavus Vasa, whom the Swedes had raised to the throne in place of Christian king of Denmark, whose horrid barbarity lost him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. This prince, however, was as prudent as he was zealous; and, as the minds of the Swedes were in a fluctuating state, he wisely avoided all kind of vehemence and precipitation in spreading the new doctrine. Accordingly, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his attention was the instruction of his people in the sacred doctrines of the Holy Scriptures; for which purpose he invited into his dominions several learned Germans, and spread abroad through the kingdom the Swedish translation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> that had been made by Olaus Petri. Some time after this, in 1526, he appointed a conference at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UPSALA\">Upsala</a>, between this reformer and Peter Gallius, a zealous defender of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> superstition, in which each of the champions was to bring forth his arguments, that it might be seen on which side the truth lay. In this dispute Olaus obtained a signal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>; which contributed much to confirm Gustavus in his persuasion of the truth of Luther's doctrine, and to promote its progress in Sweden. The following year another event gave the finishing stroke to its propagation and success. This was the assembly of the states at Weferaas, where Gustavus recommended the doctrine of the reformers with such zeal, that, after warm debates fomented by the clergy in general, it was unanimously resolved that the reformation introduced by Luther should have place in Sweden. This revolution was principally owing to the firmness and magnanimity of Gustavus, who declared publicly, that he would lay down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCEPTRE\">sceptre</a> and retire from the kingdom, rather than rule a people enslaved by the orders and authority of the pope, and more controlled by the tyranny of their bishops than by the laws of their monarch. From this time the papal empire in Sweden was entirely overthrown, and Gustavus declared head of the church.\n\nIn Denmark, the reformation was introduced as early in Denmark as the year 1521, in consequence of the ardent desire manifested by Christian II. of having his subjects instructed in the doctrines of Luther. This monarch, notwithstanding his cruelty, for which his name has been rendered odious, was nevertheless desirous of delivering his dominions from the tyranny of the church of Rome. For this purpose, in the year 1529, he sent for Martin Reinard, one of the disciples of Carlottadt, out of Saxony, and appointed him professor of divinity at Hafnia; and after his death, which happened in 1521, he invited Carlottadt himself to fill that important place. Carlottadt accepted of this office indeed, but in a short time returned to Germany; upon which Christian used his utmost endeavours to engage Luther to visit his dominions, but in vain. However, the progress of Christianity, in reforming the religion of his subjects, or rather of advancing his own power above that of the church, was checked, in the year 1523, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, by which he was deprived and banished; his uncle Frederic, duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a> and Sleswig, being appointed his successor.\n\nFrederic conducted the reformation with much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> than his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a>. He permitted the Protestant doctors to preach publicly the sentiments of Luther, but did not venture to change the established government and discipline of the church. However, he contributed greatly to the progress of the reformation, by his successful attempts in favour of religious liberty in an assembly of the states held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODENSEE\">Odensee</a> in 1527.\nHere he procured the publication of a famous edict, by which every subject of Denmark was declared free either to adhere to the tenets of the church of Rome, or to the doctrine of Luther. The papal tyranny was totally destroyed by his successor Christian III. He began by suppressing the despotic authority of the bishops, and restoring to their lawful owners a great part of the wealth and possessions which the church had acquired by various stratagems. This was followed by a plan of religious doctrine, worship, and discipline, laid down by Bugenhagen, whom the king had sent from Wittenberg for that purpose; and in 1539 an assembly of the estates at Odensee gave a solemn sanction to all these transactions.\n\nIn France also, the reformation began to make some progress very early. Margaret queen of Navarre, sister to Francis I., the perpetual rival of Charles V., was a great friend to the new doctrine; and it appears that, as early as the year 1523, there were in several of the provinces of France great numbers of people who had conceived the greatest aversion both to the doctrine and tyranny of the church of Rome; among whom were many of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and dignity, and even some of the episcopal order. But as their number increased daily, and troubles and commotions were excited in several places on account of the religious differences, the authority of the king intervened, and many persons eminent for their virtue and piety were put to death in the most barbarous manner. Indeed Francis, who had neither religion at all, or, at best, no fixed and consistent system of religious principles, conducted himself towards the Protestants in such a manner as best answered his private views. Sometimes he resolved to invite Melanchthon into France, probably with a view to please his sister the queen of Navarre, whom he loved tenderly, and who had strongly imbibed the Protestant principles. At other times he exercised the most infernal cruelty towards the reformed; and once made the following mad declaration, That if he thought the blood in his arm was tainted by the Lutheran heresy, he would have it cut off; and that he would not spare even his own children, if they entertained sentiments contrary to those of the Catholic church.\n\nAbout this time the famous Calvin began to draw the attention of the public, but more especially of the queen of Navarre. His zeal exposed him to danger; and the friends of the reformation, whom Francis was daily committing to the flames, placed him more than once in the most perilous situation, from which he was delivered by the intervention of the queen of Navarre. He therefore retired out of France to Basil in Switzerland; where he published his Christian Institutions, and became afterwards so famous.\n\nThose among the French who first renounced the jurisdiction of the Roman church, are commonly called Lutherans by the writers of those early times. Hence it has been supposed that they had all imbibed the peculiar sentiments of Luther. But this appears by no means to have been the case; for the vicinity of the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAUSANNE\">Lausanne</a>, &c., which had adopted the doctrines of Calvin, produced a remarkable effect upon the French Protestant churches; insomuch that, about the middle of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, they all entered into communion with the church of Geneva. The French Protestants were called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUGUENOTS\">Huguenots</a>* by their adversaries, by way of contempt. Their fate was very severe, being persecuted with unparalleled fury; and though many princes of the blood, and of the first nobility, had embraced their sentiments, yet in no part of the world did the reformers suffer so much. At last all commotions were quelled by the fortitude and magnanimity of Henry IV., who in France, the year 1598 granted all his subjects full liberty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> by the famous Edict of Nantes, and seemed to have thoroughly established the reformation throughout his dominions. During the minority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV., however, this edict was revoked by Cardinal Mazarin, since which time the Protestants have often been cruelly persecuted; nor was the profession of the reformed religion in France at any time so safe as in most other countries of Europe.\n\nIn the other parts of Europe the opposition to the church of Rome was but faint and ambiguous before the diets of Augsburg. Before that period, however, it appears from undoubted testimony, that the doctrine of Luther had made a considerable, though probably secret, progress through Spain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>; and had in all these countries many friends, of whom several repaired to Wittenberg, in order to enlarge their knowledge by means of Luther's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a>. Some of these countries threw off the Romish yoke entirely, and in others a prodigious number of families embraced the principles of the reformed religion. It is certain indeed, and some Roman Catholics themselves acknowledge it without hesitation, that the Papal doctrines and authority would have fallen into ruin in all parts of the world at once, had not the force of the secular arm been employed to support the tottering edifice. In the Netherlands particularly, the most grievous persecutions took place, so that by the emperor Charles V., upwards of 100,000 were destroyed, while still greater cruelties were exercised upon the people by his son Philip II. The revolt of the United Provinces, however, and motives of real policy, at last put a stop to these furious proceedings; and, though in many provinces of the Netherlands, the establishment of the Popish religion was still continued, the Protestants have been long free of the danger of persecution on account of their principles.\n\nThe reformation made considerable progress in Spain and Italy soon after the rupture between Luther and the Roman pontiff. In all the provinces of Italy, but more especially in the territories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, the superstition of Rome lost ground, and great numbers of people of all ranks expressed an aversion to the Papal yoke. This occasioned violent and dangerous commotions in the kingdom of Naples in the year 1546; which, however, were at last quelled by the united efforts of Charles V. and his viceroy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Pedro di <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOLEDO\">Toledo</a>. In several places the pope put a stop to the progress of the reformation, by letting loose the inquisitors, who spread dreadful marks of their barbarity through the greatest part of Italy. These formidable ministers of superstition put to many to death, and perpetrated such horrid acts of cruelty and opprobrium, that most of the reformed consulted their safety by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>, while others returned to the religion of Rome, at least in external appearance. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>, which frightened into the profession of Popery several Protestants in other parts of Italy, could never make its way into the kingdom of Naples; nor could either...\nthe authority or intreates of the pope engage the Neapolitans to admit even visiting inquisitors.\n\nIn Spain, several people embraced the Protestant religion, not only from the controversies of Luther, but even from those divines whom Charles V. had brought with him into Germany in order to refute the doctrines of Luther. For these doctors imbibed the pretended heresy instead of refuting it, and propagated it more or less on their return home. But the inquisition, which could obtain no footing in Naples, reigned triumphant in Spain, and by the most dreadful methods frightened the people back into Popery, and suppressed the desire of exchanging their superstition for a more rational plan of religion. It was indeed presumed that Charles himself died a Protestant; and it seems to be certain, that, when the approach of death had dissipated those schemes of ambition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> which had long blinded him, his sentiments became much more rational and agreeable to Christianity than they had ever been. All the ecclesiastics who had attended him, as soon as he expired, were sent to the inquisition, and committed to the flames, or put to death by some other method equally terrible. Such was the fate of Augustine C\u00e6sar, the emperor's preacher; of Constantius Pontius, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFESSOR\">confessor</a>; of Egidius, whom he had named to the bishopric of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORTOSA\">Tortosa</a>; of Bartholomew de Caranza, a Dominican, who had been confessor to King Philip and Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>; with 20 others of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>.\n\nIn England, the principles of the reformation began to be adopted as soon as an account of Luther's doctrines could be conveyed thither. In that kingdom there were still great remains of the so-called Lollards, whose doctrine resembled that of Luther; and among whom, of consequence, the sentiments of our reformer gained great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>. Henry VIII., king of England at that time was a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTISAN\">partisan</a> of the church of Rome, and had a particular veneration for the writings of Thomas Aquinas. Being informed that Luther spoke of his favourite author with contempt, he conceived a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> against the reformer, and even wrote against him, as we have already observed. Luther did not hesitate at writing against his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>, overcame him in argument, and treated him with very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. The first step towards public reformation, however, was not taken till the year 1529. Great complaints had been made in England, and of a very ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, of the usurpations of the clergy; and by the prevalence of the Lutheran opinions, these complaints were now become more general than before. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons, finding the occasion favourable, passed several bills, restraining the impositions of the clergy; but what threatened the ecclesiastical order with the greatest danger were the severe reproaches thrown out almost without opposition in the house against the dilolute lives, ambition, and avarice of the priests, and their continual encroachments on the privileges of the laity. The bills for regulating the clergy met with opposition in the house of lords; and Bishop Fisher imputed them to want of faith in the commons, and to a formed design, proceeding from heretical and Lutheran principles, of robbing the church of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a>, and overturning the national religion. The commons, however, complained to the king, by their speaker Sir Thomas Audley, of these reflections thrown out against them; and the bishop was obliged to retract his words.\n\nThough Henry had not the least idea of rejecting Reformation, even of the most absurd Romish superstitions, yet as the oppressions of the clergy suited very ill with the violence of his own temper, he was pleased with every opportunity of lessening their power. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of 1531, he showed his design of humbling the clergy in the most effectual manner. An obsolete statute was revived, from which it was pretended that it was criminal to submit to the legitimate power which had been exercised by Cardinal Wolsey. By this stroke the whole body of clergy was declared guilty at once. They were too well acquainted with Henry's disposition, however, to reply, that their ruin would have been the certain consequence of their not submitting to Wolsey's commission, which had been given by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> authority. Instead of making any defence of this kind, they chose to throw themselves on the mercy of their sovereign; which, however, it cost them \u00a318,840l. to procure. A confession was likewise extorted from them, that the king was protector and supreme head of the church of England; though some of them had the dexterity to get a clause inserted, which invalidated the whole submission, viz. in so far as is permitted by the law of Christ.\n\nThe king, having thus begun to reduce the power of the clergy, kept no bounds with them afterwards. He did not indeed attempt any reformation in religious matters; nay, he persecuted most violently such as did attempt this in the least. Indeed, the most essential article of his creed seems to have been his own supremacy; for whoever denied this, was sure to suffer the most severe penalties, whether Protestant or Papist. But an account of the absurd and cruel conduct of this prince, and of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> quarrel with the pope on account of his refusing a dispensation to marry Anne Boleyn, is given under the article ENGLAND, No. 253\u2014292.\n\nHe died in 1547, and was succeeded by his only son Edward VI. This amiable prince, whose early youth was crowned with that wisdom, sagacity, and virtue, that would have done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to advanced years, gave new spirit and vigour to the Protestant cause, and was its brightest ornament, as well as its most effectual support. He encouraged learned and pious men of foreign countries to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in England, and addressed a particular invitation to Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius, whose moderation added a lustre to their other virtues, that, by the ministry and labours of these eminent men, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with those of the friends of the Reformation in England, he might purge his dominions from the foridest fictions of popery, and establish the pure doctrines of Christianity in their place. For this purpose, he issued out the wisest orders for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of true religion; but his reign was too short to accomplish fully such a glorious purpose. In the year 1553, he was taken from his loving and afflicted subjects, whose sorrow was inexpressible, and suited to their lots. His sister Mary (the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Catherine of Arragon, from whom Henry had been separated by the famous divorce), a furious bigot to the church of Rome, and a princess whose natural character, like the spirit of her religion, was despotic and cruel, succeeded him on the British throne, and imposed anew the arbitrary laws and the tyrannical yoke of Rome upon the people of England. Nor were the methods she employed in the cause\nof superstition better than the cause itself, or tempered by any sentiments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>. Barbarous tortures, and death in the most shocking forms, awaited those who opposed her will, or made the least stand against the restoration of Popery. And among many other victims, the learned and pious Cranmer, archbishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, who had been one of the most illustrious instruments of the Reformation in England, fell a sacrifice to her fury. This odious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of persecution was happily concluded in the year 1558, by the death of the queen, who left no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>; and, as soon as her successor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> ascended the throne, all things assumed a new and a pleasing aspect. This illustrious princess, whose sentiments, councils, and projects, breathed a spirit superior to the natural softness and delicacy of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, exerted this vigorous and manly spirit in the defense of oppressed conscience and expiring liberty, broke anew the despotic yoke of Papal authority and superstition, and, delivering her people from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a> of Rome, established that form of religious doctrine and ecclesiastical government which still subsists in England. This religious establishment differs, in some respects, from the plan that had been formed by those whom Edward VI. had employed for promoting the cause of the Reformation, and approaches nearer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> and discipline of former times; though it is widely different, and, in the most important points, entirely opposite to the principles of the Roman hierarchy. See ENGLAND, No. 293, &c.\n\nThe cause of the reformation underwent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> the same vicissitudes and revolutions that had attended it in England. When Henry VIII., after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of the Papal authority, was declared supreme head upon earth of the church of England, George <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, a native of England, and a monk of the Augustine order, whom that monarch had created, in the year 1535, archbishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, began to act with the utmost vigour in consequence of this change in the hierarchy. He purged the churches of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> from superstition in all its various forms, pulled down images, destroyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELICS\">relics</a>, abolished absurd and idolatrous rites, and, by the influence as well as authority he had in Ireland, caused the king's supremacy to be acknowledged in that nation. Henry thought, soon after, that this supremacy was not a vain title; for he banished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONKS\">monks</a> out of that kingdom, confiscated their revenues, and destroyed their convents. In the reign of Edward VI., still farther progress was made in the removal of Popish superstitions, by the zealous labours of Bishop Brown, and the auspicious encouragement he granted to all who exerted themselves in the cause of the Reformation. But the death of this excellent prince, and the accession of Queen Mary, had like to have changed the face of affairs in Ireland as much as in England; but her designs were disappointed by a very curious adventure, of which the following account has been copied from the papers of Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Cork:\n\n\"Queen Mary having dealt severely with the Protestants in England, about the latter end of her reign signed a commission for to take the same course with them in Ireland; and to execute the same with greater force, she nominates Dr Cole one of the commissioners. The doctor coming, with the commission, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHELTENHAM\">Cheltenham</a> on his journey, the mayor of that city hearing that her majesty was sending a messenger into Ireland, and he being a churchman, waited on the doctor, who in difficulty with the mayor tooketh out of a cloke-bag a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> box, saying unto him, Here is a commission that shall lay the Heretics of Ireland, calling the Protestants by that title. The good woman of the house being well affected to the Protestant religion, and also having a brother named John Edmonds of the same persuasion, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> in Dublin, was much troubled at the doctor's words, but watching her convenient time while the mayor took his leave, and the doctor complimented him down the stairs, she opens the box, takes the commission out, and places in lieu thereof a sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> with a pack of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a> wrapt up therein, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNAVE\">knave</a> of clubs being faced uppermost. The doctor coming up to his chamber, supposing nothing of what had been done, put up the box as formerly. The next day going to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-side, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> serving him, he sails towards Ireland, and landed on the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1558 at Dublin. Then coming to the castle, the lord Fitz-Walters being lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>, sent for him to come before him and the privy-council; who, coming in, after he had made a speech relating upon what account he came over, he presents the box unto the lord-deputy; who causing it to be opened, that the secretary might read the commission, there was nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> a pack of cards with the knave of clubs uppermost; which not only startled the lord-deputy and council, but the doctor, who assured them he had a commission, but knew not how it was gone. Then the lord-deputy made answer: Let us have another commission, and we will shuffle the cards in the meanwhile. The doctor being troubled in his mind, went away, and returned into England, and coming to the court obtained another commission: but staying for a wind on the water-side, news came to him that the queen was dead; and thus God preserved the Protestants of Ireland.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth was so delighted with this story, which was related to her by Lord Fitz-Walter on his return to England, that she sent for Elizabeth Edmonds, whose husband's name was Matterhead, and gave her a pension of \u00a340 during her life.\n\nIn Scotland, the seeds of reformation were very early of the Reformation, by several noblemen who had resided in Germany during the religious disputes there. But for many years in Scotland it was suppressed by the power of the pope, seconded by inhuman laws and barbarous executions. The most eminent opposer of the Papal jurisdiction was John Knox, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Calvin, a man of great zeal and invincible fortitude. On all occasions he raised the drooping spirits of the reformers, and encouraged them to go on with their work notwithstanding the opposition and treachery of the queen-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a>; till at last, in 1561, by the assistance of an English army sent by Elizabeth, Popery was in a manner totally extirpated throughout the kingdom. From this period the form of doctrine, worship, and discipline established by Calvin at Geneva, has had the ascendancy in Scotland. But for an account of the difficulties which the Scottish reformers had to struggle with, and the manner in which these were overcome, &c., see SCOTLAND.\n\nFor further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> on the subject of the reformation in general we refer our readers to the works of Burnet and Brandt, to Beaufobre's Histoire de la R\u00e9formation dans l'Empire, et les \u00c9tats de la Confession d'Augsbourg depuis 1517\u20141530, in 4 vols 8vo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> 1785.","sp":321,"ep":331},{"h":"REFRACTION","t":"Terrestrial, is that which makes terrestrial objects appear to be raised higher than they are in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>, in observing their altitudes.

The state of a gondolier * is of much consideration among the people; which is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, that having been the dola <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> condition of the inhabitants of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. But, besides this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> consideration, there are among them some families truly distinguished and respected by their equals, whose antiquity is acknowledged, and who, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of a succession of virtuous men, able in their profession, and honoured for the prizes they have carried off in these contests, form the body of noble gondoliers; often more worthy of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> than the higher order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, who only derive their honours from the merit of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, or from their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>. The consideration for those families is carried so far, that, in the disputes frequently arising among the gondoliers in their ordinary passage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, we sometimes see a quarrel instantly made up by the simple intervention of a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, who has chanced to be of this revered body. They are rigid with respect to misalliances in their families, and they endeavour reciprocally to give and take their wives among those of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>. But we must remark here, with pleasure, that these distinctions infer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> inequality of condition, nor admit any oppression of inferiors, being founded solely on laudable and virtuous opinions. Distinctions derived from fortune only, are those which always outrage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>.\n\nIn general, the competitors at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> regatas are chosen from among these families of reputation. As soon as they are fixed upon for this exploit, they spend the intermediate time in preparing themselves for it, by a daily, arduous, and fatiguing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> they are in service, their masters during that time not only give them their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, but also augment their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> would seem to indicate, that they look upon them as persons consecrated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and under a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBLIGATION\">obligation</a> to contribute to its glory.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> the grand day arrives. Their relations assemble together; they encourage the heroes, by calling to their minds the records of their families; the women present the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAR\">oar</a>, beseeching them, in an epic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a>, to remember that they are the sons of famous men, whose steps they will be expected to follow: this they do with as much solemnity as the Spartan women presented the shield to their sons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIDDING\">bidding</a> them either return with or upon it. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a>, as practised among the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of people, has its share in the preparations for this enterprise. They cause masses to be said; they make vows to some particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> their boats for the contest with the images of those saints who are most in vogue. Sorcerers are not forgotten upon this occasion. For gondoliers who have lost the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> often declare, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a> had been practised against them, or certainly they must have won the day. Such a supposition prevents a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> fellow from thinking ill of himself; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that might be unfavourable to him another time.\nThe course is about four miles. The boats start from a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, run through the great winding canal, which divides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> into two parts, turn round a picket, and, coming back the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, go and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>, which is fixed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the great canal, on the convex side, so that the point of fight may be the more extended, and the prize seized in the sight of the spectators on both sides.\n\nAccording to the number of competitors, different races are performed in different sorts of boats; some with one oar and others with two. The prizes proposed are four, indicated by four flags of different colours, with the different value of the prizes marked upon them.\u2014These flags, public and glorious monuments, are the prizes to which the competitors particularly aspire. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> always add to each a genteel sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; besides that the conquerors, immediately after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>, are surrounded by the beau monde, who congratulate and make them presents; after which they go, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TROPHY\">trophy</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the canal, and receive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of innumerable spectators.\n\nThis grand canal, ever striking by the singularity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the buildings which border it, is, upon these occasions, covered with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFINITY\">infinity</a> of spectators, in all sorts of barges, boats, and gondolas. The element on which they move is scarcely seen; but the noise of oars, the agitation of arms and bodies in perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, indicate the spectacle to be upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. At certain distances, on each side of the shore, are erected little amphitheatres and scaffoldings, where are placed bands of music; the harmonious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of which predominates now and then over the buzzing noise of the people. Some days before a regata, one may see on the great canal many boats for pleasure and entertainment. The young noble, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a>, the rich artizan, mounts a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> of six or eight oars; his gondoliers decorated with rich and singular dresses; and the vessel itself adorned with various stuffs. Among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> there are always a number who are at a considerable expense in these decorations; and at the regata itself exhibit on the water personages of mythologic story, with the heroes of antiquity in their train, or amuse themselves with representing the costumes of different nations: in short, people contribute with a mad sort of magnificence, from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>, to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASQUERADE\">masquerade</a>, the favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a> of the Venetians. But these great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>, not being the least in motion on account of their ornaments, are not merely destined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> the show; they are employed at the regata, at every moment, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> the people, to protect the course, and to keep the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVENUE\">avenue</a> open and clear to the goal. The nobility, kneeling upon cushions at the prow of their vessels, are attentive to these matters, and announce their orders to the most reticent, by darting at them little gilded or silvered balls, by means of certain bows, with which they are furnished on this occasion. And this is the only appearance of coercion in the Venetian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> on these days of the greatest tumult: nor is there to be seen, in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the city, a body of guards or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATROL\">patrol</a>, nor even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALBERT\">halbert</a>.

A guardian and councils of regency were named for Edward III. by the parliament, which deposed his father; the young king being then 15, and not affuming the government till three years after. When Richard II. succeeded at the age of 11, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a> took upon him the management of the kingdom till the parliament met, which appointed a nominal council to assist him.

Both these princes remained in a state of pupilage till the age of 23. Edward V. at the age of 13, was recommended by his father to the care of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>; who was declared protector by the privy-council. The statutes 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12, and 28 Henry VIII. c. 7, provided, that the successor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and under 18, or if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> and under 16, should be till such age in the governance of his or her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> mother, (if approved by the king), and such other counsellors as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> should by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> or otherwise appoint: and he accordingly appointed his 16 executors to have the government of his son Edward VI. and the kingdom, which executors elected the earl of Hartford protector.

He went thither, but was soon disgusted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>; and as the philosophy of Des Cartes began at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to make a noise through the lectures of Rohault, he conceived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for it, and gave himself up entirely to it. He frequented these lectures; and becoming an adept, went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a> in 1665, and read lectures in it himself. Having fine parts, a clear and fluent manner, and a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of making himself understood, he drew all sorts of people; the magistrates, the learned, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, and the very women, who now all affected to abjure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophy.

They applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Paris, who thought it expedient, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, to put a stop to the lectures; which accordingly were discontinued for several months. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Regis was spent in propagating the new philosophy. In 1690 he published a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of it, containing logic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, physics, and morals, in 3 vols. 4to, and written in French. It was reprinted the year after at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a>, with the addition of a discourse upon ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> philosophy. He wrote afterwards several pieces in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of his system; in which he had disputes with M. Huet, Du Hamel, Malebranche, and others. His works, though abounding with ingenuity and learning, have been disregarded, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the great discoveries and advancement in philosophical knowledge that have been since made.

The parochial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of Scotland are said to have been much superior at that period to what they are at present, and young men went from them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> furnished with philological learning to the different universities. The early progress of young Reid must have been very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, since he was qualified to profit by the lectures of the professors at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of twelve. He soon gave very striking proofs that he inherited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of his mother's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and was conspicuous among the students of mathematics, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> where that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> has always been cultivated with zeal and success. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> longer at the university than the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years, as he had been appointed to the office of librarian, which was a situation every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> agreeable to him, as it gave him such an ample opportunity of gratifying his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. About this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he became intimately attached to John Stewart, afterwards professor of mathematics in Marischal college, which connection greatly strengthened his predilection for mathematical studies.\nHe resigned the office of librarian in the year 1736, and accompanied Mr Stewart to England, when they paid a visit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, Oxford, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, and were introduced to several persons of the first literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of his relation to Dr David Gregory, he had ready access to the celebrated Martin Folkes, whose house might be said to contain many of the most interesting objects to be met with in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>.\n\nHe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Dr Bentley at Cambridge, with whose erudition he was much delighted, as well as amused with his vanity; and he also conversed frequently with Saunderson, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> mathematician. Dr Reid refers in his speculations to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>, as a singular phenomenon in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind.\n\nDr Reid maintained an uninterrupted friendship with the learned and amiable Mr Stewart till the year 1765, at which time Mr Stewart was carried off by a malignant fever. The circumstances attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of this excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> deeply wounded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of Dr Reid; for his wife and daughter were carried off by the same disorder, and buried with him in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s college of Aberdeen presented Dr Reid to the living of New-Machar in the year 1737; but such was the zeal of the people against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> at that time, that he not only met with violent opposition, but was also exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> danger. But his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the duties of his office was so exemplary, his temper so mild and forbearing, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, that in a short time he subdued their prejudices; and when at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> called in the course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> to a different situation, the very people who had been guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> and indecent outrages against him followed him, on his departure, with their benedictions and tears.\n\nIn 1740, he married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, daughter of his uncle, Dr George Reid, physician in London, after which his popularity at New-Machar very much increased. Her manners were so accommodating, and so numerous were her kind offices to the sick and the indigent, that the departure of the family from the neighbourhood was looked upon as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> misfortune. The manner in which several old men were accustomed to speak upon the subject is worthy of being kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>. \"We fought, said they, against Dr Reid when he came, and we would have fought for him when he went away.\"\n\nThe greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his residence at New-Machar was devoted to the most intense study, particularly directing his attention to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> perception, and of the other principles which constitute the basis of human knowledge. He unbended his mind by the amusements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">gardening</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, of which he was extremely fond, even in old age.\n\nThe professors of King's College, in the year 1752, made choice of Dr Reid to be professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, originating wholly from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> they were led to entertain of his talents and erudition. We are not acquainted with the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which he adopted and pursued in the course of his lectures; but his department at that period comprehended mathematics and physics, logic and ethics,\u2014a practice then followed in the other universities of Scotland, instead of appointing a professor for each distinct branch.\n\nDr Reid had not been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in Aberdeen, till in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with Dr John Gregory, he projected a literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> which continued for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of years, and met once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. The writings of Reid, Gregory, Campbell, Beattie and Gerard, evince the numerous advantages which the members derived from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, as they were in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of submitting such works as they intended for publication, to the test of friendly criticism.\n\nIt is perhaps not too much to assert, that of all the publications which appeared about this time, the Inquiry into the Human Mind by Dr Reid, discovered by far the greatest originality and profound thinking. It appears that he had conceived the plan, and deeply meditated upon it, long before its publication; yet without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of his literary associates, it is more than probable that his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> might have prevented him from giving it to the world.\n\nThe publication of Mr Hume's Treatise of Human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a>, in 1739, led him to question the principles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> received with regard to the human understanding. He admitted, when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>, but without any attentive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, the opinions on which Mr Hume's skepticism was raised; but when he carefully adverted to the consequences which these principles appeared to involve, he instantly began to suspect their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. To subvert the skeptical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of Mr Hume was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of Dr Reid's Inquiry, which he submitted to the examination of Mr Hume himself. That philosopher, even after he had seen some parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">Work</a>, discovers not a little of the Jewish spirit of unbelief that any good thing should come out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAZARETH\">Nazareth</a>; and considering his antagonist as a clergyman, and belonging to an order of men from whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> would not allow him to expect any soundness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> in matters of science, he betrays more than want of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, as Dr Reid's biographer expresses himself, when he says in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> very courteous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Blair, \"I wish that the parsons would confine themselves to their old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a> of worrying one another, and leave philosophers to argue with temper, moderation, and good manners.\" But though Mr Hume, as appears from the words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> quoted, was very angry that a clergyman should become a philosopher, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> perusal of the Inquiry, he seems to have held very different sentiments, when he wrote to the author himself in the following terms, \"By Dr Blair's means, I have been favoured with the perusal of your performance, which I have read with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and attention. It is certainly very rare, that a piece so deeply philosophical is wrote (written) with so much spirit, and affords so much entertainment to the reader; though I must still regret the disadvantages under which I read it, as I never had the whole performance at once before me, and could not be able fully to compare one part with another. To this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, chiefly, I ascribe some obscurities, which, in spite of your short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a>, still seem to hang over your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>. For I must do you the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to own, that when I entered into your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, no man appears to express himself with greater perspicuity than you do; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> which, above all others, is requisite in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of literature which you have cultivated.\u2014As I was desirous to be of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to you, I kept a watchful eye all along over your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>; but it is really so correct, and so good English, that I found not anything worth remarking. There is only one passage in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, where you make use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> hinder to do, instead of hinder from doing, which is the English one; but I could not find\nfind the passage when I sought for it. You may judge how unexceptionable the whole appeared to me, when I could remark so small a blemish.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> made on the minds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men by the publication of Dr Reid's Inquiry was as great as could reasonably be expected from the nature of his undertaking. It was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of the multitude, nor even addressed to them; and as it examined opinions with the utmost freedom which had obtained the sanction of the highest authorities, it had little prospect of conciliating the favour of the learned. Some, however, there were, who perceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of his views, and beheld in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> the true spirit and language of inductive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, which made proselytes of many, and was, by them, warmly recommended to the attention of others. The Inquiry of Dr Reid was so much esteemed by the learned body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> then in the university of Glasgow, that they gave him an invitation to the vacant professorship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>, in the year 1763. It was no doubt with a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of reluctance that he resolved to leave Aberdeen; yet so numerous were the allurements which Glasgow presented to a man of his extensive erudition and deep research, that he gave it the preference. That seminary of learning could then boast of a Moor, a Simson, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, a Leechman, the two Wilsons, father and son, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a>, discriminating Millar, with all of whom he was more or less intimate, and whose fascinating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> made him in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> forget that he was long acquainted with men of genius in the university of Aberdeen.\n\nDr Reid's merit as a public teacher arose principally from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> philosophy which is characteristic of his writings; and from his invincible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and perseverance in recommending such principles as he conceived to be of the last importance to human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. His style, too, was simple and perspicuous; his character grave and possessed of authority; and his students <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> in the doctrines which he inculcated, that he never failed to be heard with the most profound attention.\n\nIn the year 1773 his remarks on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>'s logic appeared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames's Sketches of the History of Man, of which he himself has favoured us with the following account. \"In attempting to give some account of the Analytics, and of the Topics of Aristotle, ingenuity obliges me to confess, that though I have often purposed to read the whole with care, and to understand what is intelligible, yet my courage and patience always failed before I had done. Why should I throw away so much time and painful attention upon a thing of so little use? <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> I had lived in those ages when the knowledge of Aristotle's Organon entitled a man to the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in philosophy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> might have induced me to employ upon it some years of painful study; and lest, I conceive, would not be sufficient. Such reflections as these always got the better of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> when the first ardour began to cool. All I can say is, that I have read some part of the different books with care, some slightly, and some perhaps not at all. I have glanced over the whole often; and when any thing attracted my attention have dipped into it till my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> was satisfied.\"\n\nBut in spite of his modest declarations, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of doubt with some, whether any of his publications does him more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> than his perspicuous view of this complicated system. It is unquestionably superior to any other analysis of the same writings we have yet seen, an opinion amply confirmed by the sentiments of different literary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> who were intimately acquainted with the works of Aristotle.\n\nDr Reid declined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> lectures in the university for some years before his death; and he devoted this period to the task of preparing for the press his great work, which was published in two volumes 4to, the first in 1785, entitled, \"Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man;\" and the second in 1788, entitled, \"Essays on the Active Powers of Man.\" His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">Quantity</a>, occasioned by reading a Treatise, in which Simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">Compound</a> Ratios are applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">Virtue</a> and Merit, was composed previous to the year 1748, and was published in the Philosophical Transactions of London for that year. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> affords some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> with regard to the progress of his speculations about this time. The Inquiry into the Human Mind, of which we have already taken notice appeared in 1764; and at this time he was complimented with the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">Divinity</a>.\n\nIn the year 1796 (the last of his mortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>), he was prevailed upon to spend with his friends at Edinburgh a few weeks during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. From that visit he returned to Glasgow in his usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and spirits, and for some time continued to devote a portion of his time to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> both of body and mind. About the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> the same year, he was seized with a violent disorder, with which he maintained a severe struggle; and this, together with repeated strokes of the palsy, put a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> period to his long and useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> on the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, and in the 87th year of his age.\n\nAs to his bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, few men have been more indebted to nature than Dr Reid. In this respect he was athletic and vigorous, and his muscular strength was uncommonly great; advantages which were powerfully seconded by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, exercise, and the unclouded serenity of his temper. Deep and collected thought was very conspicuous in his countenance, and all his looks were expressive of kindness and goodwill.\n\nWith respect to his character, his rectitude was inflexible and intrepid; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to truth was pure; and he had an entire command over all his passions, which he acquired by the unrestrained exertions of a long life. When, therefore, he found it necessary to dispute the conclusions of others in any of his writings, he never employed any expressions to irritate those whom he was anxious to convince, and the asperity of his opponents could not provoke him to reflect his spirit of liberality and good-humour; for he considered the intemperance with which controversy is usually carried on, as an enemy to the progress of useful knowledge, and as having done more harm to the practice than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the theory of morality. He uniformly maintained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of philosophy in private life, and he united in his character the most amiable modesty and gentleness, with the noblest spirit of independence. He never solicited any favours from the great, and all his academical or other preferments were conferred upon him by those who were real judges of his merit, and thought he deserved them. To a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>, cautious, and discriminating judgment, a singular patience and perseverance of thought,\nthought, and fixed attention to the operations of his own mind, he added the curiosity of a naturalist and the eyes of an observer, and of course his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> was accurate and extensive. His sensibility was of an active and lively nature, and wherever he could command the means of relieving the distressed, he always employed them with the utmost secrecy possible.\n\nHis works are now in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the public, and we believe we may venture to assert, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> always be much esteemed, while sound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> continues to be preferred to unintelligible jargon, sophistry, or impiety. He has divested <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a> of mystery, and rendered intelligible the most profound speculations, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and constant use of words in one determined sense. In the state in which he found the philosophical world, it was Dr Reid's opinion, that his talents could not be so usefully employed, as in combating the schemes of those who aimed at the complete subversion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and revealed. He apprehended the operations of his own mind with a clearness which gave to his language a perspicuity and precision that the language of Locke never possessed; and in this respect he is decidedly superior to all his predecessors.","sp":338,"ep":341},{"h":"REINS","t":"in Anatomy, the same with Kidneys.

With the view of prosecuting with greater advantage the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of Arabic, which had become with him a favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of pursuit, he travelled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> foot to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a>, where new difficulties attended him. While he remained in Leyden he was employed in arranging the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> belonging to the university; and for this labour he received a very small remuneration. During his residence here, part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was occupied in the translation of various essays from the German and French languages into Latin. These essays afterwards appeared in the Miscellanea Critica. About the same time also our learned author translated into Latin the whole of the Chariton from the Greek, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ABULFEDA\">Abulfeda</a> from the Arabic.\n\nHaving spent eight years at Leyden, Reiske was driven from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALUMNY\">calumny</a>, which it is said were excited against him chiefly by the younger Burman, in consequence of his critical strictures on the edition of Petronius published by that author; but before his departure from this learned seminary, he had obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of physic, which was conferred in a manner highly to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. He afterwards visited different parts of Germany, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> settled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time at Leipzig, where he remained for twelve years. But although he had received the appointment of professor of Arabic, the emoluments of his office were so scanty, that he had yet to struggle with all the difficulties attendant on poverty, and merely to procure a subsistence was obliged to engage in the humbler employments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> labour, and submit to the severe and ill-requited drudgery of editing works for bookellers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> contributing detached papers to periodical publications. About this time the Acta Eruditorum were greatly indebted to the labours of our author. But in the midst of all the difficulties and hardships now alluded to, he prepared and published a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of profound learning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> merit. This work, which extended to five volumes, appeared under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Animaeviiones in Auctores Graecos, and added much to our author's reputation.\n\nIn the year 1758, in consequence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Haltaufius, he obtained a situation, which was not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> but lucrative. This was the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> of the academy of Leipzig, in which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> during the remainder of his life. He was now raised above want, and being free from the difficulties and embarrassments which had hitherto constantly attended him, he was thus enabled in the midst of learned ease to prosecute his favourite studies.\n\nIn the year 1764 Reiske married E. C. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULLER\">Muller</a>, a woman of great learning, and of whom it is said that her knowledge, especially in Greek literature, was little inferior to that of her husband. In all his literary labours she was an useful associate; but the assistance which she contributed to his great work, the edition of the Greek Orators, was particularly valuable. Thus passed the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of the life of this learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. He died in 1774, possessing a very distinguished reputation as a scholar and a critic. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the works which he superintended and published is very great. The most approved are the following, \"Remarks upon Greek Authors,\" An \"Edition of the Greek Orators,\" in 12 vols. 8vo, which was completed by his widow, \"Dionysius Halicarnassensis,\" in 7 vols. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>'s Works,\" in 9 vols. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOCRITUS\">Theocritus</a>,\" &c.","sp":341,"ep":341},{"h":"REJOINDER","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, is the defendant's answer to the plaintiff's replication <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> reply.

During three years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> under Surenhusius, he made an uncommon progress in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a>, Syriac, Chaldee, and Arabic languages; and these languages were always his favourite study.

Thus BC (fig. 1.) may represent the sail of a ship, impelled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blowing in the direction DC. GO may be the direction of the ship's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>, or the line of her course. The wind strikes the sail in the direction GH <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to DC; the sail is urged or pressed in the direction GI, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to BC. But we are interested to know what tendency this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give the ship to move in the direction GO. This is the effective or relative impulse. Or BC may be the transverse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of the sail of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> wind-mill. This, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the machine, can move only in the direction GP, perpendicular to the direction of the wind; and it is only in this direction that the impulse produces the desired effect. Or BC may be half of the prow of a punt or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a>, riding at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> by means of the cable DC, attached to the prow C. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, GQ, parallel to DC, is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impulse which is employed in straining the cable.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> is the angle FGC contained between the direction of the stream FG and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> BC.\n\nThe angle of obliquity is the angle OGC contained between the plane and the direction GO, in which we wish to estimate the impulse.\n\nProp. II. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> impulse of a fluid on a plane surface, is to its absolute oblique impulse on the same surface, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> to the square of the sine of the angle of incidence.\n\nLet a stream of fluid, moving in the direction DC, (fig. 1.), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the plane BC. With the radius CB, describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABB\">ABB</a>; draw CA perpendicular to CE, and draw MNBS parallel to CE. Let the particle F, moving in the direction FG, meet the plane in G, and in FG produced take GH to represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the direct impulse, or the impulse which the particle would exert on the plane AC, by meeting it in V. Draw GI and HK perpendicular to BC, and HI perpendicular to GI. Also draw BR perpendicular to DC.\n\nThe force GH is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the two forces GI and GK; and GK being in the direction of the plane has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> share in the impulse. The absolute impulse, therefore, is represented by GI; the angle GHI is equal to FGC, the angle of incidence; and therefore GH is to GI as radius to the sine of the angle of incidence: Therefore the direct impulse of each particle or filament is to its absolute oblique impulse as radius to the sine of the angle of incidence. But further, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of particles or filaments which strike the surface AC, is to the number of those which strike the surface BC as AC to NC: for all the filaments between LA and MB go past the oblique surface BC without striking it. But BC : NC = rad. : sin. NBC, = rad. : sin. FGC, = rad. : sin. incidence. Now the whole impulse is as the impulse of each filament, and as the number of filaments exerting equal impulses jointly; therefore the whole direct impulse on AC is to the whole absolute impulse on BC, as the square of radius to the square of the sine of the angle of incidence.\n\nLet S express the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the surface, i the angle of incidence, o the angle of obliquity, v the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the fluid, and d its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a>. Let F represent the direct impulse, f the absolute oblique impulse, and \u03c6 the relative or effective impulse: And let the tabular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> and columns be considered as decimal fractions of the radius unity.\n\nThis proposition gives us \\( F : f = R^2 : \\sin^2 i = 1 : \\sin^2 i \\), and therefore \\( f = F \\times \\sin^2 i \\). Also, because impulses are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the extent of surface similarly impelled, we have, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, \\( f = FS \\times \\sin^2 i \\).\n\nThe first who published this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> was Pardies, in his Oeuvres de Mathematique, in 1673. We know that Newton had investigated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> of the Principia before 1670.\n\nProp. III. The direct impulse on any surface is to the effective oblique impulse on the same surface, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of radius to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, which has for its base the square of the sine of incidence, and the sine of obliquity for its height.\n\nFor,\nFor, when GH represents the direct impulse of a particle, GI is the absolute oblique impulse, and GO is the effective impulse in the direction GO: Now GI is to GO as radius to the sine of GIO, and GIO is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEMENT\">complement</a> of GIO, and is therefore equal to CGO, the angle of obliquity.\n\nTherefore \\( f : \\phi = R : \\sin O \\).\n\nBut \\( F : f = R^2 : \\sin^2 i \\).\n\nTherefore \\( F : \\phi = R^2 : \\sin^2 i \\times \\sin O \\), and \\( \\phi = F \\times \\sin^2 i \\times \\sin O \\).\n\nCor.\u2014The direct impulse on any surface is to the effective oblique impulse in the direction of the stream, as the cube of radius to the cube of the sine of incidence.\n\nFor draw IQ and GP perpendicular to GH; and IP perpendicular to GP; then the absolute impulse GI is equivalent to the impulse GQ in the direction of the stream, and GP, which may be called the transverse impulse. The angle GIO is evidently equal to the angle GHI, or FGC, the angle of incidence.\n\nTherefore \\( f : \\phi = GI : GQ = R : \\sin i \\).\n\nBut \\( F : f = R^2 : \\sin^2 i \\).\n\nTherefore \\( F : \\phi = R^2 : \\sin^2 i \\).\n\nAnd \\( \\phi = F \\times \\sin^2 i \\).\n\nBefore we proceed further, we shall consider the impulse on a surface which is also in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. This is evidently a frequent and an important case. It is perhaps the most frequent and important: It is the case of a ship under sail, and of a wind or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-mill at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nTherefore, let a stream of fluid, moving with the direction and velocity DE, meet a plane BC (fig. 2) which is moving parallel to itself in the direction and with the velocity DF: It is required to determine the impulse?\n\nNothing is more easy: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> actions of bodies depend on their relative motions only. The motion, DE of the fluid relative to BC, which is also in motion, is compounded of the real motion of the fluid and the opposite to the real motion of the body. Therefore produce DF till Df = DF, and complete the parallelogram Df'eE, and draw the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> De. The impulse on the plane is the same as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the plane were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>, and every particle of the fluid impelled it in the direction and with the velocity De; and may therefore be determined by the foregoing proposition. This proposition applies to every possible case; and we shall not before more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> on it, but reserve the important modification of the general proposition for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which shall occur in the practical applications of the whole doctrine of the impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESISTANCE_OF_FLUIDS\">resistance of <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>.\n\nProp. IV. The direct impulse of a stream of fluid, whose breadth is given, is to its oblique effective impulse in the direction of the stream, as the square of radius to the square of the sine of the angle of incidence.\n\nFor the number of filaments which occupy the oblique plane BC, would occupy the portion NC of a perpendicular plane, and therefore we have only to compare the perpendicular impulse on any point V with the effective impulse made by the same filament FV on the oblique plane at G. Now GH represents the impulse which this filament would make at V; and GQ is the effective impulse of the same filament at G, estimated in the direction GH of the stream; and GH is Resistance to GQ as GH\u00b2 to GI\u00b2, that is, as rad\u00b2 to sin\u00b2 i.\n\nCor. I. The effective impulse in the direction of the stream on any plane surface BC, is to the direct impulse on its base BR or SE, as the square of the sine of the angle of incidence to the square of the radius.\n\n2. If an isosceles wedge ACB (fig. 3.) be exposed to Fig. 3., a stream of fluid moving in the direction of its height CD, the impulse on the sides is to the direct impulse on the base as the square of half the base <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a> to the square of the side AC, or as the square of the sine of half the angle of the wedge to the square of the radius. For it is evident, that in this case the two transverse impulses, such as GP in fig. 1, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other, and the only impulse which can be observed is the sum of the two impulses, such as GQ of fig. 1, which are to be compared with the impulses on the two halves AD, DB of the base. Now AC : <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> = rad. : sin. ACD, and ACD is equal to the angle of incidence.\n\nTherefore, if the angle ACB is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angle, and ACD is half a right angle, the square of AC is twice the square of AD, and the impulse on the sides of a rectangular wedge is half the impulse on its base.\n\nAlso, if a cube ACBE (fig. 4.) be exposed to a Fig. 4., stream moving in a direction perpendicular to one of its sides, and then to a stream moving in a direction perpendicular to one of its diagonal planes, the impulse in the first case will be to the impulse in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> as \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) to 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">Call</a> the perpendicular impulse on a side \\( F_1 \\), and the perpendicular impulse on its diagonal plane \\( f_1 \\), and the effective oblique impulse on its sides \\( \\phi \\);\u2014we have\n\n\\[ F : f = AC : AB = 1 : \\sqrt{2}, \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXT\">text</a>{ and} \\]\n\n\\[ f : \\phi = AC : AD = 2 : 1. \\]\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[ F : \\phi = 2 : \\sqrt{2}, = \\sqrt{2} : 1, \\text{ or very nearly as } 10 \\text{ to } 7. \\]\n\nThe same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> will apply to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> whose base is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> polygon, and whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> is perpendicular to the base. If such a pyramid is exposed to a stream of fluid moving in the direction of the axis, the direct impulse on the base is to the effective impulse on the pyramid, as the square of the radius to the square of the sine of the angle which the axis makes with the sides of the pyramid.\n\nAnd, in like manner, the direct impulse on the base of a right cone is to the effective impulse on the conical surface, as the square of the radius to the square of the sine of half the angle at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERTEX\">vertex</a> of the cone. This is demonstrated, by supposing the cone to be a pyramid of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> number of sides.\n\nWe may in this manner compare the impulse on any polygonal surface with the impulse on its base, by comparing apart the impulses on each plane with those in their corresponding bases, and taking their sum.\n\nAnd we may compare the impulse on a curved surface with that on its base, by resolving the curved surface into elementary planes, each of which is impelled by an elementary filament of the stream.\n\nThe following beautiful proposition, given by Le Seur and Jaquier, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on the second book of Newton's Principia, with a few examples of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, will suffice for any further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>.\nProposition V. Let ADB (fig. 5.) be the section of a surface of simple curvature, such as is the surface of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>. Let this be exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a fluid moving in the direction AC. Let BC be the section of the plane (which we have called its base), perpendicular to the direction of the stream. In AC produced, take any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> CG; and on CG describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> CHG, and complete the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> BCGO. Through any point D of the curve draw ED parallel to AC, and meeting BC and OG in Q and P. Let DF touch the curve in D, and draw the chord GH parallel to DF, and HKM perpendicular to CG, meeting ED in M. Suppose this to be done for every point of the curve ADB, and let LMN be the curve which passes through all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of the parallels EDP and the corresponding perpendiculars HKM.\n\nThe effective impulse on the curve surface ADB in the direction of the stream, is to its direct impulse on the base BC as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> BCNL is to the rectangle BCGO.\n\nDraw edqmp parallel to EP and extremely near it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> Dd of the curve may be conceived as the section of an elementary plane, having the position of the tangent DF. The angle EDF is the angle of incidence of the filament EDe. This is equal to CGH, because ED, DF, are parallel to CG, GH; and (because CHG is a semicircle) CH is perpendicular to GH. Also CG : CH = CK, and CG : CK = CG^2 : CH^2 = rad^2 : <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>^2, CGH = rad^2 : fin^2 incid. Therefore if CG, or its equal DP, represent the direct impulse on the point Q of the base, CK, or its equal QM, will represent the effective impulse on the point D of the curve. And thus, QgP will represent the direct impulse of the filament on the element Qg of the base, and QgmM will represent the effective impulse of the same filament on the element Dd of the curve. And, as this is true of the whole curve ADB, the effective impulse on the whole curve will be represented by the area BCNML; and the direct impulse on the base will be represented by the rectangle BCGO; and therefore the impulse on the curved surface is to the impulse on the base as the area BLMNC is to the rectangle BOGC.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, from the construction, that if the tangent to the curve at A is perpendicular to AC, the point N will coincide with G. Also, if the tangent to the curve at B is parallel to AC, the point L will coincide with B.\n\nWhenever, therefore, the curve ADB is such that an equation can be had to exhibit the general relation between the abscissa AR and the ordinate DR, we shall deduce an equation which exhibits the relation between the abscissa CK and the ordinate KM of the curve LMN; and this will give us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of BLNC to BOGC.\n\nThus, if the surface is that of a cylinder, so that the curve BDAb (fig. 6.), which receives the impulse of the fluid, is a semicircle, make CG equal to AC, and construct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> as before. The curve BMG is a parabola, whose axis is CG, whose vertex is G, and whose parameter is equal to CG. For it is plain, that CG = DC, and GH = CQ = MK. And CG \u00d7 GK = GH^2 = KM^2. That is, the curve is such, that the square of the ordinate KM is equal to the rectangle of Refractance, the abscissa GK and a constant line GC; and it is therefore a parabola whose vertex is G. Now, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known, that the parabolic area BMGC is two thirds of the parallelogram BCGO. Therefore the impulse on the quadrant ADB is two thirds of the impulse on the base BC. The same may be said of the quadrant Adb and its base cb. Therefore, The impulse on a cylinder or half cylinder is two thirds of the direct impulse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> on a transverse plane through the axis; or it is two cylinders, thirds of the direct impulse on one side of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a> of the same breadth and height.\n\nProposition VI. If the body be a solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the revolution of the figure BDAC (fig. 5.) round the axis AC; and if it be exposed to the action of a stream of fluid moving in the direction of the axis AC; then the effective impulse in the direction of the stream is to the direct impulse on its base, as the solid generated by the revolution of the figure BLMNC round the axis CN to the cylinder generated by the revolution of the rectangle BOGC.\n\nThis scarcely needs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>. The figure ADBLMNA is a section of these solids by a plane passing through the axis; and what has been demonstrated of this section is true of every other, because they are all equal and similar. It is therefore true of the whole solids, and (their base) the circle generated by the revolution of BC round the axis AC.\n\nHence we easily deduce, that The impulse on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> on a sphere, is one half of the direct impulse on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> circle, or on and the base of a cylinder of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>.\n\nFor in this case the curve BMN (fig. 6.) which generates the solid expressing the impulse on the sphere is a parabola, and the solid is a parabolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONOID\">conoid</a>. Now this conoid is to the cylinder generated by the revolution of the rectangle BOGC round the axis CG, as the sum of all the circles generated by the revolution of ordinates to the parabola such as KM, to the sum of as many circles generated by the ordinates to the rectangle such as KT; or as the sum of all the squares described on the ordinates KM to the sum of as many squares described on the ordinates KT. Draw BG <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> MK in S. The square on MK is to the square on BC or TK as the abscissa GK to the abscissa GC (by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the parabola), or as SK to BC; because SK and BC are respectively equal to GK and GC. Therefore the sum of all the squares on ordinates, such as MK, is to the sum of as many squares on ordinates, such as TK, as the sum of all the lines SK to the sum of as many lines TK; that is, as one to two: and therefore the impulse on the sphere is one half of the direct impulse on its great circle.\n\nFrom the same construction we may very easily deduce a very curious and seemingly useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that of all conical bodies having the circle whose diameter is a cone, AB (fig. 3.) for its base, and FD for its height, the one which sustains the smallest impulse or meets with the smallest resistance is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUSTUM\">frustum</a> AGHB of a cone ACB so constructed, that EF being taken equal to ED, EA is equal to EC. This frustum, though more capacious than the cone AFB of the same height, will be least resisted.\n\nAlso, if the solid generated by the revolution of BDAC (fig. 5.) have its anterior part covered with a fruitum\nResistance frustum of a cone generated by the lines Da, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">aA</a>, forming the angle at a of 135 degrees; this fold, though more capacious than the included solid, will be less resisted.\n\nAnd, from the same principles, Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton determined the form of the curve ADB, which would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> the solid which, of all others of the same length and base, should have the least resistance.\n\nThere are curious and important deductions, but are not introduced here, for reasons which will soon appear.\n\nThe reader cannot fail to observe, that all that we have hitherto delivered on this subject, relates to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of different impulses or resistances. We have always compared the oblique impulses with the direct, and by their intervention we compare the oblique impulses with each other. But it remains to give absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> impulse; to which, as to an unit, we may refer every other. And as it is by their pressure that they become useful or hurtful, and they must be opposed by other pressures, it becomes extremely convenient to compare them all with that pressure with which we are most familiarly acquainted, the pressure of gravity.\n\nThe manner in which the comparison is made, is this. When a body advances in a fluid with a known velocity, it puts a known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the fluid into motion (as is supposed) with this velocity; and this is done in a known time. We have only to examine what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> will put this quantity of fluid into the same motion, by acting on it during the same time. This weight is conceived as equal to the resistance. Thus, let us suppose that a stream of water, moving at the rate of eight feet per second, is perpendicularly obstructed by a square foot of solid surface held fast in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Conceiving water to act in the manner of the hypothetical fluid now described, and to be without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, the whole effect is the gradual annihilation of the motion of eight cubic feet of water moving eight feet in a second. And this is done in a second of time. It is equivalent to the gradually putting eight cubic feet of water into motion with this velocity; and doing this by acting uniformly during a second. What weight is able to produce this effect?\n\nThe weight of eight feet of water, acting during a second on it, will, as is well known, give it the velocity of thirty-two feet per second; that is, four times greater. Therefore, the weight of the fourth part of eight cubic feet, that is, the weight of two cubic feet, acting during a second, will do the same thing, or the weight of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of water whose base is a square foot, and whose height is two feet. This will not only produce this effect in the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a> of the solid body, but it will also do it by the same degrees, as any one will clearly perceive, by attending to the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of water urged by one-fourth of its weight, and comparing this with the gradual production or extinction of motion in the fluid by the progress of the resisting surface.\n\nNow it is well known that eight cubic feet of water, by falling one foot, which it will do in one-fourth of a second, will acquire the velocity of eight feet per second by its weight; therefore the force which produces the same effect in a whole second is one-fourth of this. This force is therefore equal to the weight of a column of water, whose base is a square foot, and whose height is two feet; that is, twice the height necessary for acquiring the velocity of the motion by gravity.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> is the same whatever be the surface that is resisted, whatever be the fluid that resists, and whatever be the velocity of the motion. In this inductive and familiar manner we learn, that the direct impulse or resistance of an unelastic fluid on any plane surface, is equal to the weight of a column of the fluid having the surface for its base, and twice the full necessary for acquiring the velocity of the motion for its height: and if the fluid is considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, the impulse or resistance is twice as great. See Newt. Princip. B. II. prop. 35. and 38.\n\nIt now remains to compare this theory with experiment. Many have been made, both by Sir Isaac Newton and by subsequent writers. It is much to be lamented, that in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of such importance, both to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, there is such a disagreement in the results with each other. We shall mention the experiments which seem to have been made with the greatest judgement and care. Those of Sir Isaac Newton were chiefly made by the oscillations of pendulums in water, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of balls both in water and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. Many have been made by Mariotte (Trait\u00e9 de Mouvement des Eaux). Gravefande has published, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">System</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, experiments made on the resistance or impulsions on solids in the midst of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a> or canal. They are extremely well contrived, but are on so small a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> that they are of very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Daniel Bernoulli, and his pupil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCTOR\">Proctor</a> Kraft, have published, in the Comment. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACAD\">Acad</a>. Petropol, experiments on the impulse of a stream or vein of water from an orifice or tube: These are of great value. The Abb\u00e9 Boifut has published others of the same kind in his Hydrodynamique. Mr Robins has published, in his New Principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNNERY\">Gunnery</a>, many valuable experiments on the impulse and resistance of air. The Chev. de Borda, in the Mem. Acad. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, 1763 and 1767, has given experiments on the resistance of air and also of water, which are very interesting. The most complete collection of experiments on the resistance of water are those made at the public expense by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the academy of sciences, consisting of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> de Condorcet, Mr d'Alembert, Abb\u00e9 Boifut, and others. The Chev. de Buat, in his Hydraulique, has published some most curious and valuable experiments, where many important circumstances are taken notice of, which had never been attended to before, and which give a view of the subject totally different from what is usually taken of it. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> George d'Ulloa, in his Examine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIMO\">Maritimo</a>, has also given some important experiments, similar to those adduced by Bouguer in his Man\u0153uvre des Vaissaux, but leading to very different conclusions. All these should be consulted by such as would acquire a practical knowledge of this subject. We must content ourselves with giving their most general and steady results. Such as,\n\n1. It is very consonant to experiment that the resistances are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the squares of the velocities. When the velocities of water do not exceed a few feet per second, no sensible deviation is observed. In very small velocities the resistances are sensibly greater than in this proportion, and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> is plainly owing to the viscosity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> fluidity of water. Sir Isaac Newton has shown that the resistance arising from this cause...\nResistance, cause is constant, or the same in every velocity; and when he has taken off a certain part of the total resistance, he found the remainder was very exactly proportional to the square of the velocity. His experiments to this purpose were made with balls a very little heavier than water, so as to descend very slowly; and they were made with his usual care and accuracy, and may be depended on.\n\nIn the experiments made with bodies floating on the surface of water, there is an addition to the resistance arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INERTIA\">inertia</a> of the water. The water heaps up a little on the anterior surface of the floating body, and is depressed behind it. Hence arises a hydrostatical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a>, acting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with the true resistance. A similar thing is observed in the resistance of air, which is condensed before the body and rarefied behind it, and thus an additional resistance is produced by the unbalanced elasticity of the air; and also because the air, which is actually displaced, is denser than common air. These circumstances cause the resistances to increase faster than the squares of the velocities: but, even independent of this, there is an additional resistance arising from the tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> behind a very swift body; because the pressure of the surrounding fluid can only make the fluid fill the space left with a determined velocity.\n\nWe have had occasion to speak of this circumstance more particularly under Gunnery and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>, when considering very rapid motions. Mr Robins had remarked that the velocity at which the observed resistance of the air began to increase to prodigiously, was that of about 1100 or 1200 feet per second, and that this was the velocity with which air would rush into a void. He concluded, that when the velocity was greater than this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> was exposed to the additional resistance arising from the unbalanced statical pressure of the air, and that this constant quantity behaved to be added to the resistance arising from the air's inertia in all greater velocities. This is very reasonable: But he imagined that in smaller velocities there was no such unbalanced pressure. But this cannot be the case: for although in smaller velocities the air will still fill up the space behind the body, it will not fill it up with air of the same density. This would be to suppose the motion of the air into the deflected place to be instantaneous. There must therefore be a rarefaction behind the body, and a pressure backward; arising from unbalanced elasticity, independent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> on the anterior part. The condensation and rarefaction are caused by the same thing, viz. the limited elasticity of the air. Were this infinitely great, the smallest condensation before the body would be instantly diffused over the whole air, and so would the rarefaction, so that no pressure of unbalanced elasticity would be observed; but the elasticity is such as to propagate the condensation with the velocity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> only, i.e., the velocity of 142 feet per second. Therefore this additional resistance does not commence precisely at this velocity, but is sensible in all smaller velocities, as is very justly observed by Euler. But we are not yet able to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of its increase, although it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> which seems susceptible of a tolerably accurate solution.\n\nPrecisely similar to this is the resistance to the motion of floating bodies, arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> or gorging up of the water on their anterior surface, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> behind them. Were the gravity of the water infinite, while its inertia remains the same, the wave raised up at the prow of a ship would be instantly diffused over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, and it would therefore be infinitely small, as also the depression behind the poop. But this wave requires time for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>; and while it is not diffused, it acts by hydrostatical prelude. We are equally unable to ascertain the law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of this part of the resistance, the mechanism of waves being but very imperfectly understood. The height of the wave in the experiments of the French academy could not be measured with sufficient precision (being only observed en <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSANT\">passant</a>) for ascertaining its relation to the velocity. The chev. Buat attempted it in his experiments, but without success. This must evidently make a part of the resistance in all velocities: and it still remains an undecided question, \"What relation it bears to the velocities?\" When the solid body is wholly buried in the fluid, this accumulation does not take place, or at least not in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>: It may, however, be observed. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> may recollect, that in a very swift running stream a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> will produce a small swell above it; unless it lies very deep, a nice eye may still observe it. The water, on arriving at the obstacle, glides past it in every direction, and is deflected on all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>; and therefore what passes over it is also deflected upwards, and causes the water over it to rise above its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>. The nearer that the body is to the surface, the greater will be the perpendicular rise of the water, but it will be less diffused; and it is uncertain whether the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> will be greater or less. By the whole elevation we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the area of a perpendicular section of the elevation by a plane perpendicular to the direction of the stream. We are rather disposed to think that this area will be greatest when the body is near the surface. D'Ullon has attempted to consider this subject scientifically; and is of a very different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, which he confirms by the single experiment to be mentioned by and by. Mean time, it is evident, that if the water which glides past the body cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in behind it with sufficient velocity, for filling up the space behind, there must be a void there; and thus a hydrostatical pressure must be superadded to the resistance arising from the inertia of the water. All must have observed, that if the end of a stick held in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> be drawn slowly through the water, the water will fill the place left by the stick, and there will be no curled wave: but if the motion be very rapid, a hollow trough or gutter is left behind, and is not filled up till at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the stick, and the wave which forms its sides is very much broken and curled. The writer of this article has often looked into the water from the poop of a second rate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> when she was sailing 11 miles per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, which is a velocity of 16 feet per second nearly; and he not only observed that the back of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> was naked for about two feet below the load water-line, but also that the trough or wake made by the ship was filled up with water which was broken and foaming to a considerable depth, and to a considerable distance from the vessel: There must therefore have been a void. He never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the wake perfectly transparent (and therefore completely filled with water) when the velocity exceeded 9 or 10 feet per second. While this broken\nResistance. Broken water is observed, there can be no doubt that there is a void and an additional resistance. But even when the space left by the body, or the space behind a still body exposed to a stream, is completely filled, it may not be filled sufficiently fast, and there may be (and certainly is, as we shall see afterwards) a quantity of water behind the body, which is moving more slowly away than the rest, and therefore hangs in some shape by the body, and is dragged by it, increasing the resistance. The quantity of this must depend partly on the velocity of the body or stream, and partly on the rapidity with which the surrounding water comes in behind. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> must depend on the pressure of the surrounding water. It would appear, that when this adjoining pressure is very great, as must happen when the depth is great, the augmentation of resistance now spoken of would be less. Accordingly this appears in Newton's experiments, where the balls were less retarded as they were deeper under water.\n\nThese experiments are so simple in their nature, and were made with such care, and by a person so able to detect and appreciate every circumstance, that they deserve great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, and the conclusions legitimately drawn from them deserve to be considered as physical laws. We think that the present deduction is unexceptionable: for in the motion of balls, which hardly descend, their preponderancy being hardly sensible, the effect of depth must have borne a very great proportion to the whole resistance, and must have greatly influenced their motions; yet they were observed to fall as if the resistance had no way depended on the depth.\n\nThe same thing appears in Borda's experiments, where a sphere which was deeply immersed in the water was less resisted than one that moved with the same velocity near the surface; and this was very constant and regular in a course of experiments. D'Ulloa, however, affirms the contrary: He says that the resistance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, which was a foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, immersed one foot in a stream moving two feet per second, was 15 lbs. and the resistance to the same board, when immersed 2 feet in a stream moving 1\u00bd feet per second (in which case the surface was 2 feet), was 26\u00bd pounds (A).\n\nWe are very sorry that we cannot give a proper account of this theory of resistance by Don George Juan D'Ulloa, an author of great mathematical reputation, and the instructor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACADEMIES\">academies</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. We have not been able to procure either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> or the French translation, and judge of it only by an extract by Mr Prony in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a> Hydrodynamique, \u00a7 868, &c. The theory is enveloped (according to Mr Prony's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>) in the most complicated expressions, so that the physical principles are kept almost out of sight. When accommodated to the simplest possible case, it is nearly as follows.\n\nLet \\( o \\) be an elementary orifice or portion of the surface of the side of a vessel filled with a heavy fluid, and let \\( h \\) be its depth under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> surface of the fluid. Let \\( \\delta \\) be the density of the fluid, and \\( \\phi \\) the accelerative power of gravity, = 32 feet velocity acquired in a second.\n\nIt is known, says he, that the water would flow out at this hole with the velocity \\( u = \\sqrt{2gh} \\), and \\( u^2 = 2gh \\) and \\( h = \\frac{u^2}{2g} \\). It is also known that the pressure \\( p \\) on the orifice \\( o \\) is \\( \\phi \\delta h = \\phi \\delta \\frac{u^2}{2g} = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta ou^2 \\).\n\nNow, let this little surface \\( o \\) be supposed to move with the velocity \\( v \\). The fluid would meet it with the velocity \\( u + v \\), or \\( u - v \\), according as it moved in the opposite or in the same direction with the efflux. In the equation \\( p = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta ou^2 \\), substitute \\( u = v \\) for \\( u \\), and we have the pressure on \\( o = p = \\frac{1}{2} (\\delta ou^2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta o \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{2gh}}{\\sqrt{2g}} \\right)^2 \\).\n\nThis pressure is a weight, that is, a mass of matter \\( m \\) actuated by gravity \\( g \\), or \\( p = \\phi m \\), and \\( m = \\delta o \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{\\sqrt{2g}} \\right)^2 \\).\n\nThis elementary surface being immersed in a stagnant fluid, and moved with the velocity \\( v \\), will sustain on one side a pressure \\( \\delta o \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{\\sqrt{2g}} \\right)^2 \\), and on the other side a pressure \\( \\delta o \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{\\sqrt{2g}} \\right)^2 \\); and the sensible resistance will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of these two pressures, which is \\( \\delta o \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{h}} \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{2g}} \\) or \\( \\delta o \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{h}} \\frac{v}{8} \\), that is, \\( \\frac{\\delta o \\sqrt{hv}}{2} \\), because \\( \\sqrt{2g} = 8 \\); a quantity which is in the subduplicate ratio of the depth under the surface of the fluid, and the simple ratio of the velocity of the resisting surface jointly.\n\nThere is nothing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a> more certain than that the resistances are very nearly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUPLICATE\">duplicate</a> ratio of the velocities; and we cannot conceive by what experiments the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> author has supported this conclusion.\n\nBut there is, besides, what appears to us to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> defect in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. The equation excludes resistance in the case of a fluid without weight, gation. Now a theory of the resistance of fluids should exhibit the retardation arising from inertia alone, and should distinguish it from that arising from any other cause: and moreover, while it affirms an ultimate sensible resistance proportional (ceteris paribus) to the simple velocity, it affirms as a first principle that the pressure \\( p \\) is as \\( u = \\phi \\). It also gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the frictional pressures: for these (in the case of bodies immersed in our waters at least) are made up of the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> water, which is measured by \\( h \\), and the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, a constant quantity.\n\nWhatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> can be given for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> out with the principle that the pressure on the little surface \\( o \\), moving with the velocity \\( u \\), is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\delta o \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{h}}{\\sqrt{2g}} \\right)^2 \\), makes it indispensably necessary to take for the velocity \\( u \\), not that with which water would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from a hole whose depth under the surface is \\( h \\), but the velocity\n\n(A) There is something very unaccountable in these experiments. The resistances are much greater than any other author has observed.\nResistance, with which it will issue from a hole whose depth is \\( h + 33 \\) feet. Because the pressure of the atmosphere is equal to that of a column of water 33 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>: for this is the acknowledged velocity with which it would rush in to the void left by the body. If therefore this velocity (which does not exist) has any share in the effort, we must have for the fluxion of\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{h}v}{2\\varphi}, \\quad \\text{but} \\quad \\frac{4\\sqrt{h+33}v}{2\\varphi}.\n\\]\n\nThis would not only give pressure or resistances many times exceeding those that have been observed in our experiments, but would also totally change the proportions which this theory determines. It was at any rate improper to embarras an investigation, already very intricate, with the pressure of gravity, and with two motions of efflux, which do not exist, and are necessary for making the pressures in the ratio of \\( u + v^2 \\) and \\( u - v^2 \\).\n\nMr Prony has been at no pains to inform his readers of his reasons for adopting this theory of resistance, so contrary to all received opinions, and to the most distinct experiments. Those of the French academy, made under greater pressures, gave a much smaller resistance; and the very experiments adduced in support of this theory are extremely deficient, wanting fully one-third of what the theory requires. The resistances by experiment were 15\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and 26\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the theory required 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and 39. The equation, however, deduced from the theory is greatly deficient in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of the pressures caused by the accumulation and depression, stating the heights of them as \\( \\frac{v^2}{2g} \\). They can never be so high, because the heaped-up water flows off at the sides, and it also comes in behind by the sides; so that the pressure is much less than half the weight of a column whose height is \\( \\frac{v^2}{2g} \\); both because the accumulation and depression are less at the sides than in the middle, and because, when the body is wholly immersed, the accumulation is greatly diminished. Indeed in this case, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> equation does not include their effects, though as real in this case as when part of the body is above water.\n\nUpon the whole, we are somewhat surprised that an author of D'Ulloa's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> should have adopted a theory so unnecessarily and so improperly embarrassed with foreign circumstances; and that Mr Prony should have inferred it with the explanation by which he was to abide, in a work destined for practical use.\n\nThis point, or the effect of deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a>, is still much contested; and it is a received opinion, by many not accustomed to mathematical researches, that the resistance is greater in greater depths. This is affirmed as an important principle by Mr Gordon, author of a Theory of Naval Architecture; but on very vague and slight grounds; and the author seems unacquainted with the manner of reasoning on such subjects. It shall be considered afterwards.\n\nWith these corrections it may be asserted that theory and experiment agree very well in this respect, and that the resistance may be asserted to be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity.\n\nWe have been more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> on this subject, because it is the leading proposition in the theory of the action of fluids. Newton's demonstration of it takes no notice of the manner in which the various particles of the fluid are put in motion, or the motion which each in particular acquires. He only shows, that if there be nothing concerned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> but pure inertia, the sum total of the motions of the particles, estimated in the direction of the bodies motion, or that of the stream, will be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. It was therefore of importance to show that this part of the theory was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>. To do this, we had to consider the effect of every circumstance which could be combined with the inertia of the fluid. All these had been foreseen by that great man, and are most briefly, though perspicuously, mentioned in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-SCHOLIUM\">scholium</a> to prop. 36. B. II.\n\n2. It appears from a comparison of all the experiments, that the impulses and resistances are very nearly in the proportion of the surfaces. They appear, however, to increase somewhat faster than the surfaces. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEVALIER\">chevalier</a> Borda found that the resistance, with the same velocity, to a surface of\n\n| inches | was | instead of |\n|--------|-----|------------|\n| 9      | 17,535 | 9          |\n| 16     | 42,750 | 16         |\n| 36     | 104,737 | 36        |\n\nThe deviation in these experiments from the theory increases with the surface, and is probably much greater in the extensive surfaces of the sails of ships and windmills, and the hulls of ships.\n\n3. The resistances do by no means vary in the duplicate ratio of the sines of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of incidence.\n\nAs this is the most interesting circumstance, having a chief influence on all the particular modifications of the resistance of fluids, and as on this depends the whole theory of the construction and working of ships, and the action of water on our most important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>, and seems most immediately connected with the mechanism of fluids, it merits a very particular consideration. We cannot do a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> than by rendering more generally known the excellent experiments of the French academy.\n\nFifteen boxes or vessels were constructed, which were two feet wide, two feet deep, and four feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>. One of them was a parallelopiped of these dimensions; the French others had prows of a wedge-form, the angle ACB academy, (fig. 8.) varying by 12\u00b0 degrees from 12\u00b0 to 180\u00b0; so Fig. 8. that the angle of incidence increased by 6\u00b0 from one to another. These boxes were dragged across a very large basin of smooth water (in which they were immersed two feet) by means of a line passing over a wheel connected with a cylinder, from which the actuating weight was suspended. The motion became perfectly uniform after a very little way; and the time of passing over 96 French feet with this uniform motion was very carefully noted. The resistance was measured by the weight employed, after deducting a certain quantity (properly estimated) for friction, and for the accumulation of the water against the anterior surface. The results of the many experiments are given in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>; where column 1st contains the angle of the prow, column 2nd contains the resistance as given by the preceding theory, column 3rd contains the resistance exhibited in the experiments, and column 4th contains the deviation of the experiment from the theory.\nThe resistance to 1 square foot, French measure, moving with the velocity of 2,56 feet per second, was very nearly 7,625 pounds French.\n\nReducing these to English measures, we have the surface = 1,363 feet, the velocity of the motion equal to 2,726 feet per second, and the resistance equal to 8,234 pounds avoirdupois. The weight of a column of fresh water of this base, and having for its height the fall necessary for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> this velocity, is 8,264 pounds avoirdupois. The resistances to other velocities were accurately proportional to the squares of the velocities.\n\nThere is great diversity in the value which different authors have deduced for the absolute resistance of water from their experiments. In the value now given nothing is taken into account but the inertia of the water. The accumulation against the forepart of the box was carefully noted, and the flat side pressure backwards, arising from this cause, was subtracted from the whole resistance to the drag. There had not been a sufficient variety of experiments for discovering the share which tenacity and friction produced; so that the number of pounds set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> here may be considered as somewhat superior to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> effects of the inertia of the water. We think, upon the whole, that it is the most accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> yet given of the resistance to a body in motion: but we shall afterwards see reason for believing, that the impulse of a running stream having the same velocity is somewhat greater; and this is the form in which most of the experiments have been made.\n\nAlso observe, that the resistance here given is that to a vessel two feet broad and deep and four feet long. The resistance to a plane of two feet broad and deep would probably have exceeded this in the proportion of 15:22 to 14:54, for reasons we shall see afterwards.\n\nFrom the experiments of Chevalier Borda, it appears that a body of one foot square, French measure, and two feet long, having its centre 15 inches under water, moving three French feet per second, sustained a pressure of 14.54 French pounds, or 15.63 English. This reduced in the proportion of $3^2$ to $2.5^2$ gives 11.43 pounds, considerably exceeding the 8.24.\n\nMr Bouguer, in his *Man\u0153uvre des Vaiffeaux*, says, that he found the resistance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-water to a velocity of one foot to be 23 ounces poids des Marc.\n\nThe chevalier Borda found the resistance of sea-water to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of a cubic foot, moving against the water one foot per second, to be 21 ounces nearly. But this experiment is complicated: the wave was not deducted; Resistance, and it was not a plane, but a cube.\n\nDon George d'Ulloa found the impulse of a stream of sea-water, running two feet per second on a foot square, to be 15.5 pounds English measure. This greatly exceeds all the values given by others.\n\nFrom these experiments we learn, in the first place, consequently that the direct resistance to a motion of a plane surface ces from through water, is very nearly equal to the weight of a thin column of water having that surface for its base, and for its height the fall producing the velocity of the motion. This is but one half of the resistance determined by the preceding theory. It agrees, however, very well with the best experiments made by other philosophers on bodies totally immersed or surrounded by the fluid; and sufficiently shows, that there must be some fallacy in the principles or reasoning by which this result of the theory is supposed to be deduced. We shall have occasion to return to this again.\n\nBut we see that the effects of the obliquity of incidence deviate enormously from the theory, and that this deviation increases rapidly as the acuteness of the prow increases. In the prow of 60\u00b0 the deviation is nearly equal to the whole resistance pointed out by the theory, and in the prow of 12\u00b0 it is nearly 40 times greater than the theoretical resistance.\n\nThe resistance of the prow of 90\u00b0 should be one half the resistance of the base. We have not such a prow; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> between the resistance of the prow of 96\u00b0 and 84\u00b0 is 5790, instead of 500.\n\nThese experiments are very conform to those of other authors on plane surfaces. Mr Robins found the resistance of the air to a pyramid of 45\u00b0, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APEX\">apex</a> foremost, was to that of its base 1000 to 1411, instead of one to two. Chevalier Borda found the resistance of a cube, moving in water in the direction of the side, was to the oblique resistance, when it was moved in the direction of the diagonal, in the proportion of $\\frac{5}{7}$ to $\\frac{7}{5}$; whereas it should have been that of $\\sqrt{2}$ to 1, or of 10 to 7 nearly. He also found, that a wedge whose angle was 90\u00b0, moving in air, gave for the proportion of the resistances of the edge and base 7281 : 10000, instead of 5000 : 10000. Also, when the angle of the wedge was 60\u00b0, the resistances of the edge and base were 52 and 100, instead of 25 and 100.\n\nIn short, in all the cases of oblique plane surfaces, the resistances were greater than those which are assigned by the theory. The theoretical law agrees tolerably with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> in large angles of incidence, that is, in incidences not differing very far from the perpendicular; but in more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> prongs the resistances are more nearly proportional to the sines of incidence than to their squares.\n\nThe academicians deduced from these experiments an expression of the general value of the resistance, which corresponds tolerably well with observation. Thus let $x$ be the complement of the half angle of the prow, and let $P$ be the direct pressure or resistance, with an incidence of 90\u00b0, and $p$ the effective oblique pressure:\n\n$$p = P \\times \\cos^2 x + 3.153 \\left( \\frac{x}{6} \\right)^{3/2}.$$ \n\nThis gives for a prow of 12\u00b0 an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in defect about 1%, and in larger angles it is much nearer the truth; and this is exact enough for any practice.\n\nThis is an abundantly simple formula; but if we intro-\nResistance, with which it will issue from a hole whose depth is \\( h + 33 \\) feet. Because the pressure of the atmosphere is equal to that of a column of water 33 feet high; for this is the acknowledged velocity with which it would rush into the void left by the body. If therefore this velocity (which does not exist) has any share in the effort, we must have for the fluxion of pressure not \\( \\frac{4\\sqrt{h}}{\\sqrt{2\\phi}} \\), but \\( \\frac{4\\sqrt{h+33}}{\\sqrt{2\\phi}} \\). This would not only give pressure or resistances many times exceeding those that have been observed in our experiments, but would also totally change the proportions which this theory determines. It was at any rate improper to embarrass an investigation, already very intricate, with the pressure of gravity, and with two motions of efflux, which do not exist, and are necessary for making the pressures in the ratio of \\( u + v^2 \\) and \\( u - v^2 \\).\n\nMr Prony has been at no pains to inform his readers of his reasons for adopting this theory of resistance, contrary to all received opinions, and to the most distinct experiments. Those of the French academy, made under greater pressures, gave a much smaller resistance; and the very experiments adduced in support of this theory are extremely deficient, wanting fully one-third of what the theory requires. The resistances by experiment were 15 and 26, and the theory required 29 and 39. The equation, however, deduced from the theory is greatly deficient in the expression of the pressures caused by the accumulation and depression, stating the heights of them as \\( \\frac{v^2}{2\\phi} \\). They can never be so high, because the heap-up water flows off at the sides, and it also comes in behind by the sides; so that the pressure is much less than half the weight of a column whose height is \\( \\frac{v^2}{2\\phi} \\); both because the accumulation and depression are less at the sides than in the middle, and because, when the body is wholly immersed, the accumulation is greatly diminished. Indeed in this case, the final equation does not include their effects, though as real in this case as when part of the body is above water.\n\nUpon the whole, we are somewhat surprised that an author of D'Ulloa's eminence should have adopted a theory so unnecessarily and so improperly embarrassed with foreign circumstances; and that Mr Prony should have inferred it with the explanation by which he was to abide, in a work destined for practical use.\n\nThis point, or the effect of deep immersion, is still much contested; and it is a received opinion, by many not accustomed to mathematical researches, that the resistance is greater in greater depths. This is affirmed as an important principle by Mr Gordon, author of a Theory of Naval Architecture; but on very vague and flight grounds; and the author seems unacquainted with the manner of reasoning on such subjects. It shall be considered afterwards.\n\nWith these corrections it may be asserted that theory and experiment agree very well in this respect, and that the resistance may be inferred to be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity.\n\nWe have been more minute on this subject, because it is the leading proposition in the theory of the action of fluids. Newton's demonstration of it takes no notice of the manner in which the various particles of the fluid are put in motion, or the motion which each in particular acquires. He only shows, that if there be nothing concerned in the communication but pure inertia, the sum total of the motions of the particles, estimated in the direction of the bodies motion, or that of the stream, will be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. It was therefore of importance to show that this part of the theory was just. To do this, we had to consider the effect of every circumstance which could be combined with the inertia of the fluid. All these had been foreseen by that great man, and are most briefly, though perspicuously, mentioned in the last scholium to prop. 36. B. II.\n\n2. It appears from a comparison of all the experiments, that the impulses and resistances are very nearly in the proportion of the surfaces. They appear, however, to increase somewhat faster than the surfaces. The chevalier Borda found that the resistance, with the same velocity, to a surface of\n\n| inches | was | instead of |\n|-------|-----|-----------|\n| 9     | 17,535 | 9         |\n| 16    | 42,750 | 16        |\n| 36    | 104,737 | 36       |\n\nThe deviation in these experiments from the theory increases with the surface, and is probably much greater in the extensive surfaces of the sails of ships and windmills, and the hulls of ships.\n\n3. The resistances do by no means vary in the duplicate ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence.\n\nAs this is the most interesting circumstance, having a chief influence on all the particular modifications of the resistance of fluids, and as on this depends the whole theory of the construction and working of ships, and the action of water on our most important machines, and seems most immediately connected with the mechanism of fluids, it merits a very particular consideration. We cannot do a greater service than by rendering more generally known the excellent experiments of the French academy.\n\nFifteen boxes or vessels were constructed, which were exactly two feet wide, two feet deep, and four feet long. One of them was a parallelopiped of these dimensions; the French others had praws of a wedge form, the angle ACB being (fig. 8.) varying by 12 degrees from 120 to 180; so that the angle of incidence increased by 6\u00b0 from one to another. These boxes were dragged across a very large basin of smooth water (in which they were immersed two feet) by means of a line passing over a wheel connected with a cylinder, from which the actuating weight was suspended. The motion became perfectly uniform after a very little way; and the time of passing over 96 French feet with this uniform motion was very carefully noted. The resistance was measured by the weight employed, after deducting a certain quantity (properly estimated) for friction, and for the accumulation of the water against the anterior surface. The results of the many experiments are given in the following table; where column 1st contains the angle of the prow, column 2nd contains the resistance as given by the preceding theory, column 3rd contains the resistance exhibited in the experiments, and column 4th contains the deviation of the experiment from the theory.\nThe resistance to 1 square foot, French measure, moving with the velocity of 2,56 feet per second, was very nearly 7,625 pounds French.\n\nReducing these to English measures, we have the surface = 1,363 feet, the velocity of the motion equal to 2,726 feet per second, and the resistance equal to 8,234 pounds avoirdupois. The weight of a column of fresh water of this base, and having for its height the full necessary for communicating this velocity, is 8,264 pounds avoirdupois. The resistances to other velocities were accurately proportional to the squares of the velocities.\n\nThere is great diversity in the value which different authors have deduced for the absolute resistance of water from their experiments. In the value now given nothing is taken into account but the inertia of the water. The accumulation against the forepart of the box was carefully noted, and the flatish pressure backwards, arising from this cause, was subtracted from the whole resistance to the drag. There had not been a sufficient variety of experiments for discovering the share which tenacity and friction produced; so that the number of pounds set down here may be considered as somewhat superior to the mere effects of the inertia of the water. We think, upon the whole, that it is the most accurate determination yet given of the resistance to a body in motion: but we shall afterwards see reason for believing, that the impulse of a running stream having the same velocity is somewhat greater; and this is the form in which most of the experiments have been made.\n\nAlso observe, that the resistance here given is that to a vessel two feet broad and deep and four feet long. The resistance to a plane of two feet broad and deep would probably have exceeded this in the proportion of 15:22 to 14:54, for reasons we shall see afterwards.\n\nFrom the experiments of Chevalier Borda, it appears that a body of one foot square, French measure, and two feet long, having its centre 15 inches under water, moving three French feet per second, sustained a pressure of 14.54 French pounds, or 15.63 English. This reduced in the proportion of 3:1 to 2.56 gives 11.43 pounds, considerably exceeding the 8.24.\n\nMr Bouguer, in his Man\u0153uvre des Vaiffeaux, says, that he found the resistance of sea-water to a velocity of one foot to be 23 ounces poids des Marc.\n\nThe chevalier Borda found the resistance of sea-water to the face of a cubic foot, moving against the water one foot per second, to be 21 ounces nearly. But this experiment is complicated: the wave was not deducted; Resistance, and it was not a plane, but a cube.\n\nDon George d'Ulloa found the impulse of a stream of sea-water, running two feet per second on a foot square, to be 15.5 pounds English measure. This greatly exceeds all the values given by others.\n\nFrom these experiments we learn, in the first place, consequently that the direct resistance to a motion of a plane surface ces from through water, is very nearly equal to the weight of a thin column of water having that surface for its base, and for its height the fall producing the velocity of the motion. This is but one half of the resistance determined by the preceding theory. It agrees, however, very well with the best experiments made by other philosophers on bodies totally immersed or surrounded by the fluid; and sufficiently shows, that there must be some fallacy in the principles or reasoning by which this result of the theory is supposed to be deduced. We shall have occasion to return to this again.\n\nBut we see that the effects of the obliquity of incidence deviate enormously from the theory, and that this deviation increases rapidly as the acuteness of the prow increases. In the prow of 60\u00b0 the deviation is nearly equal to the whole resistance pointed out by the theory, and in the prow of 12\u00b0 it is nearly 40 times greater than the theoretical resistance.\n\nThe resistance of the prow of 90\u00b0 should be one half the resistance of the base. We have not such a prow; but the medium between the resistance of the prow of 96\u00b0 and 84\u00b0 is 5790, instead of 500.\n\nThese experiments are very conform to those of other authors on plane surfaces. Mr Robins found the resistance of the air to a pyramid of 45\u00b0, with its apex foremost, was to that of its base as 1000 to 1411, instead of one to two. Chevalier Borda found the resistance of a cube, moving in water in the direction of the side, was to the oblique resistance, when it was moved in the direction of the diagonal, in the proportion of 5:7 to 7:5, whereas it should have been that of \u221a2 to 1, or 10 to 7 nearly. He also found, that a wedge whose angle was 90\u00b0, moving in air, gave for the proportion of the resistances of the edge and base 7281 : 10000, instead of 5000 : 10000. Also, when the angle of the wedge was 60\u00b0, the resistances of the edge and base were 52 and 100, instead of 25 and 100.\n\nIn short, in all the cases of oblique plane surfaces, the resistances were greater than those which are assigned by the theory. The theoretical law agrees tolerably with observation in large angles of incidence, that is, in incidences not differing very far from the perpendicular; but in more acute prisms the resistances are more nearly proportional to the sines of incidence than to their squares.\n\nThe academicians deduced from these experiments an expression of the general value of the resistance, which corresponds tolerably well with observation. Thus let x be the complement of the half angle of the prow, and let P be the direct pressure or resistance, with an incidence of 90\u00b0, and p the effective oblique pressure: then \\( p = P \\times \\cos^2 x + 3.75 \\left( \\frac{x}{6} \\right)^{3/2} \\). This gives for a prow of 12\u00b0 an error in defect about \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\), and in larger angles it is much nearer the truth; and this is exact enough for any practice.\n\nThis is an abundantly simple formula; but if we intro-\nintroduce it in our calculations of the resistances of curvi-\nlineal prongs, it renders them so complicated as to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AL\">al</a>-\nmost useless; and what is worse, when the calculation\nis completed for a curvilinear prong, the resistance which\nresults is found to differ widely from experiment. This\nshows that the motion of the fluid is so modified by the\naction of the most prominent part of the prong, that its\nimpulse on what succeeds is greatly affected, so that we\nare not allowed to consider the prong as composed of a\nnumber of parts, each of which is affected as if it were\ndetached from all the rest.\n\nAs the very nature of naval architecture seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RE\">re</a>-\nquire curvilinear forms, in order to give the necessary\nstrength, it seemed of importance to examine more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">par</a>-\nticularly the deviations of the resistances of such prongs\nfrom the resistances assigned by the theory. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-ACA\">aca</a>-\ndemicians therefore made vessels with prongs of a cylin-\ndrical shape; one of these was a half cylinder, and the\nother was one-third of a cylinder, both having the same\nbreadth, viz. two feet, the same depth, also two feet,\nand the same length, four feet. The resistance of the\nhalf cylinder was to the resistance of the perpendicular\nprong in the proportion of 13 to 25, instead of being as\n13 to 19.5. The chevalier Borda found nearly the\nsame ratio of the resistances of the half cylinder, and its\ndiametrical plane when moved in air. He also com-\npared the resistances of two prisms or wedges, of the same\nbreadth and height. The first had its sides plane, in-\nclined to the base in angles of 60\u00b0; the second had its\nsides portions of cylinders, of which the planes were the\nchords, that is, their sections were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of circles of\n60\u00b0. Their resistances were as 133 to 100, instead of\nbeing as 133 to 220, as required by the theory; and as\nthe resistance of the first was greater in proportion to\nthat of the base than the theory allows, the resistance of\nthe last was less.\n\nMr Robins found the resistance of a sphere moving\nin air to be to the resistance of its great circle as 1 to\n2.27; whereas theory requires them to be as 1 to 2.\nHe found, at the same time, that the absolute resistance\nwas greater than the weight of a cylinder of air of the\nsame diameter, and having the height necessary for ac-\nquiring the velocity. It was greater in the proportion\nof 49 to 40 nearly.\n\nBorda found the resistance of the sphere moving in\nwater to be to that of its great circle as 1000 to 2508,\nand it was one-ninth greater than the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COL\">col</a>-\numn of water whose height was that necessary for pro-\nducing the velocity. He also found the resistance of air\nto the sphere was to its resistance to its great circle as 1\nto 2.45.\n\nIt appears, on the whole, that the theory gives the\nresistance of oblique plane surfaces too small, and that\nof curved surfaces too great; and that it is quite unfit\nfor ascertaining the modifications of resistance arising\nfrom the figure of the body. The most prominent part\nof the prong changes the action of the fluid on the suc-\nceeding parts, rendering it totally different from what it\nwould be were that part detached from the rest, and ex-\nposed to the stream with the same obliquity. It is no\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, therefore, to deduce any formula from the\nvaluable experiments of the French academy. The ex-\nperiments themselves are of great importance, because\nthey give us the impulses on plane surfaces with every\nobliquity. They therefore put it in our power to select\nthe most proper obliquity in a thousand important cases.\n\nBy appealing to them, we can tell what is the proper\nangle of the sail for producing the greatest impulse in the\ndirection of the ship's course; or the best inclination of\nthe sail of a wind-mill, or the best inclination of the\nfloat of a water-wheel, &c., &c. These deductions will\nbe made in their proper places in the course of this\nwork. We see also, that the deviation from the simple\ntheory is not very considerable till the obliquity is\ngreat; and that, in the inclinations which other circum-\nstances would induce us to give to the floats of water-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, the sails of wind-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, and the like, the results\nof the theory are sufficiently agreeable to experiment,\nfor rendering this theory of very great use in the con-\nstruction of machines. Its great defect is in the impul-\nsions on curved surfaces, which puts a stop to our im-\nprovement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of naval architecture, and the\nworking of ships.\n\nBut it is not enough to detect the faults of the theo-\nry: we should try to amend it, or to substitute anoth-\ner. It is a pity that so much ingenuity should have\nbeen thrown away in the application of a theory so de-\nfective. Mathematicians were seduced, as has been al-\nready observed, by the opportunity which it gave for\nexercising their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a>, which was a new thing at the\ntime of publishing this theory. Newton saw clearly\nthe defects of it, and makes no use of any part of it\nin his subsequent discussions, and plainly has used it\nmerely as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INTRODUCTION\">introduction</a>, in order to give some gene-\nral notions in a subject quite new, and to give a demon-\nstration of one leading truth, viz. the proportionality of\nthe impulsions to the squares of the velocities. While we\nprofess the highest respect for the talents and labours of\nthe great mathematicians who have followed New-\nton in this most difficult research, we cannot help being\nsorry that some of the greatest of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to\nattach themselves to a theory which he neglected, mere-\nly because it afforded an opportunity of displaying their\nprofound knowledge of the new calculus, of which they\nwere willing to ascribe the discovery to Leibnitz. It\nhas been in a great measure owing to this that we have\nbeen so late in discovering our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the sub-\nject. Newton had himself pointed out all the defects\nof this theory; and he set himself to work to discover\nanother which should be more conformable to the na-\nture of things, retaining only such deductions from the\none as his great sagacity assured him would stand the\ntest of experiment. Even in this he seems to have been\nmistaken by his followers. He retained the propor-\ntionality of the resistance to the square of the velocity.\nThis they have endeavoured to demonstrate in a man-\nner conformable to Newton's determination of the\noblique impulsions of fluids; and under the cover of the\nagreement of this proposition with experiment, they in-\ntroduced into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of expression, and even\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, which is inconsistent with all accurate\nnotions of these subjects. Newton's proposition was,\nthat the motions communicated to the fluid, and there-\nfore the motions lost by the body, in equal times, were\nas the squares of the velocities; and he conceived these\nas proper measures of the resistances. It is a matter of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that the forces or pressures by which a body\nmust be supported in opposition to the impulsions of\nfluids, are in this very proportion. In determining the\nproportion of the direct and oblique resistances of plane\nsurfaces,\nResistance surfaces, he considers the resistances to arise from mutual collisions of the surface and fluid, repeated at intervals of time too small to be perceived. But in making this comparison, he has no occasion whatever to consider this repetition; and when he assigns the proportion between the resistance of a cone and of its base, he, in fact, assigns the proportion between two simultaneous and instantaneous impulses. But the mathematicians who followed him have considered this repetition as equivalent to an augmentation of the initial or first impulse; and in this way have attempted to demonstrate that the resistances are as the squares of the velocities.\n\nWhen the velocity is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a>, each impulse is double, and the number in a given time is double; therefore, say they, the resistance, and the force which will withstand it, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a>; and observation confirms their deduction: yet nothing is more gratuitous and illogical. It is very true that the resistance, conceived as Newton conceives it, the laws of motion sustained by a body moving in the fluid, is quadruple; but the instantaneous impulse, and the force which can withstand it, is, by all the laws of mechanics, only double. What is the force which can withstand a double impulse? Nothing but a double impulse. Nothing but impulse can be opposed to impulse; and it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> misconception to think of stating any kind of comparison between impulse and prelure. It is this which has given rise to much jargon and false reasoning about the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERCUSSION\">percussion</a>. This is stated as infinitely greater than any prelure, and as equivalent to a prelure infinitely repeated. It forced the abettors of these doctrines at least to deny the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of all prelure whatever, and to assert that all motion, and tendency to motion, was the result of impulse. The celebrated Euler, perhaps the first mathematician, and the lowest philosopher, of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, says, \"since motion and impulse are seen to exist, and since we see that by means of motion prelure may be produced, as when a body in motion strikes another, or as when a body moved in a curved channel presses upon it, merely in consequence of its curvilinear motion, and the exertion of a centrifugal force; and since Nature is most wisely economical in all her operations; it is absurd to suppose that prelure, or tendency to motion, has any other origin; and it is the business of a philosopher to discover by what motion any observed prelure is produced.\" Whenever any prelure is observed, such as the prelure of gravity, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, condensed air, nay, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and of elasticity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> themselves, however disparate, nay, opposite, the philosopher must immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> about, and contrive a set of motions (creating pro re nata the movers) which will produce a prelure like the one observed. Having pleased his fancy with this, he cries out ingenia \"this will produce the prelure?\" et frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora, \"therefore in this way the prelure is produced.\" Thus the vortices of Descartes are brought back in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>, and have produced vortices without number, which fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a> with motion and prelure.\n\nSuch bold attempts to overturn long-received doctrines in mechanics, could not be received without much criticism and opposition; and many able dissertations appeared from time to time in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the common doctrines. In consequence of the many objections to the comparison of pure prelure with pure percussion or impulse, John Bernoulli and others were at last obliged to assert that there were no perfectly hard bodies in nature, nor could be, but that all bodies were elastic; and that in the communication of motion by percussion, the velocities of both bodies were gradually changed by their mutual elasticity acting during the finite but imperceptible time of the collision. This was, in fact, giving up the whole argument, and banishing percussion, while their aim was to get rid of prelure. For what is elasticity but a prelure? and how shall it be produced? To act in this instance, must it arise from a still smaller impulse? But this will require another elasticity, and so on without end.\n\nThese are all legitimate consequences of this attempt to state a comparison between percussion and prelure. Numberless experiments have been made to confirm the statement; and there is hardly an itinerant lecturing showman who does not exhibit among his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> Gravelande's machine (Vol. I. plate xxxv. fig. 4.). But nothing affords so specious an argument as the experimented proportionality of the impulse of fluids to the square of the velocity. Here is every appearance of the accumulation of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFINITY\">infinity</a> of minute impulses, in the known ratio of the velocity, each to each, producing prelures which are in the ratio of the squares of the velocities.\n\nThe prelures are observed; but the impulses or percussions, whose accumulation produces these prelures, are only supposed. The rare fluid, introduced by Newton for the purpose already mentioned, either does not exist in nature, or does not act in the manner we have said, the particles making their impulse, and then escaping through among the rest without affecting their motion. We cannot indeed lay what may be the proportion between the diameter and the distance of the particles: the first may be incomparably smaller than the second, even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, the densest fluid which we are familiarly acquainted with: but although they do not touch each other, they act nearly as if they did, in consequence of their mutual attractions and repulsions. We have seen air a thousand times rarer in some experiments than in others, and therefore the distance of the particles at least ten times greater than their diameters; and yet, in this rare state, it propagates all prelures or impulses made on any part of it to a great distance, almost in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>. It cannot be, therefore, that fluids act on bodies by impulse. It is very possible to conceive a fluid advancing with a flat surface against the flat surface of a solid. The very first and superficial particles may make an impulse; and if they were annihilated, the next might do the same: and if the velocity were double, these impulses would be double, and would be withstanded by a double force, and not a quadruple, as is observed; and this very circumstance, that a quadruple force is necessary, should have made us conclude that it was not to impulse that this force was opposed. The first particles having made their stroke, and not being annihilated, must escape laterally. In their escaping they effectually prevent every farther impulse, because they come in the way of those filaments which would have struck the body. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> seems to be somewhat as follows:\n\nWhen the flat surface of the fluid has come into contact with the plane surface AD (fig. 7.), perpendicular to the direction DC of their motion, they must deflect to\nResistance to both sides equally, and in equal portions, because no reason can be assigned why more should go to either side. By this means the filament EF, which would have struck the surface in G, is deflected before it arrives at the surface, and describes a curved path EFIHK, continuing its rectilineal motion to I, where it is intercepted by a filament immediately adjoining to EF, on the side of the middle filament DC. The different particles of DC may be supposed to impinge in succession at C, and to be deflected at right angles; and gliding along CB, to escape at B. Each filament in succession, outwards from DC, is deflected in its turn; and being hindered from even touching the surface CB, it glides off in a direction parallel to it; and thus EF is deflected in I, moves parallel to CB from I to H, and is again deflected at right angles, and describes HK parallel to DC. The same thing may be supposed to happen on the other side of DC.\n\nAnd thus it would appear, that except two filaments immediately adjoining to the line DC, which bifurcates the surface at right angles, no part of the fluid makes any impulse on the surface AB. All the other filaments are merely pressed against it by the lateral filaments without them, which they turn aside, and prevent from striking the surface.\n\nIn like manner, when the fluid strikes the edge of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a> or wedge ACB (fig. 8.), it cannot be said that any real impulse is made. Nothing hinders us from supposing C a mathematical angle or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVISIBLE\">indivisible</a> point, not susceptible of any impulse, and serving merely to divide the stream. Each filament EF is effectually prevented from impinging at G in the line of its direction, and with the obliquity of incidence EGC, by the filaments between EF and DC, which glide along the surface CA; and it may be supposed to be deflected when it comes to the line CF which bifurcates the angle DCA, and again deflected and rendered parallel to DC at I. The same thing happens on the other side of DC; and we cannot in that case assert that there is any impulse.\n\nWe now see plainly how the ordinary theory must be totally unfit for furnishing principles of naval architecture, even although a formula could be deduced from such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments as those of the French Academy. Although we should know precisely the impulse, or, to speak now more cautiously, the action, of the fluid on a surface GL (fig. 9.) of any obliquity, when it is alone, detached from all others, we cannot in the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> tell what will be the action of part of a stream or fluid advancing towards it, with the same obliquity, when it is preceded by an adjoining surface CG, having a different inclination; for the fluid will not glide along GL in the same manner as if it made part of a more extensive surface having the same inclination. The previous deflections are extremely different in these two cases; and the previous deflections are the only changes which we can observe in the motions of the fluid, and the only causes of that pressure which we observe the body to sustain, and which we call the impulse on it. This theory must, therefore, be quite unfit for ascertaining the action on a curved surface, which may be considered as made up of an indefinite number of succesive planes.\n\nWe now see with equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> how it happens that the action of fluids on solid bodies may and must be opposed by pressures, and may be compared with and measured by the pressure of gravity. We are not comparing forces of different kinds, perfections with prelusions, but prelusions with each other. Let us see whether this view of the subject will afford us any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of comparison or absolute measurement.\n\nWhen a filament of fluid, that is, a row of corpuscles, are turned out of their course EF (fig. 7.), and forced Fig. 7. to take another course IH, force is required to produce this change of direction. The filament is prevented from proceeding by other filaments which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> between it and the body, and which deflect it in the same manner as if it were contained in a bended tube, and it will press on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> filament next to it as it would press on the concave side of the tube. Suppose such a bended tube ABE (fig. 10.), and that a ball A is projected Fig. 10. along it with any velocity, and moves in it without friction: it is demonstrated, in elementary mechanics, that the ball will move with undiminished velocity, and will press on every point, such as B, of the concave side of the tube, in a direction BF perpendicular to the plane CBD, which touches the tube in the point B. This pressure on the adjoining filament, on the concave side of its path, must be withstood by that filament which deflects it; and it must be propagated across that filament to the next, and thus augment the pressure upon that next filament already pressed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a> of the intermediate filament; and thus there is a pressure towards the middle filament, and towards the body, arising from the deflection of all the outer filaments; and their accumulated sum must be conceived as immediately exerted on the middle filaments and on the body, because a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> fluid transmits every pressure undiminished.\n\nThe pressure BF is equivalent to the two BH, BG, one of which is perpendicular, and the other parallel, to the direction of the original motion. By the first (taken in any point of the curvilinear motion of any filament), the two halves of the stream are pressed together; and in the case of fig. 7. and 8. exactly balance each other. But the prelusions, such as BG, must be ultimately withstood by the surface ACB; and it is by these accumulated prelusions that the solid body is urged down the stream; and it is these accumulated prelusions which we observe and measure in our experiments. We shall anticipate a little, and say that it is most easily demonstrated, that when a ball A (fig. 10.) moves with undiminished velocity in a tube so incurvated that its axis at E is at right angles to its axis at A, the accumulated action of the prelusions, such as BG, taken for every point of the path, is precisely equal to the force which would produce or extinguish the original motion.\n\nThis being the case, it follows most obviously, that if the two motions of the filaments are such as we have described and represented by fig. 7., the whole pressure in the direction of the stream, that is, the whole pressure which can be observed on the surface, is equal to the weight of a column of fluid having the surface for its base, and twice the fall productive of the velocity for its height, precisely as Newton deduced it from other considerations; and it seems to make no odds whether the fluid be elastic or unelastic, if the deflections and velocities are the same. Now it is a fact, that no difference in this respect can be observed in the actions of air and water; and this had always appeared a great defect in Newton's theory: but it was only a defect of\nResistance, the theory attributed to him. But it is also true, that the observed action is but one-half of what is just now deduced from this improved view of the subject. Whence arises this difference? The reason is this: We have given a very erroneous account of the motions of the filaments. A filament EF does not move as represented in fig. 7, with two rectangular inflections at I and at H, and a path IH between them parallel to CB. The process of nature is more like what is represented in fig. 11. It is observed, that at the anterior part of the body AB, there remains a quantity of fluid ADB, almost, if not altogether flagrant, of a singular shape, having two curved concave sides AaD, BbD, along which the middle filaments glide. This fluid is very slowly changed.\n\nThe late Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Knowles, an officer of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, equally eminent for his scientific professional knowledge and for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> talents, made many beautiful experiments for ascertaining the paths of the filaments of water. At a distance up the stream, he allowed small jets of a coloured fluid, which did not mix with water, to make part of the stream; and the experiments were made in troughs with sides and bottom of plate-glass. A small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> was placed at a considerable height above, by which the shadows of the coloured filaments were most distinctly projected on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> plane held below the trough, so that they were accurately drawn with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>. A few important particulars may be here mentioned.\n\nThe full water ADC, fig. 11, lasted for a long while before it was renewed; and it seemed to be gradually wasted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ABRASION\">abrasion</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of the surrounding water, which gradually licked away the outer parts from D to A and B; and it seemed to renew itself in the direction CD, opposite to the motion of the stream. There was, however, a considerable intricacy and eddy in this motion. Some (seemingly superficial) water was continually, but slowly, flowing outward from the line DC, while other water was seen within and below it, coming inwards and going backwards.\n\nThe coloured lateral filaments were most constant in their form, while the body was the same, although the velocity was in some cases quadrupled. Any change which this produced seemed confined to the superficial filaments.\n\nAs the filaments were deflected, they were also constricted, that is, the curved parts of the filaments were nearer each other than the parallel straight filaments up the stream; and this constriction was more considerable as the prow was more obtuse and the deflection greater.\n\nThe inner filaments were ultimately more deflected than those without them; that is, if a line be drawn touching the curve EFIH in the point H of contrary flexure, where the concavity begins to be on the side next the body, the angle HKC, contained between the axis and the tangent line, is so much the greater as the filament is nearer the axis.\n\nWhen the body exposed to the stream was a box of upright sides, flat bottom, and angular prow, like a wedge, having its edge also upright, the filaments were not all deflected laterally, as theory would make us expect; but the filaments near the bottom were also deflected downwards as well as laterally, and glided along at some distance under the bottom, forming lines of double curvature.\n\nThe breadth of the stream that was deflected was much greater than that of the body; and the sensible deflection began at a considerable distance up the stream, especially in the outer filaments.\n\nLastly, the form of the curves was greatly influenced by the proportion between the width of the trough and that of the body. The curvature was always less when the trough was very wide in proportion to the body.\n\nGreat varieties were also observed in the motion or velocity of the filaments. In general, the filaments increased in velocity outwards from the body to a certain small distance, which was nearly the same in all cases, and then diminished all the way outward. This was observed by inequalities in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the filaments, by which one could be observed to outstrip another. The retardation of those next the body seemed to proceed from friction; and it was imagined that without this the velocity there would always have been greatest.\n\nThese observations give us considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> with respect to the mechanism of these motions, and the accelerations from the motion of fluids upon solids. The pressure in the duplicate ratio of the velocities comes here again into view. We found, that although the velocities were very different, the curves were precisely the same. Now the observed pressures arise from the transverse forces by which each particle of a filament is retained in its curvilinear path; and we know that the force by which a body is retained in any curve is directly as the square of the velocity, and inversely as the radius of curvature. The curvature, therefore, remaining the same, the transverse forces, and consequently the pressure on the body, must be as the square of the velocity: and, on the other hand, we can see pretty clearly (indeed it is rigorously demonstrated by D'Alembert), that whatever be the velocities, the curves will be the same. For it is known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRAULICS\">hydraulics</a>, that it requires a fourfold or ninefold pressure to produce a double or triple velocity. And as all pressures are propagated through a perfect fluid without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a>, this fourfold pressure, while it produces a double velocity, produces also fourfold transverse pressures, which will retain the particles, moving twice as fast, in the same curvilinear paths. And thus we see that the impulses, as they are called, and resistances of fluids, have a certain relation to the weight of a column of fluid, whose height is the height necessary for producing the velocity. How it happens that a plane surface, immersed in an extended fluid, sustains just half the pressure which it would have sustained had the motions been such as are sketched in figure 7th, is a matter of more curious and difficult investigation. But we see evidently that the pressure must be less than what is there assigned; for the flagrant water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AHEAD\">ahead</a> of the body greatly diminishes the ultimate deflections of the filaments: And it may be demonstrated, that when the part BE of the canal, fig. 10, is inclined to the part AB in an angle less than 90\u00b0, the pressures BG along the whole canal are as the versed sine of the ultimate angle of deflection, or the versed sine of the angle which the part BE makes with the part AB. Therefore, since the deflections resemble more the sketch given in fig. 11, the accumulated sum of all these forces BG of fig. 10 must be less than the similar sum corresponding to fig. 7, that is, less than the weight of the column of fluid, having twice the productive height for its height. How it is just one half, shall be our next inquiry.\nAnd here we must return to the labours of Sir Isaac Newton. After many beautiful observations on the nature and mechanism of continued fluids, he says, that the resistance which they occasion is but one half of that occasioned by the rare fluid which had been the subject of his former proposition; \"which truth,\" (says he, with his usual caution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>), \"I shall endeavour to show.\"\n\nHe then enters into another, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVEL\">novel</a> and as difficult an investigation, viz. the laws of hydraulics, and endeavours to ascertain the motion of fluids through orifices when urged by pressures of any kind. He endeavours to ascertain the velocity with which a fluid escapes through a horizontal orifice in the bottom of a vessel, by the action of its weight, and the pressure which this vein of fluid will exert on a little circle which occupies part of the orifice. To obtain this, he employs a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, of which it would be extremely difficult to give an extract; and then, by increasing the diameter of the vessel and of the hole to infinity, he accommodates his reasoning to the case of a plane surface exposed to an indefinitely extended stream of fluid; and, lastly, giving to the little circular surface the motion which he had before ascribed to the fluid, he says, that the resistance to a plane surface moving through an elastic continuous fluid, is equal to the weight of a column of the fluid whose height is one-half of that necessary for acquiring the velocity; and he says, that the resistance of a globe is, in this case, the same with that of a cylinder of the same diameter. The resistance, therefore, of the cylinder or circle is four times less, and that of the globe is twice less than their resistances on a rare elastic medium.\n\nBut this determination, though founded on principles or assumptions, which are much nearer to the real state of things, is liable to great objections. It depends on his method for ascertaining the velocity of the issuing fluid; a method extremely ingenious, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>. The cataract, which he supposes, cannot exist as he supposes, depending by the full action of gravity, and surrounded by a funnel of stagnant fluid. For, in such circumstances, there is nothing to balance the hydrostatical pressure of this surrounding fluid; because the whole pressure of the central cataract is employed in producing its own descent. In the next place, the pressure which he determines is beyond all doubt only half of what is observed on a plane surface in all our experiments. And, in the third place, it is repugnant to all our experience, that the resistance of a globe or of a pointed body is as great as that of its circular base. His reasons are by no means convincing. He supposes them placed in a tube or canal; and since they are supposed of the same diameter, and therefore leave equal spaces at their sides, he concludes, that because the water escapes by their sides with the same velocity, they will have the same resistance. But this is by no means a necessary consequence. Even if the water should be allowed to exert equal pressures on them, the pressures being perpendicular to their surfaces, and these surfaces being inclined to the axis, while in the case of the base of a cylinder, it is in the direction of the axis, there must be a difference in the accumulated or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> pressure in the direction of the axis. He indeed says, that in the case of the cylinder or the circle obstructing the canal, a quantity of water remains stagnant on its upper surface; viz. all the water whose motion would not contribute to the most ready passage of the fluid between the cylinder and the sides of the canal or tube; and that this water may be considered as frozen. If this be the case, it is indifferent what is the form of the body that is covered with this mass of frozen or stagnant water. It may be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a> or a cone; the resistance will be the same.\u2014But Newton by no means affirms, either with precision or with distinct evidence, the form and magnitude of this stagnant water, so as to give confidence in the results. He contents himself with saying, that it is that water whose motion is not necessary or cannot contribute to the most easy passage of the water.\n\nThere remains, therefore, many imperfections in this theory. But notwithstanding these defects, we cannot but admire the efforts and sagacity of this great philosopher, who, after having discovered so many sublime truths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> nature, ventured to trace out a path for the solution of a problem which no person had yet attempted to bring within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of mathematical investigation. And his solution, though inaccurate, shines throughout with that inventive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> and that fertility of resource, which no man ever possessed in so eminent a degree.\n\nThose who have attacked the solution of Sir Isaac Newton have not been more successful. Most of them, instead of principles, have given a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of calculus; and the chief merit which any of them can claim, is that of having deduced some single proposition which happens to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUADRATURE\">quadrature</a> with some single case of experiment, while their general theories are either inapplicable, from difficulty and obscurity, or are discordant with more general observation.\n\nWe must, however, except from this number Daniel Bernoulli, who was not only a great geometer, but one of the first philosophers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. He possessed all the talents, and was free from the faults of that celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and while he was the mathematician of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> who penetrated farthest in the investigation of this great problem, he was the only person who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, or at least who acknowledged, its great difficulty.\n\nIn the 2d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Comment. Petropol. 1727, he Bernoulli's proposes a formula for the resistance of fluids, deduced general from considerations quite different from those on which Newton founded his solution. But he delivers it with modest diffidence; because he found that it gave a resistance four times greater than experiment. In the same dissertation he determines the resistance of a sphere to be one half of that of its great circle. But in his subsequent theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HYDRODYNAMICS\">Hydrodynamics</a> (a work which must ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the first productions of the age, and is equally eminent for refined and elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, and ingenious and original thoughts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNAMICS\">dynamics</a>), he calls this determination in question. It is indeed founded on the same hypothetical principles which have been unskilfully detached from the rest of Newton's physics, and made the groundwork of all the subsequent theories on this subject.\n\nIn 1741 Mr Daniel Bernoulli published another dissertation (in the 8th volume of the Com. Petropol.) in a particular case; namely, to the impulse of a vein of fluid with great precision.\nResistance fluid falling perpendicularly on an infinitely extended plane surface. This he demonstrates to be equal to the weight of a column of the fluid whose base is the area of the vein, and whose height is twice the fall producing the velocity. This demonstration is drawn from the true principles of mechanics and the acknowledged laws of hydraulics, and may be received as a strict physical demonstration. As it is the only proposition in the whole theory that has as yet received a demonstration acceptable to readers not versed in all the refinements of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>; and as the principles on which it proceeds will undoubtedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a solution of every problem which can be proposed, once that our mathematical knowledge shall enable us to apply them\u2014we think it our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> to give it in this place, although we must acknowledge that this problem is so very limited, that it will hardly bear an application to any case that differs but a little from the express conditions of the problem. There do occur cases however in practice, where it may be applied to very great advantage.\n\nDaniel Bernoulli gives two demonstrations; one of which may be called a popular one, and the other is more scientific and introductory to further investigation. We shall give both.\n\nBernoulli first determines the whole action exerted in the efflux of the vein of fluid. Suppose the velocity of efflux \\( v \\) is that which would be acquired by falling through the height \\( h \\). It is well known that a body moving during the time of this fall with the velocity \\( v \\) would describe a space \\( 2 \\times h \\). The effect, therefore, of the hydraulic action is, that in the time \\( t \\) of the fall \\( h \\), there issues a cylinder or prism of water whose base is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> section \\( s \\) or area of the vein, and whose length is \\( 2 \\times h \\). And this quantity of matter is now moving with the velocity \\( v \\). The quantity of motion, therefore, which is thus produced is \\( 2 \\times h \\times v \\); and this quantity of motion is produced in the time \\( t \\). And this is the accumulated effect of all the expelling forces, eliminated in the direction of the efflux. Now, to compare this with the exertion of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> power with which we are familiarly acquainted, let us suppose this pillar \\( 2 \\times h \\) to be frozen, and, being held in the hand, to be dropped. It is well known, that in the time \\( t \\) it will fall through the height \\( h \\), and will acquire the velocity \\( v \\), and now possesses the quantity of motion \\( 2 \\times h \\times v \\)\u2014and all this is the effect of its weight. The weight, therefore, of the pillar \\( 2 \\times h \\) produces the same effect, and in the same time, and (as may easily be seen) in the same gradual manner, with the expelling forces of the fluid in the vessel, which expelling forces arise from the pressure of all the fluid in the vessel. Therefore the accumulated hydraulic pressure, by which a vein of a heavy fluid is forced out through an orifice in the bottom or side of a vessel, is equal (when estimated in the direction of the efflux) to the weight of a column of the fluid, having for its base the section of the vein, and twice the fall productive of the velocity of efflux for its height.\n\nNow let \\( A B D C \\) (fig. 12.) be a quadrangular vessel with upright plane sides, in one of which is an orifice \\( E F \\). From every point of the circumference of this orifice, supposing horizontal lines \\( E e, F f, &c. \\), which will mark a similar surface on the opposite side of the vessel. Suppose the orifice \\( E F \\) to be shut. There can be no doubt but that the surfaces \\( E F \\) and \\( e f \\) will be equally pressed in opposite directions. Now open the orifice \\( E F \\); the water will rush out, and the pressure on \\( E F \\) is now removed. There will therefore be a tendency in the vessel to move back in the direction \\( E e \\). And this tendency must be precisely equal and opposite to the whole effort of the expelling forces. This is a conclusion as evident as any proposition in mechanics. It is thus that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> recoils and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROCKET\">rocket</a> rises in the air; and on this is founded the operation of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">Parent</a>'s or Dr Barker's mills, described in all treatises of mechanics, and most learnedly treated by Euler in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a>.\n\nNow, let this stream of water be received on a circular plane \\( M N \\), perpendicular to its axis, and let this circular plane be of such extent, that the vein escapes from its sides in an infinitely thin sheet, the water flowing off in a direction parallel to the plane. The vein, by this means will expand into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>-like shape, having curved sides, \\( F K G, F L H \\) fig. 13. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> at present Fig. 13, the action of gravity which would cause the vein to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> downwards, and occasion a greater velocity at \\( H \\) than at \\( G \\); and we suppose the velocity equal in every point of the circumference. It is plain, that if the action of gravity be neglected after the water has issued through the orifice \\( E F \\), the velocity in every point of the circumference of the plane \\( M N \\) will be that of the efflux through \\( E F \\).\n\nNow, because \\( L K G \\) is the natural shape assumed by the vein, it is plain, that if the whole vein were covered by a tube or mouth-piece, fitted to its shape, and perfectly polished, so that the water shall glide along it, without any friction (a thing which we may always suppose), the water will exert no pressure whatever on this trumpet mouth-piece. Lastly, let us suppose that the plane \\( M N \\) is attached to the mouth-piece by some bits of wire, so as to allow the water to escape all round by the narrow chink between the mouth-piece and the plane: We have now a vessel consisting of the upright part \\( A B D C \\), the trumpet \\( G K E F L H \\), and the plane \\( M N \\); and the water is escaping from every point of the circumference of the chink \\( G H N M \\) with the velocity \\( v \\). If any part of this chink were shut up, there would be a pressure on that part equivalent to the force of efflux from the opposite part. Therefore, when all is open, these efforts of efflux balance each other all round. There is not therefore any tendency in this compound vessel to move to any side. But take away the plane \\( M N \\), and there would immediately arise a pressure in the direction \\( E e \\) equal to the weight of the column \\( 2 \\times h \\). This is therefore balanced by the pressure on the circular plane \\( M N \\), which is therefore equal to this weight, and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nA number of experiments were made by Professor Kraft at St Petersburg, by receiving the vein on a plane \\( M N \\) (fig. 12.) which was fastened to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of a balance \\( O P Q \\), having a scale \\( R \\) hanging on the opposite arm. The resistance or pressure on the plane was measured by weights put into the scale \\( R \\); and the velocity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a> was measured by means of the distance \\( K H \\), to which it spouted on a horizontal plane.\n\nThe results of these experiments were as conformable to the theory as could be wished. The resistance was between this theory always a little less than what the theory required, but greatly exceeded its half; the result of the generally received theories. This defect should be expected; for counted\nResistance, the demonstration supposes the plane MN to be infinitely extended, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FILM\">film</a> of water which issues through the chink may be accurately parallel to the plane. This never can be completely effected. Also it was supposed, that the velocity was justly measured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPLITUDE\">amplitude</a> of the parabola EGK. But it is well known that the very putting the plane MN in the way of the jet, though at the distance of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> from the orifice, will diminish the velocity of the efflux through this orifice. This is easily verified by experiment. Observe the time in which the vessel will be emptied when there is no plane in the way. Repeat the experiment with the plane in its place; and more time will be necessary. The following is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of a course of experiments, taken as they stand, without any selection.\n\n| No | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |\n|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Ref. by theory | 1701 | 1720 | 1657 | 1583 | 1529 | 1472 |\n| Ref. by experiment | 1483 | 1403 | 1436 | 1401 | 1423 | 1321 |\n| Difference | 218 | 217 | 165 | 182 | 106 | 51 |\n\nIn order to demonstrate this proposition in such a manner as to furnish the means of investigating the whole mechanism and action of moving fluids, it is necessary to premise an elementary theorem of curvilinear motions.\n\nIf a particle of matter describes a curve line ABCE (fig. 14.) by the continual action of deflecting forces, which vary in any manner, both with respect to intensity and direction, and if the action of these forces, in every point of the curve, be resolved into two directions, perpendicular and parallel to the initial direction AK; then,\n\n1. The accumulated effect of the deflecting forces, estimated in a direction AD perpendicular to AK, is to the final quantity of motion as the fine of the final change of direction is to radius.\n\nLet us first suppose that the accelerating forces act by starts, at equal intervals of time, when the body is in the points A, B, C, E. And let AN be the deflecting force, which, acting at A, changes the original direction AK to AB. Produce AB till BH = AB, and complete the parallelogram BFCH. Then FB is the force which, by acting at B, changed the motion BH (the continuation of AB) to BC. In like manner make CH (in BC produced) equal to BC, and complete the parallelogram CFEH. CF is the deflecting force at C, &c. Draw BO parallel to AN, and GBK perpendicular to AK. Also draw lines through C and E perpendicular to AK, and draw through B and C lines parallel to AK. Draw also HI, HI perpendicular, and FG, HI, HI parallel to AK.\n\nIt is plain that BK is BO or AN estimated in the direction perpendicular to AK, and that BG is BF estimated in the same way. And since BH = AB, HI or IM is equal to BK. Also CI is equal to BG. Therefore CM is equal to AP + BG. By similar reasoning it appears that EM = EI + HI = CG + CM, = CG + BG, + AP.\n\nTherefore if CE be taken for the measure of the final velocity or quantity of motion, EM will be the accumulated effect of the deflecting forces estimated in the direction AD perpendicular to AK. But EM is to CE as the fine of mCE is to radius; and the angle mCE is the angle contained between the initial and final directions, because CM is parallel to AK. Now let the intervals of time diminish continually and the frequency of the impulses increase. The deflection becomes ultimately continuous, and the motion curvilinear, and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nWe see that the initial velocity and its subsequent changes do not affect the conclusion, which depends entirely on the final quantity of motion.\n\n2. The accumulated effect of the accelerating forces, when estimated in the direction AK of the original motion, or in the opposite direction, is equal to the difference between the initial quantity of motion and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of the final quantity of motion by the cosine of the change of direction.\n\nFor CM = C / m, I = BM - f q,\nBM = BL - ML = AK - FG,\nAK = AO - OK = AO - PN.\n\nTherefore PN + FG + fQ (the accumulated impulse in the direction OA) = AO - CM = AO - CE X cosine of ECM.\n\nCor. 1. The same action, in the direction opposite to that of the original motion, is necessary for causing a body to move at right angles to its former direction as for stopping its motion. For in this case, the cosine of the change of direction is = o, and AO - CE X cosine ECM = AO - o = AO, = the original motion.\n\nCor. 2. If the initial and final velocities are the same, the accumulated action of the accelerating forces, estimated in the direction OA, is equal to the product of the original quantity of motion by the verified sine of the change of direction.\n\nThe application of these theorems, particularly the second, to our present purpose is very obvious. All the filaments of the jet were originally moving in the direction of its axis, and they are finally moving along the retarding plane, or perpendicular to their former motion. Therefore their transverse forces in the direction of the axis are (in cumulo) equal to the force which would stop the motion. For the aggregate of the simultaneous forces of every particle in the whole filament is the same with that of the successive forces of one particle, as it arrives at different points of its curvilinear path. All the transverse forces, estimated in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the vein, precisely balance and sustain each other; and the only forces which can produce a sensible effect are those in a direction parallel to the axis. By these all the inner filaments are prefed towards the plane MN, and must be withstood by it. It is highly probable, nay certain, that there is a quantity of stagnant water in the middle of the vein which sustains the preffres of the moving filaments without it, and transmits it to the solid plane. But this does not alter the case. And, fortunately, it is of no consequence what changes happen in the velocities of the particles while each is describing its own curve. And it is from this circumstance, peculiar to this particular case of perpendicular impulse, that we are able to draw the conclusion. It is by no means difficult to demonstrate that the velocity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface of this jet is constant, and indeed of every jet which is not acted on by external forces after it has quitted the orifice: but this diffusion is quite unnecessary here. It is however extremely difficult to ascertain, even in this most simple case, what is the velocity of the internal filaments in the different points of their progress.\nSuch is the demonstration which Mr Berroulli has given of this proposition. Limited as it is, it is highly valuable, because derived from the true principles of hydraulics.\n\nHe hoped to render it more extensive and applicable to oblique impulses, when the axis AC of the vein (fig. 15) is inclined to the plane in an angle ACN. But here all the simplicity of the case is gone, and we are now obliged to ascertain the motion of each filament. It might not perhaps be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to determine what must happen in the plane of the figure, that is, in a plane passing through the axis of the vein, and perpendicular to the plane MN. But even in this case it would be extremely difficult to determine how much of the fluid will go in the direction EKG, and what will go in the path FLH, and to ascertain the form of each filament, and the velocity in its different points. But in the real state of the case, the water will dissipate from the centre C on every side; and we cannot tell in what proportions. Let us however consider a little what happens in the plane of the figure, and suppose that all the water goes either in the course EKG or in the course FLH. Let the quantities of water which take these two courses have the proportions of \\( p \\) and \\( n \\). Let \\( \\sqrt{2a} \\) be the velocity at A, \\( \\sqrt{2b} \\) be the velocity at G, and \\( \\sqrt{2\\beta} \\) be the velocity at H. ACG and ACH are the two changes of direction, of which let \\( c \\) and \\( -c \\) be the cosines. Then, adopting the former reasoning, we have the pressure of the watery plate GKEACM on the plane in the direction AC:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{p + n} \\times 2a - 2cb,\n\\]\n\nand the pressure of the plate HLFACN:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n}{p + n} \\times 2a + 2c\\beta,\n\\]\n\nand their sum\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p \\times 2a - 2cb + n \\times 2a + 2c\\beta}{p + n};\n\\]\n\nwhich being multiplied by the sine of ACM or \\( \\sqrt{1 - c^2} \\), gives the pressure perpendicular to the plane MN:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p \\times 2a - 2cb + n \\times 2a}{p + n} \\times 2ac \\sqrt{1 - c^2}.\n\\]\n\nBut there remains a pressure in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the vein, which is not balanced, as in the former case, by the equality on opposite sides of the axis. The pressure arising from the water which escapes at G has an effect opposite to that produced by the water which escapes at H. When this is taken into account, we shall find that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> efforts perpendicular to AC are\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p - n}{p + n} \\times 2a \\sqrt{1 - c^2},\n\\]\n\nwhich, being multiplied by the cosine of ACM, gives the action perpendicular to MN:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p - n}{p + n} \\times 2ac \\sqrt{1 - c^2}.\n\\]\n\nThe sum or joint effort of all these pressures is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p \\times 2a - 2cb + n \\times 2a + 2c\\beta}{p + n} \\sqrt{1 - c^2} + \\frac{p - n}{p + n} \\times 2ac \\sqrt{1 - c^2}.\n\\]\n\nThus, from this case, which is much simpler than can happen in nature, seeing that there will always be a lateral efflux, the determination of the impulse is as uncertain and vague as it was sure and precise in the former case.\n\nIt is therefore without proper authority that the absolute impulse of a vein of fluid on a plane which receives it wholly, is affected to be proportional to the fine of incidence. If indeed we suppose the velocity in G and H are equal to that at A, then \\( b = \\beta = a \\), and the whole impulse is \\( 2a \\sqrt{1 - c^2} \\), as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> supposed. But this cannot be. Both the velocity and quantity at H are less than those at G. Nay, frequently there is no efflux on the side H when the obliquity is very great. We may conclude in general, that the oblique impulse will always bear to the direct impulse a greater proportion than that of the fine of incidence to radius. If the whole water escapes at G, and none goes off laterally, the pressure will be \\( 2a + 2ac - 2bc \\times \\sqrt{1 - c^2} \\). The experiments of the Abb\u00e9 Bo\u00ebt show in the plainest manner that the pressure of a vein, striking obliquely on a plane which receives it wholly, diminishes faster than in the ratio of the square of the fine of incidence; whereas, when the oblique plane is wholly immersed in the stream, the impulse is much greater than in this proportion, and in great obliques it is nearly as the fine.\n\nNor will this proposition determine the impulse of a fluid on a plane wholly immersed in it, even when the impulse is perpendicular to the plane. The circumstance is now wanting on which we can establish a calculation, namely, the angle of final deflection. Could this be ascertained for each filament, and the velocity of the filament, the principles are completely adequate to an accurate solution of the problem. In the experiments which we mentioned to have been made under the inspection of Sir Charles Knowles, a cylinder of six inches diameter was exposed to the action of a stream moving precisely one foot per second; and when certain deductions were made for the water which was held adhering to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> base (as will be noticed afterwards), the impulse was found equal to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) ounces avoirdupois. There were 36 coloured filaments distributed on the stream, in such situations as to give the most useful indications of their curvature. It was found necessary to have some which passed under the body and some above it; for the form of these filaments, at the same distance from the axis of the cylinder, was considerably different: and those filaments which were situated in planes neither horizontal nor vertical took a double curvature. In short, the curves were all traced with great care, and the deflecting forces were computed for each, and reduced to the direction of the axis; and they were summed up in such a manner as to give the impulse of the whole stream. The deflections were marked as far ahead of the cylinder as they could be assuredly observed. By this method the impulse was computed to be \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) ounces, differing from observation \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an ounce, or about \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) of the whole; a difference which may most reasonably be ascribed to the adhesion of the water, which must be most sensible in such small velocities. These experiments may therefore be considered as giving all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> that can be desired of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of the principles. This indeed hardly admits of a doubt: but, alas! it gives us but final affluence; for all this is empirical, in as far as it leaves us in every case the task of observing the form of the curves, and\nResistance, and the velocities in their different points. To derive service from this most judicious method of Daniel Bernoulli, we must discover some method of determining, *a priori*, what will be the motion of the fluid whose course is obstructed by a body of any form. And here we cannot omit taking notice of the casual observations of Sir Isaac Newton when attempting to determine the resistance of the plane surface or cylinder, or sphere exposed to a stream moving in a canal. He says, that the form of the resisting surface is of less consequence, because there is always a quantity of water stagnant upon it, and which may therefore be considered as frozen; and he therefore considers that water only whose motion is necessary for the most expeditious discharge of the water in the vessel. He endeavours to discriminate that water from the rest; and although it must be acknowledged that the principle which he assumes for this purpose is very gratuitous, because it only shows, that if certain portions of the water, which he determines very ingeniously, were really frozen, the rest will flow, as he says, and will exert the pressure which he assigns; still we must admire his fertility of resource, and his sagacity in thus foreseeing what subsequent observation has completely confirmed.\n\nWe are even disposed to think, that in this casual observation Sir Isaac Newton has pointed out the only method of arriving at a solution of the problem; and that, if we could discover what motions are not necessary for the most expeditious passage of the water, and could thus determine the form and magnitude of the stagnant water which adheres to the body, we should much more easily ascertain the real motions which occasion the observed resistance. We are here disposed to have recourse to the economy of nature, the improper use of which we have sometimes taken the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of reprehending. Mr Maupertuis published as a great discovery his principle of smallest action, where he showed that in all the mutual actions of bodies the quantity of action was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a>; and he applied this to the solution of many difficult problems with great success, imagining that he was really reasoning from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINGENT\">contingent</a> law of nature, selected by its infinitely wise Author, viz., that in all occasions there is the smallest possible exertion of natural powers. Mr D'Alembert has, however, shown (vid. Encyclop\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, Action) that this was but a whim, and that the minimum observed by Maupertuis is merely a minimum of calculus, peculiar to a formula which happens to express a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of mathematical quantities which frequently occurs in our way of considering the phenomena of nature, but which is no natural measure of action.\n\nBut the chevalier D'Arcy has shown, that in the trains of natural operations which terminate in the production of motion in a particular direction, the intermediate communications of motion are such that the smallest possible quantity of motion is produced. We seem obliged to conclude, that this law will be observed in the present instance; and it seems a problem not above our reach to determine the motions which result from it. We would recommend the problem to the eminent mathematicians in some simple case, such as the proposition already demonstrated by Daniel Bernoulli, or the perpendicular impulse on a cylinder included in a tubular canal; and if they succeed in this, great things may be expected. We think that experience gives great encouragement. We see that the resistance to a plane surface is a very small matter greater than the weight of a column of the fluid having the full productive of the velocity for its height, and the small excess is most probably owing to adhesion, and the measure of the real resistance is probably precisely this weight. The velocity of a flowing fluid was found, in fact, to be that acquired by falling from the surface of the fluid; and it was by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> at this, as at a pole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>, that Newton, Bernoulli, and others, have with great sagacity and ingenuity discovered much of the laws of hydraulics, by searching for principles which would give this result. We may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> for similar success.\n\nIn the mean time, we may receive this as a physical truth, that the perpendicular impulse or resistance of a plane surface, wholly immersed in the fluid, is equal to the weight of the column having the surface for its base, and the fall producing the velocity for its height.\n\nThis is the medium result of all experiments made in these precise circumstances. And it is confirmed by a set of experiments of a kind wholly different, and which seem to point it out more certainly as an immediate consequence of hydraulic principles.\n\nIf Mr Pitot's tube be exposed to a stream of fluid issuing from a reservoir or vessel, as represented in fig. 16, with the open mouth I pointed directly against Pitot's tube, this stream, the fluid is observed to stand at K in the up Fig. 16. right tube, precisely on a level with the fluid AB in the reservoir. Here is a most unexceptionable experiment, in which the impulse of the stream is actually opposed to the hydrostatical prelude of the fluid on the tube. Pressure is in this case opposed to pressure, because the issuing fluid is deflected by what flows in the mouth of the tube, in the same way in which it would be deflected by a firm surface. We shall have occasion by and by to mention some most valuable and instructive experiments made with this tube.\n\nIt was this which suggested to the great mathematician Euler another theory of the impulse and resistance of fluids, which must not be omitted, as it is applied in his elaborate performance On the Theory of the Construction and Working of Ships, in two volumes 4to, which was afterwards abridged and used as a textbook in some marine academies. He supposes a stream of fluid ABCD (fig. 17.), moving with any velocity, to strike the plane BD perpendicularly, and that part of it goes through a hole EF, forming a jet EGHF. Mr Euler says, that the velocity of this jet will be the same with the velocity of the stream. Now compare this with an equal stream issuing from a hole in the side of a vessel with the same velocity. The one stream is urged out by the pressure occasioned by the impulse of the fluid; the other is urged out by the pressure of gravity. The effects are equal, and the modifying circumstances are the same. The causes are therefore equal, and the pressure occasioned by the impulse of a stream of fluid, moving with any velocity, is equal to the weight of a column of fluid whose height is productive of this velocity, &c. He then determines the oblique impulse by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of motion, and deduces the common rules of resistance, &c.\n\nBut all this is without just grounds. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> was always satisfied with the slightest analogies which would give him an opportunity of exhibiting his great\ngreat dexterity in algebraic analysis, and was not afterwards startled by any discordancy with observation. Analysis magis fidendum is a frequent assertion with him. Though he wrote a large volume containing a theory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and colours totally opposite to Newton's, he has published many dissertations on optical phenomena on the Newtonian principles, expressly because his own principles non idem facile anfam praebet analysi instruendae.\n\nNot a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of argument is given for the leading principle in this theory, viz. that the velocity of the jet is the same with the velocity of the stream. None can be given, but saying, that the pressure is equivalent to its production; and this is assuming the very thing he labours to prove. The matter of fact is, that the velocity of the jet is greater than that of the stream, and may be greater almost in any proportion. Which curious circumstance was discovered and ingeniously explained long ago by Daniel Bernoulli in his Hydrodynamica. It is evident that the velocity must be greater. Were a stream of fluid to come against the plane, what goes through would indeed preserve its velocity unchanged; but when a real fluid strikes the plane, all that does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through is deflected on all sides; and by these deflections forces are excited, by which the filaments which surround the cylinder immediately fronting the hole are made to press the cylinder on all sides, and as it were squeeze it between them; and thus the particles at the hole must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> be accelerated, and the velocity of the jet must be greater than that of the stream. We are disposed to think that, in a fluid perfectly incompreffible, the velocity will be double, or at least increased in the proportion of $1/\\sqrt{2}$. If the fluid is in the smallest degree compressible, even in the very small degree that water is, the velocity at the first impulse may be much greater. D. Bernoulli found that a column of water moving 5 feet per second, in a tube some hundred feet long, produced a velocity of 136 feet per second in the first moment.\n\nThere being this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> defect in the theory of Mr Euler, it is needless to take notice of its total insufficiency for explaining oblique impulses and the resistance of curvilinear flows.\n\nWe are extremely sorry that our readers are deriving so little advantage from all that we have said; and that having taken them by the hand, we are thus obliged to grope about, with only a few scattered rays of light to direct our steps. Let us see what assistance we can get from Mr d'Alembert, who has attempted a solution of that problem in a method entirely new and extremely ingenious. He saw clearly, that all the followers of Newton had forsaken the path which he had marked out for them in the second part of his investigation, and had merely amused themselves with the mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> with which his introductory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> gave them an opportunity of occupying themselves. He paid the deserved <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> to Daniel Bernoulli for having introduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of pure prelure as the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in this business; and he saw that he was in the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and that it was from hydrostatical principles alone that we had any chance of explaining the phenomena of hydraulics. Bernoulli had only considered the prelures which were excited in consequence of the curvilinear motions of the particles. Mr d'Alembert even thought that these prelures were not the consequences, but the causes, of these curvilinear motions. No internal motion can happen in a fluid but in consequence of an unbalanced prelude; and every such motion will produce an inequality of pressure, which will determine the succeeding motions. He therefore endeavoured to reduce all to the discovery of those disturbing prelures, and thus to the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYDROSTATICS\">hydrostatics</a>. He had long before this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> on a very refined and ingenious view of the action of bodies on each other, which had enabled him to solve many of the most difficult problems concerning the motions of bodies, such as the centre of oscillation, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a>, the precession of the equinoxes, &c., &c., with great facility and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a>. He saw that the same principle would apply to the action of fluid bodies. The principle is this:\n\n\"In whatever manner any number of bodies are supposed to act on each other, and by these actions come to change their present motions, if we conceive that the motion which each body would have in the following instant (if it became free), is resolved into two other motions; one of which is the motion which it really takes in the following instant; the other will be such, that if each body had no other motion but this second, the whole bodies would have remained in equilibrium.\"\n\nWe here observe, that \"the motion which each body would have in the following instant, if it became free,\" is a continuation of the motion which it has in the first instant. It may therefore perhaps be better expressed thus:\n\n\"If the motions of bodies, anyhow acting on each other, be considered in two consecutive instants, and if we conceive the motion which it has in the first instant as compounded of two others, one of which is the motion which it actually takes in the second instant, the other is such, that if each body had only those second motions, the whole system would have remained in equilibrium.\"\n\nThe proposition itself is evident. For if these second motions be not such as that an equilibrium of the whole system would result from them, the other component motions would not be those which the bodies really have after the change; for they would necessarily be altered by these unbalanced motions. See D'Alembert \u00c9l\u00e9mens de Dynamique.\n\nAfflicted by this incontestable principle, M. d'Alembert demonstrates, in a manner equally new and simple, those propositions which Newton had so cautiously deduced from his hypothetical fluid, showing that they were not limited to this hypothesis, viz. that the motions produced by similar bodies, similarly projected in them, would be similar; that whatever were the prelures, the curves described by the particles would be the same; and that the resistances would be proportional to the squares of the velocities. He then comes to consider the fluid as having its motions constrained by the form of the canal or by solid obstacles interposed.\n\nWe shall here give a summary account of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> proposition.\n\nIt is evident, that if the body ADCE (fig. 18.) did not form an obstruction to the motion of the water, the account of particles would describe parallel lines TF, OK, PS, &c., his fundamental proposition. But while yet at a distance from the body in F, K, S position, they gradually change their directions, and describe the curves FM, K m, S n, so much more incurvated as they are nearer to the body. At a certain distance ZY this curvature...\nResistance-curvature will be insensible, and the fluid included in the space ZYHQ will move uniformly as if the solid body were not there. The motions on the other side of the axis AC will be the same; and we need only attend to one half, and we shall consider these as in a state of permanency.\n\nNo body changes either its direction or velocity otherwise than by insensible degrees: therefore the particle which is moving in the axis will not reach the vertex A of the body, where it behoved to deflect instantaneously at right angles. It will therefore begin to be deflected at some point F a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the body, and will describe a curve FM, touching the axis in F, and the body in M; and then, gliding along the body, will quit it at some point L, describing a tangent curve, which will join the axis again (touching it) in R; and thus there will be a quantity of stagnant water FAM before or a-head of the body, and another LCR behind or after of it.\n\nLet \\(a\\) be the velocity of a particle of the fluid in any instant, and \\(a'\\) its velocity in the next instant. The velocity \\(a\\) may be considered as compounded of \\(a'\\) and \\(a''\\). If the particles tended to move with the velocities \\(a''\\) only, the whole fluid would be in equilibrium (general principle), and the pressure of the fluid would be the same as if all were stagnant, and each particle were urged by a force \\(\\frac{a''}{t}\\), \\(t\\) expressing an indefinitely small moment of time. (N.B. \\(a''\\) is the proper expression of the accelerating force, which, by acting during the moment \\(t\\), would generate the velocity \\(a''\\); and \\(a''\\) is supposed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> quantity, different perhaps for each particle.) Now let \\(a\\) be supposed constant, or \\(a = a'\\). In this case \\(a'' = 0\\). That is to say, no pressure whatever will be exerted on the solid body unless there happen changes in the velocities or directions of the particles.\n\nLet \\(a\\) and \\(a'\\) then be the motions of the particles in two consecutive instants. They would be in equilibrium if urged only by the forces \\(\\frac{a''}{t}\\). Therefore if \\(F\\) be the point where the particles which describe the curve FM begin to change their velocity, the pressure in \\(F\\) would be equal to the pressure which the fluid contained in the canal \\(FMD\\) would exert, if each particle were solicited by its force \\(\\frac{a''}{t}\\). The question is therefore reduced to the finding the curvature in the canal \\(FMD\\), and the accelerating forces \\(\\frac{a''}{t}\\) in its different parts.\n\nIt appears, in the first place, that no pressure is exerted by any of the particles along the curve FM: for suppose that the particle \\(a\\) (fig. 19.) describes the indefinitely small straight line \\(ab\\) in the first instant, and \\(bc\\) in the second instant; produce \\(ab\\) till \\(bd = ab\\), and joining \\(dc\\), the motion \\(ab\\) or \\(bd\\) may be considered as composed of \\(bc\\), which the particle really takes in the next instant, and a motion \\(dc\\) which should be destroyed. Draw \\(bi\\) parallel to \\(dc\\), and \\(ie\\) perpendicular to \\(bc\\). It is plain that the particle \\(b\\), solicited by the forces \\(be, ei\\) (equivalent to \\(dc\\)) should be in equilibrium. This being established, \\(be\\) must be \\(= 0\\), that is, there will be no accelerating or retarding force at \\(b\\); for if there\n\nFig. 19.\n\nbe, draw \\(bm\\) (fig. 20.) perpendicular to \\(bF\\), and the resistance parallel \\(ng\\) infinitely near it. The part \\(bn\\) of the fluid contained in the canal \\(bngm\\) would sustain some pressure from \\(b\\) towards \\(n\\), or from \\(n\\) towards \\(b\\). Therefore since the fluid in this stagnant canal should be in equilibrium, there must also be some action, at least in one of the parts \\(bm, mg, gn\\), to counterbalance the action on the part \\(bn\\). But the fluid is stagnant in the space \\(FAM\\) (in consequence of the law of continuity). Therefore there is no force which can act on \\(bm, mg, gn\\); and the pressure in the canal in the direction \\(bn\\) or \\(nb\\) is nothing; or the force \\(be = 0\\), and the force \\(ie\\) is perpendicular to the canal; and there is therefore no pressure in the canal \\(FMD\\), except what proceeds from the part \\(F\\), or from the force \\(ei\\); which last being perpendicular to the canal, there can be no force exerted on the point \\(M\\), but what is propagated from the part \\(F\\).\n\nThe velocity therefore in the canal \\(FMD\\) is constant if finite, or infinitely small if variable: for, in the first case, the force \\(be\\) would be absolutely nothing; and in the second case, it would be an infinitesimal of the second order, and may be considered as nothing in comparison with the velocity, which is of the first order. We shall see by and by that the last is the real state of the case. Therefore the fluid, before it begins to change its direction in \\(F\\), begins to change its velocity in some point \\(F\\) a-head of \\(F\\), and by the time that it reaches \\(F\\) its velocity is as it were annihilated.\n\nCor. 1. Therefore the pressure in any point \\(D\\) arises both from the retardations in the part \\(F\\), and from the particles which are in the canal \\(MD\\): as these last move along the surface of the body, the force \\(\\frac{a''}{t}\\), destroyed in every particle, is compounded of two others, one in the direction of the surface, and the other perpendicular to it; call these \\(p\\) and \\(p'\\). The point \\(D\\) is pressed perpendicularly to the surface \\(MD\\); 1st, by all the forces \\(p\\) in the curve \\(MD\\); 2d, by the force \\(p'\\) acting on the single point \\(D\\). This may be neglected in comparison of the indefinite number of the others: therefore taking in the arch \\(MD\\), an infinitely small portion \\(Nm = s\\), the pressure on \\(D\\), perpendicular to the surface of the body, will be \\(= ps\\); and this fluent must be so taken as to be \\(= s\\) in the point \\(M\\).\n\nCor. 2. Therefore, to find the pressure on \\(D\\), we must find the force \\(p\\) on any point \\(N\\). Let \\(u\\) be the velocity of the particle \\(N\\), in the direction \\(Nm\\) in any instant, and \\(u + u'\\) its velocity in the following instant; we must have \\(p = \\frac{u'}{t}\\). Therefore the whole question is reduced to finding the velocity \\(u\\) in every point \\(N\\), in the direction \\(Nm\\).\n\nAnd this is the aim of a series of propositions which his final follow, in which the author displays the most accurate equation and precise conception of the subject, and great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> truly follows and elegance in his mathematical analysis. He at length brings out an equation which expresses the pressure on the body in the most general and unexceptionable manner. We cannot give an abstract, because the train of reasoning is already concise in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a>: nor can we even exhibit the final equation; for it is conceived in the\nAnd we should multiply experiments on the resistance of bodies. Those of the French academy are undoubtedly of inestimable value, and will always be appealed to. But there are circumstances in those experiments which render them more complicated than is proper for a general theory, and which therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> the conclusions which we wish to draw from them. The bodies were floating on the surface. This greatly modifies the deflections of the filaments of water, causing some to deflect laterally, which would otherwise have remained in one vertical plane; and this circumstance also necessarily produced what the academicians called the remou, or accumulation on the anterior part of the body, and depression behind it. This produced an additional resistance, which was measured with great difficulty and uncertainty. The effect of adhesion must also have been very considerable, and very different in the different cases; and it is of difficult calculation. It cannot perhaps be totally removed in any experiment, and it is necessary to consider it as making part of the resistance in the most important practical cases, viz. the motion of ships. Here we see that its effect is very great. Every seaman knows that the speed, even of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>-sheathed ship, is greatly increased by greasing her bottom. The difference is too remarkable to admit of a doubt: nor should we be surprised at this, when we attend to the diminution of the motion of water in long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a>. A smooth pipe four and a half inches diameter, and 500 yards long, yields but one-fifth of the quantity which it ought to do independent of friction. But adhesion does a great deal which cannot be compared with friction. We see that water flowing through a hole in a thin plate will be increased in quantity fully one-third, by adding a little tube whose length is about twice the diameter of the hole. The adhesion therefore will greatly modify the action of the filaments both on the solid body and on each other, and will change both the forms of the curves and the velocities in different points; and this is a sort of objection to the only hypothesis introduced by d'Alembert. Yet it is only a sort of objection; for the effect of this adhesion, too, must undoubtedly depend on the situation of the particle.\n\nThe form of these experiments of the academy is ill-suited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the resistance of bodies immersed wholly immersed in the fluid. The form of experiment adopted by Robins for the resistance of air, and Borda afterwards by the Chevalier Borda for water, is free from these inconveniences, and is susceptible of equal able accuracy. The great advantage of both is the exact knowledge which they give us of the velocity of the motion; a circumstance essentially necessary, and but imperfectly known in the experiments of Mariotte and others, who examined quiescent bodies exposed to the action of a stream. It is extremely difficult to measure the velocity of a stream. It is very different in its different parts. It is fivefold of all in the middle superficial filament, and diminishes as we recede from this towards the sides or bottom, and the rate of diminution is not precisely known. Could this be ascertained with the necessary precision, we should recommend the following form of experiment as the most simple, easy, economical, and accurate.\n\nLet \\(a, b, c, d\\) (fig. 21.) be four hooks placed in a horizontal plane at the corners of a rectangular parallelogram,\nResistance telegram, the sides \\(a, b, c, d\\) being parallel to the direction of the stream \\(ABCD\\), and the sides \\(a, b, c, d\\) being perpendicular to it. Let the body \\(G\\) be fastened to an axis \\(e\\) of stiff-tempered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> wire, so that the surface on which the fluid is to act may be inclined to the stream in the precise angle we desire. Let this axis have hooks at its extremities, which are hitched into the loops of four equal threads, suspended from the hooks \\(a, b, c, d\\); and let \\(H e\\) be a fifth thread, suspended from the middle of the line joining the points of suspension \\(a, b\\). Let \\(H K\\) be a graduated arch, whose centre is \\(H\\), and whose plane is in the direction of the stream. It is evident that the impulse on the body \\(G\\) will be measured (by a process well known to every mathematician) by the deviation of the thread \\(H e\\) from the vertical line \\(H f\\); and this will be done without any intricacy of calculation, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the centres of gravity, of oscillation, or of percussion. These must be accurately ascertained with respect to that form in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> has always been employed for measuring the impulse or velocity of a stream. These advantages arise from the circumstance, that the axis \\(e f\\) remains always parallel to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>. We may be allowed to observe, by the bye, that this would have been a great improvement of the beautiful experiments of Mr Robins and Dr Hutton on the velocities of cannon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>, and would have saved much intricate calculation, and been attended with many important advantages.\n\nThe great difficulty is, as we have observed, to measure the velocity of the stream. Even this may be done in this way with some precision. Let two floating bodies be dragged along the surface, as in the experiments of the academy, at some distance from each other laterally, so that the water between them may not be sensibly disturbed. Let a horizontal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> be attached to them, transverse to the direction of their motion, at a proper height above the surface, and let a spherical pendulum be suspended from this, or let it be suspended from four points, as here described. Now let the deviation of this pendulum be noted in a variety of velocities. This will give us the law of relation between the velocity and the deviation of the pendulum. Now, in making experiments on the resistance of bodies, let the velocity of the stream, in the very filament in which the resistance is measured, be determined by the deviation of this pendulum.\n\nIt were greatly to be wished that some more palpable argument could be found for the existence of a quantity of stagnant fluid at the anterior and posterior parts of the body. The one already given, derived from the consideration that no motion changes either its velocity or direction by finite quantities in an instant, is unexceptionable. But it gives us little information. The smallest conceivable extent of the curve \\(FM\\) in fig. 18, will answer this condition, provided only that it touches the axis in some point \\(F\\), and the body in some point \\(M\\), so as not to make a finite angle with either. But surely there are circumstances which rigorously determine the extent of this stagnant fluid. And it appears without doubt, that if there were no cohesion or friction, this space will have a determined ratio to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the body (the figures of the bodies being supposed similar). Suppose a plane surface \\(AB\\), as in fig. 11, there can be no doubt but that the figure \\(A a D b B\\) will in every case be similar. But if we suppose an \\(R\\) degree adhesion or tenacity which is constant, this may make a change both in its extent and its form; for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a> of form depends on the disturbing forces being always as the squares of the velocity; and this ratio of the disturbing forces is preserved, while the inertia of the fluid is the only agent and patient in the process. But when we add to this the constant (that is, invariable) disturbing force of tenacity, a change of form and dimensions must happen. In like manner, the friction, or something analogous to friction, which produces an effect proportional to the velocity, must alter this necessary ratio of the whole disturbing forces. We may conclude, that the effect of both these circumstances will be to diminish the quantity of this stagnant fluid, by licking it away externally; and to this we must ascribe the fact, that the part \\(FAM\\) is never perfectly stagnant, but is generally disturbed with a whirling motion. We may also conclude, that this stagnant fluid will be more incurvated between \\(F\\) and \\(M\\) than it would have been, independent of tenacity and friction; and that the arch \\(LR\\) will, on the contrary, be less incurvated.\u2014And, lastly, we may conclude, that there will be something opposite to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, or something which we may call abfraction, exerted on the posterior part of the body which moves in a tenacious fluid, or is exposed to the stream of such a fluid; for the stagnant fluid \\(LCR\\) adheres to the surface \\(LC\\); and the passing fluid tends to draw it away both by its tenacity and by its friction. This must augment the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> impulse of the stream on such a body; and it must greatly augment the resistance, that is, the motion lost by this body in its progress through the tenacious fluid; for the body must drag along with it this stagnant fluid, and drag it in opposition to the tenacity and friction of the surrounding fluid. The effect of this is most remarkably seen in the resistances to the motion of pendulums; and the chevalier Buat, in his examination of Newton's experiments, clearly shows that this constitutes the greatest part of the resistance.\n\nThis most ingenious writer has paid great attention to this part of the process of nature, and has laid the foundation of a theory of resistance entirely different from all the preceding. We cannot abridge it; and it is too imperfect in its present condition to be offered as a body of doctrine: but we hope that the ingenious author will prosecute the subject.\n\nWe cannot conclude this dissertation (which we acknowledge to be very unsatisfactory and imperfect) the chevalier Buat's account of the experiments of the chevalier Buat, which seem of immense consequence, and tend to give us very new views of the subject. Mr Buat observed the motion of water issuing from a glass cylinder through a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> formed by a bottom of smaller diameter; that is, the cylinder was open at both ends, and there was placed at its lower end a circle of smaller diameter, by way of bottom, which left a ring all around. He threw some powdered sealing wax into the water, and observed with great attention the motion of its small particles. He saw those which happened to be in the very axis of the cylinder descend along the axis with a motion pretty uniform,\nResistance uniform, till they came very near the bottom; from this they continued to descend very slowly, till they were almost in contact with the bottom; then they deviated from the centre, and approached the orifice in straight lines and with an accelerated motion, and at last darted into the orifice with great rapidity. He had observed a thing similar to this in a horizontal canal, in which he had set up a small board like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a> or bar, over which the water flowed. He had thrown a gooseberry into the water, in order to measure the velocity at the bottom, the gooseberry being a smaller matter heavier than water. It approached the dam uniformly till about three inches from it. Here it almost stood still, but it continued to advance till almost in contact. It then rose from the bottom along the inside of the dam with an accelerated motion, and quickly escaped over the top.\n\nHence he concluded, that the water which covers the anterior part of the body exposed to the stream is not perfectly stagnant, and that the filaments recede from the axis in curves, which converge to the surface of the body as different hyperbolas converge to the same asymptote, and that they move with a velocity continually increasing till they escape round the sides of the body.\n\nHe had established (by a pretty reasonable theory, confirmed by experiment) a proposition concerning the pressure which water in motion exerts on the surface along which it glides, viz., that the pressure is equal to that which it would exert if at rest minus the weight of the column whose height would produce the velocity of the peeling stream. Consequently the pressure which the stream exerts on the surface perpendicularly exposed to it will depend on the velocity with which it glides along it, and will diminish from the centre to the circumference. This, says he, may be the reason why the impulse on a plane wholly immersed is but one half of that on a plane which deflects the whole stream.\n\nHe contrived a very ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for examining this theory. A square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plate ABGF (fig. 22.) was pierced with a great number of holes, and fixed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of a shallow box represented edgewise in fig. 23. The back of this box was pierced with a hole c, in which was inserted the tube of glass CDE, bent square at D. This instrument was exposed to a stream of water, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> on the brass plate. The water having filled the box through the holes, stood at an equal height in the glass tube when the surrounding water was stagnant; but when it was in motion, it always flooded in the tube above the level of the smooth water without, and thus indicated the pressure occasioned by the action of the stream.\n\nWhen the instrument was not wholly immersed, there was always a considerable accumulation against the front of the box, and a depression behind it. The water before it was by no means stagnant: indeed it should not be, as Mr. Busat observes; for it consists of the water which was escaping on all sides, and therefore upwards from the axis of the stream, which meets the plate perpendicularly in e considerably under the surface. It escapes upwards; and if the body were sufficiently immersed, it would escape in this direction almost as easily as laterally. But in the present circumstances, it heaps up, till the elevation occasions it to fall off sidewise as fast as it is renewed. When the instrument was immersed more than its semidiameter under the surface, the water still rose above the level, and there was a great depression immediately behind this elevation. In consequence of this difficulty of escaping upwards, the water flows off laterally; and if the horizontal dimensions of the surface is great, this lateral efflux becomes more difficult, and requires a greater accumulation. From this it happens, that the resistance of broad surfaces equally immersed is greater than in the proportion of the breadth. A plane of two feet wide and one foot deep, when it is not completely immersed, will be more resisted than a plane two feet deep and one foot wide; for there will be an accumulation against both; and even if these were equal in height, the additional surface will be greatest in the widest body; and the elevation will be greater, because the lateral escape is more difficult.\n\nThe circumstances chiefly to be attended to are these. Circumstances towards the border, and, in general, the height of the water in the tube DE was more than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the height needed to cellularly produce the velocity when only the central hole was open. When various holes were opened at different distances from the centre, the height of the water in DH continually diminished as the hole was nearer the border. At a certain distance from the border the water at E was level with the surrounding water, so that no pressure was exerted on that hole. But the most unexpected and remarkable circumstance was, that, in great velocities, the holes at the very border, and even to a small distance from it, not only sustained no pressure, but even gave out water; for the water in the tube was lower than the surrounding water. Mr. Busat calls this a non-pressure. In a case in which the velocity of the stream was three feet, and the pressure on the central hole caused the water in the vertical tube to stand 33 lines or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch above the level of the surrounding smooth water, the action on a hole at the lower corner of the square caused it to stand 12 lines lower than the surrounding water. Now the velocity of the stream in this experiment was 36 inches per second. This requires 21\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) lines for its productive fall; whereas the pressure on the central hole was 33. This approaches to the pressure on a surface which deflects it wholly. The intermediate holes gave every variation of pressure, and the diminution was more rapid as the holes were nearer the edge; but the law of diminution could not be observed.\n\nThis is quite a new and most unexpected circumstance in the action of fluids on solid bodies, and renders the subject more intricate than ever; yet it is by no means inconsistent with the genuine principles of hydrostatics or hydraulics. In as far as M. Busat's proposition concerning the pressure of moving fluidics is true, it is very reasonable to say, that when the lateral velocity with which the fluid tends to escape exceeds the velocity of percussion, the height necessary for producing this velocity must exceed that which would produce the other, and a non-pressure must be observed. And if we consider the forms of the lateral filaments near the edge of the body, we see that the concavity of the curve is turned towards the body, and that the centrifugal forces tend to diminish their pressure on the body. If the middle alone were struck with a considerable velocity, the water might even\nResistance even rebound, as is frequently observed. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> rebounding is here prevented by the surrounding water, which is moving with the same velocity; but the pressure may be almost annihilated by the tendency to rebound of the inner filaments.\n\nPart (and perhaps a considerable part) of this apparent non-rebound is undoubtedly produced by the tenacity of the water, which sticks off with it the water lying in the hole. But, at any rate, this is an important fact, and gives great value to these experiments. It gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to many curious phenomena in the resistance of fluids; and the theory of Mr Buat deserves a very serious consideration. It is all contained in the two following propositions.\n\n1. \"If, by any cause whatever, a column of fluid, whether making part of an indefinite fluid, or contained in solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, come to move with a given velocity, the pressure which it exerted laterally before its motion, either on the adjoining fluid or on the sides of the canal, is diminished by the weight of a column having the height necessary for communicating the velocity of the motion.\"\n\n2. \"The pressure on the centre of a plane surface perpendicular to the stream, and wholly immersed in it, is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of the weight of a column having the height necessary for communicating the velocity. For \\( 33 = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 21 \\).\"\n\nHe attempted to ascertain the medium pressure on the whole surface, by opening 625 holes dispersed all over it. With the same velocity of current, he found the height in the tube to be 29 lines, or \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) more than the height necessary for producing the velocity. He justly concluded this to be too great a measure, because the holes were \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch from the edge: had there been holes at the very edge, they would have sustained a non-rebound, which would have diminished the height in the tube very considerably. He exposed to the same stream a conical funnel, which raised the water to 34 lines. But this could not be considered as a measure of the pressure on a plane solid surface; for the central water was undoubtedly scooped out, as it were, and the filaments much more deflected than they would have been by a plane surface. Perhaps something of this happened even in every small hole in the former experiments. And this suggests some doubt as to the accuracy of the measurement of the pressure and of the velocity of a current by Mr Pitot's tube. It surely renders some corrections absolutely necessary. It is a fact, that when exposed to a vein of fluid coming through a short passage, the water in the tube stands on a level with that in the reservoir. Now we know that the velocity of this stream does not exceed what would be produced by a fall equal to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the head of water in the reservoir. Mr Buat made many valuable observations and improvements on this most useful instrument, which will be taken notice of in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">RIVERS</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">WATER-WORKS</a>.\n\nMr Buat, by a scrupulous attention to all the circumstances, concludes, that the medium of pressure on the whole surface is equal to \\( \\frac{25}{21} \\times \\frac{5}{5} \\) of the weight of a column, having the surface for its base, and the productive fall for its height. But we think that there is an uncertainty in this conclusion; because the height of the water in the vertical tube was undoubtedly augmented by an hydrostatical pressure arising from the accumulation of water above the body which was exposed to the stream.\n\nSince the pressures are as the squares of the velocities, or as the heights \\( h \\) which produce the velocities, we may express this pressure by the symbol \\( \\frac{25}{21} \\times \\frac{5}{5} \\times h \\), or \\( \\frac{1}{186} \\times m \\times h \\), the value of \\( m \\) being 186. This exceeds considerably the result of the experiments of the French academy. In these it does not appear that \\( m \\) sensibly exceeds unity. Note, that in these experiments the body was moved through still water; here it is exposed to a stream. These are generally supposed to be equivalent, on the authority of the third law of motion, which makes every action depend on the relative motions. We shall by and by see some causes of difference.\n\nThe writers on this subject seem to think their task completed when they have considered the action of the fluid on the anterior part of the body, or that part of the body which is before the broadest section, and have paid little or no attention to the hinder part. Yet those who import most interested in the subject, the naval architects, seem convinced that it is of no less importance to attend to the form of the hinder part of a ship. And the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> practice of all nations has been to make the hinder part more acute than the fore-part. This has undoubtedly been deduced from experience; for it is in direct opposition to any notions which a person would naturally form on this subject. Mr Buat therefore thought it very necessary to examine the action of the water on the hinder part of a body by the same method. And, previous to this examination, in order to acquire some scientific notions of the subject, he made the following very curious and instructive experiment.\n\nTwo little conical pipes \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) (fig. 24.) were inserted into the upright side of a prismatic vessel. They were an inch long, and their diameters at the inner and outer ends were five and four lines. \\( A \\) was 57 lines under the surface, and \\( B \\) was 73. A glass syphon was made of the shape represented in the figure, and its internal diameter was 1\u00bd lines. It was placed with its mouth in the axis, and even with the base of the conical pipe. The pipes being shut, the vessel was filled with water, and it was made to stand on a level in the two legs of the syphon, the upper part being full of air. When this syphon was applied to the pipe \\( A \\), and the water running freely, it rose 32 lines in the short leg, and sunk as much in the other. When it was applied to the pipe \\( B \\), the water rose 41 lines in the one leg of the syphon, and sunk as much in the other.\n\nHe reasons in this manner from the experiment. The ring comprehended between the end of the syphon and the sides of the conical tube being the narrowest part of the orifice, the water issued with the velocity corresponding to the height of the water in the vessel above the orifice, diminished for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>. If therefore the cylinder of water immediately before the mouth of the syphon issued with the same velocity the tube would be emptied through a height equal to this head of water (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>). If, on the contrary, this cylinder of water, immediately before the mouth of the syphon, were stagnant, the water in it would exert its full pressure on the mouth of the syphon, and the water in the syphon would be level with the water in the vessel. Between\nBetween these extremes we must find the real state of the case, and we must measure the force of non-pressure by the rise of water in the syphon.\n\nWe see that in both experiments it bears an accurate proportion to the depth under the surface. For \\( \\frac{57}{73} = \\frac{32}{41} \\) very nearly. He therefore estimates the non-pressure to be \\( \\frac{56}{100} \\) of the height of the water above the orifice.\n\nWe are disposed to think that the ingenious author has not reasoned accurately from the experiment. In the first place, the force indicated by the experiment, whatever be its origin, is certainly double of what he supposes; for it must be measured by the sum of the rise of the water in one leg, and its depression in the other, the weight of the air in the bend of the syphon being neglected. It is precisely analogous to the force acting on the water oscillating in a syphon, which is acknowledged to be the sum of the elevation and depression. The force indicated by the experiment therefore is \\( \\frac{11}{100} \\) of the height of the water above the orifice. The force exhibited in this experiment bears a still greater proportion to the productive height; for it is certain that the water did not issue with the velocity acquired by the fall from the surface, and probably did not exceed \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of it. The effect of contraction must have been considerable and uncertain. The velocity should have been measured both by the amplitude of the jet and by the quantity of water discharged. In the next place, we apprehend that much of the effect is produced by the tenacity of the water, which drags along with it the water which would have flowed issued from the syphon, had the other end not dipped into the water of the vessel. We know, that if the horizontal part of the syphon had been continued far enough, and if no retardation were occasioned by friction, the column of water in the upright leg would have accelerated like any heavy body; and when the half of it had arrived at the bottom of that leg, the whole in the horizontal part would be moving with the velocity acquired by falling from the surface. The water of the vessel which issues through the surrounding ring very quickly acquires a much greater velocity than what the water descending in the syphon would acquire in the same time, and it drags this last water along with it both by tenacity and friction, and it drags it out till its action is opposed by the want of equilibrium produced in the syphon, by the elevation in the one leg and the depression in the other. We imagine that little can be concluded from the experiment with respect to the real non-pressure. Nay, if the sides of the syphon be supposed infinitely thin, so that there would be no curvature of the filaments of the surrounding water at the mouth of the syphon, we do not very distinctly see any source of non-pressure. For we are not altogether satisfied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> which Mr. Buat offers for this measure of the pressure of a stream of fluid gliding along a surface, and obstructed by friction or any other cause. We imagine that passing water in the present experiment would be a little retarded by accelerating continually the water descending in the syphon, and renewed a-top, supposing the upper end open; because this water would not of itself acquire more than half this velocity. It however drags it out, till it not only resists with a force equal to the weight of the whole vertical column, but even exceeds it by \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\). This it is able to do, because the whole pressure by which the water issues from an orifice has been shown (by Daniel Bernoulli) to be equal to twice this weight. We therefore consider this beautifully experiment as chiefly valuable, by giving us a measure of the tenacity of the water; and we wish that it were repeated in a variety of depths, in order to discover what relation the force exerted bears to the depth. It would seem that the tenacity, being a certain determinate thing, the proportion of 100 to 112 would not be constant; and that the observed ratio would be made up of two parts, one of them constant, and the other proportional to the depth under the surface.\n\nBut still this experiment is intimately connected with the matter in hand; and this apparent non-pressure on the hinder part of a body exposed to a stream, from whatever cause it proceeds, does operate in the action of water on this hinder part, and must be taken into the account.\n\nWe must therefore follow the chevalier de Buat in further his discussions on this subject. A prismatic body, having its prow and poop equal and parallel surfaces, and plunged horizontally into a fluid, will require a force to keep it firm in the direction of its axis precisely equal to the difference between the real pressures exerted on its prow and poop. If the fluid is at rest, this difference will be nothing, because the opposite dead pressures of the fluid will be equal: but in a stream, there is superadded to the dead pressure on the prow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> pressure arising from the deflections of the filaments of this fluid.\n\nIf the dead pressure on the poop remained in its full intensity by the perfect stagnation of the water behind it, the whole sensible pressure on the body would be the active pressure only on the prow, represented by \\( m h \\). If, on the other hand, we could suppose that the water behind the body moved continually away from it (being renewed laterally) with the velocity of the stream, the dead pressure would be entirely removed from its poop, and the whole sensible pressure, or what must be opposed by some external force, would be \\( m h + h \\). Neither of these can happen; and the real state of the case must be between these extremes.\n\nThe following experiments were tried: The perforated box with its vertical tube was exposed to the stream, the brass plate being turned down the stream. The velocity was again 36 inches per second.\n\nThe central hole A alone being opened, gave a non-pressure of 13 lines.\n\nA hole B, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch from the edge, gave 15 lines.\n\nA hole C, near the surface, gave 15-7 lines.\n\nA hole D, at the lower angle, gave 15-3 lines.\n\nHere it appears that there is a very considerable non-pressure, increasing from the centre to the border. This increase undoubtedly proceeds from the greater lateral velocity with which the water is gliding in from the sides. The water behind was by no means stagnant, although moving off with a much smaller velocity than that of the passing stream, and it was visibly removed from the sides, and gradually licked away at its further extremity.\n\nAnother box, having a great number of holes, all open, indicated a medium of non-pressure equal to 13-5 lines.\nAnother of larger dimensions, but having fewer holes, indicated a non-pressure of $12\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nBut the most remarkable, and the most important phenomena, were the following:\n\nThe first box was fixed to the side of another box, so that, when all was made smooth, it made a perfect cube, of which the perforated brass plate made the poop.\n\nThe apparatus being now exposed on the stream, with the perforated plate looking down the stream,\n\n| Hole A | B | C |\n|--------|---|---|\n|        |   |   |\n\nHere was a great diminution of the non-pressions produced by the distance between the prow and the poop.\n\nThis box was then fitted in the same manner, so as to make the poop of a box three feet long. In this situation the non-pressures were as follow:\n\n| Hole A | B |\n|--------|---|\n|        | 1.5 |\n|        | 3.2 |\n\nThe non-pressions were still farther diminished by this increase of length.\n\nThe box was then exposed with all the holes open, in three different situations:\n\n1st, Single, giving a non-pressure - 13.1\n2d, Making the poop of a cube - 5.3\n3d, Making the poop of a box three feet long - 3.0\n\nAnother larger box:\n\n1st, Single - 12.2\n2d, Poop of a cube - 5.\n3d, Poop of the long box - 3.2\n\nThese are most valuable experiments. They plainly show how important it is to consider the action on the hinder part of the body. For the whole impulse or resistance, which must be withstood or overcome by the external force, is the sum of the active pressure on the fore-part, and of the non-pressure on the hinder part; and they show that this does not depend solely on the form of the prow and poop, but also, and perhaps chiefly, on the length of the body. We see that the non-pressure on the hinder-part was prodigiously diminished (reduced to one-fourth) by making the length of the body triple of the breadth. And hence it appears, that merely lengthening a ship, without making any change in the form either of her prow or her poop, will greatly diminish the resistance to her motion through the water; and this increase of length may be made by continuing the form of the midship frame in several timbers along the keel, by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of the ship, and her power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> sail, will be greatly increased, and her other qualities improved, while her speed is augmented.\n\nIt is surely of importance to consider a little the physical cause of this change. The motions are extremely complicated, and we must be contented if we can but perceive a few leading circumstances.\n\nThe water is turned aside by the anterior part of the body, and the velocity of the filaments is increased, and they acquire a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERGENT\">divergent</a> motion, by which they also push aside the surrounding water. On each side of the body, therefore, they are moving in a divergent direction, and with an increased velocity. But as they are on all sides prefled by the fluid without them, their motions gradually approach parallelism, and their velocities to an equality with the stream. The progressive velocity, or that in the direction of the stream, is checked, at least at first. But since we observe the filaments contipated round the body, and that they are not deflected at right angles to their former direction, it is plain that the real velocity of a filament in its oblique path is augmented.\n\nWe always observe, that a stone lying in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> of the sea, is laid bare at the bottom, and the sand is generally washed away to some distance all around. This is owing to the increased velocity of the water which comes into contact with the stone. It takes up more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> than it can keep floating, and it deposits it at a little distance all around, forming a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, which surrounds the stone at a small distance. When the filaments of water have passed the body, they are prefled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBIENT\">ambient</a> fluid into the place which it has quitted, and they glide round its stern, and fill up the space behind. The more divergent and the more rapid they are, when about to fall in behind, the more of the circumambient pressure must be employed to turn them into the trough behind the body, and less of it will remain to press them to the body itself. The extreme of this must obtain when the stream is obstructed by a thin plane only. But when there is some distance between the prow and the poop, the divergency of the filaments which had been turned aside by the prow, is diminished by the time that they have come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> of the stern, and should turn in behind it. They are therefore more readily made to converge behind the body, and a more considerable part of the surrounding pressure remains unexpended, and therefore presses the water against the stern; and it is evident that this advantage must be so much the greater as the body is longer. But the advantage will soon be susceptible of no very considerable increase: for the lateral and divergent, and accelerated filaments, will soon become nearly parallel and equally rapid with the rest of the stream, that a great increase of length will not make any considerable change in these particulars; and it must be accompanied with an increase of friction.\n\nThere are very obvious reflections. And if we attend minutely to the way in which the almost stagnant fluid behind the body is expended and renewed, we shall see all these effects confirmed and augmented. But as we cannot say anything on this subject that is precise, or that can be made the subject of computation, it is needless to enter into a more minute discussion. The diminution of the non-pressure towards the centre most probably arises from the smaller force which is necessary to be expended in the inflection of the lateral filaments, already inflected in some degree, and having their velocity diminished. But it is a subject highly deserving the attention of the mathematicians; and we presume to invite them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the motions of these lateral filaments, pushing the body, and prefled into its wake by forces which are susceptible of no difficult investigation. It seems highly probable, that if a prismatic box, with a square stern, were fitted with an addition precisely shaped like the water which would (abtracting tenacity and friction) have been stagnant behind it, the quantity of non-pressure would be the smallest possible. The mathematician would surely discover circumstances which would\nBuat's deductions from his experiments.\n\nIn the mean time, let us attend to the deductions which Mr de Buat has made from his few experiments.\n\nWhen the velocity is three feet per second, requiring the productive height $21 \\cdot 5$ lines, the heights corresponding to the non-prelude on the poop of a thin plane is $14 \\cdot 41$ lines (taking in several circumstances of judicious correction, which we have not mentioned), that of a foot cube is $5 \\cdot 83$, and that of a box of triple length is $3 \\cdot 5$.\n\nLet $q$ express the variable ratio of these to the height producing the velocity, so that $q/h$ may express the non-prelude in every case; we have,\n\n| For a thin plane | $q = 5 \\cdot 67$ |\n|------------------|---------------|\n| a cube           | $q = 2 \\cdot 71$ |\n| a box = 3 cubes  | $q = 1 \\cdot 53$ |\n\nIt is evident that the value of $q$ has a dependence on the proportion of the length, and the transverse section of the body. A series of experiments on prismatic bodies showed Mr de Buat that the deviation of the filaments was similar in similar bodies, and that this obtained even in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> prisms, when the lengths were as the square-roots of the transverse sections. Although therefore the experiments were not sufficiently numerous for deducing the precise law, it seemed not impossible to derive from them a very useful approximation.\n\nBy a dexterous comparison he found, that if $l$ expresses the length of the prism, and $s$ the area of the transverse section, and $L$ expresses the common logarithm of the quantity to which it is prefixed, we shall express the non-prelude pretty accurately by the formula\n\n$$L \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s}} \\right).$$\n\nHence arises an important remark, that when the height corresponding to the non-prelude is greater than $\\sqrt{s}$, and the body is little immersed in the fluid, there will be a void behind it. Thus a surface of a square inch, just immersed in a current of three feet per second, will have a void behind it. A foot square will be in a similar condition when the velocity is 12 feet.\n\nWe must be careful to distinguish this non-prelude from the other causes of resistance, which are always necessarily combined with it. It is superadditive to the active impulsion on the prow, to the statical pressure of the accumulation ahead of the body, the statical pressure arising from the depression behind it, the effects of friction, and the effects of tenacity. It is indeed next to impossible to eliminate them separately, and many of them are actually combined in the measures now given. Nothing can determine the pure non-preludes till we can ascertain the motions of the filaments.\n\nM. de Buat here takes occasion to controvert the universally adopted maxim, that the prelude occasioned by a stream of fluid on a fixed body is the same with that on a body moving with equal velocity in a quiescent fluid. He repeated all these experiments with the perforated box in still water. The general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> was, that both the preludes and the non-prelude in this case were less, and that the odds were chiefly to be observed near the edges of the surface. The general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> of the prelude of a stream on the anterior surface was $m = 1 \\cdot 86$; but that on a moving body through a still fluid is only $m = 1$. He observed no non-prelude even at the very edge of the prow, but even a sensible prelude. The prelude, therefore, or resistance, is more equably diffused over the surface of the prow than the impulse is.\u2014He also found that the resistances diminished in a less ratio than the squares of the velocities, especially in small velocities.\n\nThe non-preludes increased in a greater ratio than the squares of the velocities. The ratio of the velocities to a small velocity of $2 \\cdot 5$ inches per second increased geometrically, the value of $q$ increased arithmetically; and we may determine $q$ for any velocity $V$ by this proportion\n\n$$L \\left( \\frac{V}{2 \\cdot 2} \\right) = 0 \\cdot 5 : q,$$\n\nand $q = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 8}$. That is, let the common logarithm of the velocity, divided by $2 \\cdot 5$, be considered as a common number; divide this common number by $2 \\cdot 5$, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUOTIENT\">quotient</a> is $q$, which must be multiplied by the productive height. The product is the prelude.\n\nWhen Piot's tube was exposed to the stream, we had $m = 1$; but when it is carried through still water, $m = 1 \\cdot 22$. When it was turned from the stream, we had $q = 0 \\cdot 157$; but when carried through still water, $q = 0 \\cdot 138$. A remarkable experiment.\n\nWhen the tube was moved laterally through the water, so that the motion was in the direction of the ports of its mouth, the non-prelude was $= 1$. This is one of his chief arguments for his theory of non-prelude. He does not give the detail of the experiment, and only infers the result in his table.\n\nAs a body exposed to a stream deflects the fluid, heaps it up, and increases its velocity; so a body moved through a still fluid turns it aside, causes it to swell up before it, and gives it a real motion alongside of it in the opposite direction. And as the body exposed to a stream has a quantity of fluid almost stagnant both before and behind; so a body moved through a still fluid carries before it and drags after it a quantity of fluid, which accompanies it with nearly an equal velocity. This addition to the quantity of matter in motion must make a diminution of its velocity; and this forms a very considerable part of the observed resistance.\n\nWe cannot, however, help remarking that it would be difficult to require very distinct and strong proof indeed to overturn the common opinion, which is founded on our most well founded, certain and simple conceptions of motion, and on a law of nature to which we have never observed an exception. M. de Buat's experiments, though most judiciously contrived, and executed with scrupulous care, are by no means of this kind. They were, of absolute necessity, very complicated; and many circumstances, impossible to avoid or to appreciate, rendered the observation, or at least the comparison, of the velocities, very uncertain.\n\nWe can see but two circumstances which do not admit of an easy or immediate comparison in the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the problem. When a body is exposed to a stream in our experiments, in order to have an impulse of bodies made on it, there is a force tending to move the body in running backwards, independent of the real impulse or prelude or still water occasioned by the deflection of the stream. We cannot have\nResistance have a stream except in consequence of a sloping surface. Suppose a body floating on this stream. It will not only fall down along with the stream, but it will fall down the stream, and will therefore go faster along the canal than the stream does; for it is floating on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined plane</a>; and if we examine it by the laws of hydrostatics, we shall find, that besides its own tendency to slide down this inclined plane, there is an odds of hydrostatical pressure, which pushes it down this plane. It will therefore go along the canal faster than the stream. For this acceleration depends on the difference of pressure at the two ends, and will be more remarkable as the body is larger, and especially as it is longer. This may be distinctly observed. All floating bodies go into the stream of the river, because there they find the smallest obstruction to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of this motion along the inclined plane; and when a number of bodies are thus floating down the stream, the largest and longest outstrip the rest. A log of wood floating down in this manner may be observed to make its way very fast among the chips and sawdust which float alongside of it.\n\nNow when, in the course of our experiments, a body is supported against the action of the stream, and the impulse is measured by the force employed to support it, it is plain that part of this force is employed to act against that tendency which the body has to outstrip the stream. This does not appear in our experiment, when we move a body with the velocity of this stream through still water having a horizontal surface.\n\nThe other distinguishing circumstance is, that the retardations of a stream arising from friction are found to be nearly as the velocities. When, therefore, a stream moving in a limited canal is checked by a body put in its way, the diminution of velocity occasioned by the friction of the stream having already produced its effect, the impulse is not affected by it; but when the body puts the still water in motion, the friction of the bottom produces some effect, by retarding the receipt of the water. This, however, must be next to nothing.\n\nThe chief difference will arise from its being almost impossible to make an exact comparison of the velocities: for when a body is moved against the stream, the relative velocity is the same in all the filaments. But when we expose a body to a stream, the velocity of the different filaments is not the same; because it decreases from the middle of the stream to the sides.\n\nMr Buat found the total sensible resistance of a plate 12 inches square, and measured, not by the height of water in the tube of the perforated box, but by weights acting on the arm of a balance, having its centre 15 inches under the surface of a stream moving three feet per second, to be 19.46 pounds; that of a cube of the same dimensions was 15.22; and that of a prism three feet long was 13.87; that of a prism five feet long was 14.27. The three first agree extremely well with the determination of \\( m \\) and \\( q \\), by the experiments with the perforated box. The total resistance of the last was undoubtedly much increased by friction, and by the retrograde force of so long a prism floating in an inclined stream. This last by computation is 0.223 pounds; this added to \\( h(m+q) \\), which is 13.39, gives 13.81, leaving 0.46 for the effect of friction.\n\nIf the same resistances be computed on the supposition that the body moves in still water, in which case resistance, we have \\( m=1 \\), and \\( q \\) for a thin plate = 0.433; and if \\( q \\) be computed for the lengths of the other two bodies by the formula \\( \\frac{1}{q} = L + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}} \\); we shall get for the resistances 14.94; 12.22; and 11.49.\n\nHence Mr Buat concludes, that the resistances in these two states are nearly in the ratio of 13 to 10. This, he thinks, will account for the difference observed water adhering to a body moving in still water, &c.\n\nMr Buat next endeavours to ascertain the quantity of water which is made to adhere in some degree to a body which is carried along through still water, or which remains nearly stagnant in the midst of a stream. He takes the sum of the motions in the direction of the stream, viz., the sum of the actual motions of all those particles which have lost part of their motion, and he divides this sum by the general velocity of the stream. The quotient is equivalent to a certain quantity of water perfectly stagnant round the body. Without being able to determine this with precision, he observes, that it augments as the resistance diminishes; for in the case of a longer body, the filaments are observed to converge to a greater distance behind the body. The stagnant mass ahead of the body is more constant; for the deflection and resistance at the prow are observed not to be affected at the length of the body. Mr Buat, by a very nice analysis of many circumstances, comes to this conclusion, that the whole quantity of fluid, which in this manner accompanies the solid body, remains the same whatever is the velocity. He might have deduced it at once, from the consideration that the curves described by the filaments are the same in all velocities.\n\nHe then relates a number of experiments made to ascertain the absolute quantity thus made to accompany the body. These were made by causing pendulums to oscillate in fluids. Newton had determined the resistances to such oscillation by the diminution of the arches of vibration. Mr Buat determines the quantity of dragged fluid by the increase of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for this stagnation or dragging is in fact adding a quantity of matter to be moved, without any addition to the moving force. It was ingeniously observed by Newton, that the time of oscillation was not sensibly affected by the resistance of the fluid: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a>, almost complete, being made by the diminution of the arches of vibration; and experiment confirmed this. If, therefore, a great augmentation of the time of vibration be observed, it must be ascribed to the additional quantity of matter which is thus dragged into motion, and it may be employed for its measurement. Thus, let \\( a \\) be the length of a pendulum swinging seconds in vacuo, and \\( l \\) the length of a second's pendulum swinging in a fluid. Let \\( p \\) be the weight of the body in the fluid, and \\( P \\) the weight of the body displaced by it; \\( P+p \\) will express its weight in vacuo, and \\( \\frac{P+p}{p} \\) will be the ratio of these weights. We shall therefore have \\( \\frac{P+p}{p} = \\frac{a}{l} \\) and \\( l = \\frac{ap}{P+p} \\).\n\nLet \\( n \\) express the sum of the fluid displaced, and the fluid dragged along, \\( n \\) being a greater number than unity,\nResistance, unity, to be determined by experiment. The mass in motion is no longer $P + \\rho$, but $P + n\\rho$, while its weight in the fluid is still $\\rho$. Therefore we must have\n\n$$I = \\frac{a\\rho}{n\\rho + P} = \\frac{a}{n + \\frac{P}{\\rho}}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\frac{\\rho}{P} \\left( \\frac{a}{\\rho} - 1 \\right).$$\n\nA prodigious number of experiments made by M. Buat on spheres vibrating in water gave values of $n$, which were very constant, namely, from 1.5 to 1.7; and by considering the circumstances which accompanied the variations of $n$ (which he found to arise chiefly from the curvature of the path described by the ball), he states the mean value of the number $n$ at 1.583. So that a sphere in motion drags along with it about $\\frac{6}{5}$ of its own bulk of fluid with a velocity equal to its own.\n\nHe made similar experiments with prisms, pyramids, and other bodies, and found a complete confirmation of his assertion, that prisms of equal lengths and sections, though dissimilar, dragged equal quantities of fluid; that similar prisms and prisms not similar, but whose lengths were as the square root of their sections, dragged quantities proportional to their bulks.\n\nHe found a general value of $n$ for prismatic bodies, which alone may be considered as a valuable truth; namely, that $n = 0.705 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{P}} + 1.13$.\n\nFrom all these circumstances, we see an intimate connection between the pressures, non-pressures, and the fluid dragged along with the body. Indeed this is immediately deducible from the first principles; for what Mr Buat calls the dragged fluid is in fact a certain portion of the whole change of motion produced in the direction of the bodies motion.\n\nIt was found, that with respect to thin planes, spheres, and pyramidal bodies of equal bases, the resistances were inversely as the quantities of fluid dragged along.\n\nThe intelligent reader will readily observe, that these views of the Chevalier Buat are not so much discoveries of new principles as they are classifications of consequences, which may all be deduced from the general principles employed by D'Alembert and other mathematicians. But they greatly assist us in forming notions of different parts of the procedure of nature in the mutual action of fluids and solids on each other. This must be very acceptable in a subject which it is by no means probable that we shall be able to investigate with mathematical precision. We have given an account of these last observations, that we may omit nothing of consequence that has been written on the subject; and we take this opportunity of recommending the *Hydraulique* of Mr Buat as a most ingenious work, containing more original, ingenious, and practically useful thoughts, than all the performances we have met with. His doctrine of the principle of uniform motion of fluids in pipes and open canals, will be of immense service to all engineers, and enable them to determine with sufficient precision the most important questions in their profession; questions which at present they are hardly able to guess at. See *Rivers and Water Works*.\n\nThe only circumstance which we have not noticed in detail, is the change of resistance produced by the void, or tendency to a void, which obtains behind the body; and we omitted a particular discussion, merely because we could say nothing sufficiently precise on the subject. Resistance. Persons not accustomed to the discussions in the physico-mathematical sciences, are apt to entertain doubts or false notions connected with this circumstance, which we shall attempt to remove; and with this we shall conclude this dissertation.\n\nIf a fluid were perfectly incompressible, and were contained in a vessel incapable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>, it is impossible that any void could be formed behind the body; and in this case it is not very easy to see how motion could be performed in it. A sphere moved in such a medium could not advance the smallest distance, unless some particles of the fluid, in filling up the space left by it, moved with a velocity next to infinite. Some degree of compressibility, however small, seems necessary. If this be insensible, it may be rigidly demonstrated, that an external force of compression will make no sensible change in the internal motions, or in the resistances. This indeed is not obvious, but is an immediate consequence of the quadruplerium pressure of fluids. As much as the pressure is augmented by the external compressions in one side of a body, so much is it augmented on the other side; and the same must be said of every particle. Nothing more is necessary for securing the same motions by the same partial and internal forces; and this is fully verified by experiment. Water remains equally fluid under any compressions. In some of Sir Isaac Newton's experiments balls of four inches diameter were made so light as to preponderate in water only three grains. These balls descended in the same manner as they would have descended in a fluid where the resistance was equal in every part; yet, when they were near the bottom of a vessel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet deep, the compression round them was at least 2400 times the moving force; whereas, when near the top of the vessel, it was not above 50 or 60 times.\n\nBut in a fluid sensibly compressible, or which is not confined, a void may be left behind the body. Its motion may be so swift that the surrounding pressure may not suffice for filling up the deserted space; and, in this case, a flatical pressure will be added to the resistance. This may be the case in a vessel or pond of water having an open surface exposed to the finite or limited pressure of the atmosphere. The question now is, whether the resistance will be increased by an increase of external pressure? Supposing a sphere moving near the surface of water, and another moving equally fast at four times the depth. If the motion be so swift that a void is formed in both cases, there is no doubt but that the sphere which moves at the greatest depth is most retarded by the pressure of the water. If there is no void in either case, then, because the quadruple depth would cause the water to flow in with only a double velocity, it would seem that the resistance would be greater; and indeed the water flowing in laterally with a double velocity produces a quadruple non-pressure.\u2014But, on the other hand, the pressure at a small depth may be insufficient for preventing a void, while that below effectually prevents it; and this was observed in some experiments of Chevalier de Borda. The effect, therefore, of greater immersion, or of greater compression, in an elastic fluid, does not follow a precise ratio of the pressure, but depends partly on absolute quantities. It cannot, therefore, be stated by any very simple formula what increase or diminution of resistance will result.\nIt is evident, that a smaller elevation will suffice when the body is more immersed, because the check or impulse given by the body below is propagated, not vertically only, but in every direction; and therefore the elevation is not confined to that part of the surface which is immediately above the moving body, but extends so much further laterally as the centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> is deeper: Thus, the elevation necessary for the passage of the body is so much smaller; and it is the height only of this accumulation or wave which determines the backward pressure on the body. D'Ulloa's equation may happen to quadrature with two experiments at different depths, without being nearly just; for any two points may be in a curve, without exhibiting its equation. Three points will do it with some approach to precision; but four, at least, are necessary for giving any notion of its nature. D'Ullon has only given two experiments, which we mentioned in another place.\n\nWe may here observe, that it is this circumstance which immediately produces the great resistance to the motion of a body through a fluid in a narrow canal.\u2014The fluid cannot pass the body, unless the area of the section be sufficiently extensive. A narrow canal prevents the extension sidewise. The water must therefore heap up, till the section and velocity of diffusion are sufficiently enlarged, and thus a great backward pressure is produced. (See the second series of Experiments by the French Academicians; see also Franklin's Essays.) It is important, and will be considered in another place.\n\nThus have we attempted to give our readers some account of one of the most interesting problems in the whole of mechanical philosophy. We are sorry that so little advantage can be derived from the united efforts of the first mathematicians of Europe, and that there is so little hope of greatly improving our scientific knowledge of the subject. What we have delivered will, however, enable our readers to peruse the writings of those who have applied the theories to practical purposes. Such, for instance, are the treatises of John Bernoulli, of Bouguer, and of Euler, on the construction and working of ships, and the occasional differences of different authors on water-mills. In this last application the ordinary theory is not without its value, for the impulses are nearly perpendicular; in which case they do not materially deviate from the duplicate proportion of the sine of incidence. But even here this theory, applied as it commonly is, misleads us exceedingly. The impulse on one float may be accurately enough stated by it; but the authors have not been attentive to the motion of the water after it has made its impulse; and the impulse on the next float is stated the same as if the parallel filaments of water, which were not stopped by the preceding float, did impinge on the opposite part of the second, in the same manner, and with the same obliquity and energy, as if it were detached from the rest. But this does not in the least resemble the real process of nature.\n\nSuppose the floats B, C, D, H (fig. 26.) of a wheel immersed in a stream whose surface moves in the direction AK, and that this surface meets the float B in E. The part BE alone is supposed to be impelled; whereas the water, checked by the float, heaps up on it to e.\u2014Then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the horizontal line BF, the part CF of the...\nResolution, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of a mixed body into its component parts or first principles, as far as can be done by a proper analysis.\n\nResolution, in Medicine, the disappearing of any tumor without coming to suppuration or forming an abscess.\n\nResolvents, in Medicine, such as are proper for dissipating tumors, without allowing them to come to suppuration.\n\nResonance, Resounding, in Music, &c., a sound returned by the air inclosed in the bodies of stringed instruments, such as lutes, &c., or even in the bodies of wind-instruments, as flutes, &c.\n\nRespiration, the act of respiring or breathing the air.

The abuses of the church of Rome, with respect to relics, are very flagrant and notorious. For such was the rage for them at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, that, as F. Mabillon a Benedictine justly complains, the altars were loaded with suspected relics; numerous spurious ones being everywhere offered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> of the faithful. He adds, too, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> are often consecrated, which, far from belonging to saints, probably do not belong to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>. From the catacombs numerous relics have been taken, and yet it is not known who were the persons interred therein. In the 11th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, relics were tried by fire, and those which did not consume were reckoned genuine, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> not. Relics were, and still are, preferred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the altars whereon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> is celebrated; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> hole being made in the middle of the altar, big enough to receive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and herein is the relic deposited, being first wrapped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, and inclosed in a leaden box.\n\nThe Romanists plead antiquity in behalf of relics; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANICHEES\">Manichees</a>, out of hatred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, which they considered as an evil principle, refused to honour the relics of saints; which is reckoned a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the Catholics did it in the first ages.\n\nWe know, indeed, that the touching of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloths on relics, from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> derived therefrom, was as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> as the first ages, there being a hole made in the coffins of the 40 martyrs at Constantinople expressly for this purpose. The honouring the relics of saints, on which the church of Rome afterwards founded her superstitious and lucrative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them, as objects of devotion, as a kind of charms or amulets, and as instruments of pretended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a>, appears to have originated in a very ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, that prevailed among Christians, of assembling at the cemeteries or burying-places of the martyrs, for the purpose of commemorating them, and of performing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WORSHIP\">worship</a>. When the profession of Christianity obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTECTION\">protection</a> of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, under Constantine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">Great</a>, stately churches were erected over their sepulchres, and their names and memories were treated with every possible token of affection and respect. This reverence, however, gradually exceeded all reasonable bounds;\nRelics; bounds; and these prayers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> services were thought to have a peculiar sanctity and virtue, which were performed over their tombs. Hence the practice, which afterwards obtained, of depositing relics of saints and martyrs under the altars in all churches. This practice was then thought of such importance, that St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBROSE\">Ambrose</a> would not consecrate a church because it had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> relics; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of Constantinople in Trullo ordained, that those altars should be demolished under which there were found no relics. The rage of procuring relics for this and other purposes of a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, became so excessive, that in 386 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Theodosius the Great was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, forbidding the people to dig up the bodies of the martyrs, and to traffic in their relics.\n\nSuch was the origin of that respect for sacred relics, which afterwards was perverted into a formal worship of them, and became the occasion of innumerable processions, pilgrimages, and miracles, from which the church of Rome hath derived incredible advantage.\u2014In the end of the ninth century, it was not sufficient to reverence departed saints, and to confide in their intercessions and succours, to clothe them with an imaginary power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALING\">healing</a> diseases, working miracles, and delivering from all sorts of calamities and dangers; their bones, their clothes, the apparel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a> they had possessed during their lives, the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> which they had touched, or in which their purified carcases were laid, were treated with a stupid veneration, and supposed to retain the marvellous virtue of healing all disorders both of body and mind, and of defending such as possessed them against all the assaults and devices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of all this was, that every one was eager to provide himself with these salutary remedies; consequently, great numbers undertook fatiguing and perilous voyages, and subjected themselves to all sorts of hardships; while others made use of this delusion to accumulate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, and to impose upon the miserable multitude by the most impious and shocking inventions. As the demand for relics was prodigious and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, the clergy employed the utmost dexterity to satisfy all demands, and were far from being nice in the methods they used for that end. The bodies of the saints were sought by fasting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>, instituted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> in order to obtain a divine answer and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, and this pretended direction never failed to accomplish their desires; the holy carcase was always found, and that always in consequence, as they impiously gave out, of the suggestion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of God himself. Each discovery of this kind was attended with excessive demonstrations of joy, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> the zeal of these devout seekers to enrich the church still more and more with this new kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>. Many travelled with this view into the eastern provinces, and frequented the places which Christ and his disciples had honoured with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>, that, with the bones and other sacred remains of the first heralds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>, they might comfort dejected minds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> trembling consciences, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> sinking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> their inhabitants from all sorts of calamities. Nor did these pious travellers return home empty; the craft, dexterity, and knavery of the Greeks, found a rich prey in the stupid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of the Latin relic-hunters, and made a profitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of this new devotion. The latter paid considerable sums for legs and arms, skulls and jaw-bones (several of which were Pagan, and some not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a>), and other things that were supposed to have belonged to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> worthies of the Christian church; and thus the Latin churches came to the possession of these celebrated relics of St Mark, St James, St Bartholomew, Cyprian, Pantaleon, and others, which they show at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> with so much ostentation. But there were many who, unable to procure for themselves these spiritual treasures by voyages and prayers, had recourse to violence and theft; for all sorts of means, and all sorts of attempts in a cause of this nature, were considered, when successful, as pious and acceptable to the Supreme Being.\u2014Besides the arguments from antiquity to which the Papists refer, in vindication of their worship of relics, of which the reader may form some judgement from this article, Bellarmine appeals to Scripture in support of it, and cites the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, viz. Exod. xiii. 19.; Deut. xxxiv. 6.; 2 Kings xiii. 21.; 2 Kings xxiii. 16., 17., 18.; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAIAH\">Isaiah</a> xi. 10.; Matthew xi. 20., 21., 22.; Acts v. 12.\u201415.; Acts xix. 11., 12.

But, however proper this veneration and respect may be, its abuse has been so great and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, as fully to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> the rejection of them altogether.\n\nRelics are forbidden to be used or brought into England by several statutes; and justices of peace are empowered to search houses for popish books and relics, which, when found, are to be defaced and burnt, &c.","sp":342,"ep":343},{"h":"RELIEF","t":"signifies a certain sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, which the tenant, holding by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> serjeanty, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>, (for which homage or legal service is due), and being at full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his ancestor, paid unto his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> at his entrance.

The English ill brooked this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of their newly adopted policy; and therefore William the Conqueror by his laws confirmed the relief, by directing (in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the Danish heiots), that a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of arms, and habiliments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, should be paid by the earls, barons, and vavasours respectively; and, if the latter had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> arms, they should pay 100 shillings. William Rufus broke through this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and again demanded arbitrary uncertain reliefs, as due by the feudal laws; thereby in effect obliging every heir to new-purchase or redeem his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>: but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Henry I., by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> before mentioned, restored his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; and ordained, that the relief to be paid should be, according to the law so established, and not an arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>.\u2014But afterwards, when, by an ordinance in 27 Hen.

In either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the import of the word religion is different from that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>, as the former signifies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of practical duties, and the latter a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> truths. From theology is therefore the foundation of religion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> from which it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can study what pertains to the worship of superior powers till he believe that such powers exist, or feel any obligation on his mind from a relation of which he knows nothing.\n\nThis idea of religion, as distinguished from theology, comprehends the duties not only of those more refined and complicated systems of theism or polytheism which have prevailed among civilized and enlightened nations, such as the polytheism of the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and the theism of the Jews, the Mahometans, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; it comprehends every sentiment of obligation which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> beings have ever conceived themselves under to superior powers, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as all the forms of worship which have ever been practised through the world, however fantastic, immoral, or absurd.\n\nWhen we turn our eyes to this feature of the human character, we find it peculiarly interesting. Mankind are distinguished from the brutal tribes, and elevated to a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, by the rational and moral faculties with which they are endowed; but they are still more widely distinguished from the inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, and more highly exalted above them, by being made capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> notions and religious sentiments. The slightest knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is sufficient to inform us, that religion has ever had a powerful influence in moulding the sentiments and manners of men. It has sometimes dignified, and sometimes degraded, the human character. In one region or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> it has been favourable to civilization and refinement; in another, it has occasionally cramped the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, deprived the morals, and deformed the manners of men. The varieties of religion are innumerable; and the members of every distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> must view all who differ from them as more or less mistaken with respect to the most important concerns of man. Religion seems to be congenial to the heart of man; for wherever human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> subsists, there we are certain of finding religious opinions and sentiments.\n\nIt must, therefore, be an important subject of speculation to the man and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> to consider the origin of religion; to inquire, How far religion in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> has a tendency to promote or to injure the order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of society? and, above all, to examine, What particular religion is best calculated to produce a happy influence on human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>?\n\nWe shall endeavour to give a satisfactory answer to each of these questions; referring to the article THEOLOGY the consideration of the dogmas of that particular religion which, from our present inquiries, shall appear to be true, and to have the happiest influence on human life and manners.\n\nI. The foundation of all religion rests on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of one or more superior beings, who govern the world, and upon whom the happiness or misery of mankind ultimately depends. Of this belief, as it may be said to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, there seem to be but three sources that can be conceived. Either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> must be stamped on the mind of every human being, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> as well as the sage; or the founders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, and other eminent persons, tracing, by the efforts\nReligion, efforts of their own reason visible effects to invisible causes, must have discovered the existence of superior powers, and communicated the discovery to their associates and followers; or, lastly, the universal belief in such powers must have been derived by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> from a primeval <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, communicated to the progenitors of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\nOne or other of these hypotheses must be true, because a fourth cannot be framed. But we have elsewhere (Polytheism, No. 2.) examined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> which has been employed to establish the first, and shown that it proceeds upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> notions of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. We should likewise pronounce it contrary to fact, could we believe, on the authority of some of its patrons, who are not ashamed to contradict one another, that the Kamchatkans, and other tribes, in the lowest state of reasoning and morals, have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> whatever of Deity. We proceed, therefore, to consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, which is much more plausible, and will bear a stricter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a>.\n\nThat the existence and many of the attributes of the Deity are capable of rigid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> which cannot be controverted either by the philosopher or the Christian; for \"the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead,\" (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> III. chap. vi. and Theology, No. 8, 9.) But surely it would be rash to infer, either that every truth for which, when it is known, the ingenuity of man can frame a demonstration, is therefore discoverable by human sagacity, or that all the truths which have been discovered by a Newton or a Locke might therefore have been discovered by untaught barbarians. In mathematical science, there are few demonstrations of easier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> than that given by Euclid, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a> is the reputed author; yet no man ever dreamed that a boy capable of being made to understand that theorem, must therefore have sagacity equal to the sage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a>; or that such a boy, having never heard of the relation between the hypotenuse and other two sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, would be likely to discover that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the former is precisely equal to the sum of the squares of the latter. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">Just</a> so it seems to be with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> truths of theology. There can hardly be conceived a demonstration less intricate, or more conclusive, than that which the man of science employs to prove the existence of at least one God, possessed of boundless power and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. And could we suppose that the human race had remained without any knowledge of God in the world, till certain lucky individuals had by some means or other made themselves masters of the rules of logic, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of causes, there can be no doubt but that these individuals might have discovered the existence of superior powers, and communicated their discovery to their associates and followers. But this supposition cannot be admitted, as it is contradicted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of all history. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> has ever been found, in which there is not reason to believe that some notions were entertained of superior and invisible powers, upon which depends the happiness or misery of mankind: and from the most authentic records of antiquity, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> that very pure principles of theism prevailed in some nations <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the rules of logic, and the philosophy of causes, were thought of by any people under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.\n\nThe supposition before us is inadmissible upon other accounts. Some modern philosophers have fancied that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> progenitors of mankind were left entirely to themselves from the moment of their creation; that they wandered about for ages without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of speech and in the lowest state of savagery; but that they gradually civilized themselves, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> stumbled upon the contrivance of making articulate sounds significant of ideas, which was followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of arts and sciences, with all the blessings of religion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> in their train. But this is a wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERIE\">reverie</a>, inconsistent with the phenomena of human nature.\n\nIt is a well-known fact, that a man <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> from his birth, and suddenly made to see, would not by means of his newly acquired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> discern either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of objects, but would conceive everything which communicated to him visible sensations as inseparably united to his eye or his mind (see Metaphysics, No. 49\u201453). How long his sense of sight would remain in such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> state, we cannot positively say; but from attending to the visible sensations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, we are confident that weeks, if not months, elapse before they can distinguish one thing from another. We have indeed been told, that Chefelden's famous patient, though he was at first in the state which we have described, learned to distinguish objects by sight in the course of a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, or at the most of a few days: but admitting this to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to be true, it may easily be accounted for. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> called cata-ract does not always occasion total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>; but let us suppose the eyes of this man to have been so completely dimmed as to communicate no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> whatever upon being exposed to the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; still we must remember that he had long possessed the power of locomotion and all his other senses in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. He was therefore well acquainted with the real, i.e., the tangible magnitude, figure, and distance of many objects; and having been often told that the things which he touched would, upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of sight, communicate new sensations to his mind, differing from each other according to the distance, figure, and magnitude of the objects by which they were occasioned, he would soon learn to infer the one from the other, and to distinguish near objects by means of his sight.\n\nThe progenitors of the human race, however, if left to themselves from the moment of their creation, had not the same advantages. When they first opened their eyes, they had neither moved, nor handled, nor heard, nor smelled, nor tasted, nor had a single idea or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> treasured up in their memories; but were in all these respects in the state of new-born infants. Now we should be glad to be informed by those sages who have conducted mankind through many generations in which they were mutum et turpe pecus to that happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when they invented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, how the first men were taught to distinguish objects by their sense of sight, and how they contrived to live till this most necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> was acquired? It does not appear that men are like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>, provided with a number of instincts which guide them blindfold and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to whatever is necessary for their own preservation (see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">Instinct</a>): On the contrary, all voyagers tell us that,\nReligion in strange and uninhabited countries, they dare not venture to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> unknown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> unless they perceive that these fruits are eaten by the fowls of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. But without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of instinct, or of some other guide equally to be depended upon, it is not in our power to conceive how men dropt from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of their Creator, and left from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> wholly to themselves, could move a single step without the most imminent danger, or even stretch out their hands to lay hold of that food which we may suppose to have been placed within their reach. They could not, for many days, distinguish a precipice from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, a rock from a pit, or a river from the meadows through which it rolled. And in such circumstances, how could they possibly exist, till their senses of sight had acquired such perfection as to be a sufficient guide to all their necessary motions? Can any confident theist suppose that the God whose goodness is so conspicuously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in all his works, would leave his noblest creature on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, a creature for whose comfort alone many other creatures seem to have been formed, in a situation so forlorn as this, where his immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> appears to be inevitable? No! This supposition cannot be formed, because mankind still exist.\n\nWill it then be said, that when God formed the first men, he not only gave them organs of sensation, and souls capable of arriving by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of reason, but that he also impressed upon their minds adequate ideas and notions of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in which they were interested; brought all their organs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal, at once to their utmost possible state of perfection; taught them instantaneously the laws of reasoning; and, in one word, stored their minds with every branch of useful knowledge? This is indeed our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; and it is perfectly agreeable to what we are taught by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> lawgiver. When God had formed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">Eve</a>, Moses does not say that he left them to acquire by slow degrees the use of their senses and reasoning powers, and to distinguish as they could fruits that were salutary from those that were poisonous. No: he placed them in a garden where every tree but one bore fruit fit for food; he warned them particularly against the fruit of that tree; he brought before them the various animals which roamed through the garden; he arranged these animals into their proper genera and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>; and by teaching Adam to give them names, he communicated to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> the elements of language. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> appears in every respect worthy of perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>; and indeed without it the helpless man and woman could not have lived one whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. But it cannot be supposed, that amidst so much useful instruction the gracious Creator would neglect to communicate to his rational creatures the knowledge of himself; to inform them of their own origin, and the relations in which they stood to him; and to state in the plainest terms the duties <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on them in return for so much goodness.\n\nIn what manner all this knowledge was communicated, cannot be certainly known. It may have been in either of the following ways conceivable by us, or in others of which we can form no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>. God may have miraculously stored the minds of the first pair with adequate ideas and notions of sensible and intellectual objects; and they by an internal operation of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">Spirit</a> have enabled them to exert at once their rational faculties so as to discover his existence and attributes, together with the relation in which as creatures they stood to him their Almighty Creator. Or, after rendering them capable of distinguishing objects by means of their senses, of comparing their ideas, and understanding a language, he may have exhibited himself under some sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a>, and conducted them by degrees from one branch of knowledge to another, as a schoolmaster conducts his pupils, till they were sufficiently acquainted with every thing relating to their own happiness, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>, as rational, moral, and religious creatures. In determining the question before us, it is of no importance whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> wisdom adopted either of these methods, or some other different from them, both which we cannot conceive. The ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in which men acquire knowledge is, by the laws of their nature, extremely tedious. They cannot reason before their minds be stored with ideas and notions; and they cannot acquire these but through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of their senses long exercised on external objects.\n\nThe progenitors of the human race, left to inform themselves by this process, must have inevitably perished that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> before they had acquired one distinct notion; and it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, it was the same thing with respect to the origin of religion, equally a question whether God preserved them from destruction by an internal or external revelation. If he stored their minds at once with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of all useful knowledge, and rendered them capable of exerting their rational faculties, so as, by tracing effects to their causes, to discover his being and attributes, he revealed himself to them as certainly as he did afterwards to Moses, when to him he condescended to speak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> to face.\n\nIf this reasoning be admitted as fair and conclusive, and we apprehend that the principles on which it proceeds cannot be considered as ill-founded, we have advanced so far as to prove that mankind must have been originally enlightened by a revelation. But it is scarcely necessary to observe, that this revelation must have been handed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> through succeeding generations. It could not fail to reach the era of the deluge. It is not absurd to suppose, that he who spoke from heaven to Adam, spoke also to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>. And both the revelation which had been handed down to the postdiluvian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> by tradition, and that which was communicated immediately to himself, would be by him made known to his descendants. Thus it appears almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> that some part of the religious sentiments of mankind should not have been derived from revelation; and that not of the religious sentiments of one particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> or tribe, but of almost all the nations of the earth.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a>, which we have deduced by fair reasoning from the benevolence of God and the nature of the man, is confirmed by the authority of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, which are entitled to more implicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> than all the other records of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> history.\n\nWhen we review the internal and external evidence of the authenticity of these sacred books, we cannot for a moment hesitate to receive them as the genuine word of God. If we examine their internal character, they everywhere appear to be indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of Heaven. The creation of the world\u2014the manner in which this globe was first peopled\u2014the deluge which swept away its inhabitants\u2014the succeeding views of the state of mankind...\nmankind in the next ages after the deluge\u2014the calling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>\u2014the legislation of Moses\u2014the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of events which befell the Jewish nation\u2014the prophecies\u2014the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, and the promulgation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a>, as explained to us in the Scriptures\u2014form one series, which is, in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, illustrative of the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Supreme Being.\n\nWhile it must be allowed that the human mind is ever prone to debauch the sublime principles of true religion by enthusiasm and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, reason and candour will not for a moment hesitate to acknowledge, that the whole system of revelation represents the Supreme Being in the most sublime and amiable light: that, in it, religion appears essentially connected with morality; that the legislative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CODE\">code</a> of Moses was such as no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> ever formed and established among a people equally rude and uncultivated: that the manners and morals of the Jews, vicious and savage as they may in some instances appear, yet merit a much higher character than those either of their neighbours, or of almost any other nation, whose circumstances and character were in other respects similar to theirs: that there is an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the Scripture prophecies and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> and predictions which prevailed among heathen nations: and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> recorded in those writings which we esteem sacred were attended with circumstances which entitle them to be ranked in a very different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> from those which enthusiasm and imposture have fabricated among other nations. See MIRACLE and PROPHECY.\n\nBut as the evidence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> religion rests particularly on the authority of the first five books of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, it may be thought incumbent on us to support our reasoning on this subject, by proving, that the author of those books was indeed inspired by God. This we shall endeavour to do by one decisive argument; for the nature of the article, and the limits prescribed us, admit not of our entering into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> detail of all that has been written on the divine legation of Moses.\n\nIf the miracles recorded in the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXODUS\">Exodus</a>, and the other writings of the Hebrew lawgiver, were really performed; if the first-born of the Egyptians were all cut off in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, as is there related; and if the children of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a> passed through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, the waters being divided, and forming a wall on their right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and on their left\u2014it must necessarily be granted, that Moses was sent by God; because nothing less than a divine power was sufficient to perform such wonderful works. But he who supposes that those works were never performed, must affirm that the books recording them were forged, either at the era in which the miracles are said to have been wrought, or at some subsequent era: There is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a>.\n\nThat they could not be forged at the era in which they affirm the miracles to have been wrought, a very few reflections will make incontrovertibly evident. These books inform the people for whose use they were written, that their author, after having inflicted various plagues upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a> and his subjects, brought them, to the number of 600,000, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hand; that they were led by a pillar of cloud through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and by a pillar of fire through the night; to the brink of the Red sea, where they were almost overtaken by the Egyptians, who had pursued them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a> and horses; that, to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> for their escape, Moses stretched out his rod over the sea, which was immediately divided, and permitted them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through on dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, between two walls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and that the Egyptians, pursuing and going in after them to the midst of the sea, were all drowned by the return of the waters to their usual state, as soon as the Hebrews arrived at the further shore. Is it possible now that Moses or any other man could have persuaded 600,000 persons, however barbarous and illiterate we suppose them, that they had been witnesses of all these wonderful works, if no such works had been performed? Could any art or eloquence persuade all the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, that they had yesterday walked on dry ground through the Frith to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGHORN\">Kinghorn</a>, the waters being divided and forming a wall on their right hand and on their left? If this question must be answered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, it is absolutely impossible that the books of Moses, supposing them to have been forged, could have been received by the people who were alive when those wonders are said to have been wrought.\n\nLet us now inquire, whether, if they be forgeries, in any after they could have been received as authentic at any subsequent period; and we shall soon find this supposition as impossible as the former. The books claiming Moses for their author speak of themselves as delivered by him, and from his days kept in the ark of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENANT\">covenant</a>; an *Deut.xxxi.*ark which, upon this supposition, had no existence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> 24\u201427. to the forgery. They speak of themselves likewise, not only as a history of miracles wrought by their author, but as the statutes or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNICIPAL\">municipal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the nation, of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> was to be always in the possession of the priests, and another in that of the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>. Deut. Now, in whatever age we suppose these books to have xviii.19. been forged, they could not possibly be received as authentic; because no copy of them could then be found either with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, with the priests, or in the ark, though, as they contain the statute law of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, it is not conceivable that, if they had existed, they could have been kept secret. Could any man, at this day, forge a book of statutes for England or Scotland, and make it pass among the nations for the only book of statutes which they had ever known? Was there ever since the world began a book of such statutes, and these, too, multifarious and burdensome, imposed upon any people as the only statutes by which they and their fathers had been governed for ages? Such a forgery is evidently impossible.\n\nBut the books of Moses have internal proofs of authenticity, which no other books of ancient statutes ever had. They not only contain the laws, but also give an historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their enactment, and the reasons upon which they were founded. Thus they tell us, that Gen.xvii. the rite of circumcision was instituted as a mark of the covenant between God and the founder of the Jewish nation, and that the practice of it was enforced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of the Almighty, that every uncircumcised man-child should be cut off from his people. They inform us that the annual solemnity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a> was instituted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMEMORATION\">commemoration</a> of their deliverance when God slew, in one night, all the first-born of the Egyptians; that the first-born of Israel, both of men and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>, were on the same occasion dedicated for ever to God, who took the Levites instead of the first-born of\nReligion.\n\nthe men; that this tribe was consecrated as priests, by whole hands alone the sacrifices of the people were to be offered; that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of a different tribe to approach the altar, or even to touch the ark of the covenant; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>'s budding rod was kept in the ark in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the wonderful destruction of Korah, Dathan, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABIRAM\">Abiram</a>, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a> against the priesthood.\n\nIs it possible now, if all these things had not been practised among the Hebrews from the era of Moses, with a retrospect to the signal mercies which they are said to commemorate, that any man or body of men could have persuaded a whole nation, by means of forged books, that they had always religiously observed such institutions? Could it have been possible, at any period <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to the Exodus, to persuade the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a> that they and their fathers had all been circumcised on the eighth day from their birth, if they had been conscious themselves that they had never been circumcised at all? or that the pasover was kept in memory of their deliverance from Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONDAGE\">bondage</a>, if no such festival was known among them?\n\nBut let us suppose that circumcision had been practised, and all their other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> and ceremonies observed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> immemorial, without their knowing any reason of such institutions: still it must be confessed, that the forger of these books, if they were forged, constructed his narrative in such a manner as that no man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> sense could receive it as authentic. He says it was death to touch the ark! As such an assertion was never heard of before, and as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITUAL\">ritual</a> he was endeavouring to make them esteem sacred was oppressively multifarious; surely some daring spirit would have ventured to put his veracity to the test by moving the ark and even offering sacrifices; and such a test would at once have exposed the imposture. The budding rod, too, and the pot of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a>, which, though long preserved, were never before heard of, must have produced inquiries that could not fail to end in detection. These books speak likewise of weekly sabbaths, daily sacrifices, a yearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIATION\">expiation</a>, and monthly festivals, all to be kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> things, particularly specified as done for the nation at an early period of its existence. If this was not the case, could the forger of the books have persuaded the people that it really was so? The enlightened reasoners of this nation would be offended were we to compare them with the ancient Israelites; but, surely they will not say that we are partial to that people, if we bring them to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the most savage tribes of the Russian empire, who profess Christianity? Now, were a book to be forged containing an account of many strange things done a thousand years ago in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a> by an Apollonius, or any other philosopher or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>, numbers of the barbarians inhabiting that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> would, we doubt not, give implicit credit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGEND\">legend</a>: But were the author, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of his narrative, to affirm, that all the Siberians had from that day to this kept sacred the first day of the week in memory of his hero; that they had all been baptized or circumcised in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>; that in their public judicatories they had sworn by his name, and upon that very book which they had never seen before; and that the very same book was their law and their gospel, by which for a thousand years back the actions of the whole people had been regulated\u2014surely the grossest savage among them would reject with contempt and indignation a forgery so palpable.\n\nIf this reasoning be conclusive, the books of Moses must indubitably be authentic, and he himself must have been inspired by the Spirit of God. But this point being established, the question respecting the origin of the primitive religion is completely answered. The writer of the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a> informs us, that Adam and Noah received many revelations from the Author of their being, and that their religion was founded on the principles of the purest theism. How it degenerated among the greater part of their descendants into the grossest idolatry, has been thrown at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. See Polytheism.\n\nII. Having thus answered the first question proposed of the influence of religion on society, we now proceed to consider the second, and to inquire whether and how far religious sentiments have a tendency to injure or to promote the welfare of society? This is a subject of the utmost importance; and if we prove successful in our inquiries, we shall be enabled to determine whether the governors of mankind ought carefully to support religious establishments, or whether the philosopher who calls himself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> of the world, and professes to feel the most eager desire to promote the interests of his species, acts consistently when he labours to exterminate religion from among men.\n\nA celebrated French financier *, a man of abilities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, who has published a book on the importance of religious opinions, labours to show that religious establishments are indispensably necessary for the maintenance of civil order, and demonstrates how weak the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> institutions is on the morals of mankind; but he refuses to review the history of past ages in order to discover how far religious opinions have actually been injurious or beneficial to the welfare of society; choosing rather to content himself with the result of a series of metaphysical disquisitions.\n\nWe admire the spirit which induced a man who had spent a considerable part of his life amid the hurry of public business, to become the strenuous advocate of religion; but we cannot help thinking that, notwithstanding the eloquence, the acuteness, and the knowledge of mankind which he has displayed, his refusing to admit the evidence of facts, concerning the influence of religion on society, may possibly be regarded by its enemies as a tacit acknowledgment that the evidence of facts would be unfavourable to the cause which he wishes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a>. The fallacy of general reasonings, and the utility of metaphysics for the purposes of life, are so universally acknowledged, that they have long been the theme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>. Though the abuses of religion, as well as the abuses of reason, the perversion of any of the principles of the human mind, and the misapplied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the gifts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, may have often counteracted the produced effects hurtful to the virtue and the happiness of mankind; yet, after tracing religion to a divine origin, we cannot, for a moment, allow ourselves to think that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> tendency of religion must be hostile to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of society, or that it is necessary to view it abstractly in order that we may not behold it in an odious light. Often has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCEPTIC\">sceptic</a> attacked religion with artful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALICE\">malice</a>; but perhaps none of his attacks has been so skilfully directed as that which has first ridiculed the absurdity of the most absurd superstitions, and\nReligion, and afterwards laboured to prove that the most absurd system of polytheism is more favourable to the interests of society than the purest and most sublime theism. Instances in which the abuse of religion had tended to deprave the human heart, and had led to the most shocking crimes, have been affluently collected, and displayed in all the aggravating colours in which eloquence could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> them, till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> even the friends of true religion have been abashed; and it has become a fashionable opinion, that nothing but self-interest or bigotry can prompt men to represent religion as the friend of civil order. But let us try if, by a candid consideration of what effects have resulted to society from religious principles, in general, without comparing them with regard to truth or falsehood, we can advance anything to vindicate the character of religion.\n\nNotions of Deity in general, of various orders of divinities, of their moral character, of their influence on human life, of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> state, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a> of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, constitute the leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of religion. Let us view these together with the rites to which they have given rise; and we may perhaps be enabled to form some well-grounded notions on this important point.\n\n1. Having proved that the first religious principles entertained by men were derived from revelation, it is impossible to suppose that they could produce effects injurious to society. If religion of any kind has ever lessened the virtue or disturbed the peace of men, it must have been that religion which springs from a belief in a multitude of superior powers actuated by passions, and of whom some were conceived as benevolent and others as malicious beings. That such sentiments should have produced vices unknown in societies where pure theism is professed, will be readily admitted. Even the few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATHEISTS\">atheists</a> who live in Christian or Mahometan countries are restrained by the laws, by a desire to promote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the fact, and by many other considerations, from indulging in practices which the example of the false gods of antiquity sanctioned in their votaries. But in determining the present question, we must not compare the virtues of the pagan world with those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> atheists in modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, but with those of nations professing atheism; and such nations are nowhere to be found. We can however easily conceive, that in a society unawed by any notions of God or a future state, no such laws would be enacted as those which restrain the sensual appetites; of which the criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> was one of the greatest stigmas on the pagan worship of antiquity. In such societies, therefore, those vices would be practised constantly to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGANISM\">paganism</a> gave only an occasional sanction; and many others, in spite of the utmost vigilance of human laws, would be perpetrated in secret, which the most profligate pagans viewed with horror. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">Conscience</a>, though acting with all her energy, would not be able to command any regard to the laws of morality: No virtue would be known; social order would be nowhere observed; the midnight affair would everywhere be found; and in the general scramble mankind would be exterminated from the face of the earth.\n\nThe worst species of paganism, even that which prevails among savages who worship evil spirits, affords greater security than this. It is indeed shocking to think that demons should be worshipped, while deities, who are regarded as being all benevolence, are treated with contempt: And it has been asked, If the influence of such religious sentiments on the moral practice of the more idolaters must not naturally be, to cause them to treat ingratefully their friends and benefactors with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, and to humble themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> submission before a powerful enemy?\n\nThey do not appear to have produced such effects on the morality of the savages by whom they were entertained. The benevolent deities were neglected, only because their benevolence was necessary. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> favour merits a grateful return: a designed injury provokes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>. But when you become, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of any man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, the world will scarce consider him as owing you any obligation: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which bruises your foot excites only a momentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> of resentment. Those gods who could not avoid doing good to men might not receive a profusion of thanks for their services; and yet a favour conferred by a human benefactor commands the warmest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>. But those rude tribes appear to have had so much wisdom as to confer a less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> malice on their malevolent deities, than the benevolence which they attributed to their more amiable order of superior beings: though the latter could not possibly do them anything but good, and that constantly; yet the former were not under an equally indispensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of persevering in depressing them under calamities. On their malevolent deities they conferred a freedom of agency which they denied to the benevolent. No wonder, then, that they were more affluous in paying their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> to the one than to the other. They might with as much propriety have thought of being grateful to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAR\">boar</a> or stag whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> supported them, as to deities who were always benevolent, because they could not possibly be otherwise. Though negligent of such deities, this can scarce be thought to have had any tendency to render them ungrateful to benefactors like themselves. And yet, it must not be doubted, that the American Indians, among whom such religious sentiments have been found to prevail, are said to be very little sensible to the emotions of gratitude. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> receives a present without thinking of making any grateful acknowledgments to the bestower. He pleases his fancy or gratifies his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> with what you have given, without seeming to consider himself as under the smallest obligation to you for the gift.\n\nIt may be doubted, however, whether this spirit of ingratitude originates from, or is only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> with, that indifference which refuses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> and worship to the benevolent divinities. If the former be actually the case, we must acknowledge that those religious notions which we now consider, though preferable to general atheism, are in this respect unfriendly to virtue. But if the Indians may be thought to owe the ingratitude for which they are distinguished to the opinion which they entertain of the existence of a benevolent order of deities, whose benevolence is necessary and involuntary, their ideas of the nature of their malevolent demons do not appear to have produced equal effects on their moral sentiments. However submissive to those dreaded beings, they are far from showing the same tame and cowardly submission to their human enemies: towards them\nthem they seem rather to adopt the sentiments of their demons. Inveterate rancour and brutal fury, inhuman cruelty and inconceivable cunning, are displayed in the hostilities of tribes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and we know not, after all, if even these sentiments do not owe somewhat of their force to the influence of religion.\n\nYet let us remember that these same Indians have not been always represented in so unamiable a light; or, at least, other qualities have been ascribed to them which seem to be inconsistent with those barbarous dispositions. They have been described as peculiarly susceptible of conjugal and parental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>; and he who is so cannot be destitute of virtue.\n\n2. But leaving the religion of savages, of which very little is known with certainty, let us proceed to examine what is the natural influence of that mixed system of theology which represents to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of men a number of superior and inferior divinities, actuated by the same passions and feelings with themselves, and often making use of their superior power and knowledge for no other purpose but to enable them to violate the laws of moral order with impunity. This is the celebrated polytheism of the Greeks and Romans, and most other nations of antiquity (see POLYTHEISM). Could its influence be favourable to virtue?\n\nAt a first view every person will readily declare, that such a system must have been friendly to profligacy. If you commit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, and the inspection of human society, to a set of beings who are often disposed to regard vice with a less favourable eye than virtue, and who, though there be an established order by which virtue is discriminated from vice, and right from wrong, yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> not to violate that order in their own conduct; you cannot expect them to require in you a degree of rectitude of which they themselves appear incapable. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> will not discourage the thievish arts of the trader; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> cannot frown upon debauchery; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> will behold with savage delight all the cruelties of war. The Thracians indeed, one of the most barbarous nations of antiquity, whose ferocity was little if at all inferior to that of the Indians who have been distinguished as cannibals, was the favourite nation of Mars; among whom stood his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, to which he repaired when about to mount his chariot, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> himself for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. Even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, who had been guilty of so many acts of tyrannical caprice, had been engaged in such a multitude of amorous intrigues, and seemed to owe his elevated station as monarch of the sky, not to superior goodness or wisdom, but merely to a superior degree of brutal force, could not be feared as the avenger of crimes, or revered as the impartial rewarder of virtues.\n\nThat this system had a pernicious effect on morals, and that, as compared with pure theism, it was injurious to society, cannot be denied; but yet, when contrasted with atheism, it was not without its favourable effects. It was so connected with the order of society, that, without its support, that order could scarce have been maintained. The young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a> might perhaps justify himself by the example of Jupiter, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, or some other amorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>; the frail virgin or matron might complain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPID\">Cupid</a>, or boast of imitating Venus; and the thief might practise his craft under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of Mercury. But if we take the whole system together, if we consider with what views those deities were publicly worshipped, what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> were raised, what rites instituted, what sacrifices offered, and what feriae consecrated; we shall perhaps find it necessary to acknowledge that the general effects even of that mixed and incoherent system of polytheism which prevailed among the Greeks and Romans were favourable to society. To state a particular instance, the ancilia of Mars and the fire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESTA\">Vesta</a> were thought to secure the perpetuity of the Roman empire. As long as the sacred ancilia, which had been dropped from heaven for that benevolent purpose, was safely preserved in those holy archives in which it had been deposited; and as long as the sacred fire of Vesta was kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, without being once extinguished, or at least suffered to remain for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> in that state; so long was Rome to subsist and flourish. And, however, simple and absurd the idea which connected the prosperity of a nation with the preservation of a piece of wood in a certain place, or with the constant blazing of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> upon an hearth; yet no fact can be more certain, than that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and enthusiastic valour of the Romans, which we so much extol and admire, were, in many instances, owing in no inconsiderable degree to the veneration which they entertained for the ancilia and the vestal fire.\n\nA numerous series of facts occur in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman history</a>, which show the happy effects of their religious views and opinions and ceremonies on their sentiments concerning social order and the public welfare. How powerful was the influence of the sacramentum administered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> when they enlisted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of their country? The promises made, the idea of the powers invoked, and the rites performed on that occasion, produced so deep and so awful an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on their minds, that no danger, nor distress, nor discontent, could prompt them to violate their engagements. The responses of the oracles, too, though the dictates of deceit and imposture, were often of singular service to those to whom they were uttered; when they inspired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, as he marched out to battle, with the confidence of success, they communicated to him new vigour, and more heroic valour, by which he was actually enabled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>, or at least to deserve, the success which they promised. Again, when in times of public distresses, the augur and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> directed some games to be celebrated, certain sacrifices to be offered, or some other solemnities to be performed, in order to appease the wrath of the offended deities; it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the means were not at all suited to accomplish the end proposed by them; yet still they were highly beneficial. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the whole people was turned entirely to those solemnities by which the wrath of heaven was to be averted, they were roused from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPRESSION\">depression</a> under which the sense of the public distress or danger might have otherwise caused them to sink: the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> was at the same time more closely cemented, and the hearts of the people knit together; and when persuaded, that by propitiating the gods they had removed the cause of their distress, they acquired such calmness and strength of mind as enabled them to take more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> and proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> for the safety of the state.\n\nCould we view the ancient Greeks and Romans acting in public or in private life under the influence of that system of superstition which prevailed among them;\nReligion could we perceive how much it contributed to the maintenance of civil order; could we behold Numa and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a> establishing their laws, which would otherwise have met with a very different reception under the sanction of divinities; could we observe all the beneficial effects which arose to communities from the celebration of religious ceremonies, we should no longer hesitate to acknowledge, that those principles in the human heart by which we are susceptible of religious sentiments, are so eminently calculated to promote the happiness of mankind, that even when perverted and abused, their influence is still favourable.\n\nThe ideas which prevailed among the nations of the heathen world concerning a future state of retribution were, it must be confessed, not very correct. Some of the poets, we believe, have represented them in no unfair light: both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> have conducted their heroes through the realms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTO\">Pluto</a>, and have taken occasion to unfold to us the secrets of those dreary abodes. The scenes are wild and fanciful; the rewards of the just and virtuous are of no very refined or dignified nature: and of the punishments inflicted on the guilty, it is often hard to say for what ends they could be inflicted; whether to correct and improve, or for the gratification of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> or whim: they are often so whimsical and unsuitable, that they cannot with any degree of propriety be ascribed to any cause but blind chance or wanton caprice. A great dog with three tongues, a peevish old boatman with a leaky ferry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, demanding his freight in a fury <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a>, and an uxorious monarch, are objects too familiar and ludicrous not to degrade the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of those awful scenes which are represented as the mansions of the dead, and to prevent them from making a deep enough impression on the imagination. The actions and qualities too, for which departed spirits were admitted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELYSIUM\">Elysium</a>, or doomed to the regions of suffering, were not always of such a nature as under a well-regulated government on earth would have been thought to merit reward, or to be worthy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. It was not always virtue or wisdom which conducted to the Elysian fields, or gained admission into the society of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a> gods.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GANYMEDE\">Ganymede</a> was for a very different reason promoted to be the cup bearer of Jove; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> and Bacchus could not fairly plead that any merits of that kind entitled them to seats in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, and at the banquets of the immortals. That doctrine, likewise, which represented mortals as hurried by fate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of crimes, which they could no more abstain from committing than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> can avoid to obey the impulse of a powerful and furious arm plunging it into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of an unresisting antagonist, could not but produce effects unfavourable to virtue; and it afforded a ready excuse for the most extravagant crimes.\n\nYet, after all, he who attentively considers the ideas of the Greeks and Romans concerning the moral government of the world and a future state of rewards and punishments, will probably acknowledge, that their general influence must have been favourable to virtue and moral order. Allow them to have been incorrect and dashing with absurdity; still they represent punishments prepared for such qualities and actions as were injurious to the welfare of society; whilst, for those qualities which rendered men eminently useful in the world, they hold forth a reward. Though incorrect, their ideas concerning a future state were exceedingly distinct; they were not vague or general, but such as might be readily conceived by the imagination, in all their circumstances, as really existing. When a man is told that for such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> he will be put to death, he may flounder and be alarmed, and think of the deed as what he must by no means commit; but place before him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> for his execution, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> him to behold some other criminal mounting the scaffold, addressing his last words in a wild scream of despair to the surrounding spectators, and then launching into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a>\u2014his horror of the crime, and his dread of the punishment, will now be much more powerfully excited. In the same manner, to encourage the soldier marching out to battle, or the mariner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> sail under the prospect of a storm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> not, merely in general terms, a liberal reward; be sure to specify the nature of the reward which you mean to bestow; describe it so that it may take hold on the imagination, and may rise in opposition to the images of death and danger with which his courage is to be assailed.\n\nIf these phenomena of the human mind are fairly stated, if it be true that general ideas produce no very powerful effects on the sentiments and dispositions of the human heart, it must then be granted, that though the scenes of future reward and punishment, which the heathens considered as prepared for the righteous and the wicked, were of a somewhat motley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>; yet still, as they were distinct and even minute draughts, they must have been favourable to virtue, and contributed in no inconsiderable degree to the support of civil order.\n\nAnother thing of which we may take notice under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, is the vast multiplicity of deities with which the Greek and Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MYTHOLOGY\">mythology</a> peopled all the regions of nature. Flocks and fields, and woods, and oaks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and many much more minute objects, had all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> deities. These were somewhat capricious at times, it is true, and expected to have attended with attention paid them. But yet the faithful shepherd, and the industrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>, knew generally how to acquire their friendship; and in the idea of deities enjoying the same simple pleasures, partaking in the same labours, protecting their possessions, and bringing forward the fruits of the year, there could not but be something of a very pleasing nature, highly favourable to industry, which would animate the labours, and cheer the festivals, of the good people who entertained such a notion; nay, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> over all the scenes of the country, even in the gayest months of the year.\n\nFrom all these particular observations, we think ourselves warranted to conclude, that notwithstanding the mixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the deities who were adored by the celebrated nations of antiquity; though they are in many instances represented as conspicuous for vices and frolics; however vain, absurd, and morally criminal, some of the rites by which they were worshipped may have been, and however incorrect the notions of the heathens concerning the moral government of the universe and a future state of retribution; yet still, after making a just allowance for all these imperfections, the general influence of their religious system was rather favourable than unfavourable to virtue and to the order and happiness of society.\nIt was not without good reason that the earliest legislators generally endeavoured to establish their laws and constitutions on the basis of religion; government needs the support of opinion; the governed must be impressed with a belief that the particular establishment to which they are required to submit, is the best calculated for their security and happiness, or is supported on some such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> foundation, that it must prove impossible for them to overturn it, or is connected with some awful sanction, which it would be the most heinous impiety to oppose. Of these several notions, the last will ever operate on most men with the most steady influence. We are frequently blind to our own interest; even when eager for the attainment of happiness, we often refuse to take the wisest measures for that end. The great bulk of the people in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> are so little capable of reasoning and foresight, that the public minister who shall most steadily direct his views to the public good will often be the most unpopular. Those laws, and that system of government, which are the most beneficial, will often excite the strongest popular discontents. Again, it is not always easy to persuade people that your power is superior to theirs, when it is not really so. No one man will ever be able to persuade a thousand that he is stronger than they all together; and therefore, in order to persuade one part of his subjects or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> that it is absolutely necessary for them to submit to him, because any attempts to resist his power would prove ineffectual, a monarch or general must take care first to persuade another part that it is for their interest to submit to him; or to impress the whole with a belief that, weak and pitiful as he himself may appear, when viewed singly in opposition to them all, yet by the assistance of some awful invisible beings, his friends and protectors, he is so powerful, that any attempts to resist his authority must prove presumptuous folly. Here, then, the aid of religion becomes requisite. Religious sentiments are the most happily calculated to serve this purpose. Scarce ever was there a society formed, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of government established, or a code of laws framed and enacted, without having the religious sentiments of mankind, their notions of the existence of superior invisible beings, and their hopes and fears from those beings, as its fundamental principle. Now, we believe, it is almost universally agreed, that even the rudest form of society is more favourable to the happiness of mankind, and the dignity of the human character, than a solitary and savage state. And if this, with what we have asserted concerning religion as the basis of civil government, be both granted, it will follow, that even the most imperfect religious notions, the most foolish and absurd rites, and the wildest ideas that have been entertained concerning the moral government of the universe by superior beings, and a future state of retribution, have been more advantageous than atheism to the happiness and virtue of human life. We have already granted, nor can it be denied, indeed, that many of the religious opinions which prevailed among the ancient heathens, did contribute, in some degree, to the depravation of their morals; and all that we argue for is, that on a comparative view of the evil and the good which resulted from them, the latter must appear more than adequate to counterbalance the effects of the former.\n\nBut if such be the natural tendency of those principles by which the human heart is made susceptible of religious sentiments, that even enthusiasm and absurd superstition are productive of beneficial effects more than sufficient to counterbalance whatever is malignant in it; pure, their influence on society\u2014surely a pure rational religious, the doctrines of which are founded in undeniable truth, and all the observances which it enjoins calculated to promote by their direct and immediate effects some useful purposes, must be in a very high degree conducive to the dignity and the happiness of human nature. Indeed one collateral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the truth of any religion, which must have very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> with all who are not of opinion that the system of the universe has been produced and hitherto maintained in order and existence by blind chance, will be its having a stronger and more direct tendency than others to promote the interests of moral virtue and the happiness of mankind in the present life. Even the testimony of thousands, even miracles, prophecies, and the sanction of remote antiquity, will scarce have sufficient weight to persuade us, that a religion is of divine origin, if its general tendency appear to be rather unfavourable than advantageous to moral virtue.\n\nIII. We shall therefore, in the next place, endeavour to determine, from a comparative view of the effects produced on the character and circumstances of society by the most eminent of these various systems of different religion which have been in different ages or in different countries established in the world, how far any system of one of them has in this respect the advantage over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>; and, if the utility of a system of religion were to be received as a test of its truth, what particular system might, with the best reason, be received as true, while the rest were rejected.\n\nIst. The principle upon which we here set out is, that all, or almost all, systems of religion with which we are acquainted, whether true or false, contribute more or less to the welfare of society. But as one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> is more fruitful, and one garden less overgrown with weeds than another; so, in the same manner, one system of religious opinions and ceremonies may be more happily calculated than others to promote the truest interests of mankind. In opposition to those philosophers who are so vehement in their declamations against the inequality of ranks, we have ever been of opinion that refinement and civilization contribute to the happiness of human life. The character of the solitary savage is, we are told, more dignified and respectable than that of the philosopher and the hero, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as he is more independent. He is indeed more independent; but his independence is that of a stone, which receives no nourishment from the earth or air, and communicates none to animals or vegetables around it. In point of happiness, and in point of respectability, we cannot hesitate a moment, let philosophers say what they will, to prefer a virtuous, enlightened, and polished Briton, to any of the rudest savages, the least acquainted with the restraints and the sympathies of social life, that wander through the wild forests of the western world. But if we prefer civilization to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a>, we must admit, that in view of this Christianity has the advantage over every other religious system which has in any age or country prevailed.\nprevailed among men; for nowhere has civilization and useful science been carried to such a height as among Christians.\n\nIt is not, indeed, in any considerable degree that the absurd superstitions of those rude tribes, who can scarce be said to be formed into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> society, can contribute to their happiness. Among them the faculty of reason is but in a very low state; and the moral principle usually follows the improvement or the depression of the reasoning faculty. Their appetites and merely animal passions are almost their only principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>: their first religious notions, if we suppose them not to be derived from revelation or tradition, are produced by the operation of gratitude, or grief, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a>, or fear, upon their imaginations. And to these, however wild and fanciful, it is not improbable that they may owe some of their earliest moral notions. The idea of superior powers naturally leads to the thought that those powers have some influence on human life. From this they will most probably proceed to fancy one set of actions agreeable, another offensive, to those beings to whom they believe themselves subject. And this, perhaps, is the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> that savages can be supposed to form between actions, as right or wrong, to be performed or to be avoided. But if this be the case, we must acknowledge, that the religious notions of the savage, however absurd, contribute to elevate his character, and to improve his happiness, when they call forth the moral principle implanted in his breast.\n\nBut if the social state be preferable to a state of wild and solitary independence, even the rude superstitions of unenlightened tribes of savages are in another respect beneficial to those among whom they prevail. They usually form, as has been already observed under this article, the basis of civil order. Religious opinions may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> the great body of the community to reverence some particular set of institutions, some individual, or some family, which are represented to them as peculiarly connected with the gods whom they adore. Under this sanction some form of government is established; they are taught to perform social duties, and rendered capable of social enjoyments. Not only Numa and Lycurgus, but almost every legislator who has sought to civilize a rude people, and reduce them under the restraints of legal government, have endeavoured to impress their people with an idea that they acted with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>, and under the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of superior powers. We cannot but allow that the rude superstitions of early ages are productive of these advantages to society; but we have already acknowledged, and it cannot be denied, that they are also attended with many unhappy effects. When we view the absurdities intermixed with the systems of religion which prevailed among most of the nations of antiquity, we cannot help lamenting that so noble a principle of human nature as our religious sentiments should be liable to such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> perversion; and when we view the effects which they produce on the morals of mankind, and the forms of society, though we allow them to have been upon the whole rather beneficial than hurtful, yet we cannot but observe, that their unfavorable effects are by far more numerous than if they had been better directed. What unhappy effects, for instance, have been produced by false notions concerning the condition of human souls in a future state. Various nations have imagined that the scenes and objects of the world of spirits are only a shadowy representation of the things of the present world. Not only the souls of men, according to them, inhabit those regions; all the inferior animals and vegetables, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> bodies that are killed or destroyed here, are supposed to pass into that visionary world; and, existing there in unsubstantial forms, to execute the same functions, or serve the same purposes, as on earth. Such are the ideas of futurity that were entertained by the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>. And by these ideas they were induced, when a king or great man died among them, to provide for his comfortable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> in the world of spirits, by burying with him meat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> for his subsistence, slaves to attend and serve him, and wives with whom he might still enjoy the pleasures of love. His faithful subjects vied with each other in offering, one a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, another a wife, a third a son or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, to be sent to the other world in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with the monarch, that they might there be employed in his service. In New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENIN\">Benin</a>, and among the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, similar practices on the same occasion, owing no doubt to similar notions of futurity, have been prevalent. But such practices as these cannot be viewed with greater contempt on account of the opinions which have given rise to them, than horror on account of their unhappy effects on the condition of those among whom they prevail. A lively impression of the enjoyments to be obtained in a future state, together with some very false or incorrect notions concerning the qualities or actions which were to entitle the departing soul to admission into the scene of those enjoyments, is said to have produced equally unhappy effects among the Japanese. They not only bribe their priests to solicit for them; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon the enjoyments of the present life with disgust or contempt, they used to dash themselves from precipices, or cut their throats, in order to get to paradise as soon as possible. Various other superstitions subsisting among rude nations might here be enumerated, as instances of the perversion of the religious principles of the human heart, which render them injurious to virtue and happiness. The austerities which have been practised, chiefly among rude nations, as means of propitiating superior powers, are especially worthy of notice.\u2014When the favourite idol of the Bantans is carried in solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, some devotees prostrate themselves on the ground, that the chariot in which the idol is carried may run over them; others, with equal enthusiasm, dash themselves on spikes fastened on purpose to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-CAR\">car</a>. Innumerable are the ways of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORTURE\">torture</a> which have been invented and practised on themselves by men ignorantly striving to recommend themselves to the favour of heaven. These we lament as instances in which religious sentiments have been so ill directed by the influence of imagination, and unenlightened erring reason, as to produce unfavourable effects on the human character, and oppose the happiness of social life.\u2014Though we have argued, that even the most absurd systems of religion that have prevailed in the world, have been upon the whole rather beneficial than injurious to the dignity and happiness of human nature; yet if it shall not appear, as we proceed farther in our comparative\nReligion. tive view of the effects of religion on society, that others have been attended with happier effects than those superstitions which belong to the rude ages of society, we may scarce venture to brand the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> with the appellation of fool, for refusing to give his assent to religious doctrines, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> under their influence.\n\n2d. The polytheism of the Greeks and Romans, and other heathen nations in a similar state of civilization, we have already considered as being, upon the whole, rather favourable than unfavourable to virtue; but we must not partially conceal its defects. The vicious characters of the deities which they worshipped, the incorrect notions which they entertained concerning the moral government of the universe and a future retribution, the absurdity of their rites and ceremonies, and the criminal practices which were intermixed with them, must have altogether had a tendency to pervert both the reasoning and the moral principles of the human mind. The debaucheries of the monarch of the gods, and the fidelity with which his example in that respect was followed by the whole crowd of the inferior deities, did, we know, dispose the devout heathen, when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the same passions which had affected their power over the gods, to gratify them without scruple. It is a truth, however, and we will not attempt to deny or conceal it, that the genius of the polytheism of the Greeks and Romans was friendly to the arts; to such of them especially as are raised to excellence by the vigorous exertion of a fine imagination; music, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, all of these arts appear to have been considerably indebted for that perfection to which they attained, especially among the Greeks, to the splendid and fanciful system of mythology which was received among that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> people.\n\nBut we cannot give an equally favourable account of its influence on the sciences. There was little in that system that could contribute to call forth reason. We may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> indeed, that if reason can be so flooded with absurdity as to be roused to a more vigorous exertion of her powers, and a more determined attention of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of surveying it; in that case, this system of mythology might be favourable to the exercise and improvement of reason; not otherwise.\n\nThe connection of paganism with morality was too imperfect for it to produce any very important effects on the morals of its votaries. Sacrifices and prayers, and temples and festivals, not purity of heart and integrity of life, were the means prescribed for propitiating the favour of the deities adored by the Pagans. There were other means, too, besides true heroism and patriotism, of gaining admission into the Elysian fields, or obtaining a seat in the council of the gods. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a>, in one of the most beautiful parts of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, represents Hercules wooed by Virtue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">Pleasure</a> in two fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> forms, and deliberating with much anxiety which of the two he should prefer. But this is the fiction of a philosopher desirous to improve the fables of antiquity in such a way as to render them truly useful. Hercules does not appear, from the tales which are told us of his adventures, to have been at any such pains in choosing his way of life. He was received into the palace of love, without having occasion to plead that he had through life been the faithful follower of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> to whom the philosopher makes him give the preference; his being the son of Jove, and his wild adventures, were sufficient without any other religious merits to gain him that honour. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> may be said concerning many of the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMI\">demi</a>-gods and heroes who were advanced to heaven, or conveyed to the blissful fields of Elysium. And whatever might be the good effects of the religion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome in general upon the civil and political establishments, and in some few instances on the manners of the people, yet still it must be acknowledged to have been but ill calculated to impress the heart with such principles as might in all circumstances direct to a firm, uniform tenor of virtuous conduct.\n\nBut after what has been said on the character of this religion elsewhere (see Polytheism), and in the second part of this article, we cannot without repetition enlarge farther on it here. Of the Jewish religion, however, we have as yet said little, having on purpose referred to this place whatever we mean to introduce under the article, concerning its influence on society.\n\n3d. When we take a general view of the circumstances in which the Jewish religion was established, the judicious effects which it produced on the character and fortune of the nation, the rites and ceremonies which it enjoined, and the singular political institutions to which it gave a sanction, it may perhaps appear hard to determine, whether it were upon the whole more or less beneficial to society than the polytheism of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. But if such be the judgment which preconceived prejudices, or a hasty and careless view, have induced some to form of this celebrated system; there are others who, with equal keenness, and founder reasoning, maintain, that it was happily calculated, not only to accomplish the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of preparing the way for the promulgation of the Gospel, but likewise to render the Jews a more refined and virtuous people, and a better regulated community, than any neighbouring nation. In the first place, the attributes of the Deity were very clearly exhibited to the Jews in the establishment of their religion. The miracles by which he delivered them from servitude, and conducted them out of Egypt, were striking demonstrations of his power; that condescension with which he forgave their repeated acts of perverseness and rebellion, was a most convincing proof of his benevolence; and the impartiality with which the observance and the violation of his laws were rewarded and punished, even in the present life, might well convince them of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. A part of the laws which he dictated to Moses are of eternal and universal obligation; others of them were local and particular, suited to the character of the Jews, and their circumstances in the land of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>. The Jewish code, taken altogether, is not to be considered as a complete system of religion, or laws calculated for all countries and all ages of society. When we consider the expediency of this system, we must take care not to overlook the design for which the Jews are said to have been separated from other nations, the circumstances in which they had lived in Egypt, the customs and manners which they had contracted by their intercourse with the natives of that country, the manner in which they were to acquire to themselves settlements by extirpating the nations of Canaan, the rank which they were to hold among the nations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> and the adjacent countries, together with the difficulty of\nReligion, of restraining a people so little civilized and enlightened from the idolatrous worship which prevailed among their neighbours: All these circumstances were certainly to be taken into account; and had the legislator of the Jews not attended to them, his institutions must have remained in force only for a short period; nor could they have produced any lasting effects on the character of the nation. With a due attention to these circumstances, let us descend to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of particulars.\n\nAlthough in every religion or superstition that has prevailed through the world, we find one part of its institutions to consist in the enjoining of certain festivals to be celebrated by relaxation from labour, and the performance of certain ceremonies in honour of the gods; yet in none, or almost none besides the Jewish, do we find every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> day ordained to be regularly kept holy. One great end which the legislator of the Jews had in view in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of the Sabbath was, to impress them with a belief that God was the maker of the universe. In the early ages of the world a great part of mankind imagined the stars, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, to be eternal, and consequently objects highly worthy of adoration. To convince the Israelites of the absurdity of this belief, and prevent them from adopting that idolatry, Moses taught them, that those conspicuous objects which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENTILE\">Gentile</a> nations regarded as eternal, and endowed with divine power and intelligence, were created by the hand of God; who, after bringing all things out of nothing, and giving them form, order, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>, in the space of six days, rested on the seventh from all his works. Various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in the Old Testament concur to show, that this was one great end of the institution of the Sabbath. The observance of the Sabbath, and detestation of idolatrous worship, are frequently inculcated together; and, again, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of the Sabbath, and the worship of idols, are usually reprobated at the same time. Another good reason for the institution of a Sabbath might be, to remind the Jews of their deliverance from bondage, to inspire them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> to strangers and domestics, and to mitigate the rigours of servitude.\n\nThe purposes for which the other festivals of the Jewish religion were instituted appear also of sufficient importance. The great miracle, which, after a series of other miracles, all directed to the same end, finally effected the deliverance of the Jews out of Egypt, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> departure from that land of servitude, might well be commemorated in the feast of the passover. To recall to the minds of posterity the history of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, to impress them with an awful and grateful sense of the goodness and greatness of God, and to make them think of the purposes for which his almighty power had been so signally exerted, were surely good reasons for the institution of such a festival. The feast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENTECOST\">Pentecost</a> celebrated the first declaration of the law by Moses, in the space of fifty days after the feast of the passover. It served also as a day of solemn thanksgiving for the blessings of a plentiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>. On the feast of tabernacles, they remembered the wanderings of their ancestors through the wilderness, and expressed their gratitude to heaven for the more comfortable circumstances in which they found themselves placed. The feast of new moons served to fix their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, and determine the times at which the other festivals were to be celebrated; on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a> were sounded, to give public notice of the event which was the cause of the festival; no servile works were performed, divine service was carefully attended, and the first fruits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> were offered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>. The Jewish legislator limited his festivals to a very small number, while the heathens devoted a considerable part of the year to the celebration of theirs. But we perceive the occasions upon which the Jewish festivals were celebrated to have been of suitable importance; whereas those of the heathens were often celebrated on trifling or ridiculous occasions. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">Piety</a> and innocent recreation shared the Jewish festival; the festivals of the heathens were chiefly devoted to debauchery and idleness.\n\nThe Hebrews had other solemn seasons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> before the weekly Sabbath and the annual festivals. Every seventh year they rested from labour: they were then neither to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, to sow, nor to prune; and whatever the earth produced spontaneously that year belonged rather to strangers, orphans, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, than to the proprietors of the ground. On this year <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSOLVENT\">insolvent</a> debtors were discharged from all debts contracted by purchasing the necessaries of life: and the great end of this release from debts contracted during the preceding five years, appears to have been to prevent the Hebrew from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> to the Gentiles and forsaking his religion when embarrassed in his circumstances. None but native Israelites and proselytes of righteousness were admitted to this privilege; it was refused to strangers, and even to proselytes of the gate. The jubilee was a festival to be celebrated every fiftieth year. It produced the same effect with the sabbatical year as to rest from labour and the discharge of debts; with this addition, that on the year of the jubilee slaves obtained their freedom, and the lands reverted to the old proprietors. On the year of the jubilee, as on the sabbatical year, the lands were to rest uncultivated, and lawsuits were now to terminate. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> design of this institution appears to have been, to preserve the order of ranks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> originally established in the Hebrew state. None but Israelites or circumcised converts could enjoy the benefit of this institution; nor could even these hope to regain their estates on the year of the jubilee, if they sold them for any other purpose but to supply their necessities. The law relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURY\">usury</a> was evidently founded on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of policy with respect to property. To almost any other nation such a law, it must be confessed, would have been unfavourable and unjust; but as the Jews were not designed for a trading nation, they could have little occasion to borrow, unless to relieve distress; and as an indulgence to people in such circumstances, the Jew was forbidden to exact usury from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to whom he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>.\n\nThe Jewish legislator, we may well think, would be disposed to adopt every proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> to prevent his own nation from falling away into the idolatry of heathen nations. Probably one reason of the distinctions between clean beasts which they were permitted to eat, and unclean beasts, the eating of which they were taught to consider as pollution, was to prevent them from convivial intercourse with profane nations, by which they might be seduced to idolatry. We do not readily fit down at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> with people who are fond of dishes which\nReligion. we regard with abhorrence. And if the Jews were taught to loathe the flesh of some of those animals which were among the greatest delicacies of the Gentiles, they would naturally of consequence avoid fitting down at meat with them, either at their ordinary meals or at those entertainments which they prepared in honour of their deities; and this we may with good reason consider as one happy mean to preserve them from idolatry. Besides, the Jews were permitted, or rather enjoined, to eat animals which the Gentiles reverenced as sacred, and from which they religiously withheld all violence. Goats, sheep, and oxen, were worshipped in Egypt (see Polytheism and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>) ; and several learned writers are of opinion, that Moses directed his people to sacrifice and eat certain of the favourite animals of the Egyptians, in order to remove from their minds any opinions which they might have otherwise entertained of the sanctity of those pretended deities. Many of the observances which Moses enjoined with regard to food, appear to have been intended to inspire the Israelites with contempt for the superstitions of the people among whom they had so long sojourned. They were to kill the animal which the Egyptians worshipped; to roast the flesh which that people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATE\">ate</a> raw; to eat the head, which they never ate; and to dress the entrails, which they set apart for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">divination</a>. These distinctions concurred with the peculiarities of their dress, language, government, customs, places and times of worship, and even the natural situation of their country, by which they were in a manner confined and fortified on all sides, to separate them in such a manner from neighbouring nations, that they might escape the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> of their idolatry. And if we reflect both on the design for which Providence separated the Israelites from other nations, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that, in the state of society in which mankind were during the earlier period of the Jewish history, the Jews, by mixing with other nations, would rather have been themselves converted to idolatry than have converted idolatrous nations to the worship of the true God; we cannot but be satisfied, that even this, however it may at first appear, was a benefit, not a disadvantage; and in the author of their legislation wisdom, not caprice.\n\nBut not only in the distinctions of meats, and between clean and unclean animals, does the legislator of the Jews appear to have laboured to fix a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> between them and other nations which might preserve them from the contagion of idolatry\u2014we shall not err, perhaps, if we ascribe many particulars of their worship to this design in the institutor. The heathens had gods who presided over woods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and valleys, and to each of these they offered sacrifices, and performed other rites of worship in a suitable place. Sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a>, sometimes the mountain top, at other times the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the river or the brink of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, was the scene of their devotions. But as the unity of the divine nature was the truth the most carefully inculcated on the children of Israel; so in order to impress that truth on their minds with the more powerful efficacy, they were taught to offer their sacrifices and other offerings only in one place, the place chosen by the Lord; and death was threatened to those who dared to disobey the command. To confirm this idea, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPHETS\">prophets</a> intimates, that when idolatry should be abolished, the worship of God should not be confined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, but it would then be lawful to worship him anywhere.\n\nThe whole institutions and observances of the Jewish religion appear to have been designed and happily calculated to impress the minds of the people with veneration and respect for the Deity. All the festivals which either commemorated some gracious dispensation of his providence towards their ancestors, or served as days of thanksgiving for the constant returns of his goodness to those who celebrated them, and all the other rites designed to fortify them against idolatry, served at the same time to impress their hearts with awful reverence for the God of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>. Various other particulars in the institutions of the Jewish economy appear to have been directed solely to that end. Into the most sacred place, the Holy of Holies, none but the high priest was admitted, and he only once a-year. No fire was used in sacrifice but what was taken from the altar. Severe punishments were on various occasions inflicted on such as presumed to meddle in the service of the sanctuary in a manner contrary to what the law had directed. All the laws respecting the character, the circumstances, and the services, of the priests and the Levites, appear plainly to have a similar tendency.\n\nIn compliance with the notions of Deity which naturally prevailed among a gross and rude people, though no visible object of worship was granted to the Jews, yet they were allowed in their wanderings through the wilderness to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a> or portable temple, in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> of the universe sometimes deigned to display some rays of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. Incapable as they were of conceiving aright concerning the spiritual nature and the omnipresence of the Deity, they might possibly have thought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEHOVAH\">Jehovah</a> careless and indifferent about them, had they been at no time favoured with a visible demonstration of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>.\n\nThe sacrifices in use among the Gentiles in their worship of idols were permitted by the Jewish legislature; but he directed them to be offered with views very different from those with which the Gentiles sacrificed to their idols. Some of the sacrifices of the Jewish ritual were designed to avert the indignation of the Deity; some to expiate offences and purify the heart; and all of them to abolish or remove idolatry. Lustrations or ablutions entered likewise into the Jewish ritual; but these were recommended and enjoined by Moses for purposes widely different from those which induced the heathens to place so high a value upon them. The heathens practised them with magical and superstitious ceremonies; but in the Jewish ritual they were intended simply for the cleansing away of impurities and pollutions.\n\nThe theocratical form of government to which the Jews were subjected, the rewards which they were sure of receiving, and the punishments which they were equally liable to suffer in the present life, had a powerful effect on their minds, and preserved them from idolatry, as well as to support all the social virtues among them. They were promised a numerous offspring, a land flowing with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, long life, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> over their enemies, on the condition of their paying a faithful obedience to the will of their heavenly Sovereign; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, famine, disease, defeats, and death, were threatened as the punishments to be inflicted on those who violated\nviolated his laws; and these sanctions, it must be allowed, were happily accommodated to the genius of a rude and carnal-minded people, attentive only to present objects, and not likely to be influenced by remote and spiritual considerations.\n\nThere were other rites and prohibitions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSAIC_LAW\">Mosaic law</a>, which appear to have had but little connection with religion, morals, or policy. These may be more liable to be objected against, as adding an unnecessary weight to a burden which, though heavy, might yet have been otherwise borne in consideration of the advantages connected with it. Even these, however, may perhaps admit of being viewed in a light in which they shall appear to have been in no way unfavourable to the happiness of those to whom they were enjoined. They appear to have had none of them an immoral tendency: all of them had, in all probability, a tendency to remove or prevent idolatry, or to support, in some way or other, the religious and the civil establishment to which they belonged.\n\nFrom these views of the spirit and tendency of the Jewish religion, we may fairly conclude it to have been happily calculated to promote the welfare of society. In comparing it with other religions, it is necessary to reflect on the peculiar purposes for which it was given; that its two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> objects were to preserve the Jews a separate people, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> them against the contagion of the surrounding idolatry. When these things are taken into consideration, every candid mind acquainted with the history of ancient nations will readily acknowledge that the whole system, though calculated indeed in a peculiar manner for them, was as happily adapted for the purposes for which it had been wisely and graciously intended, as it is possible to imagine any such system to be. It would be unhappy, indeed, if, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of pure theism with polytheism, the latter, with all its absurdities, should be found more beneficial to mankind than the former. The theism of the Jews was not formed to be disseminated through the earth; that would have been inconsistent with the purposes for which it is said to have been designed. But while the Jews were separated by their religion from all other nations, and perhaps, in some degree, fixed and rendered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> in their progress towards refinement, they were placed in circumstances, in respect to laws, and government, and religion, and moral light, which might with good reason render them the envy of every other nation in the ancient world.\n\nIV. The Christian religion next demands our attention. It is to be considered as an improvement of the Jewish, or a new superstructure raised on the same basis. If the effects of the Jewish religion were beneficial to those among whom it was established, they were confined almost to them alone. But is the spirit of Christianity equally pure and benevolent? Is its influence equally beneficial and more diffusive than that of Judaism? Does it really merit to have triumphed over both the theism of the Jews and the polytheism of the heathens?\n\nIf we consider the doctrines and precepts of the Christian religion, nothing can be more happily calculated to raise the dignity of human nature, and promote the happiness of mankind. The happiness of the individual is best promoted by the exercise of love and gratitude towards God, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a> to his providence; of humanity, integrity, and good will towards men; and by the due government of our appetites and passions. Social happiness again proceeds from the members of society entertaining a disinterested regard for the public welfare; being actively industrious each in his proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of exertion; and being strictly just and faithful, and generously benevolent in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> intercourse. The tenor of the gospel inculcates these virtues; it seems everywhere through the whole of the Christian code to have been the great design of its Author to inspire mankind with mild, benevolent, and peaceable dispositions, and to form them to courteous manners. Christianity again represents the Deity and his attributes in the fairest light; even so as to render our ideas of his nature, and the manner in which he exerts his power, consistent with the most correct principles of morality that can be collected from all the other religions that have prevailed in the earth, and from the writings of the most admired philosophers. The ritual observances which Christianity enjoins are few in number, easy to perform, decent, expressive, and edifying. It inculcates no duties but what are founded on the principles of human nature, and on the relation in which men stand to God, their Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier; and it prescribes accurate rules for the regulation of the conduct. The assistance of the spirit of God is promised in this sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> to those who assiduously labour to discharge the duties which it enjoins; and it exhibits a striking example of spotless purity, which we may safely venture to imitate. The gospel teaches that worldly afflictions are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENT\">incident</a> to both good and bad men; a doctrine highly conducive to virtue, which consoles us in distress, prevents despair, and encourages us to persist firmly in our integrity under every difficulty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. Christianity represents all men as children of the same God, and heirs of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>, and levels all distinctions of rich and poor, as accidental and insignificant in the sight of him who rewards or punishes with impartiality according to the merits or demerits of his creatures. This doctrine is highly favourable to virtue, as it tends to humble the proud, and to communicate dignity of sentiment to the lowly; to render princes and inferior magistrates moderate and just, gentle and condescending, to their inferiors. It farther requires husbands to be affectionate and indulgent to their wives, wives to be faithful and respectful to their husbands, and both to be true and constant to each other. Such is the purity of the gospel, that it forbids us even to harbour impure thoughts; it requires us to abandon our vices, however dear to us; and to the cautious wisdom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a> it directs us to join the innocent simplicity of the dove. The Christian dispensation, to prevent a perseverance in immorality, offers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> for the past, provided the offender forsake his vicious practices, with a firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to act differently in future. The sanctions of the gospel have a natural tendency to exalt the mind above the paltry pursuits of this world, and to render the Christian incorruptible by wealth, honours, or pleasures. The true Christian not only abjures from injustice towards others, but even forgives those injuries which he himself suffers, knowing that he cannot otherwise hope for forgiveness from God. Such are the precepts, such the spirit, and such the general tendency of the gospel. Even those who refused to give credit to its doctrines and history have yet acknowledged the excellence\nReligion, excellence of its precepts. They have acknowledged, that \"no religion ever yet appeared in the world of which the natural tendency was so much directed to promote the peace and happiness of mankind as the Christian; and that the gospel of Christ is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> lesson of the strictest morality, of justice, benevolence, and universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>.\" These are the words of Bolingbroke, one of its keenest and most inflexible opponents. Without examining the effects of this religion on society, we might almost venture to pronounce with confidence, that a religion, the precepts of which are so happily formed to promote all that is just and excellent, cannot but be in the highest degree beneficial to mankind. By reviewing the effects which it has actually produced, the favourable opinion which we naturally conceive of it, after considering its precepts, cannot but be confirmed.\n\nOne circumstance we must take notice of as rather unfavourable to this review. It is really impossible to do justice to Christianity by such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of its merits. The virtues which it has a natural tendency to produce and cherish in the human heart, are not of a noisy ostentatious kind; they often escape the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of the world. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">Temperance</a>, gentleness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, benevolence, justice, and general purity of manners, are not the qualities which most readily attract the admiration and obtain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> of men. The man of Roos, whom Mr. Pope has so justly celebrated, was a private character; his name is now likely to live, and his virtues to be known to the latest posterity: and yet, however disinterested his virtues, however beneficial his influence to all around him, had his character not attracted the notice of that eminent poet, his name would perhaps ere this time have been lost in oblivion. Individuals in private life seldom engage the attention of the historian; his object is to record the actions of princes, warriors, and statesmen. Had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSORS\">professors</a> of Christianity in the earlier ages of its existence been exposed to persecutions, and unjust accusations from which they were called on to vindicate themselves, we should be strangers to the names and virtues of saints and martyrs, and to the learning and endowments of the first apologists for Christianity. We can therefore only trace the general influence of the institutions of Christianity on society. We cannot hope to make an accurate enumeration of particulars. In many of the countries in which it has been established, it has produced a very favourable change on the circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> life. Polygamy, a practice repugnant to the will of our Creator (see POLYGAMY), who has declared his intentions in this instance in the plainest manner, by causing nearly equal numbers of males and females to be brought into the world, was never completely abolished but by Christianity.\n\nThe practice of divorce, too, though in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> proper and even necessary, had been so much abused at the time of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>'s appearance in the world, that he found reason to declare it unlawful, unless in the case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>. The propriety and reasonableness of this prohibition will sufficiently appear, if we consider, that when divorces are easily obtained, both parties will often have nothing else in view at the period of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of their nuptial engagements after a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHABITATION\">cohabitation</a>; the interests of the husband and the wife will almost always be separate; and the children of such a marriage are scarce likely to enjoy the cordial affection and tender watchful care of either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>. The husband in such a case will naturally be to his wife, not a friend and protector, but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; fear and deceit, not love, gratitude, or a sense of duty, will be the principles of the wife's obedience.\n\nIn another instance, likewise, Christianity has produced an happy change on the circumstances of domestic life; it must be acknowledged to have contributed greatly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, or at least to the mitigation of the rigour of servitude. The customs and laws of the Romans in relation to slaves were cruel and severe. Masters were often so inhuman as to remove aged, sick, or infirm slaves, into an island in the Tiber, where they suffered them to perish without pity or affiance. The greater part of the subjects of many of those republics which enjoyed the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, groaned under tyrannical oppression; they were condemned to drag out a miserable existence in hard labour, under inhuman usage, and to be transferred like beasts from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> to another. The hardships of slavery were eased, not by any particular precept of the Gospel, but by the gentle and humane spirit which breathed through the general tenor of the whole system of doctrines and precepts of which the Gospel consists. It must indeed be allowed, that a trade in slaves is at present carried on by people who presume to call themselves Christians, and protected by the legislature of Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>; but the spirit of the Christian code condemns the practice, and the true Christian will not engage in it.\n\nPartly by the direct and conspicuous, partly by the secret and unseen, influence of Christianity since its promulgation in the world, the hearts of men have been gradually softened; even barbarians have been formed to mildness and humanity; the influence of selfishness has been checked and restrained; and even war, amid all the pernicious improvements by which men have fought to render it more terrible, has assumed much more of the spirit of mildness and peace than ever entered into it during the reign of heathenism.\n\nIf we review the history of mankind with a view to their political circumstances, we shall find, that by some means or other, it has happened, since the time when the Gospel was first preached, that both systems of legislature and forms of government have been raised to much greater perfection, at least in those parts of the world to which the religion of Jesus has made its way, and obtained an establishment.\n\nThe popular government of the Romans, notwithstanding the multiplicity of their laws, and the imperfections of their political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, was, no doubt, happily enough adapted to promote the increase of the power and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the empire of Rome. In Greece there were various republics, the wisdom and impartiality of whose laws have been highly celebrated. But we apprehend that there is a sufficient number of well authenticated facts to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> us to affirm, that since Christianity has been propagated, and has had sufficient time to produce its full effect on arts, manners, and literature, even under governments the form of which might appear less favourable than the celebrated models of antiquity to the liberty and happiness of the people in general, these actually have been much better provided for than under the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>, or even of Rome in the days of the consuls. It is a just\njust and happy observation of Montesquieu, who has attributed so much to the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> and local circumstances, that \"the mildness to frequently recommended in the Gospel is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the despotic rage with which an arbitrary tyrant punishes his subjects, and exercises himself in cruelty.\" It is the Christian religion (says he) which, in spite of the extent of empire, and the influence of climate, has hindered despotism from being established in Ethiopia, and has carried into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> the manners of Europe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> to the empire of Ethiopia enjoys a principality, and gives to other subjects an example of love and obedience.\u2014Not far from hence may be seen the Mahometan hunting up the children of the king of Sennaar, at whose death the council tends to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> them in favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> who ascends the throne. Let us set before our eyes (continues that eloquent writer), in the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the 24th book of his spirit of Laws, on one hand the continual massacres of the kings and generals of the Greeks and Romans, and on the other the destruction of people and cities by the famous conquerors Timur Beg and Jenghiz Khan, who ravaged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>; and we shall perceive, that we owe to Christianity in government a certain political law, and in war a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\">law of nations</a>, which allows to the conquered the great advantages of liberty, laws, wealth, and always religion, when the conqueror is not blind to his own interest.\"\n\nThese are the reflections of no common judge in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, but one who had long studied the history of nations, and observed the phenomena of the various forms of society, with such success as few others have attained.\n\nBut on no occasion has the mild influence of Christianity been more eminently displayed, or more happily exerted, than in softening and humanizing the barbarians who overturned the Roman empire. The idolatrous religion which prevailed among those tribes before their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSION\">conversion</a> to Christianity, instead of disposing them to cultivate humanity and mildness of manners, contributed strongly to render them fierce and blood-thirsty, and eager to distinguish themselves by deeds of savage valour. But no sooner had they settled in the dominions of Rome, and embraced the principles of Christianity, than they became a mild and generous people.\n\nWe are informed by Mosheim, who was at pains to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> his materials from the most authentic sources, that in the 10th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> Christian princes exerted themselves in the conversion of nations whose fierceness they had experienced, in order to soften and render them more gentle. The mutual humanity with which nations at war treat each other in modern times, is certainly owing, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, to the influence of the mild precepts of the Gospel. It is a fact worthy of notice, too, that during the barbarous ages, the spiritual courts of justice were more rational and impartial in their decisions than civil tribunals.\n\nHow many criminal practices which prevailed among heathen nations have been abolished by their conversion to Christianity! Christians of all nations have been observed to retain the virtues and reject the vicious practices of their respective countries. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTHIA\">Parthia</a>, where polygamy prevailed, they are not polygamists; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, the Christian father does not marry his own daughter.\n\nBy the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOROASTER\">Zoroaster</a> the Persians committed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INCEST\">incest</a> until they embraced the Gospel; after which period they abstained from that crime, and observed the duties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHASTITY\">chastity</a> and temperance, as enjoined by its precepts. Even the polished and enlightened Romans were cruel and blood-thirsty before the propagation of the Gospel. The breaking of a glass, or some such trifling offence, was sufficient to provoke Vidius Pollio to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> his flames into fish ponds to be devoured by lampreys. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of human blood was their favourite entertainment; they delighted to see men combating with beasts, or with one another; and we are informed on respectable authority, that no wars ever made such havoc on mankind as the fights of gladiators, which sometimes deprived Europe of 20,000 lives in one month. Not the humanity of Titus, nor the wisdom and virtue of Trajan, could abolish the barbarous spectacle. However humane and wise in other instances, in this practice these princes complied with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of their country, and exhibited splendid shows of gladiators, in which the combatants were matched by pairs; who, though they had never injured nor offended each other, yet were obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAIM\">maim</a> and murder one another in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> blood. Christian divines soon exercised their pens against these horrid practices; the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Constantine restrained them by edicts, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HONORIUS\">Honorius</a> finally abolished them. It would be tedious to proceed through an enumeration of particulars; but wherever Christianity has been propagated, it has constantly operated to the civilization of the manners of mankind, and to the abolition of absurd and criminal practices. The Irish, the Scotch, and all the ancient inhabitants of the British isles, were notwithstanding their intercourse with the Romans, rude barbarians, till such time as they were converted to Christianity. The inhuman practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> infants, which once prevailed so generally over the world, and still prevails among some Pagan nations, even under very humane and enlightened legislatures, yielded to the influence of Christianity.\n\nLet us likewise remember, in honour of Christianity, Learning that it has contributed eminently to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of so much knowledge, the preservation and the advancement of learning. When the barbarians overpread Europe, what must have become of the precious remains of polished, enlightened antiquity, had there been no other depositaries to preserve them but the heathen priests? We allow that even the Roman clergy during the dark ages did not study the celebrated models of ancient times with much advantage themselves, and did not labour with much assiduity to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a> acquainted with them. It must even be acknowledged, that they did not always preserve those monuments of genius with sufficient care, as they were often ignorant of their real value. Yet, after all, it will be granted, it cannot be denied, that had it not been for the clergy of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> of learning would, in all probability, have been entirely extinguished, during that night of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and barbarity in which all Europe was buried for a long series of centuries, after the irruption of the barbarians into the Roman empire.\n\nSuch is the excellence of the Christian system, and Christianity's tendency to meliorate the human character, that its beneficial influence has not been confined to those who have received its doctrines and precepts, and have who have professed themselves Christians; it has even produced not only many\nmany happy effects on the circumstances and the characters of Pagans and infidels, who have had opportunities of beholding the virtues of Christians, and learning the excellence of the morality of the gospel. Those virtues which distinguished the character of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> Julian were purely owing in no inconsiderable degree to his acquaintance with Christianity; and it is an undeniable fact, that after the propagation of Christianity through the Roman empire, even while the purity of that holy religion was gradually debased, the manners of those Pagans who remained unconverted became more pure, and their religious doctrines and worship less immoral and absurd.\u2014We might here adduce a tedious series of facts to the same purpose. Whenever Christians have had any intercourse with Pagan idolaters, and have not concealed the laws of the gospel, nor shewn by their conduct that they disregarde them, even those who have not been converted to Christianity have, however, been improved in their dispositions and manners by its influence. The emperor, whose virtues we have mentioned as arising, in a certain degree, from his acquaintance with Christianity, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to an Heathen pontiff, desires him to turn his eyes to the means by which the superstition of Christians was propagated; by kindness to strangers, by sanctity of life, and by the attention which they paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> of the dead. He recommends an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of their virtues, exhorts him to cause the priests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a> to be attentive to the worship of their gods, and authorizes him to strip them of the sacerdotal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>, unless they obliged their wives, children, and servants, to pay attention to the same duties. He likewise enjoins works of beneficence, desires the priest to relieve the distressed, and to build houses for the accommodation of strangers of whatever religion; and says it is a disgrace for Pagans to disregarde those of their own religion, while Christians do kind offices to strangers and enemies. This is indeed an eminent instance of the happy influence of Christianity even on the sentiments and manners of those who regarded the Christian name with abhorrence.\n\nUpon the whole, then, may we not, from the particulars here exhibited concerning the influence of this religion on the manners and happiness of men in society, conclude that Christianity is infinitely superior to the superstitions of Paganism? as being in its tendency uniformly favourable to the virtue and the happiness of mankind, and even to the system of religion and laws delivered by Moses to the children of Israel; because, while the religion of the Jews was calculated only for one particular nation, and it may almost be said for one particular stage in the progress of society, Christianity is an universal religion, formed to exert its happy influence in all ages and among all nations; and has a tendency to dispel the shades of barbarism and ignorance, to promote the cultivation of the powers of the human understanding, and to encourage every virtuous refinement of manners.\n\nV. Another religion, which has made and still makes a conspicuous figure in the world, remains yet to be examined. The religion of Mahomet is that which we here alluded to. Whether we consider through what an extensive part of the globe that religion prevails, the political importance of the nations among whom it is professed, or the striking peculiarity of character by which it is distinguished from all other religious systems\u2014it is for all these reasons well worthy of particular notice. Like the Jewish religion, it is not merely a system of religious doctrines and general moral precepts; it forms both the civil legislature and the religious system of those nations among whom it is professed; and, like it too, it would appear to be calculated rather for one particular period in the progress of mankind from rudeness to refinement, than for all ages and all states of society.\n\nThe history of its origin is pretty well known, and we have had occasion to enlarge upon it under a former article (see Mahomet and Mahometanism). We are not here to trace the impostures of the prophet, or to consider the arts by which he so successfully accomplished his designs; but merely to consider the morality of his religion, and its influence on civil order and the happiness of society.\n\nIf we view the state of the nations among whom it is established, we cannot hesitate a moment to declare, friendly to ignorance, to despotism, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPURITY\">impurity</a>, putrid, and impure manners. The Turks, the Persians, and the Malays, are all Mahometans; and in reviewing their history and considering their present state, we might find a sufficient number of facts to justify the above assertion: and we must not neglect to observe, that, as those nations are not known to have ever been since their conversion to Mahometanism under a much happier government, or in a much more civilized state than at present, it cannot be, with any degree of fairness, argued, with respect to Mahometanism as with respect to Christianity, that it is only when its influence is opposed by other causes as to prevent it from producing its full effects, that it does not conduct those societies among which it is established to a high state of civilization and refinement.\n\nOne, and that by no means an inconsiderable, part of the Koran, was occasionally invented to solve some difficulty with which the prophet found himself at the time perplexed, or to help him to the gratification of his ruling passions, lust and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a>. When he and his followers were, at any time, unsuccessful in those wars by which he sought to propagate his religion, to prevent them from falling away into unbelief, or sinking into despondency, he took care to inform them that God suffered such misfortunes to befal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>, as a punishment for their sins, and to try their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. The doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREDESTINATION\">predestination</a>, which he assiduously inculcated, had a happy effect to persuade his followers to rush boldly into the midst of death and danger at his command. He prevailed with Zeyd to put away his wife, married her himself, and pretended that his crime had the approbation of heaven; and, in the Koran, he introduces the Deity approving of this marriage. Being repulsed from the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>, he made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with the inhabitants; but on the very next year, finding it convenient to surprize the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, by violating this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>, he justified his perfidy by teaching his followers to disregarde promises or leagues made with infidels. In some instances again, we find absurd prohibitions enjoined for similar reasons: his officers, having on some occasion drunk to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a>, excited much riot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, he prohibited the use of wine and other intoxicating liquors among his followers in future. Now, though it must be acknowledged that many evils arise from the use of these liquors, yet we cannot but think that,\nReligion; that, when used in moderation, they are in many cases beneficial to men; and certainly as much allowed by God as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPIUM\">opium</a>, which the Mahometans have substituted in their place.\n\nMahomet is allowed to have copied from the Christian and the Jewish religions, as well as from the idolatrous superstitions which prevailed through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, and thus to have formed a motley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of reason and absurdity, of pure theft and wild superstition. He considered also the circumstances of his country, and the prejudices of his countrymen. When he attended to the former, he was generally judicious enough to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> his doctrines and decisions to them with sufficient skill; the latter he also managed with the greatest art; but he entered into accommodation with them in instances when a true prophet or a wise and upright legislator would surely have opposed them with decisive vigour. Where the prophet indulges his own fancy, or borrows from the superstitions of his countrymen, nothing can be more ridiculous than that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHAPSODY\">rhapsody</a> of lies, contradictions, and extravagant fables, which he delivers to his followers. Amazing are the absurdities which he relates concerning the patriarchs, concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, and concerning the animals that were assembled in Noah's ark.\n\nBut in the whole tissue of absurdities of which his system consists, there is nothing more absurd, or more happily calculated to promote impiety of manners, than his descriptions of heaven and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>; the ideas of future rewards and punishments which he sought to impress on the minds of his followers. Paradise was to abound with rivers, trees, fruits, and shady groves; wine which would not intoxicate was to be there plentifully served up to believers; the inhabitants of that happy region were all to enjoy perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>; and their powers of enjoyment were to be enlarged and invigorated, in order that so many fine things might not be thrown away upon them. \"Instead of inspiring the blest inhabitants of paradise with a liberal taste for harmony and science, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> and friendship (says Mr Gibbon), Mahomet idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds, the robes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, palaces of marble, dyes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, rich wines, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of sensual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>.\u2014Seventy-two hours, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>-eyed girls of resplendent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, will be created for the use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will be prolonged for 1000 years, and his faculties will be increased 100 fold, to render him worthy of his felicity.\" It must be acknowledged that he allows believers other more refined enjoyments than these; thus they are to see the face of God <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> and evening; a pleasure which is far to exceed all the other pleasures of paradise. The following is his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the punishments of hell: The wicked are there to drink nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> drinking water; breathe nothing but hot winds; dwell for ever in continual burning fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>; eat nothing but briars and thorns, and the fruit of a tree that riseth out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of hell, whose branches resemble the heads of devils, and whose fruits shall be in their bellies like burning pitch.\n\nAll that we can conclude from a general view of the religion of Mahomet, from considering the character of the prophet, or from reviewing the history of the nations among whom it has been established, is, that it is one tissue of absurdities, with a few truths, however, and valuable precepts incongruously intermixed; that a great part of it is unfavourable to virtuous manners, to wife and equal laws, and to the progress of knowledge and refinement. It often inculcates in a direct manner sentiments that are highly immoral; it substitutes trifling superstitious observances in the room of genuine piety and moral virtue; and it gives such views of futurity as render purity of heart no necessary qualification for seeing God.\n\nSurely, therefore, even the deist, who rejects all but Mahometan natural religion, would not hesitate to prefer Christianity to Judaism, and even Judaism, to the religion of Mahomet. Judaism, calculated for a peculiar people, was undoubtedly much more sublime and much more happily framed to render that people virtuous and happy in the circumstances in which they were placed; and Christianity we find to be an universal religion, suited to all circumstances and to all the stages of society, and acting, wherever it is received, with more or less force to the support of civil order, virtuous manners, improvement of arts, and the advancement of science. However, as Mahometanism forms in some measure a regular system, as it has borrowed many of the precepts and doctrines of Judaism and Christianity, not indeed without corrupting and degrading them; and as it has contributed considerably to the support of civil government, although in a very imperfect form, in those countries in which it has obtained an establishment; for all these reasons we cannot but give it the preference to the superstitions of Paganism.\n\nThe whole result of our inquiries under this article, Conclusion, therefore, is, 1. That as man, by the constitution of his mind, is naturally fitted for acquiring certain notions concerning the existence of invisible, superior beings, and their influence on human life; so the religious ideas which we find to have in all ages of the world, and in all the different stages of the progress of society, prevailed among mankind, appear to have originated partly from the natural exertions of the human imagination, understanding, and passions, in various circumstances, and partly from supernatural revelation.\n\n2. That though religious opinions, together with the moral precepts, and the rites of worship connected with them, may appear to have been in numerous instances injurious to the virtue and happiness of society; yet, as they have often contributed to lead the mind to form moral distinctions, when it would otherwise in all probability have been an entire stranger to such distinctions; and as they have always contributed in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> manner to the establishment and the support of civil government\u2014it must therefore be acknowledged that they have always, even in their humblest state, been more beneficial than hurtful to mankind.\n\n3. That when the different systems of religion that have prevailed in the world are comparatively viewed with respect to their influence on the welfare of society, we find reason to prefer the polytheism of the Greeks and Romans to the ruder, wilder, religious ideas and ceremonies that have prevailed among savages; Mahometanism, perhaps in some respects, to the polytheism of the Greeks and Romans; Judaism, however, to Mahometanism; and Christianity to all of them.","sp":344,"ep":361},{"h":"RELIGIOUS","t":"in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, something that relates to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>.\u2014We say, a religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>,\nReligious society, &c.\u2014Churches and churchyards are religious places.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> was born with a creative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, which never attained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. It was said of him, that he would have invented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had not found it already discovered. Without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, without the assistance of any master, but by his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, he formed rules, and a certain practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> for colouring; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> produced the desired effect. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> is not set off to the greatest advantage in his pictures; but there is such a striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and simplicity in them, that his heads, particularly his portraits, seem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a>, and rising from the canvas. He was fond of strong contrasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. The light entered in his working-room only by a hole, in the manner of a camera obscura, by which he judged with greater certainty of his productions. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> considered painting like the stage, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> do not strike unless they are exaggerated. He did not pursue the method of the Flemish painters of finishing his pieces. He sometimes gave his light such thick touches, that it seemed more like modelling than painting. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of his has been shown, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> of which was so thick of paint, as that which he copied from nature. He was told one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, that by his peculiar method of employing colours, his pieces appeared rugged and uneven\u2014he replied, he was a painter, and not a dyer. He took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in dressing his figures in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> manner: with this view he had collected a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of eastern caps, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMOUR\">armour</a>, and drapery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since out of fashion. When he was advised to consult antiquity to attain a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, as his was usually heavy and uneven, he took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">counsellor</a> to the closet where these old vestments were deposited, saying, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of derision, those were his antiques.\n\nRembrandt, like most men of genius, had many caprices. Being one day at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, painting a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, word being brought him that his monkey was dead, he was so affected at the loss of this animal, that, without paying any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the persons who were fitting for their pictures, he painted the monkey upon the same canvas. This whim could not fail of displeasing those for whom the piece was designed; but he would not efface it, choosing rather to lose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> of his picture.\n\nThis freak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear still more extraordinary in Rembrandt, when it is considered that he was extremely avaricious; which vice daily grew upon him. He practised various stratagems to sell his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> price. The public were very desirous of purchasing them, and not without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>. In his prints the same taste prevails as in his pictures; they are rough and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>, but picturesque. In order to heighten the value of his prints, and increase their price, he made his son sell them as if he had purloined them from his father; others he exposed at public sales, and went thither himself in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> to bid for them; sometimes he gave out that he was going to leave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. These stratagems were successful, and he got his own price for his prints. At other times he would print his plates half finished, and expose them to sale; afterwards finished them, and they became fresh plates. When they wanted retouching, he made some alterations in them, which promoted the sale of his prints a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, though they differed but little from the first impressions.\n\nHis pupils, who were not ignorant of his avarice, one day painted some pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>; and Rembrandt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them, than he was going to take them up. He was not angry at the pleasantry; but it had no effect in checking his avarice. He died in 1674.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">Remembrance</a>, is when the idea of something formerly known recurs again to the mind without the operation of a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> senses.

This is indeed farther evident from the LXX translators having substituted in their version the word \u1f08\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2, instead of Chiron, which we read in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> and English Bibles. But the question which still remains to be answered is, what god was worshipped by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Remphan, Raiphon, or Chiron? for about the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> here mentioned there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> dispute. See MOLOCH.\n\nThat Chiron or Remphan was an Egyptian divinity, cannot be questioned; for at the era of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXODUS\">Exodus</a> the Hebrews must have been strangers to the idolatrous worship of all other nations; nor are they ever accused of any other than Egyptian idolatries during their 40 years wanderings in the wilderness, till towards the end of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> that they became infected by the Moabites with the worship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAAL_PEOR\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAAL\">Baal</a>-peor. That Moloch, Molek, Molek, or Milcom, in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> acceptation, denotes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, is known to every oriental scholar; and therefore when it is used as the name of a god, it undoubtedly signifies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, and is the same divinity with the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSIRIS\">Osiris</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">Reasoning</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, many critics, and we believe Selden is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, have concluded that Chiron, and of course Remphan, is the planet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>; because Chiron is written Cium, Cevan, Chevan, Chevun; all of which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> oriental names of that planet.\n\nBut against this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> insurmountable objections present themselves to our minds. It is universally allowed (see POLYTHEISM), that the first objects of idolatrous worship were the sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, considered as the king and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. The fixed stars, indeed, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, were afterwards gradually admitted into the Pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUBRIC\">rubric</a>; but we may be sure that those would be first associated with the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> luminaries which most resembled them in brightness, and were supposed to be most benignant to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. But the planet Saturn appears to the naked eye with so feeble a lustre, that, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, it could not make such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the mind as to excite that admiration which we must conceive to have always preceded planetary worship. It is to be observed, too, that by the Pagan writers of antiquity Saturn is constantly represented as a star of baleful influence. He is termed the leaden planet; the planet of malevolent aspect; the dismal, the inhumane star. That the Egyptians, at so early a period as that under consideration, should have adored as one of their greatest gods a planet obscure in its appearance, distant in its situation, and baleful in its influence, is wholly incredible.\n\nThere is, however, another star which they might naturally adore, and which we know they actually did adore, as one of their most beneficent gods, at a very early period. This is the \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 or \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 of the Greeks, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANIS\">canis</a> or stella canicularis of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and the dog-star of modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. By the Egyptians it was called Sothis or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SETH\">Seth</a>, which signifies safety, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, fecundity; and it received this name, because making its appearance in the heavens at the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a> overflowed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, it was supposed\nRemphan, to regulate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a>. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a> (I. c. Qir.) tells us, they believed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of their illustrious benefactress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a> to have transmigrated into the star Sothis, which they therefore worshipped as the divinity which rendered their country fruitful. It made its appearance, too, on the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> Thoth (A), which was the beginning of the Egyptian year, and as such celebrated with festivity and festivity; and being by much the brightest star in the heavens, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORAPOLLO\">Horapollo</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 3.) informs us it was considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> over the reit. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of so many important circumstances might have induced a people less superstitious than the Egyptians to pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> homage to that glorious luminary, which was confounded with Isis, who had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> regarded with the highest veneration; and as Isis was the wife and sister of Osiris, and always associated with him, the star of Isis or Remphan was naturally associated with Moloch, the same with Osiris.\n\nBut it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be asked, how the star which by the Egyptians was called Soth or Sothis came to be worshipped by the Hebrews under the appellation of Chion or Remphan? This is a very pertinent question, and we shall endeavour to answer it.\n\nEvery one knows that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of oriental words is very uncertain; and that as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOWELS\">vowels</a> were often omitted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, it is of very little importance to the meaning how they be supplied, provided we retain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADICAL\">radical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSONANTS\">consonants</a>. The word Chion may with equal propriety be written Kion, Kion, or even Kyon, the Hebrew jod being convertible into the Greek \u03c5 or the Roman y; but the words <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">Cane</a>, Chan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KAN\">Kan</a>, or Khan, which are often diversified into Ken, Kyn, Cohen, Cahan, signifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a>, Chief, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a>, King, &c. are diffused through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and Europe. In the Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> Quan, which signifies a King, is so similar to the word Chion or Khian under consideration, that no etymologist will hesitate to pronounce them of the same original and the same import. The word Kan or Khan is universally known to be an honorary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>; and Kain or Kain, which is manifestly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COGNATE\">cognate</a> of the word Chion or Kion, is, in the Pilevi or old Persian language, the epithet applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNASTY\">dynasty</a> of princes which succeeded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> the Great. Among the Scythians or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, Chion signifies the Sun and likewise the day; and Kung, Kiuung, Kun, runs through all the dialects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> tongue, everywhere denoting a chief or sovereign. In the Syrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a>, Kon signifies a prince; and hence the Almighty is styled (Gen. xiv. 19.) Konah, which is translated pofefor, but might have, with perhaps more propriety, been rendered Sovereign of heaven and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. In Hebrew, the word Kahan or Kohen, which is the very same with Khan or Kan, signifies either a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> or a prince; and in Egypt Kon was the name of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a> or the sun. Hence the same word in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> denotes greatness, as Can-olur the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>; Can athoth, the great Thoth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>; Can-ofiris, the great Osiris.\n\nFrom this deduction we would conclude, that the word, which is found in so many tongues, and always denotes Chief, Prince, Sovereign, is the very word Chion which the Egyptians and Hebrews applied to Sothis, as being, in their conceptions, the chief or sovereign of all the stars. This will appear still more probable, when we have ascertained the import of the word Remphan, or, as the LXX have it, Raiphon.\n\nPhan, the latter part of this word, is unquestionably the same with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>, the most ancient of the Egyptian gods (see Pan). It is likewise a cognate of the Hebrew Phanah, confexit, spectavit, vidit; and the radical word seems to be phah, which signifies sometimes the countenance and sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. Hence Phaethon, which is compounded of pha, \"light,\" eth or e\u03b2, \"fire,\" and on, \"strength,\" came to be one of the names of the sun. Rai, which we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> write <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAJAH\">Rajah</a>, has long signified, among the Indians, a subordinate prince; and we know, that between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> and Egypt there was a very early intercourse. Raiphon, therefore, may be either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> light or the bright prince, subordinate to Osiris; and in either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, it was a very proper epithet of Sothis in the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>. The word Rem or Rom, again (for it is sometimes written Remphan, and sometimes Rompha), is no other than the Hebrew \u05e8\u05d5\u05de, Rum, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, exalted.\" Hence Remphan is the high or exalted light, which Sothis certainly was.\n\nFor this etymological <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISQUISITION\">disquisition</a> we are indebted to Dr. Doig, the learned author of Letters on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">Savage</a> State, who has written a dissertation on Chion and Remphan, of such value that we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> it will not be much longer withheld from the public. The ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of those names, and the god to which they belonged, is the least of its merit; for it will be found to throw much light upon many palettes in the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>. What confirms his interpretation is, that the idol consecrated by the Egyptians to Sothis or the dog-star, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> with a star on her head; and hence the prophet upbraids his countrymen with having borne the Star of their deity.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">Action</a> of REMOVING**, in Scots <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>.

It is rather <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> along the north-east and north part of it; and it has few hills which rise to any considerable height.

Although a considerable part of it might be constantly kept with advantage under arable crops, yet so extensive is the demand for the products of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAIRY\">dairy</a>, that a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is perpetually kept in grass. With respect to crops, potatoes generally constitute a part of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>. This is the usual arrangement: Oats from grass; potatoes or barley dugged; oats, with five pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> clover and 3 sloats of rye-grass; hay for two years; pasture.\n\nThe proprietors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in this county have shewn a laudable zeal for the making of excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, which are constantly kept in the best repair, and frequently are fixed at every toll-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to prevent carts from being overloaded; 15 cwt. being allowed in the vicinity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAISLEY\">Paisley</a> as the load for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a> with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>.\n\nThe mineral productions are not very extensive, but they are very abundant in the vicinity of Paisley. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> coal has been met with near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENOCK\">Greenock</a> or Port Glasgow; but what is called of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> is found in the parishes of Eaglesham and Kilbarchan, so very soft at first that it may be cut with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHISEL\">chisel</a>, but it becomes much harder by exposure to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. It is of various colours; breaks in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; readily absorbs water; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> recently heated in the fire, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> is accompanied with a hissing noise. There are two mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> in the same vicinity of Eaglesham; the one possessing a purgative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and the other is regarded as a remedy for what is called the moor-ill in black cattle.\n\nThe most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of minerals is in the vicinity of Paisley; the most singular being the coal at Quarreltown, upwards of 50 feet thick, consisting of five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> in contact with each other (a). The Hurlet coal, belonging to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Glasgow, about three miles south-east of Paisley, is five feet three inches thick, and supposed to have been wrought for more than two centuries. Inflammable air and fixed air are met with in this mine, but from the precautions adopted accidents are not so frequent as might otherwise be apprehended. The coal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of Hurlet have for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> afforded the materials for a copperas manufactory on a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>; and one\n\n(a) For a detailed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of coal, the reader is referred to the Appendix to Williams's Mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">Kingdom</a>, by Dr Millar, 2 vols. 8vo, 1809.\none of the most extensive manufactories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> has been established and successfully carried on by a spirited and enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, for several years past, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Coal is also found in the upper part of the county, as in the parish of Cathcart, and also not far from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RENFREW\">Renfrew</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a> is abundant in many parts of the county, as in the parish of Cathcart; and at Lord Glasgow's coal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> at Hurlet, it forms a very considerable strata covering the coal. But one of the most remarkable masses of limestone is found at the entrance to a romantic glen called Gleniffer, three miles to the south of Paisley. The limestone is in a mass of about 10 feet thick, dips to the centre, and is wrought by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a> mines under a thick mass of whitestone which covers it. Ironstone is also abundant along with the coal strata in some parts of the county.\n\nThe ruins of an old castle, called the Peel, to which the lairds of Semple retreated in times of imminent danger, are still to be seen in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Castle Semple loch; and the ruins of the castle of Newark, lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, are even at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> deserving of attention. They are lofty, and have filled an air of magnificence, and some parts of it were inhabited about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a> ago. It is situated on the eastern part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> and harbour of Port Glasgow and Newark. This castle is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of Lord Bellhaven, but when it was erected cannot be fully ascertained. Mearns Castle, another ruin, stands in the south-east part of the county near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>. Crookston Castle is situated about three miles to the south-east of Paisley. The strong position and commanding prospect of this magnificent ruin must have rendered it a favourite residence of the powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Lennox, to whom it originally belonged. Near the castle there is a yew tree, venerable from its antiquity, but still more so, according to the legendary lore of the country, as having afforded its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> to the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> and her equally unfortunate husband Darnley. If this be true, the said tree is not less than three centuries old.\n\nThere are four cups in the parish of Kilmaclom which were used by the celebrated reformer John Knox at the dispensation of the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>.

It elects a member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> along with Glasgow, Dunbarton, and Rutherglen.\n\nThe other towns are Paisley, Greenock, Port Glasgow; and some of smaller <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, as Kilbarchan, Lochwinnoch, Neilston, Gourock, and Auldkirk. Among these deserves also to be mentioned Johnston, which within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of little more than 20 years has become a large town, owing to the progress and prosperity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COTTON_MANUFACTURE\">cotton manufacture</a>.\n\nThe manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a> was introduced into Paisley about the year 1760, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of that of Spitalfields in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; experiencing at first many difficulties to which new inventions are very frequently exposed. Patterns and designs of fancy works were originally composed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>; but the manufacturers at Paisley established draughtsmen of their own, and the patterns thus executed were sent to London and Paris in order to be approved of. By means of industry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> properly encouraged, the most curious fabrics came to be devised; and the vast variety of elegant and highly ornamented gauze manufactured here is allowed to be superior to every thing of the kind which had formerly made its appearance. Even London itself was obliged to relinquish this manufacture; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> came to carry it on at Paisley; and warehouses were opened in London, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, and Paris for vending their commodities. We formerly said that Paisley must contain upwards of 25,000 inhabitants (see Paisley); but we have since seen a more recent computation, by which they are stated at upwards of 31,000.\n\nThe whole population of Renfrewshire amounted to 78,000 in 1801, of which Paisley alone contains much more than a third. In the year 1755 the population of this county was 26,645, so that in the course of half a century it has been nearly tripled.

A barbarity which they never learned from the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome; which directs, with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> as our own, quod praegnantis mulieris damnatio poene differatur, quoad parvum: which doctrine has also prevailed in England, as early as the first memorials of our laws <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> reach. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> be made in stay of execution, the judge must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> of twelve matrons or discreet women to inquire into the fact: and if they bring in their verdict quick with child (for bare-ly with child, unless it be alive in the womb, is not sufficient), execution shall be staid generally till the next session; and so from session to session, till either she is delivered, or proves by the course of nature not to have been with child at all. But if she once hath had the benefit of this reprieve, and been delivered, and afterwards becomes pregnant again, she shall not be intitled to the benefit of a farther respite for that cause. For the may now be executed before the child is quick in the womb; and shall not, by her own incontinence, evade the sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.\n\nAnother cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> reprieve is, if the offender become non compos between the judgement and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AWARD\">award</a> of execution: for regularly, though a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> be compos when he commits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> crime, yet if he becomes non compos after, he shall not be indicted; if after indictment, he shall not be convicted; if after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>, he shall not receive judgement; if after judgement, he shall not be ordered for execution: for faciatur solo fitore panitur; and the law knows not but he might have offered some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, if in his senses, to have stayed these respective proceedings. It is therefore an invariable rule, when any time intervenes between the attainder and the award of execution, to demand of the prisoner what he hath to allege why execution should not be awarded against him; and, if he appears to be insane, the judge in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> may and ought to reprieve him. Or, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> may plead in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of execution; which plea may be either pregnancy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s pardon, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, or diversity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, viz. that he is not the same that was attainted, and the like. In this case a jury shall be impanelled to try this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLATERAL\">collateral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, namely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of his person; and not whether guilty or innocent, for that has been decided before. And in these collateral issues the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> shall be infanter; and no time allowed the prisoner to make his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> or produce his witnesses, unless he will make oath that he is not the person attainted: neither shall any peremptory challenges of the jury be allowed the prisoner, though formerly such challenges were held to be allowable whenever a man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was in question. If neither pregnancy, insanity, non-identity, nor other plea, will avail to avoid the judgement, and stay the execution consequent thereupon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> and surest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> is in the king's most gracious pardon; the granting of which is the most amiable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of the crown. See the article PARDON.","sp":368,"ep":368},{"h":"REPRISALS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> which princes claim of taking from their enemies any thing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to what they unjustly detain from them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> their subjects. For as the delay of making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> may sometimes be detrimental to individuals who have suffered by depredations from foreign potentates, our laws have in some respects armed the subject with powers to impel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>; by directing the ministers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> letters of marque and reprisal upon due demand: the prerogative of granting which is nearly related to, and plainly derived from, that other of making war; this being indeed only an incomplete state of hostilities, and generally ending in a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENUNCIATION\">denunciation</a> of war. These letters are grantable by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of nations, whenever the subjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> letters of marque and\nReprifal, and reprifal (words used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a>; and signifying, the latter a taking in return, the former the pafting the frontiers in order to such taking) may be obtained, in order to feize the bodies or goods of the subjects of the offending state, until satisfaction be made, wherever they happen to be found. And indeed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of reprifals seems dictated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> herself; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> we find in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times very notable instances of it. But here the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> is obvious of calling in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a> power, to determine when reprifals may be made; else every private sufferer would be a judge in his own cause. In pursuance of which principle, it is with us declared by the stat. 4 Hen. V. c. 7. that, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any subjects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a> are opprefled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of truce by any foreigners, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> marque in due form, to all that feel themselves grieved. Which form is thus directed to be obferved: the sufferer must first apply to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> privy-feal; and he shall make out letters of request under the privy-feal; and if after fuch request of satisfaction made, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> required do not within convenient time make due satisfaction or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a> to the party grieved, the lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> shall make him out letters of marque under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> feal; and by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of these he may attack and feize the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the aggressor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> of being condemned as a robber or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRATE\">pirate</a>.\n\nReprifal, or Reception, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of remedy allowed to an injured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. This happens when any one has deprived another of his property in goods or chattels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>, or wrongfully detains one's wife, child, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>: in which case the owner of the goods, and the husband, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, may lawfully claim and retake them, wherever he happens to find them; so it be not in a riotous manner, or attended with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of the peace. The reason for this is obvious; since it may frequently happen that the owner may have this only opportunity of doing himself justice: his goods may be afterwards conveyed away or destroyed; and his wife, children, or servants, concealed or carried out of his reach; if he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> speedier remedy than the ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of law. If therefore he can so contrive it as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> possession of his property again, without force or terror, the law favours and will justify his proceeding. But, as the public peace is a superior consideration to any one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s private property; and as, if individuals were once allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> private force as a remedy for private injuries, all social justice must cease, the strong would give law to the weak, and every man would revert to a state of nature; for these reasons it is provided, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> right of reception shall never be exerted, where such exertion must occasion strife and bodily contention, or endanger the peace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. If, for instance, my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> is taken away, and I find him in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, a fair, or a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">inn</a>, I may lawfully <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> him to my own use; but I cannot justify breaking open a private stable, or entering <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the grounds of a third person, to take him, except he be feloniously stolen; but must have recourse to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> at law.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REPROBATION\">Reprobation</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">Theology</a>, means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of abandoning, or state of being abandoned, to eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a>; and is applied to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> or resolve which God has taken from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a> to punish sinners who shall die in impenitence; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> it is directly opposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>. When a sinner is so hardened as to feel no remorse or misgiving of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, it is considered as a sign of reprobation; which by the culprits has been distinguished into positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. The first is that whereby God is supposed to create men with a positive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to damn them eternally. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is countenanced by St Augustine and other Christian fathers, and is a peculiar tenet of Calvin and most of his followers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of England, in The thirty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">Articles</a>, teaches something like it; and the church of Scotland, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">Confession</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">Faith</a>, maintains it in the strongest terms. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> is generally exploded, and is believed by no rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> in either church, being totally injurious to the justice of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>. Negative or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDITIONAL\">conditional</a> reprobation is that whereby God, though he has a sincere desire to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> men, and furnishes them with the necessary means, so that all if they will may be saved, yet fees that there are many who will not be saved by the means, however powerful, that are afforded them; though by other means which the Deity fees, but will not afford them, they might be saved. Reprobation respects <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as men, and respects the latter either fallen or unfallen. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREDESTINATION\">Predestination</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">Reproduction</a> is usually understood to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of a thing before existing, and since destroyed. It is very well known that trees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> may be raised from slips and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTINGS\">cuttings</a>; and some late observations have shown, that there are some animals which have the same property. The polype was the first insect we had of this; but we had scarce time to wonder at the discovery Mr Trembley had made, when Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONNET\">Bonnet</a> discovered the same property in a species of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-worm. Amongst the plants which may be raised from cuttings, there are some which seem to possess this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> in so eminent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the smallest portion of them will become a complete tree again.\n\nIt deserves inquiry, whether or not the great Author of nature, when he ordained that certain insects, as the polypes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, should resemble those plants in that particular, allowed them this power of being reproduced in the same degree? or, which is the same thing, whether this reproduction will or will not take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> the worm is cut? In order to try this, Mr Bonnet entered on a course of many experiments on the water-worms which have this property. These are, at their common growth, from two to three inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and of a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of redness. From one of these worms he cut off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> and tail, taking from each extremity only a small piece of a twelfth of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>; but neither of these pieces were able to reproduce what was wanting. They both perished in about 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; the tail first, and afterwards the head. As to the body of the worm from which these pieces were separated, it lived as well as before, and seemed indeed to suffer nothing by the loss, the head-part being immediately used as if the head was thereon, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BORING\">boring</a> the creature's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into the mud. There are, besides this, two other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in which the reproduction will not take place; the one of these is about the fifth or sixth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> from the head, and the other at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the tail; and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the condition of the great artery in these parts is the cause of this.\n\nWhat is said of the want of the reproductive power of these parts relates only to the head and tail ends; for as to the body, it feels very little inconvenience from\nthe loss of what is taken off, and very speedily reproduces those parts. Where then does the principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> reside in such worms, which, after having their heads cut off, will have not only the same motions, but even the inclinations, that they had before? and yet this difficulty is very small, compared to several others which at the same time offer themselves to our reason. Is this wonderful reproduction of parts only a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>? or is there lodged in the body of the creature a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> buds or shoots, a sort of little embryos, already formed and placed in such parts where the reproductions are to begin? Are these worms only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>? or are they, like more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> animals, a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> of whose motions are actuated or regulated by a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>? And if they have themselves such a principle, how is it that this principle is multiplied, and is found in every separate piece? Is it to be granted, that there are in these worms, not a single soul (if it is to be so called) in each, but that each contains as many souls as there are pieces capable of reproducing perfect animals? Are we to believe with Malpighi, that these sorts of worms are all heart and brain from one end to the other? This may be; but yet if we knew that it was so, we should know in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> but very little the more for knowing it: and it seems, after all, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of this kind we are only to admire the works of the great Creator, and sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> in silence.\n\nThe nice sense of feeling in spiders has been much talked of by naturalists; but it appears that these worms have yet somewhat more surprising in them regard to this particular. If a piece of stick, or any other substance, be brought near them, they do not stay for its touching them, but begin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAP\">leap</a> and frisk about as soon as it comes towards them. There want, however, some farther experiments to ascertain whether this be really owing to feeling or to flight; for though we can discover no distinct organs of sight in these creatures, yet they seem affected by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>, and always frisk about in the same manner at the approach of either; nay, even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>-light has some effect upon them.\n\nA twig of willow, poplar, or many other trees, being planted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, takes root, and becomes a tree, every piece of which will in the same manner produce other trees. The case is the same with these worms: they are cut to pieces, and these several pieces become perfect animals; and each of these may be again cut into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of pieces, each of which will in the same manner produce an animal. It had been supposed by some that these worms were oviparous: but Mr Bonnet, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> one of them to pieces, having observed a slender substance, resembling a small filament, to move at the end of one of these pieces, separated it; and on examining it with glasses, found it to be a perfect worm, of the same form with its parent, which lived and grew larger in a vessel of water into which he put it. These small bodies are easily divided, and very readily complete themselves again, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> usually serving for the production of a head to the part that wants one; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, the smaller and slenderer the worms are, the sooner they complete themselves after this operation. When the bodies of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> worms are examined by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, it is very easy to see the appearance of the young worms alive, and moving about within them; but it requires greater precision and exactness to be certain of this; since the ramifications of the great artery have very much the appearance of young worms, and they are kept in a sort of continual motion by the typhloes and diastoles of the several portions of the artery, which serve as so many hearts. It is very certain, that what we force in regard to these animals by our operations, is done also naturally every day in the brooks and ditches where they live. A curious observer will find in these places many of them without heads or tails, and some without either; as also other fragments of various kinds, all which are then in the act of completing themselves: but whether accidents have reduced them to this state, or they thus purposely throw off parts of their own body for the reproduction of more animals, it is not easy to determine. They are plainly liable to many accidents, by which they lose the several parts of their body, and must perish very early if they had not a power of reproducing what was lost: they often are broken into two pieces, by the resistance of some hard pieces of mud which they enter; and they are subject to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, a kind of gangrene, rotting off the several parts of their bodies, and must inevitably perish by it, had they not this surprising property.\n\nThis worm was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> instance, after the polype, of the surprising power in an animal of recovering its most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> parts when lost. But Nature does not seem to have limited her beneficence in this respect to these two creatures. Mr Bonnet tried the same experiments on another species of water-worm, differing from the former in being much thicker. This kind of worm, when divided in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> season, very often shows the same property: for if it be cut into two or three pieces, the pieces will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> like dead for a long time, but afterwards will move about again; and will be found in this state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> to have recovered a head, or a tail, or both. After recovering their parts, they move very little; and, according to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>'s experiments, seldom live more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>.\n\nIt should seem, that the more difficult success of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> kind of worm, after cutting, and the long time it takes to recover the lost parts, if it do recover them at all, is owing to its thickness; since we always find in that species of worms which succeeds best of all, that those which are thinnest always recover their parts much sooner than the others.\n\nThe water-insects also are not the only creatures which have this power of recovering their lost parts. The earth affords us some already discovered to grow in this manner from their cuttings, and these not less deserving our admiration than those of the water: the common earth-worms are of this kind. Some of these worms have been divided into two, others into three or four pieces; and some of these pieces, after having palled two or three months without any appearance of life or motion, have then begun to reproduce a head or tail, or both. The reproduction of the anus, after such a state of rest, is no long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>; a few days do it: but it is otherwise with the head, that does not seem to perform its functions in the divided pieces till about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months after the separation. It is to be observed, that in all these operations both on earth and water-worms, the hinder part suffers greatly more than the fore part in the cutting; for it always twirls itself about a long time, as if actuated by strong convulsions; whereas the head\nhead usually crawls away without the appearance of any great uneasiness.\n\nThe reproduction of several parts of lobsters, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRABS\">crabs</a>, &c., makes also one of the great curiosities in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. That, in lieu of an organic part of an animal broken off, another shall rise perfectly like it, may seem inconceivable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, where the animal is supposed to be wholly formed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>. Yet has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of fact been well attested by the fishermen, and even by several virtuosos who have taken the point into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, particularly M. de Resumar and M. Perrault, whose skill and accuracy in things of this nature will hardly be questioned. The legs of lobsters, &c., consist each of five articulations; now, when any of the legs happen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, as in walking, &c., which frequently happens, the fracture is always found to be in a part near the fourth articulation; and what they thus lose is precisely reproduced some time afterwards; that is, a part of a leg grows out, consisting of four articulations, the first whereof has two claws as before; so that the loss is entirely repaired.\n\nIf a lobster's leg be broken off by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> at the fourth or fifth articulation, what is thus broken off always comes again; but it is not so if the fracture be made in the first, second, or third articulation. In those cases, the reproduction is very rare if things continue as they are. But what is exceedingly surprising is, that they do not; for, upon visiting the lobster maimed in these barren and unhappy articulations, at the end of two or three days, all the other articulations are found broken off to the fourth; and it is suspected they have performed the operation on themselves, to make the reproduction of a leg certain.\n\nThe part reproduced is not only perfectly like that retrenched, but also, in a certain space of time, grows equal to it. Hence it is that we frequently see lobsters, which have their two big legs unequal, and that in all proportions. This shows the smaller leg to be a new one.\n\nA part thus reproduced being broken, there is a second reproduction. The summer, which is the only season of the year when the lobsters eat, is the most favourable time for the reproduction. It is then performed in four or five weeks; whereas it takes up eight or nine months in any other season. The small legs are sometimes reproduced, but more rarely, as well as more slowly, than the great ones: the herons do the same.\n\nThe experiment is most easily tried on the common crab.","sp":368,"ep":371},{"h":"REPTILES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, a kind of animals denominated from their creeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> advancing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the belly. Or reptiles are those animals, which, instead of feet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the body, while they advance forward with the rest. Such are earthworms, snakes, caterpillars, &c. Indeed, most of the reptiles have feet; only those very small, and the legs short in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the bulk of the body.\n\nNaturalists observe a world of artful contrivance for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of reptiles. Thus, particularly in the earthworm, Dr Willis tells us, the whole body is only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of annular muscles; or, as Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERHAM\">Derham</a> says, it is only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> muscle, the orbicular fibres whereby being contracted, render each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> narrower and longer than before; by which means it is enabled, like the worm of an auger, to bore its passage into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Its reptile motion might also be explained by a wire wound on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, which when flipped off, and one end extended and held fast, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> bring the other near to it. So the earthworm having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> out or extended his body (which is with a wreathing), it takes hold by these small feet it hath, and so contracts the hinder part of its body. Dr Tyton adds, that when the forepart of the body is stretched out, and applied to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, the hind part relaxing and shortening is easily drawn towards it as a centre.\n\nIts feet are disposed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> row the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the worm, with which, as with so many hooks, it fattens <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> sometimes this and sometimes that part of the body to the plane, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> stretches out or drags after it another.\n\nThe creeping of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> is effected after a somewhat different manner; there being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in their structure; in that these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> have a compages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> articulated together.\n\nThe body here is not drawn together, but as it were complicated; part of it being applied on the rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, and the rest ejaculated and shot from it, which being set on the ground in its turn, brings the other after it.

This propensity alone attaches us to every new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>; and incites us to compare objects, in order to discover their differences and resemblances.\n\nResemblance among objects of the same kind, and dissimilitude among objects of different kinds, are too obvious and familiar to gratify our curiosity in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>: its gratification lies in discovering differences among things where resemblance prevails, and resemblances where difference prevails. Thus a difference in individuals of the same kind of plants or animals, is deemed a discovery, while the many particulars in which they agree are neglected; and in different kinds, any resemblance is greedily remarked, without attending to the many particulars in which they differ.\n\nA comparison of the former neither tends to gratify our curiosity, nor to let the objects compared in a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>: two apartments in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, similar in shape, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, make separately as good a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> as when compared; and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> is applicable to two similar compartments in a garden: on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, oppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> to a towering hill, or even a little dog to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> effect. But a resemblance between objects of the same kind, have remarkably an enlivening effect. The poets, such of them as have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, draw all their families from things that in the main differ widely from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> subject; and they never attempt a contrast, but where the things have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> genus, and a resemblance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> circumstances: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> together a large and a small sized animal of the same species, the one will appear greater, the other less, than when viewed separately; when we oppose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>, each makes a greater figure by the comparison. We compare the dress of different nations with curiosity, but without surprize; because they have no such resemblance in the capital parts as to please us by contrasting the smaller parts. But a new cut of a sleeve, or of a pocket, enchants by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a>; and, in opposition to the former fashion, raises some degree of surprize.\n\nThat resemblance and dissimilitude have an enlivening effect upon objects of sight, is made sufficiently evident; and that they have the same effect upon objects of the other senses, is also certain. Nor is that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> confined to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> senses; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> contrasted make a greater figure by the opposition: Iago, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> of Othello, says,\n\nHe hath a daily beauty in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>\nThat makes me ugly.\n\nThe character of a fop, and of a rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, are nowhere more successfully contrasted than in Shakespeare:\n\nHotspur. My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEGE\">liege</a>, I did deny no prisoners:\nBut I remember, when the fight was done,\nWhen I was dry with rage, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> toil,\nBreathless and faint, leaning upon my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>,\nCame there a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>, neat, trimly dress'd,\nFresh as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDEGROOM\">bridegroom</a>; and his chin, new-reap'd,\nShow'd like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\nHe was perfumed like a milliner;\nAnd 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held\nA pouncet-box, which ever and anon\nHe gave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>:\u2014and still he smil'd and talk'd;\nAnd as the foldiers bare dead bodies by,\nHe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a>'d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,\nTo bring a flowery, handsome corpse\nBetwixt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>.\nWith many holiday and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> terms\nHe question'd me: among the rest, demanded\nMy pris'ners, in your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">Majesty</a>'s behalf.\nI then, all smarting with my wounds; being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>'d\nTo be so pestered with a popinjay,\nOut of my grief, and my impatience,\nAnswer'd, neglectingly, I know not what:\nHe should, or should not; for he made me mad,\nTo see him shine so brisk, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> so sweet,\nAnd talk so like a waiting gentlewoman,\nOf guns, and drums, and wounds, (God <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the mark!)\nAnd telling me, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>'th thing on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>\nWas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a> for an inward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUISE\">bruise</a>;\nAnd that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> pity, so it was,\nThis villainous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a> should be digg'd\nOut of the bowels of the harmless earth,\nWhich many a good, tall fellow had destroy'd\nSo cowardly: and but for these vile guns,\nHe would himself have been a soldier.\u2014\nFirst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, Henry IV. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> i. sc. 4.\n\nPassions and emotions are also inflamed by comparison. A man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> humbles the bystanders even to annihilate them in their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>: C\u00e6sar, beholding the statue of Alexander, was greatly mortified, that now, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 32, when Alexander died, he had not performed one memorable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>.\n\nOur opinions also are much influenced by comparison. A man whose opulence exceeds the ordinary standard is reputed richer than he is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> or weaknesses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> at all remarkable in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a>, is generally carried beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\nThe opinion a man forms of his present distress\nCould I forget\nWhat I have been, I might the better bear\nWhat I'm destin'd to, I'm not the first\nThat have been wretched: but to think how much\nI have been happier.\n\nSouthern's Innocent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">Adultery</a>, act ii.\n\nThe distress of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> journey makes even an indifferent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">inn</a> agreeable: and, in travelling, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> is good, and the horseman well covered, a bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> may be agreeable, by making him sensible how snug he is.\n\nThe same effect is equally remarkable, when a man opposes his condition to that of others. A ship tossed about in a storm, makes the spectator reflect upon his own ease and security, and puts these in the strongest light.\n\nA man in grief cannot bear mirth; it gives him a more lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of his unhappiness, and of course makes him more unhappy. Satan, contemplating the beauties of the terrestrial paradise, has the following exclamation:\n\nWith what delight could I have walk'd thee round,\nIf I could joy in ought, sweet interchange\nOf hill and valley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, woods, and plains,\nNew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and shores with forest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>'d,\nRocks, dens, and caves! but I in none of these\nFind place or refuge; and the more I see\nPleasures about me, so much more I feel\nTorment within me, as from the hateful siege\nOf contraries: all good to me becomes\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANE\">Bane</a>, and in heav'n much worse would be my state.\n\nParadise Lost, book ix. l. 114.\n\nThe appearance of danger gives sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, sometimes pain. A timorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLEMENTS\">battlements</a> of a high tower, is seized with fear, which even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of security cannot dispel. But upon one of a firm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, this situation has a contrary effect: the appearance of danger heightens, by opposition, the consciousness of security, and consequently the satisfaction that arises from security: here the feeling resembles that above-mentioned, occasioned by a ship labouring in a storm.","sp":373,"ep":374},{"h":"RESERVE","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, the same with reservation.

The residual analysis accordingly proceeds, by taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of a variable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> in two different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of that quantity, and denoting the relation of this difference to the difference between the two states of the said variable quantity. This relation being first generally expressed, is next considered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> when the difference of the two states of the variable quantity is = 0; and by that means it is obvious, that the same thing is done as when the function of a variable quantity is assigned by the ordinary methods.\n\nThe evolutions of the functions, considered in this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> view, requires the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a>, discovered by Mr Landen, and remarkable for its simplicity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. It is, that\n\n\\[ \\frac{m}{n} \\times \\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{m}{n} \\]\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> \\( x \\) and \\( v \\) are any two variable quantities\n\n\\[ \\frac{m}{n} \\times \\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{m}{n} \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{v}{x} + \\frac{v^2}{x^2} + \\frac{v^3}{x^3} + \\cdots (m) \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{v}{x} \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>)^n + \\left( \\frac{v}{x} \\right)^n + \\left( \\frac{v}{x} \\right)^n + \\cdots (n) \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEGER\">integer</a> numbers.\n\nThis theorem is the basis of the calculus, and from the expressions \\( \\frac{m}{n} - \\frac{n}{m} \\), and \\( x - v \\) having the form of what algebraists denominate residuals, the inventor gave to his method the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of the residual analysis.\n\nMr Landen published the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of this method in 1758, which he denominated A Discourse concerning\nThe first book of the analysis appeared in 1764, which contained an explanation of the principles of the new calculus, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to problems of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> method of fluxions, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> book solved several problems of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> method, but it was never published.\n\nIf we estimate the value of this analysis by its practical utility, it may be said to possess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great merit.

It was equally interesting to them as to us; and we cannot read the accounts of the naval exertions of Phoenicia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, and of Rome, exertions which have not been surpassed by any thing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, without believing that they possessed much practical and experimental knowledge of this subject. It was not, perhaps, possessed by them in a strict and systematic form, as it is now taught by our mathematicians; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>-builders, in their dockyards, did undoubtedly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> in comparing the forms of their finest ships, and in marking those circumstances of form and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a> which were in fact accompanied with the desirable properties of a ship, and thus framing to themselves maxims of naval architecture in the same manner as we do now. For we believe that our naval architects are not disposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>\ngrant that they have profited much by all the labours of the mathematicians. But the ancients had not made any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> progress in the physical mathematical sciences, which consist chiefly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALCULUS\">calculus</a> to the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. In this branch they could make none, because they had not the means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. A knowledge of the motions and actions of fluids is accessible only to those who are familiarly acquainted with the fluxionary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>; and without this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> admittance. Even when perplexed by this guide, our progress has been very slow, hesitating, and devious; and we have not yet been able to establish any set of doctrines which are susceptible of an easy and confident application to the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. If we have advanced farther than the ancients, it is because we have come after them, and have profited by their labours, and even by their mistakes.\n\nSir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton was the first (as far as we can recollect) who attempted to make the motions and actions of fluids the subject of mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a>. He had invented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">fluxions</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before he engaged in his physical researches; and he proceeded in these fluid mathematical faceta praefere. Yet even with this guide he was often obliged to grope his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, and to try various bye-paths, in the hopes of obtaining a legitimate theory. Having exerted all his powers in establishing a theory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> motions, he was obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a> contented with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> instead of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> solution of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> which contains the motions of three bodies mutually acting on each other. This convinced him that it was in vain to expect an accurate investigation of the motions and actions of fluids, where millions of unseen particles combine their influence. He therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> about to find some particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the problem which would admit of an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> furnish circumstances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> or resemblance sufficiently numerous for giving limiting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, which should include between them those other cases that did not admit of this accurate investigation. And thus, by knowing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> to which the case proposed did approximate, and the circumstance which regulated the approximation, many useful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> might be deduced for directing us in the application of these doctrines to the arts of life.\n\nHe therefore figured to himself a hypothetical collection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> which possessed the characteristic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of fluidity, viz. the quidquaverum propagation of pressure, and the most perfect intermixture (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> the uncouth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>) of parts, and which formed a physical whole or aggregate, whose parts were connected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> forces, determined both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> and in direction, and such as rendered the determination of certain important circumstances of their motion susceptible of precise investigation. And he concluded, that the laws which he should discover in these motions must have a great analogy with the laws of the motions of real fluids: And from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> he deduced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of propositions, which form the basis of almost all the theories of the impulse and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESISTANCE_OF_FLUIDS\">resistance of fluids</a> which have been offered to the public since his time.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, that the results of this theory agree but ill with experiment, and that, in the way in which it has been zealously prosecuted by subsequent mathematicians, it proceeds on principles or assumptions which are not only gratuitous, but even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>. But it affords such a beautiful application of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a> and calculus, that mathematicians have been as it were fascinated by it, and have published systems so elegant and so extensively applicable, that one cannot help lamenting that the foundation is so flimsy. John Bernoulli's theory, in his dissertation on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion, and Bouguer's in his Trait\u00e9 du Navire, and in his Th\u00e9orie du Man\u0153uvre et de la M\u00e2ture des Va\u00eff-jeaux, must ever be considered as among the finest specimens of physical mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> which the world has seen. And, with all its imperfections, this theory still furnishes (as was expected by its illustrious author) it is still many propositions of immense practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, they being very confining the limits to which the real phenomena of the impulse and resistance of fluids really approximate. So that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> by which the phenomena deviate from the theory is once determined by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> chosen series of experiments, this hypothetical theory becomes almost as valuable as a true one. And we may add, that although Mr d'Alembert, by treading warily in the steps of Sir Isaac Newton in another route, has discovered a genuine and unexceptionable theory, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of investigation is so intricate, requiring every fineness of the most arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> equations are so complicated, that even their most expert author has not been able to deduce more than one simple proposition (which too was discovered by Daniel Bernoulli by a more simple process) which can be applied to any use. The hypothetical theory of Newton, therefore, continues to be the groundwork of all our practical knowledge of the subject.\n\nWe shall therefore lay before our readers a very short view of the theory, and the manner of applying it. We shall then show its defects (all of which were pointed out by its great author), and give a historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the many attempts which have been made to amend it or to substitute another: in all which we think it our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> to show, that Sir Isaac Newton took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and pointed out every path which others have taken, if we except Daniel Bernoulli and d'Alembert; and we shall give an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> sets of experiments which have been made on this important subject, in the hopes of establishing an empirical theory, which may be employed with confidence in the arts of life.\n\nWe know by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that force must be applied to a body in order that it may move through a fluid, resistance, such as air or water; and that a body projected with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> is gradually retarded in its motion, and generally brought to rest. The analogy of nature makes us imagine that there is a force acting in the opposite direction, or opposing the motion, and that this force resides in, or is exerted by, the fluid. And the phenomena resemble those which accompany the known resistance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> beings, such as animals. Therefore we give to this supposed force the metaphorical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Resistance. We also know that a fluid in motion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> hurry a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body along with the stream, and that it requires force to maintain it in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. A similar analogy makes us suppose that the fluid exerts force, in the same manner as when an active being impels the body before him; therefore we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">Impulsion</a> of a Fluid. And as our knowledge of nature...\nResistence informs us that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> actions of bodies are in every case equal and opposite, and that the observed change of motion is the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a>, characteristic, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, of the changing force, the forces are the same (whether we call them impulsions or resistances) when the relative motions are the same, and therefore depend entirely on these relative motions. The force, therefore, which is necessary for keeping a body immoveable in a stream of water, flowing with a certain velocity, is the same with what is required for moving this body with this velocity through stagnant water. To any one who admits the motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, it is evident that we can neither observe nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> from a case of a body moving through still water, nor of a stream of water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> upon or impelling a quiescent body.\n\nA body in motion appears to be resisted by a stagnant fluid, because it is a law of mechanical nature that force must be employed in order to put any body in motion. Now the body cannot move forward without putting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> fluid in motion, and force must be employed for producing this motion. In like manner, a quiescent body is impelled by a stream of fluid, because the motion of the contiguous fluid is diminished by this solid obstacle; the resistance, therefore, or impulse, no way differs from the ordinary communications of motion among solid bodies.\n\nSir Isaac Newton, therefore, begins his theory of the resistance and impulse of fluids, by selecting a case where, although he cannot pretend to ascertain the motions themselves which are produced in the particles of a contiguous fluid, he can tell precisely their mutual ratios.\n\nHe supposes two systems of bodies such, that each body of the first is similar to a corresponding body of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, and that each is to each in a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>. He also supposes them to be similarly situated, that is, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of similar figures, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOLOGOUS\">homologous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of these figures are in the same ratio with the diameters of the bodies. He farther supposes, that they attract or repel each other in similar directions, and that the accelerating connecting forces are also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a>; that is, the forces in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> are to the corresponding forces in the other system in a constant ratio, and that, in each system taken apart, the forces are as the squares of the velocities directly, and as the diameters of the corresponding bodies, or their distances, inversely.\n\nThis being the case, it legitimately follows, that if similar parts of the two systems are put into similar motions, in any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, they will continue to move similarly, each correspondent body describing similar curves, with proportional velocities: For the bodies being similarly situated, the forces which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on a body in one system, arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of adjoining particles, will have the same direction with the force acting on the corresponding body in the other system, arising from the combined action of the similar and similarly directed forces of the adjoining correspondent bodies of the other system; and these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> forces will have the same ratio with the simple forces which constitute them, and will be as the squares of the velocities directly, and as the distances, or any homologous lines inversely; and therefore the chords of curvature, having the direction of the centripetal or resistance, centrifugal forces, and similarly inclined to the tangents of the curves described by the corresponding bodies, will have the same ratio with the distances of the particles. The curves described by the corresponding bodies will therefore be similar, the velocities will be proportional, and the bodies will be similarly situated at the end of the first moment, and exposed to the action of similar and similarly situated centripetal or centrifugal forces; and this will again produce similar motions during the next moment, and so on forever. All this is evident to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> acquainted with the elementary doctrines of curvilinear motions, as delivered in the theory of physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> proposition, it clearly follows, consequently, that if two similar bodies, having their homologous lines in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to those of the two systems, be similarly situated projected among the bodies of those two systems with any from it velocities, they will produce similar motions in the two systems, and will themselves continue to move similarly; and therefore will, in every subsequent moment, suffer similar diminutions or retardations. If the initial velocities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> be the same, but the densities of the two systems, that is, the quantities of matter contained in an equal bulk or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, be different, it is evident that the quantities of motion produced in the two systems in the same time will be proportional to the densities; and if the densities are the same, and uniform in each system, the quantities of motion produced will be as the squares of the velocities, because the motion communicated to each corresponding body will be proportional to the velocity communicated, that is, to the velocity of the impelling body; and the number of similarly situated particles which will be agitated will also be proportional to this velocity. Therefore, the whole quantities of motion produced in the same moment of time will be proportional to the squares of the velocities. And lastly, if the densities of the two systems are uniform, or the same through the whole extent of the systems, the number of particles impelled by similar bodies will be as the surfaces of these bodies.\n\nNow the diminutions of the motions of the projected bodies are (by Newton's third law of motion) equal to the motions produced in the systems; and these diminutions are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of what are called the resistances opposed to the motions of the projected bodies. Therefore, combining all these circumstances, the resistances are proportional to the similar surfaces of the moving bodies, to the densities of the systems through which the motions are performed, and to the squares of the velocities, jointly.\n\nWe cannot form to ourselves any distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of a fluid fluid, otherwise than as a system of small bodies, or a considered collection of particles, similarly or symmetrically arranged, the centres of each being situated in the angles of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> solids. We must form this notion of it, whether fairly arranged, with the vulgar, that the particles are little ranged, globules in mutual contact, or, with the partisans of corpuscular attractions and repulsions, we suppose the particles kept at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from each other by means of these attractions and repulsions mutually balancing each other. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> case, no other arrangement is consistent with a quiescent equilibrium; and in this case, it is evident, from the theory of curvilinear motions, that the agitations...\nFirst law of Prop. I. The resistances, and (by the third law of motion), the impulsions of fluids on similar bodies, are proportional to the surfaces of the solid bodies, to the densities of the fluids, and to the squares of the velocities, jointly.\n\nWe must now observe, that when we suppose the particles of the fluid to be in mutual contact, we may either suppose them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> or inelastic. The motion communicated to the collection of elastic particles must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> of what the same body, moving in the same manner, would communicate to the particles of an elastic fluid. The impulse and resistance of elastic fluids must therefore be double of those of inelastic fluids.\u2014But we must caution our readers not to judge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> of fluids by their sensible compressibility. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> is incomparably more elastic than the finest foot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, though not compressible in any sensible degree.\u2014It remains to be decided, by well chosen experiments, whether water be not as elastic as air. If we suppose, with Bozovich, the particles of perfect fluids to be at a distance from each other, we shall find it difficult to conceive a fluid void of elasticity. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> that the theory of their inelastic and resistance will suggest experiments which will decide this question, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out what ought to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> impulse or resistance in either case. And thus the fundamental proposition of the impulse and resistance of fluids, taken in its proper meaning, is susceptible of a rigid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, relative to the only distinct notion that we can form of the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of a fluid. We say, taken in its proper meaning; namely, that the impulse or resistance of fluids is a pressure, opposed and measured by another pressure, such as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, the force of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, and the like. And we apprehend that it would be very difficult to find any legitimate demonstration of this leading proposition different from this, which we have now borrowed from Sir Isaac Newton, Prop. 23. B. II. Princip.\n\nWe acknowledge that it is prolix and even circuitous: but in all the attempts made by his commentators and their copyists to simplify it, we see great defects of logical argument, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of principles, which are not only gratuitous, but inadmissible. We shall have occasion, as we proceed, to point out some of these defects; and doubt not but the illustrious author of this demonstration had exercised his uncommon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> and sagacity in similar attempts, and was dissatisfied with them all.\n\nBefore we proceed farther, it will be proper to make a general remark, which will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of discussion. Since it is a matter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> experience, that every action of a body on others is accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction; and since all that we can demonstrate concerning the resistance of bodies during their motions through fluids proceeds on this supposition, (the resistance of the body being assumed as equal and opposite to the sum of motions communicated to the particles of the fluid, estimated in the direction of the bodies' motion), we are intitled to proceed in the contrary order, and to consider the impulsions which each of the particles of fluid exerts on the body at rest, as equal and opposite to the motion which the body would communicate to that particle if the fluid were at rest, and the body were moving equally swift in the opposite direction. And therefore the whole impulsion of the fluid must be conceived as the measure of the whole motion which the body would thus communicate to the fluid. It must therefore be also considered as the measure of the resistance which the body, moving with the same velocity, would sustain from the fluid. When, therefore, we shall demonstrate anything concerning the impulsion of a fluid, estimated in the direction of its motion, we must consider it as demonstrated concerning the resistance of a quiescent fluid to the motion of that body, having the same velocity in the opposite direction.

The progress from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> is so slow, that however capable we may suppose the earliest inhabitants of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> to have been of making philosophical discoveries, we cannot believe that the Father of mercies left his helpless creature to discover for himself his future existence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">Death</a>, when first presented to him, must have been a ghastly object; and had he been left without any hope of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> from it, he would undoubtedly have sunk into little despontency.\n\nBut a prospect of immortality is so pleasing to the human mind, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was communicated to the first man, it would of course be cherished by his posterity; and there is no difficulty in conceiving how it might be handed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by tradition to very remote ages, among such of his descendants as were not scattered over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the earth in small and savage tribes.\u2014In the course of its progress, it would frequently be\nnew-modelled by the ever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> many absurd and fantastic circumstances would doubtless be combined with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that death puts not an end to human existence.\n\nBut though we are firmly convinced that the first principles of useful knowledge, and among them the doctrine of a future state, were communicated to man by his Maker; and though this doctrine, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, might certainly be conveyed more or less pure to late posterity through the channel of tradition\u2014we are far from attributing too much to tradition as some writers are disposed to do, or thinking it the only source from which mankind could derive the belief of their existence beyond the grave. In small tribes of savages such a tradition could hardly be preserved; and yet some indistinct notions of a future state have been found among tribes who are said to have lost all traditional notions even of the being of a God.\n\nOthers imagine the notion might be conjectured from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> phenomena; as from dreaming, &c.\n\nOthers, therefore, are inclined to believe that, independent of any traditions, mankind might be led by certain phenomena to form some conjectures of a future state.

It is but a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, containing scarce 6000 inhabitants; but it is a bishop's see, and the harbour is defended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BASHAW\">bashaw</a> resides. It was taken by the Turks in 1647, and has been in their hands ever since. It is about 45 miles from Candia. E. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">Long</a>. 24\u00b0 45'. N. Lat. 35\u00b0 22'.\n\nThe citadel, which stands on a rock jutting out into the sea, would be sufficient for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the city, were it not situated at the foot of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> hill, from which it might be cannonaded with great advantage. The harbour is now almost filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, and is no longer accessible to shipping; nor do the Turks in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> oppose the ravages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, but behold with a careless eye the most valuable works in a state of ruin. The French had formerly a vice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> at Retimo, to which ships used to repair for cargoes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; but they have been long unable to get into the harbour: to repair which, however, and to revive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of Retimo, would be a most useful attempt. The plains around the city abound in a variety of productions. Great quantities of oil, cotton, saffron, and wax, are produced here; and they would be produced in still greater quantities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the inhabitants could export their commodities. The gardens of Retimo bear the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> in the island; excellent pomegranates, almonds, pistachio nuts, and oranges. The apricot-tree, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the michmich, the juice of which is so delicious, and its flavour so exquisite, is found here. It is a kind of early peach, but smaller and more juicy than those of France.\n\n**RETINA,** in Anatomy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the optic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the eye, where the sense of vision is first received.

The conquest of it was again attempted by the Swedes in 1790. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Sodermania, with the Swedish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, attempted to carry the harbour; but after an obstinate engagement with the Russian fleet, he was obliged to give it up; but it was but for a very short while. He retired about 10 leagues from the harbour, to repair the damage his fleet had sustained, and to prepare for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> attack before any relief could be afforded to the Russian fleet. As soon as he had refitted, he sailed for the harbour, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> distant from which the Russian fleet was discovered, ready to dispute with the Swedes the entrance.

Now should a book teaching absurd or immoral doctrines (as many chapters of the Koran do, and as all the traditional systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGANISM\">Paganism</a> did), pretend to be revealed by a God of wisdom and justice, we may safely reject its pretensions without farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> than what is necessary to satisfy us that we have not misunderstood its doctrine. Should a book claiming this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> origin, enjoin in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it, and forbid in another, the same thing to be done under the same circumstances, we may reject it with contempt and indignation; because a being of infinite wisdom can never act capriciously or absurdly.

At this kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> the shallow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> may smile contemptuously; but it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in arts and sciences as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as in religion.

He believes, however, in man, while the Christian believes in God; and therefore he cannot pretend that his faith rests on a surer foundation.\n\nMr Locke, in laying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the distinct provinces of reason and faith, observes, 1. That the same truths may be discovered by revelation which are discoverable to us by reason. 2. That no revelation can be admitted against the clear evidence of reason. 3. That there are many things of which we have but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> notions, or none at all; and others, of whose past, present, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of our faculties we cannot have the least knowledge: and these, being beyond the discovery of our faculties, and above reason, when revealed, become the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of our faith. He then adds, that our reason is not injured or disturbed, but assisted and improved, by new discoveries of truth coming from the fountain of knowledge. Whatever God has revealed is certainly true; but whether it be a divine revelation or not, reason must judge, which can never permit the mind to reject a greater evidence to embrace what is less evident. There can be no evidence that any traditional revelation is of divine origin\u2014Revelation, in the words we receive it, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> we understand it, so clear and so certain as that of the principles of reason: and, therefore, nothing that is contrary to the clear and self-evident dictates of reason, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to be urged or affented to as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of faith, wherein reason has nothing to do.\n\nRevelation of St John.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s ordinary revenue is such as has either subsisted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> out of mind in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; or else has been granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of purchase or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for such of the king's inherent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> revenues as were found inconvenient to the subject.\u2014In saying that it has subsisted time out of mind in the crown, we do not mean that the king is at present in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> possession of the whole of his revenue. Much (nay the greatest\nRevenue greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>) of it is at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of subjects; to whom it has been granted out from time to time by the kings of England: which has rendered the crown in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> dependent on the people for its ordinary support and subsistence. So that we must be obliged to recount, as part of the royal revenue, what lords of manors and other subjects frequently look upon to be their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>; because they and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> are and have been veiled in them for ages, though in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> originally derived from the grants of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> princes.\n\n1. The first of the king's ordinary revenues, which may be taken notice of, is of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> kind (as are also the three succeeding ones), viz. the custody of the temporalities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>. See Temporalities.\n\n2. The king is entitled to a corody, as the law calls it, out of every bishopric; that is, to send one of his chaplains to be maintained by the bishop, or to have a pension allowed him till the bishop promotes him to a benefice. This is also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of an acknowledgment to the king, as founder of the see; since he had formerly the same corody or pension from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> or priory of royal foundation. It is supposed to be now fallen into total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a>; though Sir Matthew Hale says, that it is due of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> right, and that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> discharge it.\n\n3. The king also is entitled to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a> arising in extraparochial places: though perhaps it may be doubted how far this article, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, can be properly reckoned a part of the king's own royal revenue; since a corody supports only his chaplains, and these extraparochial tithes are held under an implied trust that the king will distribute them for the good of the clergy in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>.\n\n4. The next branch consists in the first-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> and tenths of all spiritual preferments in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. See Tenths.\n\n5. The next branch of the king's ordinary revenue (which, as well as the subsequent branches, is of a lay or temporal nature) consists in the rents and profits of the demesne lands of the crown. These demesne lands, terrae dominicales regis, being either the share reserved to the crown at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of landed property, or such as came to it afterwards by forfeitures or other means, were anciently very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and extensive; comprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> manors, honours, and lordships; the tenants of which had very peculiar privileges, when we speak of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> in ancient demesne. At present they are contracted within a very narrow compass, having been almost entirely granted away to private subjects. This has occasioned the parliament frequently to interpose; and particularly after King William III. had greatly impoverished the crown, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> passed, whereby all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> grants or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEASES\">leases</a> from the crown for any longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> than 31 years or three lives, are declared to be void; except with regard to houses, which may be granted for 50 years. And no reverendary lease can be made, so as to exceed, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> in being, the same term of three lives or 31 years; that is, when there is a subsisting lease, of which there are 20 years still to come the king cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> a future interest, to commence after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of the former, for any longer term than 11 years. The tenant must also be made liable to be punished for committing waste; and the usual rent must be reserved, or, where there has usually been no rent, one-third of the clear yearly value. The misfortune is, that this act was made too late, after almost every valuable possession of the crown had been granted away for ever, or else upon very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> leases; but may be of benefit to posterity, when those leases come to expire.\n\n6. Hither might have been referred the advantages which were used to arise to the king from the profits of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> tenures, to which most lands in the kingdom were subject, till the statute 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-CAR\">Car</a>. II. c. 24, which in great measure abolished them all. Hither also might have been referred the profitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PURVEYANCE\">purveyance</a> and pre-emption: which was a right enjoyed by the crown of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUYING\">buying</a> up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> and other necessaries, by the intervention of the king's purveyors, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>, at an appraised valuation, in preference to all others, and even without consent of the owner: and also of forcibly impressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> and horses of the subject, to do the king's business on the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, in the conveyance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, baggage, and the like, however inconvenient to the proprietor, upon paying him a settled price. A prerogative which prevailed pretty generally throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> during the scarcity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> valuation of money consequential thereupon. In those early times, the king's household (as well as those of inferior lords) were supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> renders of corn, and other victuals, from the tenants of the respective demesnes; and there was also a continual market kept at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>-gate to furnish viands for the royal use. And this answered all purposes, in those ages of simplicity, so long as the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in any certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. But when it removed from one part of the kingdom to another (as was formerly very frequently done), it was found necessary to send purveyors beforehand, to get together a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of provisions and other necessaries for the household; and, left the unusual demand should raise them to an exorbitant price, the powers before-mentioned were vested in these purveyors; who in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time very greatly abused their authority, and became a great oppression to the subject, though of little advantage to the crown; ready money in open market (when the royal residence was more permanent, and specie began to be plenty) being found upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to be the best provident of any. Wherefore, by degrees, the powers of purveyance have declined, in foreign countries as well as our own: and particularly were abolished in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> by Gustavus Adolphus, towards the beginning of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. And, with us in England, having fallen into dilute during the suspension of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>, at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a>, contented, by the same statute, to resign entirely those branches of his revenue and power: and the parliament, in part of recompense, settled on him, his heirs, and successors, for ever, the hereditary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a> of 15d. per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> on all beer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALE\">ale</a> sold in the kingdom, and a proportionable sum for certain other liquors. So that this hereditary excise now forms the fifth branch of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>'s ordinary revenue.\n\n7. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> branch might also be computed to have arisen from wine-licences; or the rents payable to the crown by such persons as are licensed to sell wine by retail throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, except in a few privileged places. These were first settled on the crown by the statute 12 Car. II. c. 25, and, together with the hereditary\nRevenue.\n\nditary excise, made up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> in value for the losses sustained by the prerogative in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABOLITION\">abolition</a> of the military tenures, and the right of pre-emption and purveyance; but this revenue was abolished by the statute 30 Geo. II. c. 19, and an annual sum of upwards of \u00a35000 per annum, issuing out of the new stamp duties imposed on wine-licences, was settled on the crown in its stead.\n\n8. An eighth branch of the king's ordinary revenue is usually reckoned to consist in the profits arising from his forests. See FOREST. These consist principally in the amercements or fines levied for offences against the forest laws. But as few, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any, courts of this kind for levying amercements have been held since 1632, 8 Char. I., and as, from the accounts given of the proceedings in that court by our historians and law-books, nobody would wish to see them again revived, it is needless to pursue this inquiry any farther.\n\n9. The profits arising from the king's ordinary courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> make a ninth branch of his revenue. And these consist not only in fines imposed upon offenders, forfeitures of recognizances, and amercements levied upon defaulters; but also in certain fees due to the crown in a variety of legal matters, as, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> to charters, original writs, and other forensic proceedings, and for permitting fines to be levied of lands in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> entails, or otherwise to insure their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. As none of these can be done without the immediate intervention of the king, by himself or his officers, the law allows him certain perquisites and profits, as a recompense for the trouble he undertakes for the public. These, in process of time, have been almost all granted out to private persons, or else appropriated to certain particular uses: so that, though our law proceedings are still loaded with their payment, very little of them is now returned into the king's exchequer; for a part of whole royal maintenance they were originally intended. All future grants of them, however, by the statute 1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. stat. 2. c. 7, are to endure for no longer time than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> who grants them.\n\n10. A tenth branch of the king's ordinary revenue, said to be grounded on the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from pirates and robbers, is the right to royal fish, which are whale and sturgeon; and these, when either thrown ashore, or caught near the coasts, are the property of the king, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their superior excellence. Indeed, our ancestors seem to have entertained a very high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the importance of this right; it being the prerogative of the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> and the dukes of Normandy; and from one of these it was probably derived to our princes.\n\n11. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> revenue, and founded partly upon the same reason, is that of SHIPWRECKS. See WRECK.\n\n12. A twelfth branch of the royal revenue, the right to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, has its original from the king's prerogative of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COINAGE\">coinage</a>, in order to supply him with materials; and therefore those mines which are properly royal, and to which the king is entitled when found, are only those of silver and gold. See MINE.\n\n13. To the same original may in part be referred the reverse of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-TREASURE_TROVE\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>-trove. See TREASURE-TROVE.\n\n14. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAIFS\">Waifs</a>. See WAIF.\n\n15. Estrays. See ESTRAY.\n\nBesides the particular reasons, given in the different Revenue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, why the king should have the several revenues of royal fish, shipwrecks, treasure-trove, waifs, and estrays, there is also one general reason which holds for them all; and that is, because they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONA\">bona</a> vacantia, or goods in which no one else can claim a property. And, therefore, by the law of nature, they belonged to the first occupant or finder; and so continued under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> law. But in settling the modern constitutions of most of the governments in Europe, it was thought proper (to prevent that strife and contention which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPANCY\">occupancy</a> is apt to create and continue, and to provide for the support of public authority in a manner the least burdensome to individuals) that these rights should be annexed to the supreme power by the positive laws of the state. And so it came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, that as Bracton expresses it, \"hac, qua nullius in bonis fuit, et olim fuerunt inventoris de jure naturali, jam efficiuntur principis de jure gentium.\"\n\n16. The next branch of the king's ordinary revenue consists in forfeitures of lands and goods for offences; bona confiscata, as they are called by the civilians, because they belonged to the fiscus or imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>; or, as our lawyers term them, foris facta, that is, such whereof the property is gone away or departed from the owner. The true reason and only substantial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of any forfeiture for crimes, consist in this; that all property is derived from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, being one of those civil rights which are conferred upon individuals, in exchange for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> freedom which every man must sacrifice when he enters into social communities. If, therefore, a member of any national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> violates the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, by transgressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNICIPAL\">municipal</a> law, he forfeits his right to such privileges as he claims by that contract; and the state may very justly refuse that portion of property, or any part of it, which the laws have before assigned him. Hence, in every offence of an atrocious kind, the laws of England have exacted a total confiscation of the moveables or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> estate; and, in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, a perpetual, in others only a temporary, loss of the offender's immoveables or landed property; and have vested them both in the king, who is the person supposed to be offended, being the one visible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> in whom the majesty of the public resides. See FORFEITURE and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEODAND\">DEODAND</a>.\n\n17. Another branch of the king's ordinary revenue arises from escheats of lands, which happen upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of heirs to succeed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a>; whereupon they in general revert to and vest in the king, who is escheated, in the eye of the law, the original proprietor of all lands in the kingdom.\n\n18. The last branch of the king's ordinary revenue, consists in the custody of idiots, from whence we shall be naturally led to consider also the custody of lunatics. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOT\">IDIOT</a> and LUNATIC.\n\nThis may suffice for a short view of the king's ordinary revenue, or the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIMONY\">patrimony</a> of the crown; which was very large formerly, and capable of being increased to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> truly formidable: for there are very few estates in the kingdom that have not, at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> or other since the Norman conquest, been vested in the hands of the king, by forfeiture, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESCHEAT\">escheat</a>, or otherwise. But, fortunately for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of the subject, this hereditary landed revenue, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of improvident\nimprovident management, is sunk almost to nothing; and the casual profits, arising from the other branches of the census regalis, are likewise almost all of them alienated from the crown. In order to supply the deficiencies of which, we are now obliged to have recourse to new methods of raising money, unknown to our early ancestors; which methods constitute,\n\nII. The king's extraordinary revenue. For, the public patrimony being got into the hands of private subjects, it is but reasonable that private contributions should supply the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Which, though it may perhaps <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> harder upon some individuals, whose ancestors have had no share in the general plunder, than upon others, yet, taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> throughout, it amounts to nearly the same; provided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> by the extraordinary should appear to be no greater than the loss by the ordinary revenue. And perhaps, if every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> in the kingdom was to be stripped of such of his lands as were formerly the property of the crown; was to be again subject to the inconveniences of purveyance and pre-emption, the opprobrium of forest-laws, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a> of feudal-tenures; and was to resign into the king's hands all his royal franchises of waifs, wrecks, estrays, treasure-trove, mines, deadlands, forfeitures, and the like; he would find himself a greater loser than by paying his quota to such taxes as are necessary to the support of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. The thing, therefore, to be wished and aimed at in a land of liberty, is by no means the total abolition of taxes, which would draw after it very pernicious consequences, and the very supposition of which is the height of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> absurdity. For as the true idea of government and magistracy will be found to consist in this, that some few men are deputies by many others to preside over public affairs, so that individuals may the better be enabled to attend their private concerns; it is necessary that those individuals should be bound to contribute a portion of their private gains, in order to support that government, and reward that magistracy, which protects them in the enjoyment of their respective properties. But the things to be aimed at are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and moderation, not only in granting, but also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of raising, the necessary supplies; by contriving to do both in such a manner as may be most conducive to the national welfare, and at the same time most consistent with economy and the liberty of the subject; who, when properly taxed, contributes only, as was before observed, some part of his property in order to enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REST\">rest</a>.\n\nThese extraordinary grants are usually called by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> names of aids, subsidies, and supplies; and are granted by the commons of Great Britain, in parliament assembled. See Parliament and Tax.\n\nThe clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> produce of the several branches of the revenue, after all charges of collecting and management paid, amounted in the year 1786 to about \u00a35,397,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>, while the expenditure was found to be about \u00a34,477,000. How these immense sums are appropriated, is next to be considered. And this is, first and principally, to the payment of the interest of the national debt. See National Debt and Funds.\n\nThe respective produces of the several taxes were originally separate and distinct funds; being securities for the sums advanced on each several tax, and for them only. But at last it became necessary, in order to avoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, as they multiplied yearly, to reduce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these separate funds, by uniting and blending them together; superadding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of parliament for the general security of the whole. So that there are now only three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> funds of any account, the aggregate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a>, and the general fund, so called from such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> and addition; and the Southsea fund, being the produce of the taxes appropriated to pay the interest of such part of the national debt as was advanced by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> and its annuitants. Whereby the separate funds, which were thus united, are become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> securities for each other; and the whole produce of them, thus aggregated, liable to pay such interest or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a> as were formerly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> upon each distinct fund: the faith of the legislature being moreover engaged to supply any casual deficiencies.\n\nThe customs, excises, and other taxes, which are to support these funds, depending on contingencies, upon exports, imports, and consumptions, must necessarily be of a very uncertain amount; but they have always been considerably more than was sufficient to answer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> upon them. The surpluses, therefore, of the three great national funds, the aggregate, general, and Southsea funds, over and above the interest and annuities charged upon them, are directed by statute Geo. I. c. 7. to be carried together, and to attend the disposition of parliament; and are usually denominated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SINKING_FUND\">sinking fund</a>, because originally destined to sink and lower the national debt. To this have been since added many other entire duties, granted in subsequent years; and the annual interest of the sums borrowed on their respective credits is charged on, and payable out of, the produce of the sinking fund. However, the nett surpluses and savings, after all deductions paid, amount annually to a very considerable sum. For as the interest on the national debt has been at several times reduced (by the consent of the proprietors, who had their option either to lower their interest or be paid their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a>), the savings from the appropriated revenues must needs be extremely large.\n\nBut, before any part of the aggregate fund (the surpluses whereof are one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> ingredients that form the sinking fund) can be applied to diminish the principal of the public debt, it stands mortgaged by parliament to raise an annual sum for the maintenance of the king's household and the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a>. For this purpose, in the late reigns, the produce of certain branches of the excise and customs, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST_OFFICE\"><a class=\"x</a>ref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a>-office, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> on wine-licences, the revenues of the remaining crown-lands, the profits arising from courts of justice, (which articles include all the hereditary revenues of the crown), and also a clear annuity of \u00a320,000l. in money, were settled on the king for life, for the support of his majesty's household, and the honour and dignity of the crown. And, as the amount of these several branches was uncertain, (though in the last reign they were computed to have sometimes raised almost a million), if they did not rise annually to \u00a320,000l. the parliament engaged to make up the deficiency. But his present majesty having, soon after his accession, spontaneously signified his consent that his own hereditary revenues might be so disposed of as might best conduce to the utility and satisfaction of the public, and having graciously accepted a limited sum, the said hereditary and other revenues are now carried into, and made a part of, the aggregate fund; and the aggregate fund is charged with\nRevenue, the payment of the whole annuity to the crown. The limited annuity accepted by his present majesty was at first 800,000l. but it has been since augmented to 900,000l.\n\nThe expenses themselves, being put under the same care and management as the other branches of the public patrimony, produce more, and are better collected than heretofore; and the public is a gainer of upwards of 100,000l. per annum by this disinterested bounty of his majesty.\n\nThe sinking fund, though long talked of as the last resource of the nation, proved very inadequate to the purpose for which it was established. Ministers found pretences for diverting it into other channels; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the national debt proceeded slowly during the intervals of peace, whilst each succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> increased it with great rapidity. To remedy this evil, and restore the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, to which the late war had given a considerable shock, Mr Pitt conceived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for diminishing the debt by a fund, which should be rendered unalienable to any other purpose. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a> 1786, he moved that the annual surplus of the revenue above the expenditure should be raised, by additional taxes, from 900,000l. to one million sterling, and that certain commissioners should be vested with the full power of disposing of this sum in the purchase of stock (see Funds), for the public, in their own names. These commissioners should receive the annual million by quarterly payments of 250,000l., to be issued out of the exchequer before any other money, except the interest of the national debt itself; by these provisions, the fund would be secured, and no deficiencies in the national revenues could affect it, but such must be separately provided for by parliament.\n\nThe accumulated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> interest on a million yearly, together with the annuities that would fall into that fund, would, he said, in 28 years amount to such a sum as would leave a surplus of four millions annually, to be applied, if necessary, to the exigencies of the state. In appointing the commissioners, he thought, he said, endeavour to choose persons of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and character as corresponded with the importance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> they were to execute. The speaker of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of the exchequer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the rolls, the governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> governor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of England, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNTANT_GENERAL\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNTANT\">accountant</a>-general of the high court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a>, were persons who, from their several situations, he thought highly proper to be of the number.\n\nTo the principle of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> no objection was made, though several specious but ill-founded ones were urged against the sufficiency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> which the chancellor of the exchequer had adopted for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of so great and so desirable an end. He had made it a clause in his bill, that the accumulating million should never be applied but to the purchase of stock. To this clause Mr Fox objected, and moved that the commissioners therein named should be impowered to accept so much of any future loan as they should have cash belonging to the public to pay for. This, he said, would relieve that distress the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> would otherwise be under, when, on account of a war, it might be necessary to raise a new loan: whenever that should be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> was, that the minister should not only raise taxes sufficiently productive to pay the interest of the loan, but also sufficient to make good to the sinking Revenue fund whatever had been taken from it.\n\nIf, therefore, for instance, at any future period a loan of six millions was proposed, and there was at that time one million in the hands of the commissioners, in such case they should take a million of the loan, and the bonus or douceur thereupon should be received by them for the public. Thus government would only have five millions to borrow of six; and from such a mode of proceeding, he said, it was evident great benefit would arise to the public.\n\nThis clause was received by Mr Pitt with the strongest marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a>, as was likewise another, moved by Mr Pulteney, enabling the commissioners named in the bill to continue purchasing stock for the public when it is above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAR\">par</a>, unless otherwise directed by parliament. With these additional clauses the bill was read a third time on the 1st of May, and carried up to the Lords, where it also passed without meeting with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> opposition, and afterwards received the royal assent.\n\nThe operation of this bill surpassed perhaps the minister's most sanguine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. The fund was ably managed, and judiciously applied; and in 1793 the commissioners had extinguished some millions of the public debt. The war, however, in which the nation was that year involved, and which continued for eight years after that period, made it necessary to borrow additional sums, so large, that many years of peace must elapse before the operation of the fund can contribute sensibly to the relief of the people.\n\nThe clear produce of the taxes raised on the people of this country was, in the year 1792, very near 17,000,000l.; and in the year ending 5th Jan. 1806, it amounted to the enormous sum of 48,890,866l.\n\nRevenue, in hunting, a flethy lump formed chiefly by a cluster of whitish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the deer, supposed to occasion the casting of their horns by gnawing them at the root.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERBERATION\">Reverberation</a>, in Physics, the act of a body repelling or reflecting another after its impinging thereon.\n\nReverberation, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, denotes a kind of circulation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> by means of a reverberatory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>.\n\nReverberatory, or Reverberating Furnace.

In England, bishops are right reverend, and archbishops most reverend. In France, before the Revolution, their bishops, archbishops, and abbots, were all alike most reverend. In Scotland, the clergy individually are reverend, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> is very reverend, and the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> is venerable.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REVERIE\">Reverie</a>, the same with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>, raving, or distraction.

As, where a commission issues to A and B, and twelve others, or any two of them, of which A or B shall be one, to take and try indictments; and any of the other twelve proceed without the intervention or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of either A or B; in this case all proceedings, trials, convictions, and judgements, are void for want of a proper authority in the commissioners, and may be falsified upon bare inspection, without the trouble of a writ of error; it being a high misdemeanor in the judges so proceeding, and little (if anything) short of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> in them all, in case the person so attainted be executed and suffer death. So likewise if a man purchases land of another; and afterwards the vender is, either by outlawry, or his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, convicted and attainted of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELONY\">felony</a> previous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALIENATION\">alienation</a>; whereby such land becomes liable to forfeiture or escheat: now, upon any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>, the purchaser is at liberty, without bringing any writ of error, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSIFY\">falsify</a> not only the time of the felony or treason supposed, but the very point of the felony or treason itself; and is not concluded by the confession or the outlawry of the vender, though the vender himself is concluded, and not suffered now to deny the fact, which he has by confession or flight acknowledged. But if such attainder of the vender was by verdict, on the oath of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a>, the alienee cannot be received to falsify or contradict the fact of the crime committed; though he is at liberty to prove a mistake in time, or that the offence was committed after the alienation, and not before.\n\nSecondly, a judgement may be reversed, by writ of error, which lies from all inferior criminal jurisdictions to the court of king's-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>, and from the king's-bench to the house of peers; and may be brought for notorious mistakes in the judgement or other parts of the record: as where a man is found guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, and receives the judgement of felony, or for other less palpable errors; such as any irregularity, omission, or want of form in the process of outlawry, or proclamations; the want of a proper addition to the defendant's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, according to the statute of additions; for not properly naming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> or other officer of the court, or not duly describing where his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>-court was held: for laying an offence, committed in the time of the late king, to be done against the peace of the present; and for many other similar causes, which (though allowed out of tenderness to life and liberty) are not much to the credit or advancement of the national justice.\u2014These writs of error, to reverse judgements in cases of misdemeanours, are not to be allowed of course, but on sufficient probable cause shown to the attorney general; and then they are understood to be grantable of common right, and ex debito justitiae. But writs of error to reverfe attainders in capital cases are only allowed ex gratia; and not without express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> under the king's sign-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a>, or at least by the consent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">attorney-general</a>. These therefore can rarely be brought by the party himself, especially where he is attainted for an offence against the state: but they may be brought by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> or executor after his death, in more favourable times; which may be some consolation to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. But the easier and more effectual way is,\n\nLastly, to reverse the attainder by act of parliament. This may be and hath been frequently done upon motives of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>, or perhaps the zeal of the times, after a sudden revolution in the government, without examining too closely into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or validity of the errors affixed. And sometimes, though the crime be universally acknowledged and confessed, yet the merits of the criminal's family shall after his death obtain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a> in blood, honours, and estate, or some or one of them, by act of parliament; which (so far as it extends) has all the effect of reversing the attainder, without calling any reflections upon the justice of the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>. See ATTAINER.\n\nThe effect of falsifying or reverfing an outlawry is, that the party shall be in the same plight as if he had appeared upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPIAS\">capias</a>: and, if it be before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> pleaded, he shall be put to plead to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>; if, after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>, he shall receive the sentence of the law; for all the other proceedings, except only the process of outlawry for his non-appearance, remain good and effectual as before. But when judgement, pronounced upon conviction, is falsified or reverfed, all former proceedings are absolutely set aside, and the party stands as if he had never been at all accused; restored in his credit, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, his blood, and his estates: with regard to which last, though they be granted away by the crown, yet the owner may enter upon the grantee, with as little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> as he might enter upon a differer.\u2014But he still remains liable to another prosecution for the same offence: for, the first being erroneous, he never was in jeopardy thereby.\n\nREVERSE of a medal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, &c. denotes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or back side, in opposition to the head or principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>.","sp":434,"ep":439},{"h":"REVERSE","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">INVERTED</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, is when anything is set with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> downwards, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> contrary to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of standing.

There are many kinds of insects which may be revived, after all the powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> have been suspended for a considerable time. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> flies, small beetles, spiders, moths, bugs, &c., after being drowned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine, and continuing apparently dead for upwards of 15 minutes, have been restored to life merely by being thrown among wood-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> slightly warm.\n\nWhile Dr Franklin was in France, he received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a> wine from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, which had been bottled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. He found a few dead flies in some of the bottles, which he exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>; and in less than three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> these seemingly dead animals recovered life which had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> suspended. At first they appeared as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> convulsed; they then raised themselves on their legs, washed their eyes with their fore feet, dried their wings with those behind, and in a short time began to fly about.\n\nBut the most remarkable instance of revivification we have heard of, is the following. In the warmer parts of France there is an insect very pernicious to the rye, apparently beginning its operations at the root of the plant, and gradually proceeding towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>. If the plant be thoroughly dried while the insect is in the root or stem, the animal is irrecoverably killed; but after it has reached the grain, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is very different. There have been instances of these insects being brought to life in 15 minutes, by a little warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, after the grains, in which they were lodged, had been kept dry for 30 years.\n\nWhat is the metaphysician to think of these phenomena, or what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCLUSION\">conclusion</a> is he to draw from them respecting the mind? If he be a sober man he will draw no conclusion, for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, that he knows nothing of the sentient principle of insects, or of any animal but man. He is conscious that it is the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> being which in himself thinks, and wills, and feels; he knows that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his thought is not in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and part of it in another; and therefore he concludes that this thinking being is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, while <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> teaches him that it quits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, when that becomes unfit to discharge its functions, and cannot be recalled. Experience teaches him, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, that the sentient principle of these insects does not quit the system when unfit for its functions; and hence he ought to infer, that the minds of men and of insects are very different, and that the bond which unites the material and immaterial parts of an insect, is certainly different from that which unites the mind and body of man. This is the only inference which can be fairly drawn from\nReview, from these phenomena; and he who makes them the basis of materialism, must have his judgment warped by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">Commission</a> of Review, is a commission sometimes granted, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, to revise the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of delegates, when it is apprehended they have been led into a material <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>.

When 20 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he connected himself with the Oratorians, a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> order, the members of which lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> without binding themselves to the observance of any vows, and turned their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the instruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>. He afterwards taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEZENAS\">Pezenas</a>, and next at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TOULON\">Toulon</a>, which requiring some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of geometrical knowledge, he became extremely fond of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, and cultivated and improved it to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. He was, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his knowledge, invited to fill the mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGERS\">Angers</a> in 1683, and he was also elected a member of the academy, in 1694.\nHe undertook to reduce into a body, for the benefit of his pupils, the chief theories which were scattered through the works of Newton, Des Cartes, Leibnitz, Bernoulli, the Leipfie Acts, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> Academy, and several other works, to which he gave the name of Analyse Demonstr\u00e9e, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Analyse Demonstrated, which was published in 1708, in 2 vols. 4to.\n\nHe gave to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> the name of Analyse Demonstrated, because he therein demonstrates various methods which had not been demonstrated by their authors, or at least not with sufficient accuracy and perspicuity. This work of Reyneau was very much applauded, and it became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> maxim in France, that to follow him was the best, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> progress in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>.\n\nSuch was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> to be useful, that in 1714 he published his Science du Calcul des Grandeurz, intended for the benefit of such as were wholly unacquainted with the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>. Of this work a very able judge was pleased to observe, that \"though several books had already appeared upon the same subject, such a treatise as that before him was still wanting, as in it every thing was handled in a manner sufficiently extensive, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with all possible exactness and perspicuity.\" Although many branches of the mathematics had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> discussed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to his time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> good elements were to be met with, even of practical geometry.\n\nWhen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Sciences at Paris gave admission to other learned and eminent men, Father Reyneau was received into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>. The works already mentioned are all he ever published, or perhaps even composed, with the exception of a little piece upon logic; and materials for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his Science du Calcul were left behind him in manuscript. Towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> he was too much afflicted with sickness to give much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to study; and he died in 1728, at 72 years of age. His many virtues and extensive erudition made this event much regretted by all who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of being acquainted with him. It was regarded as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> by the first men in France, to number him among their friends, such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> and Malbranche, of the latter of whom Reyneau was a faithful and zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>.","sp":441,"ep":442},{"h":"REYNOLDS","t":"Sir Joshua, the celebrated painter, was, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> the 16th 1723, born at Plympton, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWN\">town</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>. His father was minister of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, and also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>-school; and being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of learning and philanthropy, he was beloved and respected by all to whom he was known.\u2014Such a man, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> naturally be supposed, was affiduous in the cultivation of the minds of his children, among whom his son Joshua shone conspicuous, by displaying at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> a superiority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of a correct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Unlike other boys, who generally content themselves with giving a literal explanation of their author, regardless of his beauties <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> his faults, young Reynolds attended to both these, displaying a happy knowledge of what he read, and entering with ardour into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of his author. He discovered likewise talents for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> propensity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, in which his friends and intimates thought him qualified to excel. Emulation was a distinguishing feature in his mind, which his father perceived with the delight natural to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>; and desiring him for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, in which he hoped that his talents might raise him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, he sent him to one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>.\n\nSoon after this period he grew passionately fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>; and, by the perusal of Richardson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of that art, was determined to make it his profession through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. At his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> request, therefore, he was removed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; and about the year 1742 became a pupil to Mr Hudson, who, though not himself an eminent painter, was preceptor to several who afterwards excelled in the art. One of the first advices which he gave to Mr Reynolds was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> carefully Guercino's drawings. This was done with such skill, that many of the copies are said to be now preserved in the cabinets of the curious as the originals of that very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nAbout the year 1749, Mr Reynolds went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> under the auspices, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> (then Commodore) Keppel, who was appointed to the command of the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>. In this garden of the world, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> seat of the arts, he failed not to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> of the great masters, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the productions of different ages, and to contemplate with unwearied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> the various beauties which are characteristic of each. His labour here, as has been observed of another painter, was \"the labour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, not the task of the hireling;\" and how much he profited by it is known to all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nHaving remained about two years in Italy, and studied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the arts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> with great success, he returned to England, improved by travel and refined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to London from the port where he landed, he accidentally found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">inn</a> where he lodged Johnston's life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">Savage</a>; and was so taken with the charms of composition, and the masterly delineation of character <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in that performance, that, having begun to read it while leaning with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> on the chimney-piece, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in that attitude insensible of pain till he was hardly able to raise his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>. The admiration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> naturally led him to seek the acquaintance of its author, who continued one of his sincerest admirers and warmest friends, till 1784, when they were separated by the stroke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.\n\nThe first thing that distinguished him after his return to his native country, was a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTRAIT\">portrait</a> of Commodore Keppel; which in the polite circles was spoken of in terms of the highest encomium, and testified to what a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of eminence he had arrived in his profession. This was followed by a portrait of Lord Edgecombe, and a few others, which at once introduced him to the first business in portrait painting; and that branch of the art he cultivated with such success as will forever establish his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> with all descriptions of refined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. Having painted some of the first-rate beauties of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the polite world flocked to see the graces and the charms of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>; and he soon became the most fashionable painter, not only in England, but in all Europe. He has indeed preserved the resemblance of so many illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, that we feel the less regret for his having left behind him so few historical\nReynolds's historical paintings; though what he has done in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> shows (a) him to have been qualified to excel in both departments. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANDSCAPE\">landscape</a>, perhaps, which he ever painted, except those beautiful and chaste ones which compose the backgrounds of many of his portraits, is \"A View on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHMOND\">Richmond</a>,\" which in 1784 was exhibited by the Society for Promoting Painting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">Design</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVERPOOL\">Liverpool</a>.\n\nIn 1764 Mr Reynolds had the merit of being the first promoter of that club, which, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> existed without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, became at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> distinguished by the appellation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITERARY\">Literary</a> Club. Upon the foundation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> Academy of Painting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">Sculpture</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">Architecture</a>, he was appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>; and his acknowledged excellence in his profession made the appointment acceptable to all the lovers of art. To add to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of this new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> conferred on the president the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a>; and Sir Joshua delivered his first discourse at the opening of the Academy on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 2, 1769. The merit of that discourse has been universally admitted among painters; but it contains some directions respecting the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of prosecuting their studies, to which every student of every art would do well to pay attention. \"I would chiefly recommend (says he), that an implicit obedience to the rules of art, as established by the practice of the great masters, should be exacted from the young students. That those models, which have passed through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of ages, should be considered by them as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFALLIBLE\">infallible</a> guides; as subjects for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>, not their criticism. I am confident, that this is the only efficacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of making a progress in the arts; and that he who sets out with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOUBTING\">doubting</a>, will find life finished before he becomes master of the rudiments. For it may be laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as a maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced them. Every opportunity, therefore should be taken to disprove that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> and vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that rules are the fetters of genius. They are fetters only to men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> genius; as that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMOUR\">armour</a> which, upon the strong, becomes an ornament and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, upon the weak and mithapen turns into a load, and cripples the body which it was made to protect.\"\n\nEach succeeding year, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> of the prizes, Sir Joshua delivered to the students a discourse of equal merit with this: and perhaps we do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> too much when we say, that, from the whole collected, the lover of belles lettres and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a> will acquire jufter notions of what is meant by taste in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, and better rules for acquiring a correct taste, than from multitudes of those volumes which have been professedly written on the subject.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> of 1783 he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a>, where he expended about 1000l. on the purchase of paintings, which, having been taken from the different monasteries and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a> and Germany, were then exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> by the command of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a>! Gainborough and he had engaged to paint each other's portrait; and the canvas for both being actually stretched, Sir Joshua gave one fitting to his distinguished rival; but, to the regret of every admirer of the art, the unexpected death of the latter prevented all further progress.\n\nIn 1790 he was anxiously desirous to procure the vacant professorship of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> in the academy for Mr Bononi, an Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>; but that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> not having been yet elected, an associate was of course no academician, and it became necessary to raise him to those situations, in order to qualify him for being a professor. Mr Gilpin being his competitor for the associateship, the numbers on the ballot proved equal, when the president by his casting vote decided the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> in favour of his friend, who was thereby advanced so far towards the professorship. Soon after this, an academic feat being vacant, Sir Joshua exerted all his influence to obtain it for Mr Bononi; but finding himself outvoted by a majority of two to one, he quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> with great dissatisfaction, and next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> sent to the secretary of the academy a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a> of the office, which for twenty-one years he had filled with honour to himself and his country. His indignation, however, subsiding,\n\n(a) As the lovers of painting may wish to have a catalogue of this great master's historical pieces, we subjoin the following from the European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, which we have good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to believe accurate, as the editors of that miscellany grudge neither trouble nor expense to procure authentic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>. Sir Joshua's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> historical pieces, then, are the following: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a> nursing Love; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENUS\">Venus</a> chastising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPID\">Cupid</a> for having learned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> accounts; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Ugolino in the dungeon; the calling of Samuel; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIADNE\">Ariadne</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANDITTI\">banditti</a>; Beggar Boy; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> in the character of St Agnes; Thais; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIONYSUS\">Dionysus</a> the Areopagite; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>; Matter Crewe in the character of Henry VIII.; the death of Dido; a Child asleep; Cupid sleeping; Covent Garden Cupid; Cupid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">Clouds</a>; Cupids painting; Boy laughing; Matter Herbert in the character of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBE\">Hebe</a>; Miss Meyer in the character of Hebe; Madonna, a head; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a>; a little boy (Samuel) praying; an old Man <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>; Love <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> the zone of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">Beauty</a>; the Children in the Wood; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEOPATRA\">Cleopatra</a> dissolving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">Pearl</a>; Garrick in the character of Kitely; Garrick between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">Tragedy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">Comedy</a>; Mrs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABINGDON\">Abingdon</a> in the character of Comedy; a Child surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">Guardian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">Angels</a>; Miss Beauclerc in the character of Spencer's Una; Resignation; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> in the character of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a>; Lady Blake in the character of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNO\">Juno</a>; Mrs Sheridan in the character of St Cecilia; Edwin, from Beattie's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINSTREL\">Minstrel</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATIVITY\">Nativity</a>, Four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Virtues, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">Faith</a>, Hope, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">Charity</a>, for the window of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> Chapel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>; the Studious Boy; a Bacchante; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Lord W.

The academicians received this intelligence with the respectful concern due to the talents and virtues of their president; and either then did enter, or designed to enter, into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to all parties, namely, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> from the whole body of the academy should wait upon him, and inform him of their wish, that the authority and privileges of the office of president might be his during his life; declaring their willingness to permit the performance of any of its duties which might be irksome to him by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>.\n\nFrom this period Sir Joshua never painted more. The last effort of his pencil was the portrait of the Honourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> James Fox, which was executed in his best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, and shows that his fancy, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and his other great powers in the art which he professed, remained unabated to the end of his life. When the last touches were given to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>,\n\n\"The hand of Reynolds fell, to rise no more.\"\n\nOn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THURSDAY\">Thursday</a> February the 23rd 1792, the world was deprived of this amiable man and excellent artist, at the age of 68 years; a man than whom no one, according to Johnson, had passed through life with more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of men and manners. The following character of him is said to be the production of Mr Burke:\n\n\"His illness was long, but borne with a mild and cheerful fortitude, without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of anything irritable or querulous, agreeably to the placid and even tenor of his whole life. He had from the beginning of his malady a distinct view of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>, which he contemplated with that entire composure which nothing but the innocence, integrity, and usefulness of his life, and an unaffected submission to the will of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, could befit. In this situation he had every consolation from family tenderness, which his tenderness to his family had always merited.\n\n\"Sir Joshua Reynolds was, on very many accounts, one of the most memorable men of his time: He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant arts to the other glories of his country. In taste, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, in facility, in happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, and in the richness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of colouring, he was equal to the greatest masters of the renowned ages. In portrait he went beyond them; for he communicated to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the art in which English artists are the most engaged, a variety, a fancy, and a dignity, derived from the higher branches, which even those who professed them in a superior manner did not always perceive when they delineated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. His portraits remind the spectator of the invention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and the amenity of landscape. In painting portraits he appears not to be raised upon that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a>, but to descend to it from a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a>. His paintings illustrate his feelings, and his feelings seem to be derived from his paintings.\n\n\"He possessed the theory as perfectly as the practice of his art. To be such a painter, he was a profound and penetrating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>.\n\n\"In full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of foreign and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> fame, admired by the expert in art, and by the learned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, courted by the great, careless by foreign powers, and celebrated by distinguished poets, his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMILITY\">humility</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, and candour, never forsook him, even on surpise or provocation; nor was the least degree of arrogance or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> visible to the most scrutinizing eye in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his conduct or discourse.\n\n\"His talents of every kind\u2014powerful from nature, and not meanly cultivated in letters\u2014his social virtues in all the relations and all the habitudes of life, rendered him the centre of a very great and unparalleled variety of agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, which will be dissipated by his death. He had too much merit not to excite some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a>, too much innocence to provoke any enmity.

However that may be, the large breed of Indian apes is at this moment held in high veneration by the Hindoos, and fed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> by the Brahmins, who seem in two or three places on the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GANGES\">Ganges</a> to have a regular endowment for the support of them: they live in tribes of three or four hundred, are wonderfully gentle (I speak as an eye <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a>), and appear to have some kind of order and subordination in their little sylvan polity.\" The festival of Rama is held on the 9th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> of Chaitra, on which the war of Lanka is dramatically represented, concluding with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of the fire-ordal, by which the victor's wife Sita gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of her consummated fidelity. Among the Hindoos there is a variety of very fine dramas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> antiquity on the story of Rama.\n\nThere are three Rhamas mentioned in the Indian mythology, who, together with Crishna, the darling god of the Indian women, are described as youths of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. The third Rama is Crishna's elder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, and is considered as the eighth Avatar (A), invested with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMANATION\">emanation</a> of his divine radiance. Like all the Avatars, Rama is painted with gemmed Ethiopic or Parthian coronets; with rays encircling his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, jewels in his ears, two necklaces, one straight and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENDANT\">pendant</a> on his bosom, with dropping gems; garlands of well-dipped many-coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, or collars of pearls, hanging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> below his waist; loose mantles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> tissue or dyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, embroidered on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMS\">hems</a> with flowers elegantly thrown over one shoulder, and folded like ribbands across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; with bracelets, two on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> and on each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a>: all the Avatars are naked to the waists, and uniformly with dark azure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLUSION\">allusion</a> probably to the tint of that primordial fluid on which Narayan moved in the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; but their skirts are bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the curious pericarpium in the centre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-lily.","sp":444,"ep":445},{"h":"RHAMNUS","t":"the Buckthorn, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the pentandria clas; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> ranking under the 43rd order Dumofia.

Here, after enumerating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, we shall introduce what has been said <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the cultivation of this valuable plant. There are five species, viz. 1. The rhaponticum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> rhubarb, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, thick, fleshy, branching, deeply-friking root, yellowish within; crowned by very large, roundish, heart-shaped smooth leaves, on thick, slightly-furrowed foot-stalks; and an upright strong stem, two or three feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, adorned with leaves singly, and terminated by thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> spikes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>. It grows in Thrace and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYTHIA\">Scythia</a>, but has been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in the English gardens. Its root affords a gentle purge. It is, however, of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to some of the following sorts; but the plant being astringent, its young stalks in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, being cut and peeled, are used for tarts. 2. The palmatum, palmated-leaved true Chinese rhubarb, hath a thick fleshy root, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> within; crowned with very large palmated leaves, being deeply divided into acuminate segments, expanded like an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; upright stems, five or six feet high or more, terminated by large spikes of flowers. This is now proved to be the true foreign rhubarb, the purgative quality of which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known. 3. The compactum, or Tartarian rhubarb, hath a large, fleshy, branched root, yellow within; crowned by very large, heart-shaped\nRHE\n\nheart-shaped somewhat lobated, sharply indented, smooth leaves, and an upright large stem, five or six feet high, garnished with leaves singly, and branching above; having all the branches terminated by nodding panicles of white flowers. This has been supposed to be the true rhubarb; which, however, though of superior quality to some sorts, is accounted inferior to the rheum palmatum.\n\n4. The undulatum, undulated, or waved-leaved Chinese rhubarb, hath a thick, branchy, deep-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-DRAINING\">draining</a> root, yellow within; crowned with large, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, undulate, somewhat hairy leaves, having equal foot-stalks, and an upright firm stem, four feet high; garnished with leaves single, and terminated by long loose spikes of white flowers.\n\n5. The Arabian ribs, or currant rhubarb of Mount Lebanon, has a thick fleathy root, very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> leaves, full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a> protuberances, and with equal foot-stalks, and upright firm stems, three or four feet high, terminated by spikes of flowers, succeeded by berry-like seeds, being surrounded by a purple pulp. All these plants are perennial in root, and the leaves and stalks are annual. The roots being thick, fleathy, generally divided, strike deep into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>; of a brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> without and yellow within; the leaves rise in the spring, generally come up in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> folded together, gradually expanding themselves, having thick foot-stalks; and grow from one to two feet high, or more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> and breadth, spreading all round; amidst them rise the flower-stems, which are garnished at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, and are of strong and expeditious growth, attaining their full height in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, when they flower; and are succeeded by large triangular seeds, ripening in August. Some plants of each sort merit culture in gardens for variety; they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> effect a singularity with their luxuriant foliage, spikes, and flowers; and as medical plants, they demand culture both for private and public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>.\n\nThey are generally propagated by seeds sown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> soon after they are ripe, or early in the spring, in any open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; remarking, those intended for medical use should generally be sowed where they are to remain, that the roots, being not disturbed by removal, may grow large. Scatter the seeds thinly, either by broadcast all over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SURFACE\">surface</a>, and raked well in; or in shallow drills a foot and half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, covering them near an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> deep. The plants will rise in the spring, but not flower till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or third year; when they, however, are come up two or three inches high, thin them to eight or ten inches, and clear out all weeds; though those designed always to stand should afterwards be hoed out to a foot and a half or two feet distance: observing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any are required for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> ground, &c., for variety, they should be transplanted where they are to remain in autumn, when their leaves decay, or early in spring, before they shoot; the others remaining where sowed, must have the ground kept clean between them; and in autumn, when the leaves and stalks decay, cut them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and slightly dig the ground between the rows of plants, repeating the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> every year. The roots remaining, they increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> annually; and in the second or third year many of them will shoot up stalks, flower, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> seeds; and in three or four years the roots will be arrived to a large size; though older roots are generally preferable for medical use.\n\nIn Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>'s Travels we have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of some curious particulars relating to the culture of rhubarb. He tells us, that the bell rhubarb grows in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a> called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONGOLIA\">Mongolia</a>, which now serves as a boundary between Russia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. The marmots contribute greatly to the culture of the rhubarb. Wherever you see 10 or 20 plants growing, you are sure of finding several burrows under the shades of their broad-spreading leaves. Perhaps they may sometimes eat the leaves and roots of this plant; however, it is probable the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> they leave about the roots contributes not a little to its increase; and their casting up the earth, makes it shoot out young buds and multiply. This plant does not run, and spread itself, like docks and others of the same species; but grows in tufts, at uncertain distances, as if the seeds had been dropped with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. It appears that the Mongols never accounted it worth cultivating; but that the world is obliged to the marmots for the quantities scattered, at random, in many parts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>: for whatever part of the ripe seed happens to be blown among the thick grass, can very seldom reach the ground, but must there wither and die; whereas, should it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> among the loose earth thrown up by the marmots, it immediately takes root, and produces a new plant.\n\nAfter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> and gathering the rhubarb, the Mongols cut the large roots into small pieces, in order to make them dry more readily. In the middle of every piece they scoop a hole, through which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> is drawn, in order to suspend them in any convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. They hang them, for the most part, about their tents, and sometimes on the horns of their sheep. This is a most pernicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, as it destroys some of the best part of the root; for all about the hole is rotten and useless, whereas, were people rightly informed how to dig and dry this plant, there would not be one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of refuse in an hundred; which would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of trouble and expense, that much diminishes the profits on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>. At present, the dealers in this article think these improvements not worthy of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, as their gains are more considerable on this than on any other branch of trade. Perhaps the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> may hereafter think it proper to make some regulations with regard to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nTwo sorts of rhubarb are met with in the shops. The first is imported from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> and Russia, in roundish pieces freed from the bark, with a hole through the middle of each; they are externally of a yellowish colour, and on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> appear variegated with lively reddish streaks. The other, which is less esteemed, comes immediately from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> Indies in length pieces, harder, heavier, and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> than the foregoing. The first sort, unless kept very dry, is apt to grow mouldy and worm-eaten; the second is less subject to these inconveniences. Some of the more industrious artists are said to fill up the worm holes with certain mixtures, and to colour the outside of the damaged pieces with powder of the finer sorts of rhubarb, and sometimes with cheaper materials: this is often so nicely done, as effectually to impose upon the buyer, unless he very carefully examines each piece.\n\nThe Turkey rhubarb is, among us, universally preferred to the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> sort, though this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is for some purposes at least equal to the other; it is manifestly more astringent, but has somewhat less of an aromatic\nRHE\n\n[796] RHE\n\naromatic flavour. Tinctures drawn from both with rectified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> have nearly the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; on distilling off the menstruum, the extract left from the tincture of the East India rhubarb proved considerably the strongest.\n\nRhubarb has been cultivated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> with considerable success, and for medical purposes is found to equal that of foreign growth, as is proved by the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for encouraging Arts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">Manufactures</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a>, who have rewarded several persons both for cultivating and curing it. In the Transactions for 1792, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> medal was adjudged to Sir William Fordyce, for raising from seed in the year 1791 upwards of 300 plants of the true rhubarb, or rheum palmatum of the London Pharmacopoeia 1788, which in the second and third weeks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> were transplanted into a deep loam, at four feet distance from each other, according to rules laid down by the society. In 1793 it was adjudged to Mr Thomas Jones, from whose papers we derive the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a>.\n\nAfter giving an accurate account of his experiments and observations, he concludes, that the season for sowing is the spring about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a>, or in autumn about August and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>; that those plants which are raised in the spring should be transplanted in autumn, and vice versa; that they cannot have too much room; that room and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> are essentially necessary to their being large, of a good appearance, and perhaps to the increase of their purgative qualities; that to effect these purposes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> must be light, loamy, and rich, but not too much so, lest the roots should be too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a>; that their situation can scarcely be too dry, as more evils are to be expected from a superabundance of moisture than any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> want of it: and lastly, we may conclude, that in particular the injuries which they are subject to are principally during their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, and to be imputed to insects and inattention to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> season; afterwards, from too great an exposure to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>: but that none can be dreaded from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; and that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> they are hardy and easy of cultivation, when arrived beyond a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>.\n\nThe method of curing rhubarb, as proposed by Dr Tirriogel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKHOLM\">Stockholm</a>, is as follows; \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> roots should be taken up till they have been planted ten years: they should be taken out of the ground either in winter, before the frost set in, or in the beginning of spring, and immediately cut into pieces, and carefully barked; let them be spread upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> for three or four days, and be frequently turned, that the juices may thicken or condense within the roots. After that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, make a hole in each piece, and put a thread through it; by which let them hang separately, either within doors, or in some sheltered shady shed. Some persons dry them in a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; they inclose the roots in clay, and make a hole in the clay, about the thickness of a goose-quill, and in this manner hang up each piece to dry separately, that the moisture may not evaporate, nor the strength of the root be weakened. But the methods which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a> follow is a bad one: they dig the roots out of the deserts where they grow, bark them, and immediately string them, and hang them round the necks of their camels, that they may dry as they travel; but this greatly lessens the medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the root.\"\n\nMr Thomas Halley of Pontefract in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a>, to whom the London Society voted the silver medal in 1793, informs us, that his father tried various experiments for curing rhubarb, as washing, brushing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKING\">baking</a>, and peeling, and he dried them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILN\">kiln</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a>, or in a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>. But of the success of all or either of these methods we have no account, owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mr Halley's father. He sent, however, to them five different specimens, which the Society acknowledges to be superior to any rhubarb hitherto cured in England, and produced to them. The roots sent, Mr Halley says, were planted about the year 1781 in a light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> soil, but were much neglected. They were taken up in the spring of 1792, and being thoroughly deprived of the adhering earth, were placed for some weeks on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of a cool warehouse; the fibres were then taken off, cut up, and dried on the flue of a greenhouse; but, from mismanagement, were entirely spoiled. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> roots were severed in small pieces, peeled clean, and thoroughly cleared of every particle of unwholesomeness. Part was separately laid in sieves, and the remainder perforated, strung, and suspended in festoons from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> of a warm kitchen. The manner of dressing consists in paring off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> coat with a sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, as thin and clean as possible, and then finishing it off by a bit of fish skin, with its own powder; which powder may be procured from the chips and small pieces, either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> or pounding it in a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>.\n\nIn the year 1794 the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAYWARD\">Hayward</a> of Hanbury, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORDSHIRE\">Oxfordshire</a>, for propagating rhubarb by offsets taken from the crowns of large plants, instead of seeds, for the purpose of bringing it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in a shorter time, which fully answered his expectations. Mr Hayward was a candidate in the year 1789 for the gold medal; but having misundertood their rules, he was not entitled to it, though with great propriety they voted to him the silver medal; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which he sent them his method of culture and cure. His method of cultivating Turkey rhubarb from seed is thus explained to the Society: \"I have usually sown the seed about the beginning of February, on a bed of good soil (if rather sandy the better), exposed to an east or west aspect, in preference to the south; observing a full sun to be prejudicial to the vegetation of the seeds, and to the plants whilst young. The seeds are best sown moderately thick (broadcast), treading them regularly in, as is usual with parsnips and other light seeds, and then raking the ground smooth. I have sometimes, when the season has been wet, made a bed for sowing the rhubarb seeds upon, about two feet thick, with new dung from the stable, covering it near one foot thick with good soil. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENT\">intent</a> of this bed is not for the sake of warmth, but solely to prevent the rising of earth-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, which, in a moist season, will frequently destroy the young crop. If the seed is good, the plants often rise too thick; if so, when they have attained six leaves they should be taken carefully up (where too close), leaving the standing crop eight or ten inches apart; those taken up may be planted at the same distance, in a fresh spot of ground, in order to furnish other plantations. When the plants in general are grown to the size that cabbage plants are usually set out for a standing crop, they are best planted where they are to remain, in beds four feet wide, one\nrow along the middle of the bed, leaving two yards distance betwixt the plants, allowing an alley between the beds about a foot wide, for conveniency of weeding the plants. In the autumn, when the decayed leaves are removed, if the shovellings of the alleys are thrown over the crowns of the plants, it will be found of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of cultivating the same plant by offsets is thus given: \"On taking up some plants the last spring, I clipped off several offsets from the heads of large plants; these I set with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIBBLE\">dibble</a> about a foot apart, in order, if I found them thrive, to remove them into other beds. On examining them in the autumn, I was surprised to see the progress they had made, and pleased to be able to furnish my beds with 49 plants in the most thriving state. Though this was my first experiment of its kind, I do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to arrogate the discovery to myself, having known it recently tried by others, but without being informed of their success. I have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to think this valuable drug will, by this method, be brought much sooner to perfection than from seed.\"\n\nHis method of curing rhubarb is thus described: \"The plants may be taken up either early in the spring, or in autumn, when the leaves are decayed, in dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> if possible, when the roots are to be cleared from dirt (without washing): let them be cut into pieces, and with a sharp knife freed from the outer coat, and exposed to the sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> for a few days, to render the outside a little dry. In order to accelerate the curing of the largest pieces, a hole may be scooped out with a penknife: these and the smaller parts are then to be strung on packthread, and hung up in a warm room (I have always had the conveniency of such a one over a baker's oven), where it is to remain till perfectly dry. Each piece may be rendered more tightly by a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a>, fixing it in a small vice during that operation: afterwards rub over it a very fine powder, which the small roots furnish in beautiful perfection, for this and every other purpose where rhubarb is required.\"\n\nIn the year 1794, too, the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">Ball</a> for his method of curing the true rhubarb, which is as follows: \"I take the roots up when I find the stalks withering or dying away, clean them from the earth with a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, cut them in small pieces of about four or five inches in breadth, and about two in depth, taking away all the bark, and make a hole in the middle, and string them on packthread, keeping every piece apart; and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, if the weather is clear and fine, I place them in the open part of the garden, on staging, erected by fixing small posts about six feet high in the ground, and six feet asunder, into which I fix <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> pegs, about a foot apart, beginning at the top; and the rhubarb being fringed crosswise on small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, I place them on these pegs; so that if it should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, I could easily remove each pole with the suspended pieces, into any covered place. I never suffer them to be out at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, as the damp at this season would be apt to mould them; and if at any time I perceive the least mark of mould, I rub it off with a dry cloth. In some of the pieces of rhubarb which I have cured this year, I have made holes about half an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> in the middle, for the free passage of air, and have found that every one of these pieces dried better than the others where no such holes were made; and likewise hung several strings in the kitchen, and never exposed them in the open air, and found them to dry exceedingly well, and much better than those in the open air. Some years since I dried a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of rhubarb on a malt-kiln, keeping up the thermometer to 80 degrees, which answered well, but I think rather dried too quick: the roots which I have cured this year are a part of the plantation of 1789, and for which the Society was so kind as to give me a medal (A).\"","sp":446,"ep":449},{"h":"RHEXIA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the octandria clasps; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> ranking with those of the 17th order, Calycanthemae.

The declivities of all the hills and mountains are planted thick with vineyards and fruit trees, and the thick wooded tops of the hills <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> a gloomy horror over the otherwise cheerful landscape. Every now and then a row of rugged hills run directly down to the shore, and dominate majestically over the lesser hills under them. On one of these great mountains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> about the middle of the Rhinegau, you meet Johannis-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERG\">Berg</a>, a village which produces some of the best Rhenish. Before this village is a pretty little rising, and near the banks of the river there is a very fine old castle, which gives unspeakable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> to the whole landscape. Indeed, in every village, you meet with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which contributes very much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> of the whole. This country is indebted for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> to this semicircular hill, which protects it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> winds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that it leaves room enough for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> his benign influences. The groves and higher slopes of the hills make excellent pastures, and produce large quantities of dung, which, in a country of this sort, is of inestimable value.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of the Rhine, opposite to the Rhinegau, is Rhinegau, exceedingly barren, and heightens the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the prospect on the other side by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> it exhibits; on this side, you hardly meet above three or four villages, and these are far distant from each other. The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between them is occupied by heaths and meadows, only here and there a thick bush affords some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, and a few corn fields among the villages enliven the gloomy landscape. The back <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> of this country is the most picturesque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it. It is formed by a narrow gullet of mountains, which diminish in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> between R\u00fcdesheim and Bingen. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">Perpendicular</a> mountains and rocks hang over the Rhine in this place, and seem to make it the dominion of eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. At a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, the Rhine seems to come out of this landscape through a hole underground; and it appears to run tediously, in order to enjoy its course through a pleasant country the longer. Amidst the darkness which covers this back ground, the celebrated Mouse towers seems to swim upon the river. In a word, there is not anything in this whole tract that does not contribute something to the beauty and magnificence of the whole; or, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> I may be permitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, to make the paradise more welcome. As you sail along the Rhine, between Mentz and Bingen, the banks of the river form an oval amphitheatre, which makes one of the richest and most picturesque landscapes to be seen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The inhabitants of these regions are some of them extremely rich, and some extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. The happy middle state is not for countries the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of which is wine; for, besides that the cultivation of the vineyard is infinitely more troublesome and expensive than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, it is subjected to revolutions, which in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> reduce the holder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to the condition of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-labourer. It is a great misfortune for this country, that, though restrained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> are, through connivance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a>, allowed to purchase as much land as they please. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> generally begins by running in debt for his vineyard; so that if it does not turn out well, he is reduced to day-labour, and the rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> extends his possessions to the great detriment of the country. There are several peasants here, who having incomes of 30,000, 50,000, or 100,000 guilders a-year, have laid aside the peasant, and assumed the wine-merchant's; but, splendid as their situation is, it does not compensate, in the eyes of the humane man, for the sight of so many poor people with which the villages swarm. In order to render a country of this kind prosperous, the state should appropriate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> to the purpose of maintaining the peasant in bad years, and giving him the assistance which his necessities, and his want of ready <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, may from time to time make convenient.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Rhinegau are a handsome and uncommonly strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of men. You see at the very first aspect that their wine gives them merry hearts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> bodies. They have a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, and a vivacity and jocoseness, which distinguishes them very much from their neighbours. You need only compare them with some of these, to be convinced that the drinker of wine excels the drinker of beer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, both in body and mind, and that the inhabitant of the south is much fitter than he who lives in the north; for though the wine-drinker may not have quite as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> as he who drinks only beer, he has better blood,\nRhinegau blood, and can bear much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. Tacitus had already observed this, in his treatise *De moribus Germanorum*. \"The large and corpulent bodies of the Germans (says he) have a great appearance, but are not made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a>.\" At that time almost all the Germans drank only water; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> drinking of wine has effected a revolution in several parts of Germany, which makes the present inhabitants of these countries very different from those described by Tacitus. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> is much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> here than the white, which made the Germans so famous in old Rome. \"It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be easily imagined (says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Reifbeck), that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONKS\">monks</a> fare particularly well in so rich a country. We made a visit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> of Erbach.

In the year 79 of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> era, the cities of Herculaneum, Pompeia, and Stabia, although at the distance of many miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, were, nevertheless, buried under the matters of these dreadful eruptions; as Bergman relates in his Treatise of the Volcanic Products. This volcanic earth is of a gray, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, or blackish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; of a loose, granular, or dusty and rough, porous or spongy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, resembling a clay hardened by fire, and then reduced to a coarse powder. It contains various heterogeneous substances mixed with it. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-SPECIFIC_GRAVITY\"><a class=\"xref\" </a>href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity is from 2500 to 2800; and it is, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, magnetic; it scarcely effervesces with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, though partially soluble in them. It easily melts per se; but its most distinguishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> is, that it hardens very suddenly when mixed with 1/4 of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of lime and water; and forms a cement, which is more durable in water than any other.\n\nAccording to Bergman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">Analysis</a>, 100 parts of it contain from 55 to 60 of siliceous earth, 20 of argillaceous, five or six of calcareous, and from 15 to 20 of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. Its effects, however, in cement may perhaps depend only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the iron which has been reduced into a particular substance by means of subterraneous fires; evident signs of which are observable in the places where it is obtained. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the slate in Henneberg, or Kennekulle in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Westergotland, should happen to get fire, the uppermost stratum, which now consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of iron and different kinds of rocks, called gruberberg in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> given of them, they might perhaps be changed partly into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> and partly into terra puzzolana.\n\nIt is evidently a martial argillaceous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, that has suffered a moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. Its hardening power arises from the dry state of the half-baked argillaceous particles, which makes them imbibe water very rapidly, and thus accelerates the defecation of the calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>; and also from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and semihomogenized state of the iron contained in it.

What is meant by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">identity</a> of substance, with qualities wholly different, it is not very easy to conceive. Perhaps the meaning may be, that our incorruptible bodies shall consist of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATERIAL\">material</a> particles with our mortal bodies, though these particles will be differently arranged to produce the different qualities. But as the particles of our present bodies are constantly changing, and as different particles compose the body at different times, a question has been put, With what set of particles shall we rise? Here a singular variety of opinions have been held. Some** Leibnitz contend, that we shall rise with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAMINA\">stamina</a> of our bodies derived from our parents; some are for rising with that set of particles which they had at birth; some with the set which they are to have at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and some with the particles which remain after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACERATION\">maceration</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; though, God knows, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> this maceration be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, they may arise with few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> no particles at all. Another query has given much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>. What if any of these particles should enter a vegetable, compose its fruit, and be eaten by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, woman, or a child? Will not a dispute, similar to that apprehended by the Sadducees about the wife of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> brothers, necessarily follow, whose particles are they to be at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>?\n\nAgainst this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, they trust that the goodness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> will take all the proper and necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>; and they even venture to point out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> in which that may be done. A foot deep of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, they observe, in two or three of the counties of England, supposing each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> to weigh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> about seven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> and a few pounds, would amply supply with material\n\n(y) These thousand years formed the happy millenium so often mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fathers; and the learned Burnet, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">Theory</a> of the Earth, has endeavoured to prove, that a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> prevailed among the Jews See MILLENIUM.\n\n(z) Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a> rose with the same body, both as to substance and qualities; because it was necessary that his person should be known and identified after his resurrection.\nRESURRECTION\n\nMaterial bodies 600,000,000 of souls for no less a space than 20,000 years; and therefore there seems to be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for the vamping up of their old materials to lodge and accommodate new souls.\n\nBut, unluckily here, the question is not about the possibility of keeping the particles of different bodies separate and distinct. The question is rather, What have the Scriptures determined on the subject? Now the Scriptures say, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> returns unto God who gave it. And should it be asked, in what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> does he refer it till the resurrection? the Scriptures reply, in the place of the dead; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> descends into the pit, is redeemed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; and the sting of death, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAST\">last</a> enemy that is to be destroyed, shall be taken away when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a> of God shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>: at which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the dead that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in their graves shall awake, shall hear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and shall come forth. There is not here so much as a word concerning the body; and therefore it was asked, with what bodies are the dead to be raised? To which it was answered, the vile body is to be changed. The body which is, is not the body which shall be; for the incorruptible must put on incorruption, and that which is mortal, put on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>.\n\nThis curious discovery of the sentiments of Scripture we owe to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAYMAN\">layman</a>, the celebrated Locke; who, in one of his controversies with the bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, came to understand what he knew not before, namely, that nowhere have the Scriptures spoken of the resurrection of the same body in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> in which it is usually conceived. The resurrection of the same person is indeed promised; and how that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> may be fulfilled, notwithstanding the constant change of the particles of the body, has been shown in another place. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">METAPHYSICS</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> III, Chap. iii.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, therefore, for the resurrection of the mortal body, have again been obliged to betake themselves to the shifts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>. It is proper, say they, that the same bodies which have been accomplices in our vices and virtues, should also share in our rewards and punishments. Now, granting they will, shall one set of particles be bound for the crimes, or be entitled to receive the rewards, of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, from its first commencement to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>? or shall every particle rise up successively, and receive its dividend of rewards and punishments for the vices and virtues that belonged to the system during the time that they were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-UNION\">union</a> with the sentient principle? and is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> that fell in defending a father to be (as is supposed in some of the eastern countries) rewarded in heaven; while the other that struck him when the son became vicious, is dismissed into torments?\n\nFinding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> supported by neither Scripture nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, they next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the ancient fathers. And they, it is confessed, are for the resurrection of the very same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>. But this notion is directly contrary to the Scriptures, which have said, that flesh and blood are not to inherit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of God.\n\nBut whatever be the bodies with which the dead are to be raised at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> resurrection, all mankind must appear in judgment, and receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> according to the deeds done in the body, without regard, so far as we know, to their actions and conduct in the middle state. After this sentence, the righteous are to enter into celestial and eternal joys, and the wicked to suffer the punishments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>. These punishments some have supposed to be everlasting; others think, that after some temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, the souls of the wicked are to be annihilated; and others imagine, that after doing purgatorial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> for a while in hell, they are to be again received into favour; inclining to explain the denunciations of the Almighty as a child would do the threatenings of his mother, or a lover the affected chiding of his mistress.","sp":429,"ep":430},{"h":"THIS MOTION MAY BE EASILY PRODUCED BY","t":"s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> may be easily produced by means of two rollers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> one of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> is rolled up, while it is unrolled from the other.\n\nSuns are attended with some more difficulty; because in them it is necessary to represent fire, proceeding from the centre to the circumference. The artifice for this purpose is as follows.\n\nOn strong paper describe a circle, equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> which you are desirous to exhibit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> even somewhat larger; then trace out on this circle two spirals, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of a line or half a line from each other, and open the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between them with a penknife, in such a manner, that the paper may be cut from the circumference, decreasing in breadth to a certain distance from the centre, fig. 74.: cut the remainder of the circle into spirals of the same kind, open and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> alternately; then cement the paper circle to a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> hoop, supported by two pieces of iron, crooking each other in its centre, and adjust the whole to a small machine, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> suffer it to revolve round its centre. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> paper circle, cut in this manner, be placed before the representation of your sun, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> behind it, as soon as it is made to move towards that side to which the convexity of the spirals is turned, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> spirals, or those which afford a passage to the light, will give, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMAGE\">image</a> of the radii or jets of fire of your sun, the appearance of fire in continual motion, as if undulating from the centre to the circumference.\n\nThe appearance of motion may be given to columns, pyramids, and globes, cut through in the manner above described, by moving in a vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> a band of paper cut through into apertures, inclined at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> rather different from that of the spirals. By these means the spectators will suppose that they see fire continually circulating and ascending along the spirals; and thus will be produced an optical illusion, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which the columns or pyramids will seem to revolve.\n\nWe have thus briefly explained the principle on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> fire-works may be imitated; and as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> may suggest to him many circumstances which may improve the representation, and render the illusion stronger, we shall not enlarge further on the subject, but shall conclude this article with a few observations on illuminated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> and drawings, which are sometimes introduced as accompaniments in these imitations of artificial fire-works.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of preparing these illuminations is thus described in Hutton's translation of Montucla's Recreations. Take some prints representing a castle, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, &c.; and having coloured them properly, cement paper to the back of them, in such a manner that they shall be only semitransparent; then, with pinking irons of different sizes, prick small holes in the places and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> where the lamps are generally placed, as along the sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WINDOWS\">windows</a>, on the cornices or balustrades, &c. But care must be taken to make these holes smaller and closer, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. With other irons of a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, cut out, in other places, some stronger lights, so as to represent fire-pots, &c. Cut out also the panes in some of the windows, and cement to the back of them transparent paper of a green or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, to represent curtains drawn before them, and concealing an illuminated apartment.\n\nWhen the print is cut in this manner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of a sort of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, strongly illuminated from the back <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, and look at it through a convex glass of a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, like that used in those small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> called optical boxes. If the rules of perspective have been properly observed in the prints, and if the lights and shades have been distributed with taste, this spectacle will be highly agreeable.\n\nBefore dismissing this subject, it may not be improper Manager to point out the most effectual means of relieving those burns, to which fire-workers are so much exposed. When the burn is first received, and before blisters arise, the best applications are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, strong spirits,","sp":212,"ep":212}]
