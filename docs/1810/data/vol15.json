But MN will be the\nleat space into which the rays will be collected, as ap-\npears by their progres represented in the figure. Now\nMN is but about half of KL; and therefore it is about\nthe 56th part of the breadth of that part of the glas\nthrough which the rays pass; which was to be shown.\n\nSince therefore each point of the object will be re-\npresented in fo large a place, and the centres of those\nplaces will be contiguous, because the points in the\nobject the rays flow from are so; it is evident, that\nthe image of an object made by such a glas must be a\nmoit confused representation, though it does not appear\nso when viewed through an eye-glas that magnifies in\na moderate degree; consequently the degree of magni-\nfying in the eye-glas must not be too great with re-\nspect to that of the object-glas, lest the confusion be-\ncome sensible.\n\nNotwithstanding this imperfection, a dioptrical te-\nlescope may be made to magnify in any given degree,\nprovided it be of sufficient length; for the greater the\nfocal diftance of the object-glas is, the lefs may be\nthe proportion which the focal diftance of the eye-glas\nmay bear to that of the object-glas, without render-\ning the image obscure. Thus, an object-glas, whose Refracting\nfocal diftance is about four feet, will admit of an eye-telescope\nglas whose focal diftance shall be little more than an inch,\nand consequently will magnify almost 48 times; to their\nbut an object-glas of 40 feet focus will admit of an eye-glas\nof only four inches focus, and will therefore\nmagnify 120 times; and an object-glas of 100 feet\nfocus will admit of an eye-glas of little more than six\ninches focus, and will therefore magnify almost 200\ntimes.\n\nThe reafon of this disproportion in their several de-\ngrees of magnifying may be explained thus: Since the\ndiameter of the spaces, into which rays flowing from\nthe several points of an object are collected, are as the\nbreadth of the object-glas, it is evident that the degree\nof confufedness in the image is as the breadth of that\nglas; for the degree of confufedness will only be as the\ndiameters or breadths of thole spaces, and not as the\nspaces themselves. Now the focal length of the eye-\nglas, that is, its power of magnifying, must be as that\ndegree; for, if it exceeds it, it will render the confufed-\nnels sensible; and therefore it must be as the breadth or\ndiameter of the object-glas. The diameter of the ob-\nject-glas, which is as the square root of its aperture\nor magnitude, must be as the square root of the power\nof magnifying in the telescope; for unless the aper-\nture itfelf be as the power of magnifying, the image\nwill want light: the square root of the power of mag-\nnifying will be as the square root of the focal diftance\nof the object-glas; and therefore the focal diftance\nof the eye-glas must be only as the square root of\nthat of the object-glas. So that in making ufe of an\nobject-glas of a longer focus, suppose, than one that\nis given, you are not obliged to apply an eye-glas of\na proportionally longer focus than what would suit\nthe given object-glas, but such a one only whose fo-\ncal diftance fhall be to the focal diftance of that which\nwill suit the given object-glas, as the square root of\nthe focal length of the object-glas you make ufe of,\nis to the square root of the focal length of the given\none.

VI. On Achromatic Telescopes.\n\nThe inconvenience of very long telescopes is so great, that different attempts have been made to remove it. Of these, the most successful have been by Dollond and Blair; and the general principles upon which these eminent opticians proceeded have been mentioned in the historical part of this article, and in the preceding section. A fuller account of Dr Blair's discovery will be seen in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh; and of Dollond's, it may be sufficient to observe, in addition to what has been already said, that the object-glasses of his telescopes are composed of three distinct lenses, two convex and one concave; of which the concave one is placed in middle, as is represented in fig. 3, where a and c show the two convex lenses, and b b the concave one, which is by the British artists placed in the middle. The two convex ones are made of London crown glass, and the middle one of white flint glass; and they are all ground to spheres of different radii, according to the refractive powers of the different kinds of glass and the intended focal distance of the object-glass of the telescope. According to Bozovich, the focal distance of the parallel rays for the concave lens is one-half, and for the convex glass one third of the combined focus. When put together, they refract the rays in the following manner. Fig 4. Let a b, a b, be two red rays of the sun's light falling parallel on the first convex lens c. Supposing there was no other lens present but that one, they would be converged into the lines b e, b e, and at last meet in the focus q. Let the lines g h, g h, represent two violet rays falling on the surface of the lens. These are also refracted, and will meet in a focus; but as they have a greater degree of refrangibility than the red rays, they must of consequence converge more by the same power of refraction in the glass, and meet sooner in a focus, suppose at r.\u2014Let now the concave lens d d be placed in such a manner as to intercept all the rays before they come to their focus. Were this lens made of the same materials, and ground to the same radius with the convex one, it would have the same power to cause the rays diverge that the former had to make them converge. In this case, the red rays would become parallel, and move on in the line o o, o o: But the concave lens, being made of flint glass, and upon a shorter radius, has a greater refractive power, and therefore they diverge a little after they come out of it; and if no third lens was interposed, they would proceed diverging in the lines o p t, o p t; but, by the interpolation of the third lens o v o, they are again made to converge, and meet in a focus somewhat more distant than the former, as at x. By the concave lens the violet rays are also refracted, and made to diverge; but having a greater degree of refrangibility, the same power of refraction makes them diverge somewhat more than the red ones; and thus, if no third lens was interposed, they would proceed in such lines as l m n, l m n. Now as the differently coloured rays fall upon the third lens with different degrees of divergence, it is plain, that the same power of refraction in that lens will operate upon them in such a manner as to bring them all together to a focus very nearly at the same point. The red rays, it is true, require the greatest power of refraction to bring them to a focus; but they fall upon the lens with the least degree of divergence. The violet rays, though they require the least power of refraction, yet have the greatest degree of divergence; and thus all meet together in the point x, or nearly so.\n\nBut, though we have hitherto supposed the refraction of the concave lens to be greater than that of the convex ones, it is easy to see how the errors occasioned by the first lens may be corrected by it, though it should have even a less power of refraction than the convex one. Thus, let a b, a b, be two rays of red light falling upon the convex lens c, and refracted into the focus q; let also g h, g h, be two violet rays converged into a focus at r; it is not necessary, in order to their convergence into a common focus at x, that the concave lens should make them diverge; it is sufficient if the glass has\nOptical Instruments has a power of dispersing the violet rays somewhat more than the red ones; and many kinds have this power of dispersing some kinds of rays, without a very great power of refraction. It is better, however, to have the object-glass composed of three lenses; because there is then another correction of the aberration by means of the third lens; and it might be impossible to find two lenses, the errors of which would exactly correct each other. It is also easy to see, that the effect may be the same whether the concave glass is a portion of the same sphere with the others or not; the effect depending upon a combination of certain circumstances, of which there is an infinite variety.\n\nBy means of this correction of the errors arising from the different refrangibility of the rays of light, it is possible to shorten refracting telescopes considerably, and yet leave them equal magnifying powers. The reason of this is, that the errors arising from the object-glass being removed, those which are occasioned by the eye-glasses are inconsiderable: for the error is always in proportion to the length of the focus in any glass; and in very long telescopes it becomes exceedingly great, being no less than 1/4th of the whole; but in glasses of a few inches focus it becomes trifling. Refracting telescopes, which go by the name of Dollond's, are therefore now constructed in the following manner. Let AB represent an object-glass composed of three lenses as above described, and converging the rays 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., to a very distant focus at x. By means of the interposed lens CD, however, they are converged to one much nearer, as at y, where an image of the object is formed. The rays diverging from thence fall upon another lens EF, where the pencils are rendered parallel, and an eye placed near that lens would see the object magnified and very distinctly. To increase the magnifying power still more, however, the pencils thus become parallel are made to fall upon another at GH; by which they are again made to converge to a distant focus: but, being intercepted by the lens IK, they are made to meet at the nearer one x; whence diverging to LM, they are again rendered parallel, and the eye at N sees the object very distinctly.\n\nFrom an inspection of the figure it is evident, that Dollond's telescope thus constructed is two telescopes combined together; the first ending with the lens EF, and the second with LM. In the first we do not perceive the object itself, but the image of it formed at y; and in the second we perceive only the image of that image formed at x. Such telescopes are nevertheless exceedingly distinct, and represent objects so clearly, as to be preferred, in viewing terrestrial things, even to reflectors. The latter indeed have greatly the advantage in their powers of magnifying, but they are much deficient in point of light. Much more light is lost by reflection than by refraction: and as in these telescopes the light must unavoidably suffer two reflections, a great deal of it is lost; nor is this loss counterbalanced by the greater aperture which these telescopes will bear, which enables them to receive a greater quantity of light than the refracting ones. The metals of reflecting telescopes also are very much subject to tarnish, and require much more dexterity to clean them than the glasses of refractors; which makes them more troublesome and expensive, though for making discoveries in the heavens they are undoubtedly the only proper instruments which have been hitherto constructed.\n\nII. The Reflecting Telescope.\n\nThe inconveniences arising from the great length of Newtonian refracting telescopes, before the discovery of the achromatic telescope, are sufficiently obvious; and these, together with the difficulties occasioned by the different refrangibility of light, induced Sir Isaac Newton to turn his attention to the subject of reflection, and endeavour to realize the ideas of himself and others concerning the possibility of constructing telescopes upon that principle.\u2014The instrument which he contrived is represented, fig. 7, where ABCD is a large tube, open at AD and closed at BC, and of a length at least equal to the distance of the focus from the metallic spherical concave speculum GH placed at the end BC. The rays EG, FH, &c., proceeding from a remote object PR, intersect one another somewhere before they enter the tube, so that EG, &c., are those that come from the lower part of the object, and FH, FH from its upper part: these rays after falling on the speculum GH, will be reflected, so as to converge and meet in mn, where they will form a perfect image of the object.\u2014But as this image cannot be seen by the spectator, they are intercepted by a small plane metallic speculum KK, intersecting the axis at an angle of 45\u00b0, by which the rays tending to mn will be reflected towards a hole LL in the side of the tube, and the image will be less distinct, because some of the rays which would otherwise fall on the concave speculum GH, are intercepted by the plane speculum: nevertheless it will appear in a considerable degree distinct, because the aperture AD of the tube, and the speculum GH are large. In the lateral hole LL is fixed a convex lens, whose focus is at S q; and therefore this lens will refract the rays that proceed from any point of the image, so as at their exit they will be parallel, and those that proceed from the extreme points S q will converge after refraction, and form an angle at O, where the eye is placed; which will see the image S q, as if it were an object through the lens LL; consequently the object will appear enlarged, inverted, bright, and distinct. In LL lenses of different convexities may be placed, which by being moved nearer to the image or farther from it, would represent the object more or less magnified, provided that the surface of the speculum GH be of a perfectly spherical figure. If, in the room of one lens LL, three lenses be disposed in the same manner with the three eye-glasses of the refracting telescope, the object will appear erect, but less distinct than when it is observed with one lens.\n\nOn account of the position of the eye in this telescope, it is extremely difficult to direct the instrument towards any object. Huygens, therefore, first thought of adding to it a small reflecting telescope, the axis of which is parallel to that of the reflector. This is called a finder or director. When the Newtonian telescope is large, and placed upon its lower end to view bodies in great altitudes, the common finder can be of no use, from the difficulty of getting the eye to the eye-piece. On this account Dr Brewster proposes (Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 478.) to bend the tube of the finder to a right angle, and place a plane mirror at the angular point, so as to throw the image above the upper part of the tube,\nthat the eye-piece of the finder may be as near as possible to the eye-piece of the telescope. The angular part, where the plain mirror is to be fixed, should be placed as near as possible to the focal image, in order that only a small part of the finder may stand above the tube; and in this way the eye can be transferred with the greatest facility from the one eye-piece to the other.\n\nThe advantages of this construction will be understood from fig. 3. Plate CCCLXXXIX, where TT is part of a Newtonian telescope, D the eye-piece, and ABC the finder. The image formed by the object-glass A is reflected upwards by the plain mirror B, placed at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the axis of the tube, and the image is viewed with the eye-glass AC. Those who have been in the habit of using the Newtonian telescope with the common finder will be sensible of the convenience resulting from this contrivance.\n\nIn order to determine the magnifying power of this telescope, it is to be considered that the plane speculum KK is of no use in this respect. Let us then suppose, that one ray proceeding from the object coincides with the axis GLIA of the lens and speculum; let bb be another ray proceeding from the lower extreme of the object, and passing through the focus I of the speculum KH: this will be reflected in the direction b'd', parallel to the axis GLA, and falling on the lens d'L'd', will be refracted to G; so that GL will be equal to Ll, and d'G=d'I. To the naked eye the object would appear under the angle Ib i=b IA; but by means of the telescope it appears under the angle d'GL=d'II=d'di; and the angle I'di is to the angle I'di : Ib : I'di; consequently the apparent magnitude by the telescope is to that by the naked eye as the distance of the focus of the speculum from the speculum, to the distance of the focus of the lens from the lens.\n\nThe following new table of the apertures and magnifying power of Newtonian telescopes is taken from the Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 480. It is founded on a Newtonian telescope constructed by Hadley, in which the focal length of the great speculum was three feet three inches, and the magnifying power 226. Its aperture varied from three and a half to four and a half inches, according to the want of brightness in the objects to be examined. The first column contains the focal length of the great speculum in feet, and the second its linear aperture in inches, and hundredths of an inch. The third and fourth columns contain Sir Isaac Newton's numbers, by means of which the apertures of any kind of reflecting telescopes may be easily computed. The fifth column contains the focal length of the eye-glasses in thousandths of an inch, and the sixth contains the magnifying power of the instrument.\n\nLet TYYT be a brass tube, in which LdD is a Gregorian metallic concave speculum, perforated in the middle at telescope X; and EF a less concave mirror, so fixed by the arm or strong wire RT, which is moveable by means of a long screw on the outside of the tube, as to be moved nearer to or farther from the larger speculum LdD, its axis being kept in the same line with that of the great one. Let AB represent a very remote object from each part of which issue pencils of rays, e.g., cd, CD, from A the upper extreme of the object, and IL, il, from the lower part B; the rays IL, CD, from the extremes crossing one another before they enter the tube. These rays falling upon the larger mirror LD, are reflected from it into the focus KH, where they form an inverted image of the object AB, as in the Newtonian telescope. From this image the rays, issuing as from an object, fall upon the small mirror EF, the centre of which is at c; so that after reflection they would meet in their foci at QQ, and there form an erect image. But since an eye at that place could see but a small part of an object, in order to bring rays from more distant parts of it into the pupil, they are intercepted by the plano-convex lens MN, by which means a smaller erect image is formed at PV, which is viewed from...\nOptical Instruments.\n\nOptical Instrument from the meniscus SS by an eye at O. This meniscus both makes the rays of each pencil parallel and magnifies the image PV. At the place of this image all the foreign rays are intercepted by the perforated partition ZZ. For the same reason the hole near the eye O is very narrow. When nearer objects are viewed by this telescope, the small speculum EF is removed to a greater distance from the larger LD, so that the second image may be always formed in PV; and this distance is to be adjusted (by means of the screw on the outside of the great tube) according to the form of the eye of the spectator. It is also necessary, that the axis of the telescope should pass through the middle of the speculum LL, and its centre, the centre of the speculum LL, and the middle of the hole X, the centres of the lenses MN, SS, and the hole near O. As the hole X in the speculum LL can reflect none of the rays issuing from the object, that part of the image which corresponds to the middle of the object must appear to the observer more dark and confused than the extreme parts of it. Besides, the speculum EF will also intercept many rays proceeding from the object; and therefore unless the aperture TT be large, the object must appear in some degree obscure.\n\nIn the best reflecting telescopes, the focus of the small mirror is never coincident with the focus of the great one, where the first image KH is formed, but a little beyond it (with respect to the eye), as at n; the consequence of which is, that the rays of the pencils will not be parallel after reflection from the small mirror, but converge so as to meet in points about Q q Q, where they would form a larger upright image than PV, if the glass R was not in their way; and this image might be viewed by means of a single eye-glass properly placed between the image and the eye; but then the field of view would be less, and consequently not so pleasant; for which reason, the glass R is still retained, to enlarge the scope or area of the field.\n\nTo find the magnifying power of this telescope, multiply the focal distance of the great mirror by the distance of the small mirror from the image next the eye, and multiply the focal distance of the small mirror by the focal distance of the eye-glass; then divide the former product by the latter, and the quotient will express the magnifying power. For a table of the apertures and powers of Gregorian telescopes, see Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 472, 473.\n\nOne great advantage of the reflecting telescope is, that it will admit of an eye-glass of a much shorter focal distance than a refracting telescope; and consequently it will magnify so much the more: for the rays are not coloured by reflection from a concave mirror, if it be ground to a true figure, as they are by passing through a convex glass, let it be ground ever so true.\n\nThe nearer an object is to the telescope, the more its pencils of rays will diverge before they fall upon the great mirror, and therefore they will be the longer of meeting in points after reflection; so that the first image KH will be formed at a greater distance from the large mirror, when the object is near the telescope, than when it is very remote. But as this image must be formed farther from the small mirror than its principal focus n, this mirror must be always set at a greater distance from the larger one, in viewing near objects, than in viewing remote ones. And this is done by turning the screw on the outside of the tube, until the small mirror be so adjusted, that the object (or rather its image) appears perfect.\n\nIn looking through any telescope towards an object, we never see the object itself, but only that image of it which is formed next the eye in the telescope. For if a man holds his finger or a stick between his bare eye and an object, it will hide part (if not the whole) of the object from his view: But if he ties a stick across the mouth of a telescope before the object-glass, it will hide no part of the imaginary object he saw through the telescope before, unless it covers the whole mouth of the tube: for all the effect will be, to make the object appear dimmer, because it intercepts part of the rays. Whereas, if he puts only a piece of wire across the inside of the tube, between the eye-glass and his eye, it will hide part of the object which he thinks he sees; which proves, that he sees not the real object, but its image. This is also confirmed by means of the small mirror EF, in the reflecting telescope, which is made of opaque metal, and stands directly between the eye and the object towards which the telescope is turned; and will hide the whole object from the eye at O, if the two glasses ZZ and SS are taken out of the tube.\n\nIf the small mirror of the preceding instrument be convex instead of concave, it is then called the Caferrian telescope. As the small mirror is in this case placed between the great speculum and its focus, a Caferrian telescope will be shorter than a Gregorian one of the same magnifying power by twice the real length of the small mirror. For a table of the apertures, &c., of this instrument, see Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 474, 475.\n\nSect. VII. On the Merits of different Microscopes and Telescopes.\n\nThe advantages arising from the use of microscopes and telescopes depend, in the first place, upon their property of magnifying the minute parts of objects, so that they can by that means be more distinctly viewed by the eye; and, secondly, upon their throwing more light into the pupil of the eye than what is done without them. The advantages arising from the magnifying power would be extremely limited, if they were not also accompanied by the latter: for if the same quantity of light is spread over a large portion of surface, it becomes proportionally diminished in force; and therefore the objects, though magnified, appear proportionally dim. Thus, though any magnifying glass should enlarge the diameter of the object 10 times, and consequently magnify the surface 100 times, yet if the focal distance of the glass was about eight inches (provided this was possible), and its diameter only about the size of the pupil of the eye, the object would appear 100 times more dim when we looked through the glass, than when we beheld it with our naked eyes; and this, even on supposition that the glass transmitted all the light which fell upon it, which no glass can do. But if the focal distance of the glass was only four inches, though its diameter remained as before, the inconvenience would be vastly diminished, because the glass could then\nthen be placed twice as near the object as before, and consequently would receive four times as many rays as in the former case, and therefore we would see it much brighter than before. Going on thus, still diminishing the focal distance of the glass, and keeping its diameter as large as possible, we will perceive the object more and more magnified, and at the same time very distinct and bright. It is evident, however, that with regard to optical instruments of the microscopic kind, we must sooner or later arrive at a limit which cannot be passed. This limit is formed by the following particulars. 1. The quantity of light lost in passing through the glass. 2. The diminution of the glass itself, by which it receives only a small quantity of rays. 3. The extreme shortness of the focal distance of great magnifiers, whereby the free access of the light to the object which we wish to view is impeded, and consequently the reflection of the light from it is weakened. 4. The aberrations of the rays, occasioned by their different refrangibility.\n\nTo understand this more fully, as well as to see how far these obstacles can be removed, let us suppose the lens made of such a dull kind of glass that it transmits only one half of the light which falls upon it. It is evident that such a glass, of four inches focal distance, and which magnifies the diameter of an object twice, still supposing its own breadth equal to that of the pupil of the eye, will show it four times magnified in surface, but only half as bright as if it was seen by the naked eye at the usual distance; for the light which falls upon the eye from the object at eight inches distance, and likewise the surface of the object in its natural size, being both represented by 1, the surface of the magnified object will be 4, and the light which makes that magnified object visible only 2: because though the glass receives four times as much light as the naked eye does at the usual distance of distinct vision, yet one half is lost in passing through the glass. The inconvenience in this respect can therefore be removed only as far as it is possible to increase the clearness of the glass, so that it shall transmit nearly all the rays which fall upon it; and how far this can be done, hath not yet been ascertained.\n\nThe second obstacle to the perfection of microscopic glasses is the small size of great magnifiers, by which, notwithstanding their near approach to the object, they receive a smaller quantity of rays than might be expected. Thus, suppose a glass of only 1/8th of an inch focal distance; such a glass would increase the visible diameter 80 times, and the surface 6400 times. If the breadth of the glass could at the same time be preserved as great as that of the pupil of the eye, which we shall suppose 1/8th of an inch, the object would appear magnified 6400 times, at the same time that every part of it would be as bright as it appears to the naked eye. But if we suppose that this magnifying glass is only 1/8th of an inch in diameter, it will then only receive 1/4th of the light which otherwise would have fallen upon it; and therefore, instead of communicating to the magnified object a quantity of illumination equal to 6400, it would communicate only one equal to 1600, and the magnified object would appear four times as dim as it does to the naked eye. This inconvenience, however, is still capable of being removed, not indeed by increasing the diameter of the lens, because this must be in proportion to its focal distance, but by throwing a greater quantity of light on the object. Thus, in the above-mentioned example, if four times the quantity of light which naturally falls upon it could be thrown upon the object, it is plain that the reflection from it would be four times as great as in the natural way; and consequently the magnified image, at the same time that it was as many times magnified as before, would be as bright as when seen by the naked eye. In transparent objects this can be done very effectually by a concave speculum, as in the reflecting microscope already described; but in opaque objects the case is somewhat more doubtful; neither do the contrivances for viewing these objects seem entirely to make up for the deficiencies of the light from the smallness of the lens and shortness of the focus.\n\nWhen a microscopic lens magnifies the diameter of an object forty times, it hath then the utmost possible magnifying power, without diminishing the natural brightness of the object.\n\nThe third obstacle arises from the shortness of the focal distance in large magnifiers; but in transparent objects, where a sufficient quantity of light is thrown on the object from below, the inconvenience arises at last from straining the eye, which must be placed nearer the glass than it can well bear; and this entirely supercedes the use of magnifiers beyond a certain degree.\n\nThe fourth obstacle arises from the different refrangibility of the rays of light, and which frequently causes such a deviation from truth in the appearances of things that many people have imagined themselves to have made surprising discoveries, and have even published them to the world; when in fact they have been only as many optical deceptions, owing to the unequal refractions of the rays. For this there seems to be no remedy, except the introduction of achromatic glasses into microscopes as well as telescopes. How far this is practicable, hath not yet been tried; but when these glasses shall be introduced (if such introduction is practicable,) microscopes will then undoubtedly have received their ultimate degree of perfection.\n\nWith regard to telescopes, those of the refracting kind have evidently the advantage of all others, where Blair's the aperture is equal, and the aberrations of the rays refracting are corrected according to Mr Dollond's method; because the image is not only more perfect, but a much greater quantity of light is transmitted than what can be reflected from the best materials hitherto known. Unluckily, however, the imperfections of the glass set a limit to these telescopes, as has been already observed, so that they cannot be made above three feet and a half long. On the whole, therefore, the reflecting telescopes are preferable in this respect, that they may be made of dimensions greatly superior; by which means they can both magnify to a greater degree, and at the same time throw much more light into the eye.\n\nWith regard to the powers of telescopes, however, they are all of them exceedingly less than what we would be apt to imagine from the number of times which they magnify the object. Thus, when we hear of a telescope which magnifies 200 times, we are apt to imagine, that, on looking at any distant object through it, we should perceive it as distinctly as we would with our naked eye at the 200th part of the\nThe best method of trying the goodness of any telescope is to observe how much farther off you are able to read with it than with the naked eye. But that all deception may be avoided, it is proper to choose something to be read where the imagination cannot give any assistance, such as a table of logarithms, or something which consists entirely of figures; and hence the truly useful power of the telescope is easily known. In this way Mr Short's large telescope, which magnifies the diameter of objects 1200 times, is yet unable to afford sufficient light for reading at more than 200 times the distance at which we can read with our naked eye.\n\nWith regard to the form of reflecting telescopes, it is now pretty generally agreed, that when the Gregorian ones are well constructed, they have the advantage of those of the Newtonian form. One advantage evident at first sight is, that with the Gregorian telescope an object is perceived by looking directly through it, and consequently is found with much greater ease than in the Newtonian telescope, where we must look into the side. The unavoidable imperfection of the specula common to both, also gives the Gregorian an advantage over the Newtonian form. Notwithstanding the utmost care and labour of the workmen, it is found impossible to give the metals either a perfectly spherical or a perfectly parabolical form. Hence arises some indistinctness of the image formed by the great speculum, which is frequently corrected by the little one, provided they are properly matched. But if this is not done, the error will be made much worse; and hence many of the Gregorian telescopes are far inferior to the Newtonian ones; namely, when the specula have not been properly adapted to each other. There is no method by which the workman can know the specula which will fit one another without a trial; and therefore it is necessary to have many specula ready made of each sort, that in fitting up a telescope those may be chosen which best suit each other.\n\nThe brightness of any object seen through a telescope, in comparison with its brightness when seen by the naked eye, may in all cases be easily found by the following formula. Let \\( n \\) represent the natural distance at which an object can be distinctly seen; and let \\( d \\) represent its distance from the object-glass of the instrument. Let \\( m \\) be the magnifying power of the instrument; that is, let the visual angle subtended at the eye by the object when at the distance \\( n \\), and viewed without the instrument, be to the visual angle produced by the instrument as \\( r \\) to \\( m \\). Let \\( a \\) be the diameter of the object-glass, and \\( p \\) that of the pupil. Let the instrument be so constructed, that no parts of the pencils are intercepted for want of sufficient apertures of the intermediate glasses. Lastly, let the light lost in reflection or refraction be neglected.\n\nThe brightness of vision through the instrument will be expressed by the fraction \\( \\frac{a^2}{mpd^2} \\), the brightness of natural vision being 1. But although this fraction may exceed unity, the vision through the instrument will not be brighter than natural vision. For, when this is the case, the pupil does not receive all the light transmitted through the infranument.\n\nIn microscopes, \\( n \\) is the nearest limits of distinct vision, nearly seven inches. But a difference in this circumstance, arising from a difference in the eye, makes no change in the formula, because \\( m \\) changes in the same proportion with \\( n \\).\n\nIn telescopes \\( n \\) and \\( d \\) may be reckoned equal, and the formula becomes \\( \\frac{a^2}{mp^2} \\).\n\n**Sect. VIII. Apparatus for Measuring the Intensity of Light.**\n\nThat some luminous bodies give a stronger, and others a weaker light, and that some reflect more light than others, was always known; but no person before M. Bouguer, hit upon a tolerable method of ascertaining the proportion that two or more lights bear to one another. The methods he most commonly used were the following:\n\nHe took two pieces of wood or pasteboard EC and CD, in which he made two equal holes P and Q, over which he drew pieces of oiled or white paper. Upon these holes he contrived that the light of the different bodies he was comparing should fall; while he placed a third piece of pasteboard FC, so as to prevent the two lights from mixing with one another. Then placing himself sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other, but generally on the opposite side of this instrument, with respect to the light, he altered their position till the papers in the two holes appeared to be equally enlightened. This being done, he computed the proportion of their light by the squares of the distances at which the luminous bodies were placed from the objects. If, for instance, the distances were as three and nine, he concluded that the lights they gave were as nine and eighty-one. Where any light was very faint, he sometimes made use of lenses, in order to condense it; and he enclosed them in tubes or not as his particular application of them required.\n\nTo measure the intensity of light proceeding from the heavenly bodies, or reflected from any part of the sky, he contrived an instrument which resembles a kind of portable camera obscura. He had two tubes, of which the inner was black, fastened at their lower extremities by a hinge C. At the bottom of these tubes Fig. 5: were two holes, R and S, three or four lines in diameter, covered with two pieces of fine white paper. The two other extremities had each of them a circular aperture, an inch in diameter; and one of the tubes consisted of two, one of them sliding into the other, which produced the same effect as varying the aperture at the end. When this instrument is used, the observer has his head, and the end of the instrument C, so covered, that no light can fall upon his eye, besides that which comes through the two holes S and R, while an assistant manages the instrument, and draws out or shortens the tube DE, as the observer directs. When the two holes appear equally illuminated, the intensity of the lights is judged to be inversely as the squares of the tubes.\n\nIn using this instrument, it is necessary that the object should subtend an angle larger than the aperture A.\nApparatus or D, seen from the other end of the tube; for, otherwise, the lengthening of the tube has no effect. To avoid, in this case, making the instrument of an inconvenient length, or making the aperture D too narrow, he has recourse to another expedient. He constructs an instrument, represented (fig. 6.), consisting of two object-glasses, A.F. and D.F., exactly equal, fixed in the ends of two tubes six or seven feet, or, in some cases, ten or twelve feet long, and having their foci at the other ends. At the bottoms of these tubes B, are two holes, three or four lines in diameter, covered with a piece of white paper; and this instrument is used exactly like the former.\n\nIf the two objects to be observed by this instrument be not equally luminous, the light that issues from them must be reduced to an equality, by diminishing the aperture of one of the object-glasses; and then the remaining surface of the two glasses will give the proportion of their lights. But for this purpose, the central parts of the glass must be covered in the same proportion with the parts near the circumference, leaving the aperture such as is represented (fig. 7.), because the middle part of the glass is thicker and less transparent than the rest.\n\nIf all the objects to be observed lie nearly in the same direction, Bouguer remarks, that these two long tubes may be reduced into one, the two object-glasses being placed close together, and one eye-glass sufficing for them both. The instrument will then be the same with that of which he published an account in 1748, and which he called a heliometer, or goniometer.\n\nIt is not, however, the absolute quantity, but only the intensity of the light, that is measured by these two instruments, or the number of rays, in proportion to the surface of the luminous body; and it is of great importance that these two things be distinguished. The intensity of light may be very great, when the quantity, and its power of illuminating other bodies, may be very small, on account of the smallness of its surface; or the contrary may be the case, when the surface is large.\n\nHaving explained these methods which M. Bouguer took to measure the different proportions of light, we shall subjoin a few examples of his application of them.\n\nIt is observable, that when a person stands in a place where there is a strong light, he cannot distinguish objects that are placed in the shade; nor can he see anything upon going immediately into a place where there is very little light. It is plain, therefore, that the action of a strong light upon the eye, and also the impression which it leaves upon it, makes it insensible to the effect of a weaker light. M. Bouguer had the curiosity to endeavour to ascertain the proportion between the intensities of the two lights in this case; and by throwing the light of two equal candles upon a board, he found that the shadow made by intercepting the light of one of them, could not be perceived by his eye, upon the place enlightened by the other, at little more than eight times the distance; from whence he concluded, that when one light is eight times eight, or sixty-four times less than another, its presence or absence will not be perceived. He allows, however, that the effect may be different on different eyes; and supposes that the boundaries in this case, with respect to different persons, may lie between 60 and 80.\n\nApplying the two tubes of his instrument, mentioned above, to measure the intensity of the light reflected from different parts of the sky; he found that when the sun was 25 degrees high, the light was four times stronger at the distance of eight or nine degrees from his body, than it was at 31 or 32 degrees. But what struck him most was to find, that when the sun is 15 or 20 degrees high, the light decreases on the same parallel to the horizon to 110 or 120 degrees, and then increases again to the place exactly opposite to the sun.\n\nThe light of the sun, our author observes, is too strong, and that of the stars too weak, to determine the variation of their light at different altitudes: but as, in both cases, it must be in the same proportion with the diminution of the light of the moon in the same circumstances, he made his observations on that luminary, and found, that its light at 19\u00b0 16', is to its light at 66\u00b0 11', as 1681 to 2300; that is, the one is nearly two thirds of the other. He chose those particular altitudes, because they are those of the sun at the two solstices at latitude of Croissic, where he then resided. When one limb of the moon touched the horizon of the sea, its light was 2000 at different times less than at the altitude of 66\u00b0 11'. But this proportion he acknowledges must be subject to many variations, the atmosphere near the earth varying so much in its density. From this observation he concludes, that at a medium light is diminished in the proportion of about 2500 to 1681, in traversing 7469 toises of dense air.\n\nM. Bouguer also applied his instrument to the different parts of the sun's disk, and found that the centre is considerably more luminous than the extremities of the disk of the sun. As near as he could make the observation, it was more luminous than a part of the disk of the planets, the semidiameter from it, in the proportion of 35 to 28; which, as he observes, is more than in the proportion of the fines of the angles of obliquity. On the other hand, he observes, that both the primary and secondary planets are more luminous at their edges than near their centres.\n\nThe comparison of the light of the sun and moon is a subject that has frequently exercised the thoughts of philosophers; but we find nothing but random conjectures, before Bouguer applied his accurate measures in this case. In general, the light of the moon is imagined to bear a much greater proportion to that of the sun than it really does; and not only are the imaginations of the vulgar, but those of philosophers also, imposed upon with respect to it. It was a great surprize to M. de la Hire to find that he could not, by the help of any burning mirror, collect the beams of the moon in a sufficient quantity to produce the least sensible heat. Other philosophers have since made the like attempts with mirrors of greater power, though without any greater success; but this will not surprize us, when we see the result of M. Bouguer's observations on this subject.\n\nIn order to solve this curious problem concerning the comparison of the light of the sun and moon, he compared each of them to that of a candle in a dark room, one in the day-time, and the other in the night following, the light of the moon.\nApparatus ing, when the moon was at her mean distance from the earth; and, after many trials, he concluded that the light of the sun is about 300,000 times greater than that of the moon; which is such a disproportion, that, as he observes, it can be no wonder that philosophers have had so little success in their attempts to collect the light of the moon with burning glasses. For the largest of them will not increase the light 1000 times; which will still leave the light of the moon, in the focus of the mirror, 300 times less than the intensity of the common light of the sun.\n\nTo this account of the proportion of light which we actually receive from the moon, it cannot be displeasing to the reader, if we compare it with the quantity which would have been transmitted to us from that opaque body, if it reflected all the light it receives. Dr Smith thought that he had proved, from two different considerations, that the light of the full moon would be to our day-light as 1 to about 90,900, if no rays were lost at the moon.\n\nIn the first place, he supposes that the moon enlightened by the sun, is as luminous as the clouds are at a medium. He therefore supposed the light of the sun to be equal to that of a whole hemisphere of clouds, or as many moons as would cover the surface of the heavens. But on this Dr Priestley observes, that it is true, the light of the sun shining perpendicularly upon any surface would be equal to the light reflected from the whole hemisphere, if every part reflected all the light that fell upon it; but the light that would in fact be received from the whole hemisphere (part of it being received obliquely) would be only one-half as much as would be received from the whole hemisphere, if every part of it shone directly upon the surface to be illuminated.\n\nIn his Remarks, par. 97. Dr Smith demonstrates his method of calculation in the following manner:\n\n\"Let the little circle cfdg represent the moon's body half enlightened by the sun, and the great circle ab, a spherical shell concentric to the moon, and touching the earth; ab, any diameter of that shell perpendicular to a great circle of the moon's body, represented by its diameter cd; e the place of the shell receiving full moon light from the bright hemisphere fdg. Now, because the surface of the moon is rough like that of the earth, we may allow that the sun's rays, incident upon any small part of it, with any obliquity, are reflected from it every way alike, as if they were emitted. And therefore, if the segment df shone alone, the points a, e would be equally illuminated by it; and likewise if the remaining bright segment dg shone alone, the points b e would be equally illuminated by it. Consequently, if the light at the point a was increased by the light at b, it would become equal to the full moon light at e. And conceiving the same transfer to be made from every point of the hemispherical surface hbi k to their opposite points in the hemisphere kaeh, the former hemisphere would be left quite dark, and the latter would be uniformly illuminated with full moon light; arising from a quantity of the sun's light, which immediately before its incidence on the moon, would uniformly illuminate a circular plane equal to a great circle of her body, called her disk. Therefore the quantities of light being the same upon both surfaces, the density of the sun's incident light is to the density of full moon light, as that hemispherical surface hek is to the said disk; that is, as any other hemispherical surface whose centre is at the eye, to that part of it which the moon's disk appears to possess very nearly, because it subtends but a small angle at the eye: that is, as radius of the hemisphere to the verified fine of the moon's apparent femidiameter, or as 10,000,000 to 1106; or as 90,400 to 15; taking the moon's mean horizontal diameter to be 16' 7''.\n\n\"Strictly speaking, this rule compares moon light at the earth with day light at the moon; the medium of which, at her quadratures, is the same as our day-light; but is less at her full in the duplicate ratio of 365 to 366, or thereabout, that is, of the sun's distances from the earth and full moon; and therefore full moon light would be to our day-light as about 1 to 90,900, if no rays were lost at the moon.\n\n\"Secondly, I lay that full moon light is to any other moon light as the whole disk of the moon to the part that appears enlightened, considered upon a plane surface. For now let the earth be at b, and let dl be Fig. 9, perpendicular to fg, and gm to cd: then it is plain, that gl is equal to dm; and that gl is equal to a perpendicular section of the sun's rays incident upon the arch dg which at b appears equal to dm; the eye being unable to distinguish the unequal distances of its parts. In like manner, conceiving the moon's surface to consist of innumerable physical circles parallel to ef dg, as represented at A, the same reason holds for every one of these circles as for ef dg. It follows then, that the bright part of the surface visible at b, when reduced to a flat as represented at B, by the crescent pdqmp, will be equal and similar to a perpendicular section of all the rays incident on that part, represented at C by the crescent psglp. Now the whole disk being in proportion to this crescent, as the quantities of light incident upon them; and the light falling upon every rough particle, being equally rarefied in diverging to the eye at b, considered as equidistant from them all; it follows, that full moon light is to this moon light as the whole disk pdq to the crescent pdqmp.\n\n\"Therefore, by compounding this ratio with that in the former remark, day light is to moon light as the surface of an hemisphere whose centre is at the eye, to the part of that surface which appears to be possessed by the enlightened part of the moon.\"\n\nMr Michell made his computation in a much more simple and easy manner, and in which there is much less danger of falling into any mistake. Considering the distance of the moon from the sun, and that the density of the light must decrease in the proportion of the square of that distance, he calculated the density of the sun's light, at that distance, in proportion to its density at the surface of the sun; and in this manner he found, that if the moon reflected all the light it receives from the sun, it would only be the 45,000th part of the light we receive from the greater luminary. Admitting, therefore, that moon light is only a 300,000th part of the light of the sun, Mr Michell concludes, that it reflects no more than between the 6th and 7th part of what falls upon it.\n\nCount Rumford, has constructed a photometer, in which the shadows, instead of being thrown upon a photometer paper spread out upon the wainscot, or side of the room, are projected upon the inside of the back part of\nApparatus of a wooden box \\(7\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches wide, \\(10\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches long, and \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches deep, in the clear. The light is admitted into it through two horizontal tubes in the front, placed so as to form an angle of \\(6^\\circ\\); their axes meeting at the centre of the field of the instrument. In the middle of the front of the box, between these two tubes, is an opening through which is viewed the field of the photometer (see fig. 5). This field is formed of a piece of white paper, which is not fastened immediately upon the inside of the back of the box, but is pasted upon a final pane of very fine ground glass; and this glass, thus covered, is let down into a groove, made to receive it, in the back of the box. The whole inside of the box, except the field of the instrument, is painted of a deep black dead colour.\n\nTo the under part of the box is fitted a bail and socket, by which it is attached to a stand which supports it; and the top or lid of it is fitted with hinges, in order that the box may be laid quite open, as often as it is necessary to alter any part of the machinery it contains.\n\nThe count had found it very inconvenient to compare two shadows projected by the same cylinder, as these were either necessarily too far from each other to be compared with certainty, or, when they were nearer, were in part hid from the eye by the cylinder. To remedy this inconvenience, he now makes use of two cylinders, which are placed perpendicularly in the bottom of the box just described, in a line parallel to the back part of it, distant from this back \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, and from each other \\(3\\) inches, measuring from the centres of the cylinders; when the two lights made use of in the experiment are properly placed, these two cylinders project four shadows upon the white paper upon the inside of the back part of the box, or the field of the instrument; two of which shadows are in contact, precisely in the middle of that field, and it is these two alone that are to be attended to. To prevent the attention being distracted by the presence of unnecessary objects, the two outside shadows are made to disappear; which is done by rendering the field of the instrument so narrow, that they fall without it, upon a blackened surface, upon which they are not visible. If the cylinders be each \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch in diameter, and \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches in height, it will be quite sufficient that the field be \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches wide; and as an unnecessary height of the field is not only useless, but disadvantageous, as a large surface of white paper not covered by the shadows produces too strong a glare of light, the field ought not to be more than \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch higher than the tops of the cylinders. That its dimensions, however, may be occasionally augmented, the covered glass should be made \\(5\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches long, and as wide as the box is deep, viz. \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches; since the field of the instrument can be reduced to its proper size by a screen of black plateboard, interposed before the anterior surface of this covered glass, and resting immediately upon it. A hole in this plateboard, in the form of an oblong square, \\(1\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch wide, and two inches high, determines the dimensions, and forms the boundaries of the field. This screen should be large enough to cover the whole inside of the back of the box, and it may be fixed in its place by means of grooves in the sides of the box, into which it may be made to enter. The position of the opening above-mentioned is determined by the height of the cylinders; the top of it being \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch higher than the tops of the cylinders; and as the height of it is only two inches, while the height of the cylinders is \\(2\\frac{1}{8}\\) inches, it is evident that the shadows of the lower parts of the cylinders do not enter the field. No inconvenience arises from that circumstance; on the contrary, several advantages are derived from that arrangement.\n\nThat the lights may be placed with facility and precision, a fine black line is drawn through the middle of the field, from the top to the bottom of it, and another (horizontal) line at right angles to it, at the height of the top of the cylinders. When the tops of the shadows touch this last mentioned line, the lights are at a proper height; and farther, when the two shadows are in contact with each other in the middle of the field, the lights are then in their proper directions.\n\nWe have said that the cylinders, by which the shadows are projected, are placed perpendicularly in the bottom of the box; but as the diameters of the shadows of these cylinders vary in some degree, in proportion as the lights are broader or narrower, and as they are brought nearer to or removed farther from the photometer, in order to be able in all cases to bring these shadows to be of the same diameter, which is very advantageous, in order to judge with greater facility and certainty when they are of the same density, the count renders the cylinders moveable about their axes, and adds to each a vertical wing \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch wide, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch thick, and of equal height with the cylinder itself, and firmly fixed to it from the top to the bottom. This wing commonly lies in the middle of the shadow of the cylinder, and as long as it remains in that situation it has no effect whatever; but when it is necessary that the diameter of one of the shadows be increased, the corresponding cylinder is moved about its axis, till the wing just described, emerging out of the shadow, and intercepting a portion of light, brings the shadow projected upon the field of the instrument to be of the width or diameter required. In this operation it is always necessary to turn the cylinder outwards, or in such a manner that the augmentation of the width of the shadow may take place on that side of it which is opposite to the shadow corresponding to the other light. The necessity for that precaution will appear evident to any one who has a just idea of the instrument in question, and of the manner of making use of it. They are turned likewise without opening the box, by taking hold of the ends of their axes, which project below its bottom.\n\nAs it is absolutely necessary that the cylinders should constantly remain precisely perpendicular to the bottom of the box, or parallel to each other, it will be best to construct them of brass; and, instead of fixing them immediately to the bottom of the box (which, being of wood, may warp), to fix them to a strong thick piece of well-hammered plate brass; which plate of brass may be afterwards fastened to the bottom of the box by means of one strong screw. In this manner two of the count's best instruments are constructed; and, in order to secure the cylinders still more firmly in their vertical positions, they are furnished with broad flat rings, or projections, where they rest upon the brass plate; which rings are \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch thick, and equal in diameter to the projection of the wing of the cylinder, to the bottom of which they afford a firm support. These cylinders are likewise forcibly pushed, or rather pulled, against\nApparatus against the brass plate upon which they rest, by means of compressed spiral springs placed between the under side of that plate and the lower ends of the cylinders.\n\nOf whatever material the cylinders be constructed, and whatever be their forms or dimensions, it is absolutely necessary that they, as well as every other part of the photometer, except the field, should be well painted of a deep black dead colour.\n\nIn order to move the lights to and from the photometer with greater ease and precision, the observer should provide two long and narrow, but very strong and steady, tables; in the middle of each of which there is a straight groove, in which a sliding carriage, upon which the light is placed, is drawn along by means of a cord which is fastened to it before and behind, and which, passing over pulleys at each end of the table, goes round a cylinder; which cylinder is furnished with a wheel, and is so placed, near the end of the table adjoining the photometer, that the observer can turn it about, without taking his eye from the field of the instrument.\n\nMany advantages are derived from this arrangement: First, the observer can move the lights as he finds necessary, without the help of an assistant, and even without removing his eye from the shadows; secondly, each light is always precisely in the line of direction in which it ought to be, in order that the shadows may be in contact in the middle of the vertical plane of the photometer; and, thirdly, the sliding motion of the lights being perfectly soft and gentle, that motion produces little or no effect upon the lights themselves, either to increase or diminish their brilliancy.\n\nThese tables must be placed at an angle of 60 degrees from each other, and in such a situation, with respect to the photometer, that lines drawn through their middles, in the direction of their lengths, meet in a point exactly under the middle of the vertical plane or field of the photometer, and from that point the distances of the lights are measured; the sides of the tables being divided into English inches, and a vernier, showing tenths of inches, being fixed to each of the sliding carriages upon which the lights are placed, and which are so contrived that they may be raised or lowered at pleasure; so that the lights may be always in a horizontal line with the tops of the cylinders of the photometer.\n\nIn order that the two long and narrow tables or platforms, just described, may remain immovable in their proper positions, they are both firmly fixed to the stand which supports the photometer; and, in order that the motion of the carriages which carry the lights may be as soft and gentle as possible, they are made to slide upon parallel brass wires, 9 inches apart, about 1/4 of an inch in diameter, and well polished, which are stretched out upon the tables from one end to the other.\n\nThe structure of the apparatus will be clearly understood by a bare inspection of Plate CCCCLXXXIX.\n\nFig. 5. is a plan of the inside of the box, and the adjoining parts of the photometer. Fig. 6. Plan of the two tables belonging to the photometer. Fig. 7. The box of the photometer on its stand. Fig. 8. Elevation of the photometer, with one of the tables and carriages.\n\nHaving sufficiently explained all the essential parts of this photometer, it remains for us to give some account of the precautions necessary to be observed in using it. And, first, with respect to the distance at which lights, whose intensities are to be compared, should be placed from the field of the instrument, the ingenious and accurate inventor found, that when the weakest of the lights in question is about as strong as a common wax candle, that light may most advantageously be placed from 30 to 36 inches from the centre of the field; and when it is weaker or stronger, proportionally nearer or farther off. When the lights are too near, the shadows will not be well defined; and when they are too far off, they will be too weak.\n\nIt will greatly facilitate the calculations necessary in drawing conclusions from experiments of this kind, if some steady light, of a proper degree of strength for that purpose, be assumed as a standard by which all others may be compared. Our author found a good Argand's lamp much preferable for this purpose to any other lamp or candle whatever. As it appears, he says, from a number of experiments, that the quantity of light emitted by a lamp, which burns in the same manner with a clear flame, and without smoke, is in all cases as the quantity of oil consumed, there is much reason to suppose, that, if the Argand's lamp be so adjusted as always to consume a given quantity of oil in a given time, it may then be depended on as a just standard of light.\n\nIn order to abridge the calculation necessary in these inquiries, it will always be advantageous to place the standard-lamp at the distance of 100 inches from the photometer, and to assume the intensity of its light at its source equal to unity; in this case (calling this standard light A), the intensity of the light at its source \\(= x = 1\\), and the distance of the lamp from the field of the photometer \\(= m = 100\\); the intensity of the illumination at the field of the photometer \\(\\left(=\\frac{x}{m^2}\\right)\\) will be expressed by the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{10000}\\); and the relative intensity of any other light which is compared with it, may be found by the following proportion: Calling this light B, putting \\(y\\) = its intensity at its source, and \\(n\\) = its distance from the field of the photometer, expressed in English inches, as it is \\(\\frac{y}{n^2} = \\frac{x}{m^2}\\), or, instead of \\(\\frac{x}{m^2}\\), writing its value \\(\\frac{1}{10000}\\), it will be \\(\\frac{y}{n^2} = \\frac{1}{10000}\\); and consequently \\(y\\) is to 1 as \\(n^2\\) is to 10000; or the intensity of the light B at its source, is to the intensity of the standard light A at its source, as the square of the distance of the light B from the middle of the field of the instrument, expressed in inches, is to 10000; and hence it is \\(y = \\frac{n^2}{10000}\\).\n\nOr, if the light of the sun, or that of the moon, be compared with the light of a given lamp or candle C, the result of such comparison may be best expressed in words, by saying, that the light of the celestial luminary in question, at the surface of the earth, or, which is the same thing, at the field of the photometer, is equal to the light of the given lamp or candle, at the distance found by the experiment; or, putting \\(a\\) = the intensity of the light of this lamp C at its source, and \\(p\\) = its distance,\nApparatus distance, in inches, from the field, when the shadows corresponding to this light, and that corresponding to the celestial luminary in question, are found to be of equal densities, and putting \\( z \\) = the intensity of the rays of the luminary at the surface of the earth, the result of the experiment may be expressed thus, \\( z = \\frac{a}{p^2} \\);\n\nor the real value of \\( a \\) being determined by a particular experiment, made expressly for that purpose with the standard lamp, that value may be written instead of it. When the standard lamp itself is made use of, instead of the lamp C, then the value of \\( A \\) will be 1.\n\nThe count's first attempts with his photometer were to determine how far it might be possible to ascertain, by direct experiments, the certainty of the assumed law of the diminution of the intensity of the light emitted by luminous bodies; namely, that the intensity of the light is everywhere as the squares of the distances from the luminous body inversely. As it is obvious that this law can hold good only when the light is propagated through perfectly transparent spaces, so that its intensity is weakened merely by the divergency of its rays, he instituted a set of experiments to ascertain the transparency of the air and other mediums.\n\nWith this view, two equal wax candles, well trimmed, and which were found, by a previous experiment, to burn with exactly the same degree of brightness, were placed together, on one side, before the photometer, and their united light was counterbalanced by the light of an Argand's lamp, well trimmed, and burning very equally, placed on the other side over against them. The lamp was placed at the distance of 100 inches from the field of the photometer, and it was found that the two burning candles (which were placed as near together as possible, without their flames affecting each other by the currents of air they produced) were just able to counterbalance the light of the lamp at the field of the photometer, when they were placed at the distance of 60.8 inches from that field. One of the candles being now taken away and extinguished, the other was brought nearer to the field of the instrument, till its light was found to be just able, singly, to counterbalance the light of the lamp; and this was found to happen when it had arrived at the distance of 43.4 inches. In this experiment, as the candles burnt with equal brightness, it is evident that the intensities of their united and single lights were as 2 to 1; and in that proportion ought, according to the assumed theory, the squares of the distances, 60.8 and 43.4, to be; and, in fact, \\( 60.8^2 = 3696.64 \\) is to \\( 43.4^2 = 1883.56 \\) as 2 is to 1 very nearly.\n\nAgain, in another experiment, the distances were,\n\n| With two candles | 54 inches. Square = 2916 |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| With one candle | 38.6                     |\n\nUpon another trial,\n\n| With two candles | 54.6 inches.

Square = 3410.56 |\n|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| With one candle  | 42.2                         |\n\nAnd, taking the mean of the results of these four experiments,\n\nSquares of the Distances\n\n| With two Candles | With one Candle |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| No. 1            | 3696.64        |\n| No. 2            | 2916           |\n| No. 3            | 2981.16        |\n| No. 4            | 3410.56        |\n\nIn the Experiment\n\n| No. 1            | 1883.56        |\n| No. 2            | 1489.96        |\n| No. 3            | 1576.09        |\n| No. 4            | 1780.84        |\n\n\\( 4 \\times 13004.36 = 52017.44 \\)\n\n\\( 4 \\times 6730.45 = 26921.80 \\)\n\nMeans 3251.09 and 1682.61\n\nwhich again are very nearly as 2 to 1.\n\nWith regard to these experiments, it may be observed, that were the resistance of the air to light, or the diminution of the light from the imperfect transparency of air, sensible within the limits of the inconsiderable distances at which the candles were placed from the photometer, in that case the distance of the two equal lights united ought to be, to the distance of one of them single, in a ratio less than that of the square root of 2 to the square root of 1. For if the intensity of a light emitted by a luminous body, in a space void of all refraction, be diminished in the proportion of the squares of the distances, it must of necessity be diminished in a still higher ratio when the light passes through a refracting medium, or one which is not perfectly transparent; and from the difference of those ratios, namely, that of the squares of the distances, and that other higher ratio found by the experiment, the resistance of the medium might be ascertained. This he took much pains to do with respect to air, but did not succeed; the transparency of air being so great, that the diminution which light suffers in passing through a few inches, or even through several feet of it, is not sensible.\n\nHaving found, upon repeated trials, that the light of a lamp, properly trimmed, is incomparably more equal than that of a candle, whose wick, continually growing longer, renders its light extremely fluctuating, he substituted lamps to candles in these experiments, and made such other variations in the manner of conducting them as he thought bid fair to lead to a discovery of the resistance of the air to light, were it possible to render that resistance sensible within the confined limits of his machinery. But the results of them, so far affording means for ascertaining the resistance of the air to light, do not even indicate any refraction at all; on the contrary, it might almost be inferred, from some of them, that the intensity of the light emitted by a luminous body in air is diminished in a ratio less than that of the squares of the distances; but as such a conclusion would involve an evident absurdity, namely, that light moving in air, its absolute quantity, instead of being diminished, actually goes on to increase, that conclusion can by no means be admitted.\n\nWhy not? Theories must give place to facts; and if this fact can be fairly ascertained, instead of rejecting the conclusion, we ought certainly to rectify our notions of light, the nature of which we believe no man fully comprehends. Who can take it upon him to say, that the substance of light is not latent in the atmosphere, as heat or caloric is now acknowledged to be latent, and that the agency of the former is not called forth by the passage of a ray through a portion of air, as the agency of the latter is known to be excited by\nPart III.","sp":289,"ep":301},{"h":"EXPLANATION OF PLATES CCCLXXI","t":"CCCLXXII, CCCLXXIII, AND CCCLXXIV.\n\nFig. 1.

Discoveries concerning the Refraction of Light.\n\nThough the ancients made few optical experiments, they nevertheless knew, that when light passed through media of different densities, it did not move in a straight line, but was bent or refracted out of its original direction. This was probably suggested to them by the appearance of a straight rod partly immersed in water; and accordingly we find many questions concerning this and other optical appearances in the works of Aristotle. Archimedes is said to have written a treatise on the appearance of a ring or circle under water, and therefore could not have been ignorant of the common phenomena of refraction. The ancients, however, were not only acquainted with these more ordinary appearances, but also with the production of colours by refraction. Seneca says, that if the light of the sun shines through an angular piece of glass, it will show all the colours of the rainbow. These colours, he says, are false, such as are seen in a pigeon's neck when it changes its position; and of the same nature, he says, is a speculum, which, without having any colour of its own, affumes that of any other body. It appears also, that the ancients were not ignorant of the magnifying power of glass globes filled with water, though they do not seem to have been acquainted with its cause; and the ancient engravers supposed to have used a glass globe filled with water to magnify their figures. This indeed seems evident, from their lenticular and spherical gems of rock glass globes, crystal which are still preserved, the effect of which, in magnifying at least, could scarcely have escaped the notice of those who had often occasion to handle them; if indeed, in the spherical or lenticular form, they were not solely intended for the purposes of burning. One of these, of the spherical kind, of about an inch and a half diameter, is preserved among the fossils presented by Dr Woodward to the university of Cambridge.\n\nThe first treatise of any consequence written on the Refraction subject of optics, was by the celebrated Ptolemy. The first treated treatise is now lost; but from the accounts of others, we find that he treated of astronomical refractions. The first astronomers were not aware that the intervals between stars appear less near the horizon than near the meridian; but it is evident that Ptolemy was aware of this circumstance, by the caution which he gives to allow something\nsomething for it, upon every recourse to ancient observations.\n\nPtolemy also advances a very sensible hypothesis to account for the greater apparent size of the sun and moon when seen near the horizon. The mind, he says, judges of the size of objects by means of a preconceived idea of their distance from us; and this distance is fancied to be greater when a number of objects intervene; which is the case when we see the heavenly bodies near the horizon. In his Almagest, however, he ascribes this appearance to a refraction of the rays by vapours, which actually enlarge the angle subtended by the luminaries.\n\nThe nature of refraction was afterwards considered by Alhazen an Arabian writer; inasmuch that, having made experiments upon it at the common surface between air and water, air and glass, water and glass; and, being prepossessed with the ancient opinion of crystalline orbs in the regions above the atmosphere, he even suspected a refraction there also, and fancied he could prove it by astronomical observations. Hence this author concludes, that refraction increases the altitudes of all objects in the heavens; and he first advanced, that the stars are sometimes seen above the horizon by means of refraction, when they are really below it. This observation was confirmed by Vitellio, B. Waltherus, and by the excellent observations of Tycho Brahe. Alhazen observed, that refraction contracts the vertical diameters and distances of the heavenly bodies, and that it is the cause of the twinkling of the stars. But we do not find that either he, or his follower Vitellio, subjected it to mensuration. Indeed it is too small to be determined except by very accurate instruments, and therefore we hear little more of it till about the year 1500; when great attention was paid to the subject by Bernard Walther, Mefflin, and Tycho Brahe.\n\nAlhazen supposed that the refraction of the atmosphere did not depend upon the vapours, but on the different transparency; by which, as Montucla conjectures, he meant the density of the gross air contiguous to the earth, and the ether or sublimate air that lies beyond it. We judge of distance, he says, by comparing the angle under which objects appear, with their supposed distance; so that if these angles be nearly equal, and the distance of one object be conceived greater than that of the other, it will be imagined to be larger. He also observes, that the sky near the horizon is always imagined to be further from us than any other part of the concave surface. Roger Bacon ascribes this account of the horizontal moon to Ptolemy; and as such it is examined, and objected to by B. Porta.\n\nIn the writings of Roger Bacon, we find the first distinct account of the magnifying power of glasses; and it is not improbable, that what he wrote upon this subject gave rise to the useful invention of spectacles. He says, that if an object be applied close to the base of the larger segment of a sphere of glass, it will appear magnified. He also treats of the appearance of an object through a globe, and says that he was the first who observed the refraction of rays into it.\n\nVitellio, a native of Poland, published a treatise of optics, containing all that was valuable in Alhazen. He observes, that light is always lost by refraction; but he does not pretend to estimate the quantity of this loss. He reduced into a table the result of his experiments on the refractive powers of air, water, and glass, corresponding to different angles of incidence. In his account of the horizontal moon he agrees exactly with Alhazen. He ascribes the twinkling of the stars to the motion of the air in which the light is refracted; and to illustrate this hypothesis, he observes, that they twinkle still more when viewed in water put in motion. He also shows, that refraction is necessary as well as reflection, to form the rainbow; because the body which the rays fall upon is a transparent substance, at the surface of which one part of the light is always reflected and another refracted. But he seems to consider refraction as serving only to condense the light, thereby enabling it to make a stronger impression upon the eye. This writer also makes many attempts to ascertain the law of refraction. He likewise considers the foci of glasses, and the apparent size of objects seen through them; though upon these subjects his observations are inaccurate. It is sufficient indeed to show the state of knowledge, at that time, to observe, that both Vitellio, and his master Alhazen, account for objects appearing larger when seen under water, by the circular figure of its surface; since, being fluid, it conforms to the figure of the earth.\n\nContemporary with Vitellio was Roger Bacon, a man of extensive genius, who wrote upon almost every branch of science; yet in optics he does not seem to have made any considerable advances. Even some of the most absurd of the opinions of the ancients have had the sanction of his authority. He believed that visual rays proceed from the eye; because every thing in nature is qualified to discharge its proper functions by its own powers, in the same manner as the sun and other celestial bodies. In his Specula Mathematica, he added some observations of little importance on the refraction of the light of the stars; the apparent size of objects; the enlargement of the sun and moon in the horizon. In his Opus Majus he demonstrates, what Alhazen had done before, that if a transparent body interposed between the eye and an object, be convex towards the eye, the object will appear magnified.\n\nFrom this time, to that of the revival of learning in Europe, we have no treatise on optics. One of the first who distinguished himself in this way was Maurolycus, teacher of mathematics at Messina. In two works, entitled Theoremata Lucis et Umbrae, and Diaphanorum Partes, &c. he demonstrates that the crystalline humour of the eye is a lens that collects the rays of light issuing from the object, and throws them upon the retina, where is the focus of each pencil. From this principle he discovered the reason why some people were short-sighted and others long-sighted; and why the former are relieved by concave, and the others by convex, glasses.\n\nWhile Maurolycus made such advances towards the discovery of the nature of vision, Baptista Porta of Naples invented the camera obscura, which throws still more light on the same subject. His house was restored to by all the ingenious persons at Naples, whom he formed into an academy of secrets; each member being obliged to contribute something useful and not generally known. By this means he was furnished with materials for his Magia Naturalis, which contains his account of the camera obscura, and which was published, as he informs us, when he was not quite 15 years old. He also gave\ngave the first hint of the magic lantern; which Kircher afterwards improved. His experiments with the camera obscura convinced him, that vision, as Aristotle supposed, is performed by the introduction of something into the eye, and not by visual rays proceeding from the eye, as had been formerly imagined by Empedocles; and he was the first who fully satisfied himself and others upon this subject. The resemblance indeed between experiments with the camera obscura and the manner in which vision is performed in the eye, was too striking to escape the observation of a less ingenious person. But when he says that the eye is a camera obscura, and the pupil the hole in the window shutter, he was so far mistaken as to suppose that it was the crystalline humour that corresponds to the wall which receives the images; nor was it discovered till the year 1664, that this office is performed by the retina. He makes a variety of just observations on vision; and explains several cases in which we imagine things to be without the eye, when the appearances are occasioned by some affection of the organ itself, or some motion within it. He remarks also, that, in certain circumstances, vision will be afflittei by convex or concave glasses; and he seems also to have made some small advances towards the discovery of telephones. He observes, that a round and flat surface plunged into water, will appear hollow as well as magnified to an eye above it; and he explains by a figure the manner in which this effect is produced.\n\nThe great problem concerning the measure of refractions was still unsolved. Alhazen and Vitello, indeed, had attempted it; but failed, by trying to measure the angle instead of its sine. At last it was discovered by Snellius, professor of mathematics at Leyden. This philosopher, however, did not perfectly understand his own discovery, nor did he live to publish any account of it. It was afterwards explained by Professor Horstius before it appeared in the writings of Descartes, who published it under a different form, without making any acknowledgment of his obligations to Snellius, whose papers Huygens assures us, were seen by Descartes. Before this time Kepler had published a New Table of Angles of Refraction, determined by his own experiments, for every degree of incidence. Kircher had done the same, and attempted a theory of refraction, on principles, which, if conducted with precision, would have led him to the law discovered by Snellius.\n\nDescartes undertook to explain the cause of refraction by the resolution of forces. Hence he was obliged to suppose that light passes with more ease through a dense medium, than through a rare one. The truth of this explanation was first questioned by M. Fermat, who asserted, contrary to the opinion of Descartes, that light suffers more resistance in water than air, and more in glass than in water; and maintained, that the resistance of different media with respect to light is in proportion to their densities. M. Leibnitz adopted the same general idea, upon the principle that nature accomplishes her ends by the shortest methods, and that light therefore ought to pass from one point to another, either by the shortest road, or that in which the least time is required.\n\nAt a meeting of the Royal Society, Aug. 31, 1664, it was found, with a new instrument prepared for that purpose, that the angle of incidence being 40 degrees, that of refraction is 30\u00b0. About this time also we find the first mention of media not refracting the light in an exact proportion to their densities. For Mr Boyle, in a letter to Mr Oldenburgh, dated Nov. 3, 1664, observes, that in spirit of wine, the proportion of the times of the angles of incidence to the sines of the angles of refraction, was nearly the same as 4 to 3; and that, as spirit of wine occasions a greater refraction than common water, so oil of turpentine, which is lighter than spirit of wine, produces not only a greater refraction than common water, but a much greater than salt water. And at a meeting held November 9, the same year, Dr Hooke mentioned, that pure and clear salad oil produced a much greater refraction than any liquor which he had tried; the angle of refraction that answered to an angle of incidence of 30\u00b0 being no less than 40\u00b0 30\u2032; and the angle of refraction that answered to an angle of incidence of 20\u00b0 being 29\u00b0 47\u2032.\u2014M. de la Hire also made several experiments to ascertain the refractive power of oil, and found the sine of the angle of incidence to that of refraction as 60 to 42; which, he observes, is a little nearer to that of glass than to that of water, though oil is much lighter than water, and glass much heavier.\n\nThe members of the Royal Society finding that the refraction of salt water exceeded that of fresh, purified the experiment farther with aqueous solutions of vitriol, saltpetre, and alum. They found the refraction of the solution of vitriol and saltpetre a little more, but that of alum a little less, than common water.\n\nDr Hooke made an experiment before the Royal Society, Feb. 11, 1663, which clearly proves that ice refracts the light less than water. M. de la Hire also took a good deal of pains to determine whether the refractive power of ice and water were the same; and he found as Dr Hooke had done before, that ice refracts less than water.\n\nBy a most accurate experiment made in 1698, in which a ray of light was transmitted through a Torricellian vacuum, Mr Lowthorp found, that the refractive power of air is to that of water as 36 to 34.400. He observes, that the refractive power of bodies is not proportioned to the density, at least not to the specific gravity, of the refracting medium. For the refractive power of glass to that of water is as 55 to 34, whereas its specific gravity is as 87 to 34; that is, the squares of their refractive powers are very nearly as their respective gravities. And there are some fluids, which, though they are lighter than water, yet have a greater power of refraction. Thus the refractive power of spirit of wine, according to Dr Hooke's experiment, is to that of water as 26 to 33, and its gravity reciprocally as 33 to 36, or 36\u00bd. But the refractive powers of air and water seem to observe the simple direct proportion of their gravities.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris endeavoured to repeat this experiment in 1700; but they did not succeed.\u2014For, as they said, beams of light passed through the vacuum without suffering any refraction. The Royal Society being informed of this, ordered Mr Hawksbee to make an instrument for the purpose, under the direction of Dr Halley, for the purpose of repeating the experiment. It consisted of a strong brass prism, two sides of which had sockets to receive two plane glasses.\nglasses, whereby the air in the prism might either be exhausted or condensed. The prism had also a mercury gage fixed to it, to discover the density of the contained air; and turned upon its axis, in order to make the refractions equal on each side when it was fixed to the end of a telescope. The refracting angle was near 64\u00b0; and the length of the telescope, having a fine hair in its focus, was about 10 feet. The event of this accurate experiment was as follows:\u2014Having chosen a proper object, whose distance was 2588 feet, June 15, O.S. 1703, in the morning, the barometer being then at 29.73, and the thermometer at 60, they first exhausted the prism, and then applying it to the telescope, the horizontal hair in the focus covered a mark on the object distinctly seen through the vacuum; the two glasses being equally inclined to the visual ray. Then admitting the air into the prism, the object was seen to rise above the hair gradually as the air entered, and when the prism was full, the hair was observed to hide a mark 10\u00bd inches below the former mark.\n\nAfter this they applied the condensing engine to the prism; and having forced in another atmosphere, so that the density of the included air was double to that of the outward, they again placed it before the telescope, and, letting out the air, the object which before seemed to rise, appeared gradually to descend, and the hair at length rested on an object higher than before by the same interval of 10\u00bd inches. They then forced in another atmosphere; and upon discharging the condensed air, the object was seen near 21 inches lower than before.\n\nNow the radius in this case being 2588 feet, 10\u00bd inches will subtend an angle of 1\u00b0 8', and the angle of incidence of the visual ray being 32 degrees (because the angle of the glass planes was 64\u00b0), it follows from the known laws of refraction, that as the sine of 39\u00b0 is to that of 31\u00b0 59' 26\", differing from 32\u00b0 by 34\" the half of 1\u00b0 8', so is the fine of any other angle of incidence, to the fine of its angle of refraction; and so is radius, or 1000000, to 999736; which, therefore, is the proportion between the fine of incidence in vacuo and the fine of refraction from thence into common air.\n\nIt appears, by these experiments, that the refractive power of the air is proportional to its density. And since the density of the atmosphere is as its weight directly, and its temperature inversely, the ratio of its density, at any given time, may be had by comparing the heights of the barometer and thermometer; and thence he concludes that this will also be the ratio of the refraction of the air. But Dr Smith observes, that, before we can depend upon the accuracy of this conclusion, we ought to examine whether heat and cold alone may not alter the refractive power of air, while its density continues the same.\n\nThe French academicians, being informed of the result of the above-mentioned experiment, employed M. De l'Isle the younger to repeat the former experiment with more care: He presently found, that their operators had never made any vacuum at all, there being chinks in their instrument, through which the air had insinuated itself. He therefore annexed a gage to his instrument, by which means he was sure of his vacuum; and then the result of the experiment was the same with that of the Royal Society. The refraction was always proportional to the density of the air, excepting when the mercury was very low, and consequently the air very rare; in which case the whole quantity being very small, he could not perceive much difference in them. Comparing, however, the refractive power of the atmosphere, observed at Paris, with the result of his experiment, he found, that the best vacuum he could make was far short of that of the regions above the atmosphere.\n\nDr Hooke first suggested the idea of making allowance for the effect of the refraction of light, in passing from the rarer to the denser regions of the atmosphere, in the computed height of mountains. To this he ascribes the different opinions of authors concerning the height of several very high hills. He could not account for the appearance of very high mountains, at so great a distance as that at which they are actually seen, but upon the supposition of the curvature of the visual ray, that is made by its passing obliquely through a medium of such different density, from the top of them to the eye, very far distant in the horizon. All calculations of the height of mountains that are made upon the supposition that the rays of light come from the tops of them, to our eyes, in straight lines, he considers very erroneous.\n\nDr Hooke attributes the twinkling of the stars to the irregular and unequal refraction of the rays of light, which is also the reason why the limbs of the sun, moon, and planets, appear to wave or dance. That there is such an unequal distribution of the atmosphere, he says, will be evident by looking upon distant objects, over a piece of hot glass, which cannot be supposed to throw out any kind of exhalation from itself, as well as through ascending fleams of water.\n\nAbout this time Grimaldi first observed that the coloured image of the sun refracted through a prism is always oblong, and that colours proceed from refraction. The way in which he first discovered this was by Viottello's experiment already mentioned, in which a piece of white paper placed at the bottom of a glass vessel filled with water, and exposed to the light of the sun, appears coloured. However, he observed, that in case the two surfaces of the refracted medium were exactly parallel to each other, no colours were produced. But of the true cause of those colours, he had not the least suspicion. This discovery was referred for Sir Isaac Newton. Having procured a triangular glass prism to satisfy himself concerning the phenomena of colours; he was surprized at the oblong figure of the coloured spectrum, and the great disproportion betwixt its length and breadth; the former being about five times the measure of the latter. After various conjectures respecting the causes of these appearances, he suspected that the colours might arise from the light being dilated by some unevenness in the glass, or some other accidental irregularity; and to try this, he took another prism like the former, and placed it in such a manner, that the light, passing through them both, might be refracted in opposite directions, and thus be returned by the latter into the same course from which it had been diverted by the former. In this manner he thought that the regular effects of the first prism would be augmented by the multiplicity of refractions. The event was, that the light, diffused by the first prism into an oblong form, was\nby the second reduced into a circular one, with as much regularity as if it had not passed through either of them. He then hit upon what he calls the experimentum crucis, and found that light is not similar, or homogeneous; but that it consists of rays, some of which are more refrangible than others: so that, without any difference in their incidence on the same medium, some of them shall be more refracted than others; and therefore, that, according to their particular degrees of refrangibility, they will be transmitted through the prism to different parts of the opposite wall.\n\nSince it appears from these experiments that different rays of light have different degrees of refrangibility, it follows, that the rules laid down by preceding philosophers concerning the refractive power of water, glass, &c. must be limited to the mean rays of the spectrum. Sir Isaac, however, proves, both geometrically and by experiment, that the fine of the incidence of every kind of light, considered apart, is to its fine of refraction in a given ratio.\n\nThe most important discovery concerning refraction since the time of Sir Isaac Newton is that of Mr Dollond, who found out a method of remedying the defects of refracting telescopes arising from the different refrangibility of light. Sir Isaac Newton imagined that the different rays were refracted in the same proportion by every medium, so that the refrangibility of the extreme rays might be determined if that of the mean ones were given. From this it followed, as Mr Dollond observes, that equal and contrary refractions must not only destroy each other, but that the divergency of the colours from one refraction would likewise be corrected by the other, and that there could be no possibility of producing any such thing as refraction without colour. Hence it was natural to infer, that all object glasses of telescopes must be equally affected by the different refrangibility of light, in proportion to their apertures, of whatever materials they may be formed.\n\nFor this reason, philosophers despaired of bringing refracting telescopes to perfection. They therefore applied themselves chiefly to the improvement of the reflecting telescope; till 1747, when M. Euler, improving upon a hint of Sir Isaac Newton's, proposed to make object glasses of water and glass; hoping, that by their difference of refractive powers, the refractions would balance one another, and thereby prevent the dispersion of the rays that is occasioned by their difference of refrangibility. This memoir of M. Euler excited the attention of Mr Dollond. He went over all M. Euler's calculations, substituting for his hypothetical laws of refraction those which had been ascertained by Newton; and found, that, it followed from Euler's own principles, that there could be no union of the foci of all kinds of colours, but in a lens infinitely large.\n\nEuler did not mean to controvert the experiments of Newton; but affirmed, that, if they were admitted in all their extent, it would be impossible to correct the difference of refrangibility occasioned by the transmission of the rays from one medium into another of different density; a correction which he thought was very possible, since he supposed it to be effected in the eye, which he considered as an achromatic instrument. To this reasoning Mr Dollond made no reply, but by appealing to the experiments of Newton, and the circumvention with which it was known that he conducted all his inquiries.\n\nThis paper of Euler's was particularly noticed by M. Klingentierma of Sweden, who found that, from Newton's own principles, the result of his 8th experiment could not answer his description of it. Newton found, that when light passes out of air through several media, and thence goes out again into air, whether the refracting surfaces be parallel or inclined to one another, this light, as often as by contrary refractions it is so corrected as to emerge in lines parallel to those in which it was incident, continues ever after to be white; but if the emergent rays be inclined to the incident, the whiteness of the emerging light will, by degrees, become tinged at its edges with colours. This he tried by refracting light with prisms of glass, placed within a prismatic vessel of water.\n\nBy theorems deduced from this experiment he infers, that the refractions of the rays of every sort, made out of any medium into air, are known by having the refraction of the rays of any one sort; and also that the refraction out of one medium into another is found as often as we have the refractions out of them both into any third medium.\n\nOn the contrary, the Swedish philosopher observes, that, in this experiment, the rays of light, after passing through the water and the glass, though they come out parallel to the incident rays, will be coloured; but that the smaller the glass prism is, the nearer will the result of it approach to Newton's description.\n\nThis paper of M. Klingentierma being communicated to Dollond, made him entertain doubts concerning Newton's report, and induced him to have recourse to experiment.\n\nHe therefore cemented together two plates of glass at their edges, so as to form a prismatic vessel, when stopped at the ends; and the edge being turned downwards, he placed in it a glass prism, with one of its edges upwards, and filled up the vacancy with clear water; so that the refraction of the prism was contrary to that of the water, in order that a ray of light, transmitted through both these refracting media, might be affected by the difference only between the two refractions. As he found the water to refract more or less than the glass prism, he diminished or increased the angle between the glass plates, till he found the two contrary refractions to be equal; which he discovered by viewing an object through this double prism. For when it appeared neither raised or depressed, he was satisfied that the refractions were equal, and that the emergent and incident rays were parallel.\n\nBut according to the prevailing opinion, the object should have appeared of its natural colour; for if the difference of refrangibility had been equal in the two equal refractions, they would have rectified each other. This experiment, therefore, fully proved the fallacy of the received opinion, by showing the divergency of the light by the glass prism to be almost double of that by the water; for the image of the object was as much infected with the prismatic colours, as if it had been seen through a glass wedge only, whose refracting angle was near 30 degrees.\n\nMr Dollond was convinced that if the refracting angle of the water vessel could have admitted of a sufficient increase, the divergency of the coloured rays would have been greatly diminished, or entirely rectified; and that there would have been a very great refraction without.\nout colour; but the inconvenience of so large an angle as that of the prismatic vessel must have been, to bring the light to an equal divergency with that of the glass prism whose angle was about 60 degrees, made it necessary to try some experiments of the same kind with smaller angles.\n\nHe, therefore, got a wedge of plate glass, the angle of which was only nine degrees; and using it in the same circumstances, he increased the angle of the water wedge, in which it was placed, till the divergency of the light by the water was equal to that by the glass; that is, till the image of the object, though considerably refracted by the excess of the refraction of the water, appeared quite free from any colours proceeding from the different refrangibility of the light; and as near as he could then measure, the refraction by the water was about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of that by the glass.\n\nAs these experiments proved, that different substances caused the light to diverge very differently in proportion to their general refractive power, Mr Dollond began to suspect that such a variety might possibly be found in different kinds of glass.\n\nHis next object, therefore, was to grind wedges of different kinds of glass, and apply them together; so that the refractions might be made in contrary directions, in order to discover whether the refraction and the divergency of the colours would vanish together.\n\nFrom these experiments, which were not made till 1757, he discovered a difference far beyond his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass, with respect to the divergency of colours. The yellow or straw-coloured kind, commonly called Venice glass, and the English crown glass, proved to be nearly alike in that respect; though, in general, the crown glass seemed to make light diverge less than the other. The common English plate glass made the light diverge more; and the white crystal, or English flint glass, most of all.\n\nHe then examined the particular qualities of every kind of glass that he could obtain, to fix upon two kinds in which the difference of their dispersive powers should be the greatest; and he soon found these to be the crown glass and the white flint glass. He therefore ground one wedge of white flint, of about 25 degrees; and another of crown glass, of about 29 degrees; which refracted very nearly alike, but their power of making the colours diverge was very different. He then ground several others of crown glass to different angles, till he got one which was equal, with respect to the divergency of the light, to that in the white flint glass; for when they were put together, so as to refract in contrary directions, the refracted light was entirely free from colours. Then measuring the refraction of each wedge with these different angles, he found that of the white glass to be to that of the crown glass nearly as two to three: so that any two wedges made in this proportion, and applied together, that they might refract in a contrary direction, would transmit the light without any dispersion of the rays. He found also, that the fine of incidence in crown glass is to that of its general refraction as 1 to 1.53, and in flint glass as 1 to 1.583.\n\nIn order to apply these discoveries to the construction of telescopes, Mr Dollond considered, that, in order to make two spherical glasses that should refract the light in contrary directions, the one must be concave and the other convex; and as the rays are to converge to a real focus, the excess of refraction must be in the convex lens. Also, as the convex glass is to refract the most, it appeared from his experiments, that it must be made of crown glass, and the concave of white flint glass.\n\nFurther, as the refractions of spherical glasses are in the inverse ratio of their focal distances, it follows, that the focal distances of the two glasses shall be inversely as the ratios of the refractions of the wedges; for being thus proportioned, every ray of light that passes through this combined glass, at whatever distance it may pass from its axis, will constantly be refracted, by the difference between two contrary refractions, in the proportion required; and therefore the different refrangibility of the light will be entirely removed.\n\nThe difficulties which occurred in the application of this reasoning to practice, arose from the following circumstances. In the first place, the focal distances, as well as the particular surfaces, must be very nicely proportioned to the densities or refracting powers of the glasses, which are very apt to vary in the same sort of glasses made at different times. Secondly, the centres of the two glasses must be placed truly in the common axis of the telescope, otherwise the desired effect will be in a great measure destroyed. And thirdly, the difficulty of forming the four surfaces of the lenses exactly spherical. At length, however, after numerous trials, he was able to construct refracting telescopes, with such apertures and magnifying powers, under limited lengths, as far exceeded anything that had been produced before, representing objects with great distinctness, and in their natural colours.\n\nAs Mr Dollond did not explain the method by which he determined the curvatures of his lenses, the celebrated M. Clairaut, who had begun to investigate this subject, endeavoured to reduce it to a complete theory, from which rules might be deduced, for the benefit of the practical optician.\n\nWith this view, therefore, he endeavoured to ascertain the refractive power of different kinds of glass, and also their property of dispersing the rays of light. For this purpose he made use of two prisms, as Mr Dollond had done: but, instead of looking through them, he placed them in a dark room; and when the transmitted image of the sun was perfectly white, he concluded that the different refrangibility of the rays was corrected.\n\nIn order to ascertain more easily the true angles that prisms ought to have in order to destroy the effect of the difference of refrangibility, he constructed a prism which had one of its surfaces cylindrical, with several degrees of amplitude. By this means, without changing his prisms, he had the choice of an infinity of angles; among which, by examining the point of the curve surface, which, receiving the solar ray, gave a white image, he could easily find the true one. He also ascertained the proportion in which different kinds of glass separated the rays of light, by measuring, with proper precautions, the oblong image of the sun made by transmitting through them a beam of light.\n\nIn these experiments M. Clairaut was assisted by M. de Tournieres, and the results agreed with Mr Dollond's in general; but whereas Mr Dollond had made the dispersion of the rays in glass and in water to be as\nfive to four (acknowledging, however, that he did not pretend to do it with exactness), these gentlemen, who took more pains, found it to be as three to two. For the theorems and problems deduced by M. Clairaut from these new principles of optics, with a view to the perfection of telephones, we must refer the reader to Mem. Acad. Par. 1756, 1757.\n\nThe subject of achromatic telephones was also investigated by the illustrious D'Alembert. This excellent mathematician proposed a variety of new constructions, the advantages and disadvantages of which he distinctly notes; at the same time that he points out several methods of correcting the errors to which these telephones are liable: as by placing the object glasses, in some cases, at a small distance from one another, and sometimes by using eye glasses of different refractive powers; which is an expedient that does not seem to have occurred to any person before him. He even shows, that telephones may be made to advantage, consisting of only one object glass, and an eye glass of a different refractive power. Some of his constructions have two or more eye glasses of different kinds of glasses. This subject he considered at large in one of the volumes of his Opuscules Mathematiques. We have also three memoirs of M. D'Alembert upon this subject, among those of the French Academy; in the years 1764, 1765, and 1767.\n\nThe investigations of Clairaut and D'Alembert do not seem to have afforded the exertions of foreign artists. The telephones made in England, according to no exact rule, as foreigners supposed, were greatly superior to any that could be made elsewhere, though under the immediate direction of those able calculators.\n\nM. Euler, who first gave occasion to this inquiry, having persuaded himself, both by reasoning and calculation, that Mr Dollond had discovered no new principle in optics, and yet not being able to controvert Mr Short's testimony in favour of the achromatic telephones, concluded that this extraordinary effect was partly owing to the crown glasses not transmitting all the red light, which would otherwise have come to a different focus, and have distorted the image; but principally to his giving a full curvature to his glasses, which he did not doubt would have produced the same effect if the lenses had all been made of the same kind of glasses. At another time he imagined that the goodness of Mr Dollond's telephones might be owing to the eye glasses. If my theory, says he, be true, this disagreeable consequence follows, that Mr Dollond's object glasses cannot be exempt from the dispersion of colours: yet a regard to so respectable a testimony embarrasses me extremely, it being as difficult to question such express authority, as to abandon a theory which appears to me well founded, and to embrace an opinion which is as contrary to all the established laws of nature as it is strange and seemingly absurd. He even appeals to experiments made in a darkened room; in which he says, he is confident that Mr Dollond's object-glasses would appear to have the same defects to which others are subject.\n\nNot doubting, however, but that Mr Dollond had made some improvement in the construction of telephones, by the combination of glasses, he abandoned his former project, in which he had recourse to different media, and confined his attention to the correction of the errors which arise from the curvature of lenses. But while he was proceeding, as he imagined, upon the true principles of optics, he could not help expressing his surprise that Mr Dollond should have been led to so important a discovery by reasoning in a manner quite contrary to the nature of things. At length, however, M. Euler was convinced of the reality and importance of Mr Dollond's discoveries; and frankly acknowledges, that perhaps he should never have been brought to attend to it, had he not been assured by his friend M. Clairaut that the experiments of the English optician might be depended upon. The experiments of M. Zeiller, however, gave him the most complete satisfaction with respect to this subject. This gentleman demonstrated, that it is the lead in the composition of glasses which produces the variation in its dispersive power; and, by increasing the quantity of lead in the mixture, he produced a kind of glasses, which occasioned a much greater separation of the extreme rays than the flint glasses which Mr Dollond had made use of.\n\nFrom these new principles M. Euler deduces theorems concerning the combination of the lenses, and, in a manner similar to M. Clairaut and D'Alembert, points out methods of constructing achromatic telephones.\n\nWhile he was employed upon this subject, he informs us, that he received a letter from M. Zeiller, dated Pittsburgh, 30th of January 1764, in which he gives glasses for the him a particular account of the success of his experiments on the composition of glasses; and that, having correcting mixed minium and sand in different proportions, the refraction of the mean refraction and the dispersion of the telephones' rays varied according to the following table:\n\n| Proportion of minium to flint | Ratio of the mean refraction from air into glasses | Dispersion of the rays in comparison of crown glasses |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| I. 3 : 1                      | 2028 : 1000                                      | 4800 : 1000                                         |\n| II. 2 : 1                     | 1830 : 1000                                      | 3550 : 1000                                         |\n| III. 1 : 1                    | 1787 : 1000                                      | 3259 : 1000                                         |\n| IV. 1 : 1                     | 1732 : 1000                                      | 2297 : 1000                                         |\n| V. 1 : 1                      | 1724 : 1000                                      | 1800 : 1000                                         |\n| VI. 1 : 1                     | 1664 : 1000                                      | 1354 : 1000                                         |\n\nFrom this table it is evident, that a greater quantity of lead not only produces a greater dispersion of the rays, but also increases the mean refraction. The first of these kinds of glasses, which contains three times as much minium as flint, will appear very extraordinary; since, hitherto, no transparent substance has been known whose refractive power exceeded the ratio of two to one, and since the dispersion occasioned by this glass is almost five times as great as that of crown glasses, which could scarcely be believed by those who entertained any doubt concerning the same property in flint glasses, the effect of which is three times as great as crown glasses.\n\nHere, however, M. Euler announces to us another discovery of M. Zeiller, no less surprising than the former, and which disconcerted all his schemes for reconciling the above-mentioned phenomena. As the six kinds of glasses mentioned in the preceding table were composed of nothing but minium and flint, M. Zeiller happened to think of mixing alkaline salts with them, in order to give the glasses a composition more proper for dioptric uses: This mixture, however, greatly diminishes...\ned the mean refraction, almost without making any change in the dispersion. After many trials, he is said to have obtained a kind of glass, which occasioned three times as great a dispersion of the rays as the common glass, at the same time that the mean refraction was only as 1.61 to 1.; though we have not heard that this kind of glass was ever used in the construction of teleopes.\n\nMr Dollond was not the only optician who had the merit of discovering the achromatic telescope, as this instrument appears to have been constructed by a private gentleman\u2014Mr Chester More Hall. He observed that prisms of flint glass gave larger spectra than prisms of water, when the mean refraction was the same in both. He tried prisms of other glasses, and found similar differences; and he applied this discovery to the same purposes as Mr Dollond. These facts came out in a process raised at the instance of Watkins optician, as also in a publication of Mr Ramsden. There is, however, no evidence that Dollond stole the idea from Mr Hall, or that they had not both claims to the discovery.\n\nThe best refracting telescopes, constructed on the principles of Mr Dollond, are still defective, on account of that colour which, by the aberration of the rays, they give to objects viewed through them, unless the object glass be of small diameter. This defect philosophers have endeavoured to remove by various contrivances, and Bozovich has, in his attempts for this purpose, displayed much ingenuity; but the philosopher whose exertions have been crowned with most success, and who has perhaps made the most important discovery in this science, is Dr Robert Blair professor of practical astronomy in the college of Edinburgh. By a judicious set of experiments, he has proved, that the quality of dispersing the rays in a greater degree than crown glass, is not confined to a few media, but is possessed by a great variety of fluids, and by some of these in an extraordinary degree. He has shown, that though the greater refrangibility of the violet rays than of the red rays, when light passes from any medium whatever into a vacuum, may be considered as a law of nature; yet in the passage of light from one medium into another, it depends entirely on the qualities of the media which of these rays shall be the most refrangible, or whether there shall be any difference in their refrangibility. In order to correct the aberration arising from difference of refrangibility among the rays of light, he instituted a set of experiments, by which he detected a very singular and important quality in the muriatic acid. In all the dispersive media hitherto examined, the green rays, which are the mean refrangible in crown glass, were found among the least refrangible; but in the muriatic acid, these same rays were found to make a part of the more refrangible. This discovery led to complete success in removing the great defect of optical instruments, viz., that diffraction or aberration of the rays which arises from their unequal refrangibility, and has hitherto rendered it impossible to converge all of them to one point either by single or opposite refractions. A fluid, in which the particles of marine acid and metallic particles hold a due proportion, at the same time that it separates the extreme rays of the spectrum much more than crown glass, refracts all the orders of the rays in the same proportion that glass does; and hence rays of all colours made to diverge by the refraction of the glass, may either be rendered parallel by a subsequent refraction in the centre of the glass and this fluid; or, by weakening the refractive density of the fluid, the refraction which takes place in the centre of it and glass may be rendered as regular as reflection, without the least colour whatever. The doctor has a telescope, not exceeding 15 inches in length, with a compound object glass of this kind, which equals in all respects, if it does not surpass, the best of Dollond's 42 inches long.\n\nWe shall conclude the history of the discoveries concerning refraction, with some account of the refraction fraction of the atmosphere.\u2014Tables of refraction have been calculated by Mr Lambert, with a view to correct inaccuracies in determining the altitudes of mountains geometrically. The observations of Mr Lambert go upon the supposition that the refractive power of the atmosphere is invariable: But as this is by no means the case, his rules must be considered as true only for the mean state of the air.\n\nDr Nettleton observed a remarkable variety in the refractive power of the atmosphere, which demonstrates how little we can depend upon the calculated heights of mountains, when the observations are made with an instrument, and when the refractive power of the air is to be taken into account. Being desirous to learn, by observation, how far the mercury would descend in the barometer at any given elevation, he proposed to measure the height of some of their highest hills; but when he attempted it, he found his observation so much disturbed by refraction, that he could obtain no certain result. Having measured one hill of considerable height, in a clear day, and observed the mercury at the bottom and at the top, he found, that about 19 feet or more were required to make the mercury fall 7/8th of an inch; but afterwards, repeating the experiment, when the air was rather groggy and hazy, he found the small angles so much increased by refraction as to make the hill much higher than before. He afterwards frequently made observations at his own house, by pointing a quadrant to the tops of some neighbouring hills, and observed that they would appear higher in the morning before sunrise, and also late in the evening, than at noon in a clear day, by several minutes. In one case the elevations of the same hill differed more than 30 minutes.\n\nM. Euler considered the refractive power of the atmosphere, as affected by different degrees of heat and elasticity; in which he shows, that its refractive power, to a considerable distance from the zenith, is sufficiently near the proportion of the tangent of that distance, and that the law of refraction follows the direct ratio of the difference marked by the thermometer; but when stars are in the horizon, the changes are in a ratio somewhat greater than this, more especially on account of the variation in the heat.\n\nAs the density of the atmosphere varies with its altitude, and as the irregular curvature of the earth resolves the causes of a constant change in the inclination of the strata through which any ray of light passes to the eye, the calculation of refraction cannot be obtained from the density of the atmosphere, and the angular direction of the refracted ray. By comparing astronomical with meteorological observations, however, the celebrated M. La Place has given...\ngiven a complete solution of this very important problem.\n\nThe phenomena known by the names of mirage, gularities of refractions arising from accidental changes in the temperature of the atmosphere. From the rarefaction of the air near the surface of water, buildings, or the earth itself, a distant object seen through this rarefied air sometimes appears depressed instead of raised by refraction; at other times it appears both elevated and depressed, so that the object seems double, and sometimes triple, one of the images being in an inverted position. This subject is much indebted to the researches of the ingenious Dr Wollaston, who has imitated these natural phenomena by viewing objects through the rarefied air contiguous to a red-hot poker, or through a saline or saccharine solution with water and spirit of wine floating upon its surface. This branch of optics has also been well illustrated by Mr Vince and Mr Hudhart.\n\nSect. II. Discoveries concerning the Reflection of Light.\n\nThe followers of Plato were acquainted with the equality between the angles of incidence and reflection; and it is probable that they discovered this, by observing a ray of the sun reflected from standing water, or some other polished body; or from attending to the images of objects reflected by such surfaces. If philosophers paid any attention to this phenomenon, they could not but perceive, that, if the ray fell nearly perpendicular upon such a surface, it was reflected near the perpendicular; and if it fell obliquely, it was reflected obliquely; and observations upon these angles, the most rude and imperfect, could not fail to convince them of their equality, and that the incident and reflected rays were in the same plane.\n\nAristotle was sensible that it is the reflection of light from the atmosphere which prevents total darkness after the sun sets, and in places where he does not shine in the daytime. He was also of opinion, that rainbows, halos, and mock suns, were occasioned by the reflection of the sunbeams in different circumstances, by which an imperfect image of his body was produced, the colour only being exhibited, and not his proper figure. The image, he says, is not single, as in a mirror; for each drop of rain is too small to reflect a visible image, but the conjunction of all the images is visible.\n\nWithout inquiring any farther into the nature of light or vision, the ancient geometers contented themselves with deducing a system of optics from two facts, the rectilineal progress of light, and the equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. The treatise of optics ascribed to Euclid is employed in determining the apparent size and figure of objects, from the angle which they subtend at the eye, and the apparent place of the image of an object reflected from a polished mirror. This place he fixes at the point where the reflected ray meets a perpendicular to the mirror drawn through the object. But this work is imperfect and inaccurate, that it does not seem to be the production of Euclid.\n\nIt appears from Pliny and Lactantius, that burning glasses were known to the ancients. In one of the plays of Aristophanes, indeed, a person is introduced who proposes to destroy his adversary's papers by means of this instrument; and there is reason to believe that the Romans had a method of lighting their sacred fire by means of a concave speculum. It seems indeed to have been known A.C. 433, that there is an increase of heat in the place where the rays of light meet, after reflection from a concave mirror. The burning power of concave mirrors is noticed by the author of the work ascribed to Euclid. If we give any credit to what some ancient historians are said to have written concerning the exploits of Archimedes, we shall be induced to think that he constructed some very powerful burning mirrors; but nothing being said of other persons making use of his inventions, the whole account is very doubtful. It is allowed, however, that this eminent geometer did write a treatise on the subject of burning mirrors, which has not descended to our times.\n\nB. Porta supposes that the burning mirrors of the ancients were parabolic and made of metal. It follows from the properties of this curve, that all the rays which fall upon it, parallel to its axis, will meet in the same point at the focus. Consequently, if the vertex of the parabola be cut off, as in fig. 1, it will make a convenient burning mirror. In some drawings of this instrument the frustum is so small, as to look like a ring. With an instrument of this kind, it is thought, that the Romans lighted their sacred fire, and that with a similar mirror Archimedes burnt the Roman fleet; using a lens, to throw the rays parallel, when they had been brought to a focus; or applying a smaller parabolic mirror for this purpose, as is represented fig. 2.\n\nThe nature of reflection was, however, very far from being understood. Even Lord Bacon, who made much greater advances in physics than his predecessors, supposed it possible to see the image reflected from a looking glass, without seeing the glass itself; and to this purpose he quotes a story of Friar Bacon, who is reported to have apparently walked in the air between two steeples, and which was thought to have been effected by reflection from glasses while he walked upon the ground.\n\nVitellio had endeavoured to show that it is possible, by means of a cylindrical convex speculum, to see the images of objects in the air, out of the speculum, when the objects themselves cannot be seen. But from his description of the apparatus, it will be seen that the eye was to be directed towards the speculum placed within a room, while the object and the spectator were without it. But as no such effect can be produced by a convex mirror, Vitellio must have been under some deception with respect to his experiment.\n\nB. Porta says, that this effect may be produced by a plain mirror only; and also by the combination of a plain and a concave mirror.\n\nKircher also speaks of the possibility of exhibiting these pendulous images, and supposes that they are reflected from the dense air: But the most perfect and pleasing deception, depending upon the images in the air, is one of which this writer gives a particular account in his Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae, p. 783. In this case the image is placed at the bottom of a hollow polished cylinder, by which means it appears like a real solid substance, suspended within the mouth of the vessel.\n\nIt was Kepler who first discovered, that the apparent places of objects seen by reflecting mirrors depended on Kepler.\nMr Boyle made some curious observations concerning the reflecting powers of differently coloured substances. In order to show that snow shines by a borrowed and not by a native light, he placed a quantity of it in a room, from which all foreign light was excluded, and found that it was completely invisible. To try whether white bodies reflect more light than others, he held a sheet of white paper in a sunbeam admitted into a darkened room; and observed that it reflected much more light than a paper of any other colour, a considerable part of the room being enlightened by it.\n\nTo show that white bodies reflect the rays outwards, he adds, that common burning glaies require a long time to burn or discolour white paper; that the image of the sun was not so well defined upon white paper as upon black; that when he put ink upon the paper, the moisture would be quickly dried up, and the paper, which he could not burn before, would presently take fire;\u2014and that by exposing his hand to the sun, with a thin black glove upon it, it would be suddenly and more considerably heated, than if he held his naked hand to the rays, or put on a glove of thin white leather.\n\nTo prove that black is the reverse of white, with respect to its property of reflecting the rays of the sun, he procured a large piece of black marble, ground into the form of a large concave speculum, and found that the image of the sun reflected from it was far from offending or dazzling his eyes, as it would have done from another speculum; and though this was large, he could not for a long time set a piece of wood on fire with it; though a far less speculum, of the same form, and of a more reflecting substance, would presently have made it flame.\n\nTo satisfy himself still farther with respect to this subject, he took a tile; and having made one half of its surface white and the other black, he exposed it to the summer fun. Having let it lie there some time, he found, that while the whitened part remained cool, the black part was very hot. He sometimes left part of the tile of its native red; and, after exposing the whole to the sun, observed that this part grew hotter than the white, but not so hot as the black part.\n\nA remarkable property of lignum nephriticum (a species of guadulina) was first observed by Kircher. Mr Boyle has described this lignum nephriticum as a whitish kind of wood, which was brought from Mexico, and which had been thought to tinge water of a green colour only; but he says that he found it to communicate all kinds of colours. If an infusion of this wood be put into a glass globe, and exposed to a strong light, it will be as colourless as pure water; but if it be carried into a place a little shaded, it will be a beautiful green. In a place still more shaded, it will incline to red; and in a very shady place, or in an opaque vessel, it will be green again.\n\nMr Boyle first distinctly noted the two very different colours which this remarkable tincture exhibits by transmitted and reflected light. If it be held directly between the light and the eye, it will appear tinged (excepting the very top of it, where a sky-coloured circle sometimes appears) almost of a golden colour, except the infusion be too strong; in which case it will be dark or reddish, and requires to be diluted with water. But if it be held from the light, so that the eye be between the light and the phial, it will appear of a deep lively blue colour; as will also the drops, if any lie on the outside of the glass.\n\nWhen a little of this tincture was poured upon a sheet of white paper, and placed in a window where the sun shone upon it, he observed, that if he turned his back upon the sun, the shadow of any body projected upon the liquor would not be all dark, like other shadows; but that part of it would be curiously coloured, the edge of it next the body being almost of a lively golden colour, and the more remote part blue.\n\nObserving that this tincture, if it were too deep, was not tinged in so beautiful a manner, and that the impregnating virtue of the wood did, by frequent infusion in fresh water, gradually decay, he conjectured that the tincture contained much of the essential salt of the wood; and to try whether the subtle parts, on which the colour depended, were volatile enough to be distilled, without diffusing their texture, he applied some of it to the gentle heat of a lamp furnace; but he found all that came over was as limpid and colourless as rock water, while that which remained behind was of a deep blue, that it was only in a very strong light that it appeared of any colour.\n\nHaving sometimes brought a round long-necked phial, filled with this tincture, into a darkened room, into which a beam of the sun was admitted by a small aperture; and holding the phial sometimes near the sunbeams, and sometimes partly in them and partly out of them, changing also the position of the glass, and viewing it from several parts of the room, it exhibited a much greater variety of colours than it did in an enlightened room. Besides the usual colours, it was red in some places and green in others, and within were intermediate colours produced by the different mixtures of light and shade.\n\nIt was not only in this tincture of lignum nephriticum that Mr Boyle perceived the difference between reflected and transmitted light. He observed it even in gold, though no person explained the cause of these appearances before Sir Isaac Newton. He took a piece of leaf gold, and holding it betwixt his eye and the light, observed, that it did not appear of a golden colour, but of a greenish blue. He also observed the same change of colour by candle light; but the experiment did not succeed with a leaf of silver.\n\nThe constitution of the atmosphere and of the sea, we shall find, by more recent observations, to be similar to that of this infusion; for the blue rays, and others of a faint colour, do not penetrate so far into them as the red, and others of a stronger colour.\n\nThe first distinct account of the colours exhibited by Mr Boyle's thin plates of various substances is to be found among account of the observations of Mr Boyle. To show that colours may be made to appear or vanish, where there is no accretion or change either of the sulphureous, the saline, or the mercurial principle of bodies, he observes, that all chemical essential oils, as also good spirit of wine, being shaken till they rise in bubbles, appear of various colours; which immediately vanish when the bubbles burst, so that a colourless liquor may be immediately made to exhibit a variety of colours, and lose them in a moment,\nmoment, without any change in its essential principles.\n\nHe then mentions the colours that appear in bubbles of soap and water, and also in those of turpentine. He sometimes got glass blown so thin as to exhibit similar colours; and observes, that a feather, and also a black ribbon, held at a proper distance, between his eye and the sun, showed a variety of little rainbows, with very vivid colours, none of which were constantly to be seen in the same objects.\n\nThis subject was more carefully investigated by Dr Hooke, who promised, at a meeting of the society on the 7th of March 1672, to exhibit, at their next meeting, something which had neither reflection nor refraction, and yet was diaphanous. Accordingly he produced the famous coloured bubble of soap and water of which such use was afterwards made by Sir Isaac Newton, but which Dr Hooke and his contemporaries seem to have overlooked in Mr Boyle's treatise on colours, though it was published nine years before. It is no wonder that so curious an appearance excited the attention of that inquisitive body, and that they should desire him to bring an account of it in writing at their next meeting.\n\nBy the help of a small glass pipe, there were blown several small bubbles, out of a mixture of soap and water. At first, they appeared white and clear; but, after some time, the film of water growing thinner, there appeared upon it all the colours of the rainbow: first, a pale yellow; then orange, red, purple, blue, green, &c. with the same series of colours repeated; in which it was farther observable, that the first and last series were very faint, and that the middlemost series was very bright. After these colours had passed through the changes above mentioned, the film of the bubble began to appear white again; and presently, in several parts of this second white film, there were seen several holes, which by degrees grew very large, several of them running into one another.\n\nDr Hooke was the first who observed the beautiful colours that appear in thin plates of mica or glass. With a microscope he could perceive that these colours were ranged in rings surrounding the white specks or flaws in this thin substance, that the order of the colours was the very same as in the rainbow, and that they were often repeated ten times. But the colours were disposed as in the outer rainbow. Some of them also were much brighter than others, and some of them very much broader. He also observed, that if there was a part where the colours were very broad, and conspicuous to the naked eye, they might be made, by pressing the part with the finger, to change places, and move from one part to another. Lastly, he observed, that if great care be used, this substance may split into plates of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of an inch in diameter, each of which will appear through a microscope to be uniformly adorned with some one vivid colour, and that these plates will be found upon examination to be of the same thickness throughout.\n\nA phenomenon similar to this was noticed by Lord Bererton, who at a meeting of the Royal Society in 1666, produced some pieces of glass taken out of a church window, both on the north and on the south side of it; they were all eaten in by the air, but the piece taken from the south side had some colours like those of the rainbow upon it, which the others on the north side had not. It cannot be doubted, but that in all these cases, the glass is divided into thin plates, which exhibit colours, upon the same principle with those which Dr Hooke observed in the bubble of soap and water, and in the thin plate of glass, which we shall find more fully explained by Sir Isaac Newton.\n\nThe enquiries of M. Bouguer concerning the reflection of light are worthy of particular notice. They are fully detailed in his Trait\u00e9 d'Optique, a voluminous work published by La Caille in 1760.\n\nIn order to compare different degrees of light, he always contrived to place the radiant bodies or other of M. Bouguer's bodies illuminated by them, in such a manner that he could view them distinctly at the same time; and he either varied the distances of these bodies, or modified their light in some other way, till he could perceive no difference between them. Then, considering their different distances, or the other circumstances by which their light was affected, he calculated the proportion which they would have borne to each other at the same distance, or in the same circumstances.\n\nTo ascertain the quantity of light lost by reflection, he placed the mirror, or reflecting surface, B, on which the experiment was to be made, truly upright; and having taken two tablets, of precisely the same colour, or of an equal degree of whiteness, he placed them exactly parallel to one another at E and D, and threw light upon them by means of a lamp or candle, P, placed in a right line between them. He then placed himself so, that with his eye at A he could see the tablet E, and the image of the tablet D, reflected from the mirror B, at the same time; making them as it were, to touch one another. He then moved the candle along the line ED, so as to throw more or less light upon either of them, till he could perceive no difference in the strength of the two lights that came to his eye. After this, he had nothing more to do than to measure the distances EP and DP, and then the intensity of the lights was as \\( EP^2 \\) to \\( DP^2 \\).\n\nTo find how much light is lost by oblique reflection, he took two equally polished plates, D and E, and caused them to be enlightened by the candle P. While one of them, D, was seen at A, by reflection from B, placed in a position oblique to the eye, the other, E, was so placed, as to appear contiguous to it; and removing the plate E, till the light which it reflected was no stronger than that which came from the image D, seen by reflection at B, he estimated the quantity of light that was lost by this oblique reflection, by the squares of the distances of the two objects from the candle.\n\nIn order to ascertain the quantity of light lost by reflection with the greatest exactness, M. Bouguer introduced two beams of light into a darkened room, as by the apertures P and Q; which he had so contrived, that he could place them higher and lower, and enlarge or contract them at pleasure; and the reflecting surface (as that of a fluid contained in a vessel) was placed horizontally at O, from which the light coming through the hole P, was reflected to R, upon the screen GH, where it was compared with another beam of light that fell upon S, through the hole Q; which he made so much less than P, as that the spaces S and R were equally illuminated; and by the proportion that the apertures P and Q bore to each other, he calculated what quantity of light was lost by the reflection at O.\nIt was necessary, he observes, that the two beams of light PO and QS (which he usually made 7 or 8 feet long) should be exactly parallel, that they might come from two points of the sky of the same altitude, and having precisely the same intensity of light. It was also necessary that the hole Q should be a little higher than P, in order that the two images should be at the same height, and near one another. It is no less necessary, he says, that the screen GH be exactly vertical, in order that the direct and reflected beams may fall upon it, with the same inclination; since, otherwise, though the two lights were perfectly equal, they would not illuminate the screen equally. This disposition, he says, serves to answer another important condition in these experiments; for the direct ray QS must be of the same length with the sum of the incident and reflected rays, PO and OR, in order that the quantity of light introduced into the room may be sensibly proportional to the sizes of the apertures.\n\nBefore we proceed to detail the other experiments of Bouguer, we shall notice some which were made previous to them by Buffon on the diminution of light by reflection, and the transmission of it to considerable distances through the air.\n\nBy receiving the light of the sun in a dark room, and comparing it with the same light of the sun reflected by a mirror, he found that at small distances, as four or five feet, about one half was lost by reflection.\n\nWhen the distances were 100, 200, and 300 feet, he could hardly perceive that it lost any of its intensity by being transmitted through such a space of air.\n\nHe afterwards made the same experiments with candles, in the following manner: He placed himself opposite to a looking glass, with a book in his hand, in a dark room; and having one candle lighted in the next room, at the distance of about 40 feet, he had it brought nearer to him by degrees, till he could just distinguish the letters of the book, which was then 24 feet from the candle. He then received the light of the candle, reflected by the looking glass, upon his book, carefully excluding all the light that was reflected from anything else; and he found that the distance of the book from the candle, including the distance from the book to the looking glass (which was only half a foot) was in all 15 feet. He repeated the experiment several times, with nearly the same result; and therefore concluded, that the quantity of direct is to that of reflected light as 576 to 225; so that the light of five candles reflected from a plain mirror is about equal to that of two candles.\n\nFrom these experiments it appeared, that more light was lost by reflection of the candles than of the sun, which M. Buffon thought was owing to this circumstance, that the light issuing from the candle diverges, and therefore falls more obliquely upon the mirror than the light of the sun, the rays of which are nearly parallel.\n\nThese experiments and observations of M. Buffon, though curious, are inferior to those of M. Bouguer, both in extent and accuracy.\n\nIn order to ascertain the difference in the quantity of light reflected by glass and polished metal, he used a smooth piece of glass one line in thickness, and found that when it was placed at an angle of 15 degrees with the incident rays, it reflected 628 parts of 1000 which fell upon it; at the same time that a metallic mirror, which he tried in the same circumstances, reflected only 561 of them. At a less angle of incidence much more light was reflected; so that at an angle of three degrees the glass reflected 700 parts, and the metal something less, as in the former case.\n\nIn the case of unpolished bodies, he found that a piece of white plaster, placed at an angle of 75\u00b0, with the incident rays, reflected 9/10 part of the light that is received from a candle nine inches from it. White paper, in the same circumstances, reflected in the same proportion; but at the distance of three inches, they both reflected 150 parts out of 1000.\n\nProceeding to make farther observations on the subject of reflected light, he premises the two following theorems, which he demonstrates geometrically. 1. When the luminous body is at an infinite distance, and its light is received by a globe, the surface of which has a perfect polish, and absorbs no light, it reflects the light equally in all directions, provided it be received at a considerable distance. He excepts the place where the shadow of the globe falls: because this is no more than a single point, with respect to the immensity of the spherical surface which receives the light.\n\n2. The quantity of light reflected in one certain direction will always be exactly the same, whether it be reflected by a very great number of small polished hemispheres, by a less number of larger hemispheres, or by a single hemisphere, provided they occupy the same base, or cover the same ground plan.\n\nThe use he proposes to make of these theorems is to assist him in distinguishing whether the light reflected from bodies be owing to the extinction of it within them, or whether the eminences which cover them have not the same effect as the small polished hemispheres above mentioned.\n\nHe begins with observing, that, of the light reflected from mercury, \u00bd at least is lost, and that probably no substances reflect more than this. The rays were received at an angle of 11\u00bd degrees of incidence, that is measured from the surface of the reflecting body, and not from the perpendicular, which, he says, is what we are from this place to understand whenever he mentions the angle of incidence.\n\nWith regard to the quantities of light reflected at different angles of incidence, M. Bouguer found in general, that reflection is stronger at small angles of incidence, and weaker at large ones. The difference is extensive power effective when the rays strike the surface of transparent substances, with different degrees of obliquity; but it is almost as great in some opaque substances, and it was always more or less so in every thing that he tried.\n\nHe found the greatest inequality in black marble, which, though not perfectly polished, yet with an angle of 3\u00b0 3\u2032 of incidence, it reflected almost as well as quicksilver. Of 1000 rays which it received, it returned 600; but when the angle of incidence was 14\u00b0, it reflected only 156; when it was 30\u00b0, it reflected 51; and when it was 86\u00b0, it reflected only 23.\n\nSimilar experiments made with metallic mirrors always gave the differences much less considerable. The greatest was hardly ever an eighth or a ninth part of it, but they were always in the same way.\n\nThe great difference between the quantity of light reflected from the surface of water, at different angles of incidence, is truly surprising. M. Bouguer sometimes suspected, that, when the angles of incidence were very\nvery small, the reflection from water was even greater than from quicksilver; though he rather thought that it was scarcely so great. In very small angles, he says, that water reflects nearly $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the direct light.\n\nThe light reflected from a lake is sometimes $\\frac{1}{4}$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$, or even a greater proportion, of the light that comes directly from the sun, which is an addition to the direct rays of the sun that cannot fail to be very sensible. The direct light of the sun diminishes gradually as it approaches the horizon, while the reflected light at the same time grows stronger: so that there is a certain altitude of the sun, in which the united force of the direct and reflected light will be the greatest possible, and this he says is $12$ or $13$ degrees.\n\nThe light reflected from water at great angles of incidence is extremely small. M. Bouguer was assured, that, when the light was perpendicular, it reflected no more than the $37$th part that quicksilver does in the same circumstances; for it did not appear that water reflects more than the $60$th, or rather the $55$th, part of perpendicular light. When the angle of incidence was $50^\\circ$, the light reflected from the surface of water was about the $32$nd part of that which mercury reflected; and as the reflection from water increases as the angle of incidence diminishes, it was twice as strong in proportion at $39^\\circ$; for it was then the $16$th part of the quantity reflected from mercury.\n\nIn order to procure a common standard by which to measure the proportion of light reflected from various fluid substances, he selected water as the most commodious; and partly by observation and calculation he drew up the following table of the quantity of light reflected from its surface at different angles of incidence.\n\n| Angles of incidence | Rays reflected of 1000 |\n|---------------------|------------------------|\n| $\\frac{1}{2}$       | 721                    |\n| 1                   | 692                    |\n| $\\frac{3}{2}$       | 669                    |\n| 2                   | 639                    |\n| $\\frac{5}{2}$       | 614                    |\n| 5                   | 501                    |\n| $\\frac{7}{2}$       | 499                    |\n| 10                  | 333                    |\n| $\\frac{12}{2}$      | 271                    |\n| 15                  | 211                    |\n\nIn the same manner, he constructed the following table containing the quantity of light reflected from the looking glass not quicksilvered.\n\n| Angles of incidence | Rays reflected of 1000 |\n|---------------------|------------------------|\n| $\\frac{1}{2}$       | 17                     |\n| 1                   | 20                     |\n| $\\frac{3}{2}$       | 25                     |\n| 2                   | 30                     |\n| $\\frac{5}{2}$       | 40                     |\n| 5                   | 50                     |\n| $\\frac{7}{2}$       | 60                     |\n| 10                  | 70                     |\n| $\\frac{12}{2}$      | 80                     |\n| 15                  | 90                     |\n\nWhen water floats upon mercury there will be two images of any object seen by reflection from them, one at the surface of the water, and the other at that of the quicksilver. In the largest angles of incidence, the image at the surface of the water will disappear, which will happen when it is about a $60$th or an $80$th part less luminous than the image at the surface of the quicksilver. Depressing the eye, the image on the water will grow stronger, and that on the quicksilver weaker in proportion; till at last, the latter will be incomparably weaker than the former, and at an angle of about $10$ degrees they will be equally luminous. According to the table, $\\frac{1}{1000}$ of the incident rays are reflected from the water at this angle of $10$ degrees. At the surface of the mercury they were reduced to $500$; and of these, part being reflected back upon it from the under surface of the water, only $333$ remained to make the image from the mercury.\n\nIt has been frequently observed, that there is a remarkably strong reflection into water, with respect to rays of images issuing from the water; and persons under water have by the air seen images of things in the air in a manner peculiarly distinct and beautiful. In order to account for these facts, M. Bouguer observes that from the smallest angles of incidence, to a certain number of degrees, the greatest part of the rays are reflected, perhaps, in as great a proportion as at the surface of metallic mirrors, or of quicksilver; while the other part, which does not escape into the air, is extinguished or absorbed; so that the surface of the transparent body appears opaque on the inside. If the angle of incidence be increased only a few degrees, the strong reflection ceases altogether, a great number of rays escape into the air, and very few are absorbed. As the angle of incidence is farther increased, the quantity of the light reflected becomes less and less; and when it is near $90$ degrees, almost all the rays escape out of the transparent body, its surface losing almost all its power of reflection, and becoming nearly as transparent as when the light falls upon it from without.\n\nThis property belonging to the surfaces of transparent bodies, of absorbing the rays of light, is truly remarkable, and, as there is reason to believe, had not of light at been noticed by any person before M. Bouguer.\n\nThat all the light is reflected at certain angles of incidence from air into denser substances, had frequently been noticed, especially in glass prisms; so that Newton made use of one of them, instead of a mirror, in the reflection by construction of his reflecting telescope. If a beam of a prism light fall upon the air from within these prisms, at an angle of $10$, $20$, or $30$ degrees, the effect will be nearly the same as at the surface of quicksilver, one-fourth or one-third of the rays being extinguished, and two-thirds or three-fourths reflected. This property retains its full force as far as an angle of $49^\\circ 49'$, (the proportion of the fines of the refraction being $31$ and $20$); but if the angle of incidence be increased but one degree, the quantity of light reflected inwards suddenly decreases, and a great part of the rays escape out of the glass, so that the surface becomes suddenly transparent.\n\nAll transparent bodies have the same property, with this difference, that the angle of incidence at which the strong reflection ceases, and at which the light which is not reflected is extinguished, is greater in some than in others. In water this angle is about $41^\\circ 32'$; and in every medium it depends too much on the invariable proportion.\nproportion of the fine of the angle of refraction to the fine of the angle of incidence, that this law alone is sufficient to determine all the phenomena of this new circumstance, at least as to this accidental opacity of the surface.\n\nWhen M. Bouguer proceeded to measure the quantity of light reflected by these internal surfaces at great angles of incidence, he had to struggle with many difficulties; but by using a plate of crystal, he found, that at an angle of 75 degrees, this internal reflection diminished the light 27 or 28 times; and as the external reflection at the same angle diminished the light only 26 times, it follows that the internal reflection is a little stronger than the other.\n\nRepeating these experiments with the same and different pieces of crystal, he sometimes found the two reflections to be equally strong; but, in general, the internal was the stronger.\n\nRefining his observations on the diminution of light, occasioned by the reflection of opaque bodies obliquely situated, he compared it with the appearances of similar substances which reflected the light perpendicularly. Using pieces of silver made very white, he found, that when one of them was placed at an angle of 75 degrees with respect to the light, it reflected only 640 parts out of 1000. He then varied the angle, and also used white plaster and fine Dutch paper, and drew up the following table of the proportion of the light reflected from each of these substances at certain angles.\n\n| Angles of incidence | Silver | Plaster | Dutch Paper |\n|--------------------|--------|---------|-------------|\n| 90                 | 1000   | 1000    | 1000        |\n| 75                 | 802    | 762     | 971         |\n| 60                 | 640    | 640     | 743         |\n| 45                 | 455    | 529     | 507         |\n| 30                 | 319    | 352     | 332         |\n| 15                 | 209    | 194     | 203         |\n\nSupposing the asperities of opaque bodies to consist of very small planes, it appears from these observations, that there are fewer of them in those bodies which reflect the light at small angles of incidence than at greater. None of them had their roughness equivalent to small hemispheres, which would have dispersed the light equally in all directions; and, from the data in the preceding table, he deduces mathematically the number of the planes that compose those surfaces, and that are inclined to the general surface at the angles above-mentioned, supposing that the whole surface contains 1000 of them that are parallel to itself, so as to reflect the light perpendicularly, when the luminous body is situated at right angles with respect to it. His conclusions reduced to a table, corresponding to the preceding, are as follow:\n\n| Inclinations of the small surfaces with respect to the large one. | Silver | Plaster | Paper |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|-------|\n| 0                                                                | 1000   | 1000    | 1000  |\n| 15                                                               | 777    | 736     | 937   |\n| 30                                                               | 554    | 554     | 545   |\n| 45                                                               | 333    | 374     | 358   |\n| 60                                                               | 161    | 176     | 166   |\n| 75                                                               | 53     | 50      | 52    |\n\nThese variations in the number of little planes, expressed in the form of a curve; and afterwards shows, geometrically, what would be the effect if the bodies were enlightened in one direction, and viewed in another. Upon this subject he has several curious theorems and problems; but for these we must refer to the work itself.\n\nSince the planets are more luminous at their edges than at their centres, he concludes, that the bodies which form them are constituted in a manner different from ours; particularly that their opaque surfaces consist of small planes, more of which are inclined to the general surface than they are in terrestrial substances; and that there are in them an infinity of points, which have exactly the same splendour.\n\nM. Bouguer next proceeds to ascertain the quantity of surface occupied by the small planes of each particular inclination, from considering the quantity of light reflected by each, allowing those that have a greater inclination to the common surface to take up proportionably less space than those which are parallel to it. And comparing the quantity of light that would be reflected by small planes thus disposed, with the quantity of light that was actually reflected by the three substances above-mentioned, he found that plaster, notwithstanding its extreme whiteness, absorbs much light; for that, of 1000 rays falling upon it, of which 166 or 167 ought to be reflected at an angle of 77\u00b0, only 67 are in fact returned; so that 100 out of 167 were extinguished, that is, about three-fifths.\n\nWith respect to the planets, Bouguer concludes, that of 300,000 rays which the moon receives, 172,000, or perhaps 204,100, are absorbed.\n\nHaving considered the surfaces of bodies as consisting of planes only, he observes that each small surface, separately taken, is extremely irregular, some of them being really concave, and others convex; but, in reducing them to a middle state, they are to be regarded as planes. Nevertheless he considers them as planes only with respect to the reception of the rays; for as they are almost all curves, and as, besides this, many of those whose situation is different from others contribute to the same effects, the rays always issue from an actual or imaginary focus, and after reflection always diverge from another.\n\nThe experiments of Lambert, related in his *Photometria*, have laid open to us many curious observations concerning the natural history of light. He was the first who determined that a radiating surface emits its light with nearly the same intensity in all directions, so that\nthat every portion of it appears equally bright to an observer placed in any direction.\n\nWe are obliged to Mr Melville for some ingenious observations on the manner in which bodies are heated by light. He observes, that, as each colorific particle of an opaque body must be somewhat moved by the reflection of the particles of light, when it is reflected backwards and forwards between the same particles, it is manifest that they must likewise be agitated with a vibratory motion, and the time of a vibration will be equal to that which light takes up in moving from one particle of a body to another adjoining. This distance, in the most solid opaque bodies, cannot be supposed greater than \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of an inch, which space light describes in the \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of a second. With so rapid a motion, therefore, may the internal parts of bodies be agitated by the influence of light, as to perform \\( 125,000,000,000,000 \\) vibrations, or more, in a second of time.\n\nThe arrival of different particles of light at the surface of the same colorific particle, in the same or different rays, may disturb the regularity of its vibrations, but will evidently increase their frequency, or raise still smaller vibrations among the parts which compose those particles; whence the internal motion will become more subtle, and more thoroughly diffused. If the quantity of light admitted into the body be increased, the vibrations of the particles must likewise increase in magnitude and velocity, till at last they may be so violent, as to make all the component particles dash one another to pieces by their mutual collision; in which case, the colour and texture of the body must be destroyed.\n\nSince there is no reflection of light but at the surface of a medium, the same gentleman observes, that the greatest quantity of rays, though crowded into the smallest space, will not of themselves produce any heat. Hence it follows, that the portion of air which lies in the focus of the most potent speculum, is not at all affected by the passage of light through it, but continues of the same temperature with the ambient air; though any opaque body, or even any transparent body denser than air, when put in the same place, would, in an instant be intensely heated.\n\nThe easiest way to be satisfied of this truth experimentally is, to hold a hair, or a piece of down, immediately above the focus of a lens or speculum, or to blow a stream of smoke from a pipe horizontally over it; for if the air in the focus were hotter than the surrounding fluid, it would continually ascend on account of its rarefaction, and thereby sensibly agitate those slender bodies. Or a lens may be so placed as to form its focus within a body of water, or some other transparent substance, the heat of which may be examined from time to time with a thermometer; but care must be taken, in this experiment, to hold the lens as near as possible to the transparent body, lest the rays, by falling closer than ordinary on its surface, should warm it more than the common sunbeams. See Priestley on Vision.\n\nThe attempts of Abb\u00e9 Nollet to fire inflammable substances by the concentration of the solar rays, have a near relation to the present subject. He attempted to fire liquid substances, but he was not able to do it either with spirit of wine, olive oil, oil of turpentine, or ether; and though he could fire sulphur, yet he could not succeed with Spanish wax, rosin, black pitch, or fuel. He both threw the focus of these mirrors upon the substances themselves, and also upon the fumes that rose from them; but the only effect was, that the liquor boiled, and was dispersed in vapour or very small drops. When linen rags, and other solid substances, were moistened with any of these inflammable liquids, they would not take fire till the liquid was dispersed in a copious fume; so that the rags thus prepared were longer in burning than those that were dry.\n\nM. Beaume, who assisted M. Nollet in some of these experiments, observed farther, that the same substances, which were easily fired by the flame of burning bodies, could not be set on fire by the contact of the hottest bodies that did not actually flame. Neither ether nor spirit of wine could be fired with a hot coal, or even red-hot iron, unless they were of a white heat.\n\nBy the help of optical principles, and especially by observations on the reflection of light, Mr Melville demonstrated that bodies which seem to touch one another, are not always in actual contact. Upon examining the leaves of colewort, and some other vegetables, he found that the lustre of the drop is produced by a copious reflection of light from the flattened part of its surface, contiguous to the plant. He found also, that, when the drop rolls along a part which has been wetted, it immediately loses all its lustre, the green plant being then seen clearly through it; whereas, in the other case, it is hardly to be discerned.\n\nFrom these two observations, he concluded, that the drop does not really touch the plant, when it has the mercurial appearance, but is suspended in the air at some distance from it by a repulsive force. For there could not be any copious reflection of white light from its under surface, unless there were a real interval between it and the surface of the plant.\n\nIf that surface were perfectly smooth, the under surface of the drop would be so likewise, and would therefore show an image of the illuminating body by reflection, like a piece of polished silver; but as it is considerably rough, the under surface becomes rough likewise, and thus by reflecting the light copiously in different directions, affumes the brilliant hue of unpolished silver.\n\nIt being thus proved by an optical argument, that the drop is not really in contact with the leaf, it may easily be conceived whence its volatility arises, and why it leaves no moisture where it rolls.\n\nBefore we conclude the history of the observations concerning the reflection of light, we must not omit to take notice of two singular miscellaneous observations, observations Baron Alexander Funk, visiting some silver mines in Sweden, observed, that, in a clear day, it was as dark as pitch below ground, in the eye of a pit, at 60 or 70 fathoms deep; whereas, in a cloudy or rainy day, he could even see to read at the depth of 106 fathoms. He imagined that it arose from this circumstance, that when the atmosphere is full of clouds, light is reflected from them into the pit in all directions, and that thereby a considerable proportion of the rays are reflected perpendicularly upward toward the earth; whereas, when the atmosphere is clear, there are no opaque bodies to reflect the light in this manner, at least in a sufficient quantity; and rays from the sun itself can never fall perpendicularly in that country.\nThe other observation was that of the ingenious Mr Grey. He took a piece of stiff brown paper, and pricking a small hole in it, he held it at a little distance before him; when, applying a needle to his eye, he was surprized to see the point of it inverted. The nearer the needle was to the hole, the more it was magnified, but the less distinct; and if it was so held, that its image was near the edge of the hole, its point seemed crooked. From these appearances he concluded, that these small holes, or something in them, produce the effects of concave speculums; and from this circumstance he took the liberty to call them aerial speculums.\n\nThis method of accounting for the inverted image of the pin is evidently erroneous; for the same effect is produced, when the small aperture is formed of two semi-apertures at different distances from the eye, or when a small opening is made in the pigment on a piece of smoked glass. We have found indeed that the same phenomenon will appear, if, instead of looking at a hole in a piece of paper, we view a small luminous point so that it is expanded by indistinct vision into a circular image of light. The pin always increases in magnitude in proportion to its distance from the luminous point.\n\nSect. III. Discoveries concerning the Inflection of Light.\n\nThis property of light was not discovered till about the middle of the 17th century. The person who first made the discovery was Father Grimaldi; at least he first published an account of it in his treatise De lumine, coloribus, et iride, printed in 1666. Dr Hooke, however, laid claim to the same discovery, though he did not make his observations public till six years after Grimaldi.\n\nDr Hooke's discoveries. Dr Hooke having darkened his room, admitted a beam of the sun's light through a very small hole in a brass plate. This beam spreading itself, formed a cone, the vertex of which was in the hole, and the base was on a paper, so placed as to receive it at some distance. In the image of the sun, thus painted on the paper, he observed that the middle was much brighter than the edges, and that there was a kind of dark penumbra about it, of about a 16th part of the diameter of the circle; which he ascribed to a property of light, that he promised to explain.\u2014Having observed this, at the distance of about two inches from the former he let in another cone of light; and receiving the bases of them, at such a distance from the holes that the circles intersected each other, he observed that there was not only a darker ring, encompassing the lighter circle, but a manifest dark line, or circle, as in fig. 6, which appeared even where the limb of the one interfered with that of the other.\n\nIn the light thus admitted, he held an opaque body BB, fig. 7, so as to intercept the light that entered at a hole in the window shutter O, and was received on the screen AP. In these circumstances, he observed, that the shadow of the opaque body (which was a round piece of wood, not bright or polished) was all over somewhat enlightened, but more especially towards the edge. In order to show that this light was not produced by reflection, he admitted the light through a hole burnt in a piece of pasteboard, and intercepted it with a razor which had a very sharp edge; but still the appearances were the very same as before; so that he concluded that they were occasioned by some new property of light.\n\nHe diversified this experiment, by placing the razor so as to divide the cone of light into two parts, and placing the paper so that none of the enlightened part of the circle fell upon it, but only the shadow of the razor; and, to his great surprize, he observed what he calls a very brisk and visible radiation striking down upon the paper, of the same breadth with the diameter of the lucid circle. This radiation always struck perpendicularly from the line of shadow, and, like the tail of a comet, extended more than ten times the breadth of the remaining part of the circle. He found, wherever there was a part of the interposed body higher than the rest, that, opposite to it, the radiation of light into the shadow was brighter, as in the figure; and wherever there was a notch or gap in it, there would be a dark stroke in the half-enlightened shadow. From all these appearances, he concluded, that there is a deflection of light, differing both from reflection and refraction, and seeming to depend on the unequal density of the constituent parts of the ray, whereby the light is dispersed from the place of condensation, and rarefied, or gradually diverged into a quadrant; that this deflection is made towards the superficies of the opaque body perpendicularly; that those parts of the diverged radiations which are deflected by the greatest angle from the straight or direct radiations are the fainest, and those that are deflected by the least angles are the strongest; that rays cutting each other in one common aperture do not make the angles at the vertex equal; that colours may be made without refraction; that the diameter of the sun cannot be truly taken with common sights; that the same rays of light, falling upon the same point of an object, will turn into all sorts of colours, by the various inclinations of the object; and that colours begin to appear when two pulses of light are blended so well, and so near together, that the sense takes them for one.\n\nWe shall now proceed to give an account of the discoveries of Father Grimaldi. Having introduced a ray of light, through a very small hole, AE, fig. 8, into a Fig. 8 darkened room, he observed that the light was diffused in the form of a cone, the base of which was CD; and that if any opaque body, FE, was placed in this cone of light, at a considerable distance from the hole, and the shadow received upon a piece of white paper, the boundaries of it were not confined within GH, or the penumbra II., occasioned by the light proceeding from different parts of the aperture, and of the disk of the sun, but extended to MN: At this he was very much surprised, as he found that it was broader than it ought to have been made by rays passing in right lines by the edges of the object.\n\nBut the most remarkable circumstance in this appearance was, that upon the lucid part of the base, CM and ND, streaks of coloured light were plainly distinguished, each being terminated by blue on the side next the shadow, and by red on the other; and though these coloured streaks depended, in some measure on the size of the aperture AB, because they could not be made to appear if it was large, yet he found that they were not limited either by it, or by the diameter of the sun's disk.\n\nHe farther observed, that these coloured streaks were\nwere not all of the same breadth, but grew narrower as they receded from the shadow, and were each of them broader the farther the shadow was received from the opaque body, and also the more obliquely the paper on which they were received was held with respect to it. He never observed more than three of these streaks.\n\nTo give a clearer idea of these coloured streaks, he drew the representation of them, exhibited in fig. 9, in which NMO represents the largest and most luminous streak, next to the dark shadow X. In the space in which M is placed there was no diffusion of colour, but the space NN was blue, and the space OO on the other side of it was red. The second streak QPR was narrower than the former; and of the three parts of which it consisted, the space P had no particular colour, but QQ was a faint blue, and RR a faint red. The third streak TSV was exactly similar to the two others, but narrower than either of them, and the colour still fainter.\n\nThese coloured streaks he observed to lie parallel to the shadow of the opaque body; but when it was of an angular form, they did not make the same acute angles, but were bent into a curve, the outermost being rounder than those that were next the shadow, as is represented in fig. 10. If it was an inward angle, as DCH, the coloured streaks, parallel to each other of the two sides crossed without obliterating one another; only the colours were thus rendered either more intense or mixed.\n\nWithin the shadow itself, Grimaldi sometimes perceived coloured streaks, similar to those above mentioned on the outside of the shadow. Sometimes he saw more of them, and sometimes fewer; but for this purpose it was necessary to have strong light, and to make the opaque body long and moderately broad. A hair, for instance, or a fine needle, did not answer so well as a thin and narrow plate; and the streaks were most distinguishable when the shadow was taken at the greatest distance; though the light grew fainter in the same proportion.\n\nThe numbers of these streaks increased with the breadth of the plate. They were at least two, and sometimes four, if a thicker plate were made use of. But, with the same plate, more or fewer streaks appeared, in proportion to the distance at which the shadow was received; but they were broader when they were few, and narrower when there were more of them; and they were all much more distinct when the paper was held obliquely.\n\nThese coloured streaks, like those on the outside of the shadow, were bent in an arch, round the acute angles of the shadow, as they are represented in fig. 11. At this angle also, as at D, other shorter lucid streaks were visible, bent in the form of a plume, as they are drawn between D and C, each bending round and meeting again in D. These angular streaks appeared, though the plate or rod was not wholly immersed in the beam of light, but the angle of it only; and they increased in number with the breadth of the plate. If the plate was very thin, the coloured streaks bent round from the opposite sides, and met one another as at B.\n\nIn order to obtain a more satisfactory proof, that rays of light really bend, in passing by the edges of bodies, he admitted a beam of light into a dark room, as before; and, at a great distance from it, he fixed a plate EF, (fig. 12.) with a small aperture, GH, which admitted only a part of the beam of light, and found, that when the light transmitted through this plate was received at some distance upon a white paper, the base IK was considerably larger than it could possibly have been made by rays issuing in right lines through the two apertures. Grimaldi generally made the aperture CD \\( \\frac{4}{100} \\) or \\( \\frac{5}{100} \\) part of a foot, and the second aperture, GH, \\( \\frac{3}{100} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{100} \\); and the distances DG and GN, were, at least, 12 feet. The observation was made about mid-day in the summer time, when the atmosphere was free from all vapours.\n\nGrimaldi also made the same experiment that has been recited from Dr Hooke, in which two beams of light, entering a dark room by two small apertures near one another, projected cones of light, which, at a certain distance, in part coincided; and he particularly observed, that the dark boundaries of each of them were visible within the lucid ground of the other.\n\nTo these discoveries of Grimaldi, we shall subjoin an additional observation of Dechales; who found, that if a piece of polished metal, with small scratches in it, be exposed to the beams of the sun in a darkened room, it will reflect the rays streaked with colours in the direction of the scratches; as will appear, if the reflected light be received upon a piece of white paper. That these colours are not produced by refraction, he says, is manifest; for if the scratches be made upon glass, the effect will be the same; and in this case, if the light had been refracted at the surface of the glass, it would have been transmitted through it. From these and many other observations, he concluded, that colour does not depend upon the refraction of light only, nor upon a variety of other circumstances, which he particularly enumerates, but upon the intensity of the light only.\n\nWe shall here give an account of a phenomenon of vision observed by M. de la Hire, as being connected with the subject of this section. When we look at a candle, or any luminous body, with our eyes nearly shut, rays of light are extended from it, in several directions, to a considerable distance, like the tails of comets. This appearance exercised the sagacity of Descartes and Rohault, as well as of De la Hire; but all these philosophers seem to have been mistaken with regard to its cause. Descartes ascribed this effect to certain wrinkles in the surface of the humours of the eyes. Rohault says, that when the eye-lids are nearly closed, the edges of them act like convex lenses. But De la Hire observes, that the moisture on the surface of the eye, adhering partly to the eye itself, and partly to the edge of the eye-lid, makes a concave mirror, and so disperses the rays at their entrance into the eye. The true account of the phenomenon, however, is this. There are three different kinds of radiations distinctly visible; the most brilliant, which diverge directly from the candle, are formed by the refraction of the light of the candle through the moisture that lubricates the eye, and which is brought opposite the pupil by one of the eye-lids. Another kind of radiation, which appears at a distance from the candle in the form of small luminous specks, is produced by reflection from the part of the eye-lid in which the lashes...\nare inflected. The third kind of radiation is horizontal, and is caused by the inflection of the light in passing between the eye-lashes.\n\nThe experiments of Grimaldi and Hooke were repeated and extended by Sir Isaac Newton, and were in some measure explained by that distinguished philosopher.\n\nHe made in a piece of lead a small hole the 42d part of an inch in diameter. Through this hole he let into his dark chamber a beam of the sun's light; and found, that the shadows of hairs, and other slender substances, placed in it, were considerably broader than they would have been if the rays of light had passed by those bodies in right lines. He therefore concluded, that they must have palled as they are represented in fig. 1, in which X represents a section of the hair, and AD, BE, &c., rays of light passing by at different distances, and then falling upon the wall GQ. Since, when the paper which receives the rays is at a great distance from the hair, the shadow is broad, it must follow, that the hair acts upon the rays at some considerable distance from it, the action being strongest on those rays which are at the least distance, and growing weaker and weaker on those which are farther off, as is represented in this figure; and hence it comes to pass that the shadow of the hair is much broader in proportion to the distance of the paper from the hair when it is nearer than when it is at a greater distance.\n\nBy wetting a polished plate of glass, and laying the hair in the water upon the glass, and then laying another polished plate of glass upon it, so that the water might fill up the space between the glasses, he found that the shadow at the same distance was as big as before, so that this breadth of shadow must proceed from some other cause than the refraction of the air.\n\nThe shadows of all bodies placed in this light were bordered with three parallel fringes of coloured light, of which that which was nearest to the shadow was the broadest and most luminous, while that which was farthest from it was the narrowest, and so faint as to be scarcely visible. It was difficult to distinguish these colours, unless when the light fell very obliquely upon some smooth white body, so as to make them appear much broader than they would otherwise have done; but in these circumstances the colours were plainly visible, and in the following order. The first or innermost fringe was violet, and deep blue next the shadow, light blue, green, and yellow in the middle, and red without. The second fringe was almost contiguous to the first, and the third to the second; and both were blue within, and yellow and red without; but their colours were very faint, especially those of the third. The colours, therefore, proceeded in the following order from the shadow; violet, indigo, pale blue, green, yellow, red; blue, yellow, red; pale blue, pale yellow, and red. The shadows, made by scratches and bubbles in polished plates of glass were bordered with the like fringes of coloured light.\n\nMeasuring these fringes and their intervals with the greatest accuracy, he found the former to be in the progression of the numbers $1, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}$, and their intervals to be in the same progression with them, that is, the fringes and their intervals together to be nearly in continual progression of the numbers, $1, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}}$.\n\nHaving made the aperture $\\frac{1}{8}$ of an inch in diameter, and admitted the light as formerly, Sir Isaac placed, at the distance of two or three feet from the hole, a sheet of pasteboard, black on both sides; and in the middle of it he made a hole about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an inch square, and behind the hole he fastened to the pasteboard the blade of a sharp knife, to intercept some part of the light which passed through the hole. The planes of the pasteboard and blade of the knife were parallel to each other, and perpendicular to the rays; and when they were so placed that none of the light fell on the pasteboard, but all of it passed through the hole to the knife, and there part of it fell upon the blade of the knife, and part of it passed by its edge, he let that part of the light which passed fall on a white paper, 2 or 3 feet beyond the knife, and there he saw two streams of faint light shoot out both ways from the beam of light into the shadow. But because the sun's direct light, by its brightness upon the paper, obscured these faint streams, so that he could scarcely see them, he made a little hole in the midst of the paper for that light to pass through and fall on a black cloth behind it; and then he saw the two streams plainly. They were similar to one another, and pretty nearly equal in length, breadth, and quantity of light. Their light, at that end which was next to the sun's direct light, was pretty strong for the space of about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an inch, or $\\frac{1}{2}$ of an inch, and gradually decreased till it became insensible.\n\nThe whole length of either of these streams, measured upon the paper, at the distance of 3 feet from the knife, was about 6 or 8 inches; so that it subtended an angle, at the edge of the knife, of about 10 or 12, or at most 14, degrees. Yet sometimes he thought he saw it shoot 3 or 4 degrees farther; but with a light so very faint, that he could hardly perceive it. This light he suspected might, in part at least, arise from some other cause than the two streams. For, placing his eye in that light, beyond the end of that stream which was behind the knife, and looking towards the knife, he could see a line of light upon its edge; and that not only when his eye was in the line of the streams, but also when it was out of that line, either towards the point of the knife, or towards the handle. This line of light appeared contiguous to the edge of the knife, and was narrower than the light of the innermost fringe, and narrowest when his eye was farthest from the direct light; and therefore seemed to pass between the light of that fringe and the edge of the knife; and that which passed nearest the edge seemed to be most bent.\n\nHe then placed another knife by the former, so that their edges might be parallel, and look towards one another, and that the beam of light might fall upon both the knives, and some part of it pass between their edges. In this situation he observed, that when the distance of their edges was about the 400th of an inch, the stream divided in the middle, and left a shadow between the two parts. This shadow was so dark, that all the light which passed between the knives seemed to be bent to the one hand or the other; and as the knives still approached each other, the shadow grew broader and the streams shorter next to it, till, upon the contact of the knives, all the light vanished.\n\nHence Sir Isaac concluded, that the light which is least bent, and which goes to the inward ends of the streams, passes by the edges of the knives at the greatest distance;\ndistance; and this distance, when the shadow began to appear between the streams, was about the 800th of an inch; and the light which passed by the edges of the knives at distances still less and less, was more and more faint, and went to those parts of the streams which were farther from the direct light; because, when the knives approached one another till they touched, those parts of the stream vanished last which were farthest from the direct line.\n\nIn the experiment of one knife only, the coloured fringes did not appear; but, on account of the breadth of the hole in the window, became so broad as to run into one another, and, by joining, to make one continual light in the beginning of the streams; but in the last experiment, as the knives approached one another, a little before the shadow appeared between the two streams, the fringes began to appear on the inner ends of the streams, on either side of the direct light; three on one side, made by the edge of one knife, and three on the other side, made by the edge of the other knife. They were the most distinct when the knives were placed at the greatest distance from the hole in the window, and became still more distinct by making the hole less; so that he could sometimes see a faint trace of a fourth fringe beyond the three above mentioned: and as the knives approached one another the fringes grew more distinct and larger, till they vanished; the outermost vanishing first, and the innermost last. After they were all vanished, and the line of light in the middle between them was grown very broad, extending itself on both sides into the streams of light described before, the above-mentioned shadow began to appear in the middle of this line, and to divide it along the middle into two lines of light, and increased till all the light vanished. This enlargement of the fringes was so great, that the rays which went to the innermost fringe seemed to be bent about 20 times more when the fringe was ready to vanish, than when one of the knives was taken away.\n\nFrom both these experiments Newton concluded, that the light of the first fringe passed by the edge of the knife at a distance greater than the 800th of an inch; that the light of the second fringe passed by the edge of the knife at a greater distance than the light of the first fringe, and that of the third at a greater distance than that of the second; and that the light of which the streams above mentioned consisted, passed by the edges of the knives at less distances than that of any of the fringes.\n\nHe then got the edges of two knives ground straight, and fixed their points into a board, so that their edges might contain a rectilinear angle. The distance of the edges of the knives from one another, at four inches from the angular point, was the 8th of an inch; so that the angle contained by their edges was about 1\u00b0 54\u2032. The knives being thus fixed, he placed them in a beam of the sun\u2019s light let into his darkened chamber, through a hole the 42d of an inch wide, at the distance of 10 or 13 feet from the hole; and he let the light which passed between their edges fall very obliquely upon a smooth white ruler, at the distance of \u00be inch, or an inch, from the knives; and there he saw the fringes made by the two edges of the knives run along the edges of the shadows of the knives, in lines parallel to those edges, without growing sensibly broader, till they met in angles equal to the angle contained by the edges of the knives; and where they met and joined, they ended, without crossing one another. But if the ruler was held at a much greater distance from the knives, the fringes, where they were farther from the place of their meeting, were a little narrower, and they became something broader as they approached nearer to one another, and after they met they crossed one another, and then became much broader than before.\n\nFrom these observations he concluded, that the distances at which the light composing the fringes passed by the knives were not increased or altered by the approach; and that the knife which was nearest to any ray determined which way the ray should be bent, but that the other knife increased the bending.\n\nWhen the rays fell very obliquely upon the ruler, at the distance of \u00bc of an inch from the knives, the dark line between the first and second fringe of the shadow of one knife, and the dark line between the first and second fringe of the shadow of the other knife, met one another, at the distance of \u00bd of an inch from the end of the light which passed between the knives, where their edges met; so that the distance of the edges of the knives, at the meeting of the dark lines, was the 160th of an inch; and one half of that light passed by the edge of one knife, at a distance not greater than the 320th part of an inch, and, falling upon the paper, made the fringes of the shadow of that knife; while the other half passed by the edge of the other knife, at a distance not greater than the 320th part of an inch, and, falling upon the paper, made the fringes of the shadow of the other knife. But if the paper was held at a distance from the knives greater than \u00bc of an inch, the dark lines above mentioned met at a greater distance than \u00bd of an inch from the end of the light which passed between the knives, at the meeting of their edges; so that the light which fell upon the paper where those dark lines met passed between the knives, where their edges were farther distant than the 160th of an inch. For at another time, when the two knives were 8 feet 5 inches from the little hole in the window, the light which fell upon the paper where the above-mentioned dark lines met passed between the knives, where the distance between their edges was, as in the following table, at the distances from the paper noted.\n\n| Distances of the paper from the knives in inches | Distances between the edges of the knives in thousandths of an inch |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 \u00bc                                              | 0.012                                                            |\n| 3 \u00bc                                              | 0.020                                                            |\n| 8 \u00bc                                              | 0.034                                                            |\n| 32                                               | 0.057                                                            |\n| 96                                               | 0.081                                                            |\n| 131                                              | 0.087                                                            |\n\nFrom these observations he concluded, that the light which forms the fringes upon the paper is not the same light at all distances of the paper from the knives; but that when the paper is held near the knives, the fringes are made by light which passes by\nthe edges of the knives at a less distance, and is more bent than when the paper is held at a greater distance from the knives.\n\nWhen the fringes of the shadows of the knives fell perpendicularly upon the paper, at a great distance from the knives, they were in the form of hyperbolas, of the following dimensions. Let CA, CB, (fig. 2.) represent lines drawn upon the paper, parallel to the edges of the knives; and between which all the light would fall if it suffered no inflection. DE is a right line drawn through C, making the angles ACD, BCE, equal to one another, and terminating all the light which falls upon the paper, from the point where the edges of the knives meet. Then eis, fkt, and gtv, will be three hyperbolic lines, representing the boundaries of the shadow of one of the knives, the dark line between the first and second fringes of that shadow, and the dark line between the second and third fringes of the same shadow. Also xip, ykq, and zlr, will be three other hyperbolic lines, representing the boundaries of the shadow of the other knife, the dark line between the first and second fringes of that shadow, and the dark line between the second and third fringes of the same shadow. These three hyperbolas which are similar, and equal to the former, cross them in the points i, k, and l; so that the shadows of the knives are terminated, and distinguished from the first luminous fringes, by the lines eis and xip, till the meeting and crossing of the fringes; and then those lines cross the fringes in the form of dark lines terminating the first luminous fringes on the inside, and distinguishing them from another light, which begins to appear at i, and illuminates all the triangular space ipDE, comprehended by these dark lines and the right line DE. Of these hyperbolas one asymptote is the line DE, and the other asymptotes are parallel to the lines CA and CB.\n\nBefore the small hole in the window Newton placed a prism, to form on the opposite wall the coloured image of the sun; and he found that the shadows of all bodies held in the coloured light, were bordered with fringes of the colour of the light in which they were held; and he found that those made in the red light were the largest, those made in the violet the least, and those made in the green of a middle bigness. The fringes with which the shadow of a man's hair were surrounded, being measured across the shadow, at the distance of six inches from the hair, the distance between the middle and most luminous part of the first or innermost fringe on one side of the shadow, and that of the like fringe on the other side of the shadow, was, in the full red light \\(\\frac{1}{37.5}\\) of an inch, and in the full violet \\(\\frac{1}{48}\\). The like distance between the middle and most luminous parts of the second fringes, on either side of the shadow, was in the full red light \\(\\frac{1}{37}\\), and in the violet \\(\\frac{1}{47}\\) of an inch; and these distances of the fringes held the same proportion at all distances from the hair, without any sensible variation.\n\nFrom these observations it was evident, that the rays which formed the fringes in the red light, passed by the hair at a greater distance than those which made the like fringes in the violet; so that the hair, in causing these fringes, acted alike upon the red light or least refrangible rays at a greater distance, and upon the violet or most refrangible rays at a less distance; and thereby occasioned fringes of different sizes, without any change in the colour of any sort of light.\n\nIt may therefore be concluded, that when the hair was held in the white beam of light, and cast a shadow bordered with three coloured fringes, those colours arose not from any new modifications impressed upon the rays of light by the hair, but only from the various inflections by which the several sorts of rays were separated from one another, which before separation, by the mixture of all their colours, composed the white beam of the sun's light; but, when separated, composed lights of the several colours which they are originally disposed to exhibit.\n\nThe person who first made any experiments similar to Maraldi's, those of Newton on inflected light is M. Maraldi. His discoveries, observations chiefly respect the inflection of light towards other bodies, whereby their shadows are partially illuminated.\n\nHe exposed in the light of the sun a cylinder of wood three feet long, and 6\u00bd lines in diameter, when its shadow was everywhere equally black and well defined, even at the distance of 23 inches from it. At a greater distance the shadow appeared of two different densities; for its two extremities, in the direction of the length of the cylinder, were terminated by two dark strokes, a little more than a line in breadth. Within these dark lines there was a faint light, equally dispersed through the shadow, which formed an uniform penumbra, much lighter than the dark strokes at the extremity, or than the shadow received near the cylinder. This appearance is represented in Plate CCCLXXVI., fig. 3.\n\nAs the cylinder was removed to a greater distance from the paper, the two black lines continued to be nearly of the same breadth, and the same degree of obscurity; but the penumbra in the middle grew lighter, and its breadth diminished, so that the two dark lines at the extremity of the shadow approached one another, till at the distance of 60 inches, they coincided, and the penumbra in the middle entirely vanished. At a still greater distance a faint penumbra was visible; but it was ill defined, and grew broader as the cylinder was removed farther off, but was sensible at a very great distance.\n\nBesides the black and dark shadow which the cylinder formed near the opaque body, a narrow and faint penumbra was seen on the outside of the dark shadow. And on the outside of this there was a tract more strongly illuminated than the rest of the paper.\n\nThe breadth of the external penumbra increased with the distance of the shadow from the cylinder, and the breadth of the tract of light on the outside of it was also enlarged; but its splendour diminished with the distance.\n\nHe repeated these experiments with three other cylinders of different dimensions; and from all of them he inferred, that every opaque cylindrical body, exposed to the light of the sun, makes a shadow which is black and dark to the distance of 38 to 45 diameters of the cylinder which forms it; and that, at a greater distance, the middle part begins to be illuminated in the manner described above.\n\nIn explaining these appearances, Maraldi supposes that\nthat the light which diluted the middle part of the shadow was occasioned by the inflection of the rays, which, bending inwards on their near approach to the body, did at a certain distance enlighten all the shadow, except the edges, which were left undisturbed. At the same time other rays were deflected from the body, and formed a strong light on the outside of the shadow, and which might at the same time contribute to dilute the outer shadow, though he supposed that penumbra to be occasioned principally by that part of the paper not being enlightened, except by a part of the sun's disk only, according to the known principles of optics.\n\nThe same experiments he made with globes of several diameters; but he found, that the shadows of the globes were not visible beyond 1\u00bd of their diameters; which he thought was owing to the light being inflected on every side of a globe, and consequently in such a quantity as to disperse the shadows sooner than in the case of the cylinders.\n\nIn repeating the experiments of Grimaldi and Newton, he observed that, besides the enlarged shadow of a hair, a fine needle, &c., the bright gleam of light that bordered it, and the three coloured fringes next to this enlightened part, when the shadow was at a considerable distance from the hair, the dark central shadow was divided in the middle by a mixture of light; and that it was not of the same density, except when it was very near the hair.\n\nA brittle, at the distance of nine feet from the hole, made a shadow, which, being received at five or six feet from the object, he observed to consist of several streaks of light and shade. The middle part was a faint shadow, or rather a kind of penumbra, bordered by a darker shadow, and after that by a narrower penumbra; next to which was a light streak broader than the dark part, and next to the streak of light, the red, violet, and blue colours were seen as in the shadow of the hair.\n\nA plate, two inches long, and about half a line broad, being fixed perpendicularly to the rays, at the distance of nine feet from the hole, a faint light was seen uniformly dispersed over the shadow, when it was received perpendicularly to it, and very near. The shadow of the same plate, received at the distance of two feet and a half, was divided into four narrow black streaks, separated by small lighter intervals equal to them. The boundaries of this shadow on each side had a penumbra, which was terminated by a very strong light, next to which were the coloured streaks of red, violet, and blue, as before. This is represented in Plate CCCLXXVI, fig. 4.\n\nThe shadow of the same plate, at 4\u00bd feet distance from it, was divided into two black streaks only, the two outermost having disappeared, as in fig. 5; but these two black streaks which remained were broader than before, and separated by a lighter shade, twice as broad as one of the former black streaks, when the shadow was taken at 2\u00bd feet. This penumbra in the middle had a tinge of red. After the two black streaks there appeared a pretty strong penumbra, terminated by the two streaks of light, which were now broad and splendid, after which followed the coloured streaks.\n\nA second plate, 2 inches long and a line broad, being placed, 14 feet from the hole, its shadow was received perpendicularly very near the plate, and was found to be illuminated by a faint light, equally dispersed, as in the case of the preceding plate. But being received at the distance of 13 feet from the plate, five small black streaks began to be visible, as in fig. 6. At 17 feet the black streaks were broader, more distinct, and more separated from the streaks that were less dark. At 42 feet, only two black streaks were seen in the middle of the penumbra, as in fig. 7. This middle penumbra between the two black streaks was tinged with red. Next to the black streaks there always appeared the streaks of light, which were broad, and the coloured streaks next to them. At the distance of 72 feet, the appearances were the same as in the former situation, except that the two black streaks were broader, and the interval between them, occupied by the penumbra, was broader also, and tinged with a deeper red. With plates from \u00bc line to 2 lines broad, he could not observe any of the streaks of light, though the shadows were in some cases 56 feet from them.\n\nThe extraordinary size of the shadows of small substances M. Maraldi thought to be occasioned by the shadow from the enlightened part of the sky, added to that which was made by the light of the sun, and also to a vortex occasioned by the circulation of the inflected light behind the object.\n\nMaraldi having made the preceding experiments upon single long substances, placed two of them so as to cross one another in a beam of the sun's light. The shadows of two hairs placed in this manner, and received at some distance from them, appeared to be painted reciprocally one upon the other, so that the obscure part of one of them was visible upon the obscure part of the other. The streaks of light also crossed one another, and the coloured streaks did the same.\n\nHe also placed in the rays of the sun a brittle and a plate of iron a line thick, so that they crossed one another obliquely; and when their shadows were received at the same distance, the light and dark streaks of the shadow of the brittle were visible so far as the middle of the shadow of the plate on the side of the acute angle, but not on the side of the obtuse angle, whether the brittle or the plate were placed next to the rays. The plate made a shadow sufficiently dark, divided into six black streaks; and these were again divided by as many light ones equal to them; and yet all the streaks belonging to the shadow of the brittle were visible upon it, as in fig. 8. To explain this appearance, he supposed that the rays of the sun glided a little along the brittle, so as to enlighten part of that which was behind the plate. But this seems to be an arbitrary and improbable supposition.\n\nM. Maraldi also placed small globes in the solar light, admitted through a small aperture, and compared their shadows with those of the long substances, as he had done in the daylight, and the appearances were still familiar. It was evident, that there was much more light in the shadows of the globes than in those of the cylinders, not only when they were both of an equal diameter, but when that of the globe was larger than that of the cylinder, and the shadows of both the bodies were received at the same distance. He also observed, that he could perceive no difference of light in the shadows...\nof the plates which were a little more than one line broad, though they were received at the distance of 72 feet; but he could observe a difference of shades in those of the globes, taken at the same distance, though they were 2\u00bd lines in diameter.\n\nIn order to explain the colours at the edges of these shadows, he threw some of the shadows upon others.\n\nHe threw the gleam of light, which always intervened between the colours and the darker part of the shadow, upon different parts of other shadows; and observed, that, when it fell upon the exterior penumbra made by another needle, it produced a beautiful sky-blue colour, almost like that which was produced by two blue colours thrown together. When the same gleam of light fell upon the deeper shadow in the middle, it produced a red colour.\n\nHe placed two plates of iron, each three or four lines broad, at a very small distance; and having placed them in the rays of the sun, and received their shadows at the distance of 15 or 20 feet from them, he saw no light between them but a continued shadow, in the middle of which were some parallel streaks of a lively purple, separated by other black streaks; but between them there were other streaks, both of a very faint green, and also of a pale yellow.\n\nThe subject of inflection was next investigated by M. Mairan: but he only endeavoured to explain the facts which were known, by the hypothesis of an atmosphere surrounding all bodies; and consequently making two reflections and refractions of the light that falls upon them, one at the surface of the atmosphere, and the other at that of the body. This atmosphere he supposed to be of a variable density and refractive power, like the atmosphere.\n\nM. Du Tour thought the variable atmosphere superfluous, and attempted to account for all the phenomena by an atmosphere of uniform density, and of a less refractive power than the air surrounding all bodies.\n\nOnly three fringes had been observed by preceding authors, but M. Du Tour was accidentally led to observe a greater number of them, and adopted from Grimaldi the following ingenious method of making them all appear very distinct.\n\nHe took a circular board A.B.E.D., (fig. 9.) 13 inches in diameter, the surface of which was black, except at the edge, where there was a ring of white paper about three lines broad, in order to trace the circumference of a circle, divided into 360 degrees, beginning at the point A, and reckoning 180 degrees on each hand to the point E; B and D being each of them placed at 90 degrees. A slip of parchment 3 inches broad, and disposed in the form of a hoop, was fastened round the board, and pierced at the point E with a square hole, each side being 4 or 5 lines, in order to introduce a ray of the sun's light; and in the centre of the board C, he fixed a perpendicular pin about \u00bc of a line in diameter.\n\nThis hoop being so placed, that a ray of light entering the chamber, through a vertical cleft of 2\u00bd lines in length, and about as wide as the diameter of the pin, went through the hole at E, and passing parallel to the plane of the board, projected the image of the sun and the shadow of the pin at A. In these circumstances he observed, 1. That quite round the concave surface of this hoop, there were a multitude of coloured streaks; but that the space m A n, of about 18 degrees, the middle of which was occupied by the image of the sun, History, was covered with a faint light only. 2. The order of the colours in these streaks was generally such that the most refrangible rays were the nearest to the incident ray E.C.A.; so that, beginning from the point A, the violet was the first and the red the last colour in each of the streaks. In some of them, however, the colours were disposed in a contrary order. 3. The image of the sun, projected on each side of the point A, was divided by the shadow of the pin, which was bordered by two luminous streaks. 4. The coloured streaks were narrower in some parts of the hoop than others, and generally decreased in breadth in receding from the point A. 5. Among these coloured streaks, there were sometimes others which were white, 1 or 1\u00bd lines in breadth, which were generally bordered on both sides by a streak of orange colour.\n\nFrom this experiment he thought it evident, that the rays which passed beyond the pin were not the only ones that were decomposed, for that those which were reflected from the pin were decomposed also; whence he concluded that they must have undergone some refraction. He also imagined that those which went beyond the pin suffered a reflection, so that they were all affected in a similar manner.\n\nIn order to give some idea of his hypothesis, M. Du Tour shows that the ray a b, fig. 10, after being refracted at b, reflected at r and u, and again refracted at r, will be divided into its proper colours; the least refrangible or the red rays issuing at x, and the most refrangible or violet at y. Those streaks in which the colours appear in a contrary order he thinks are to be ascribed to inequalities in the surface of the pin.\n\nThe coloured streaks nearest the shadow of the pin, he supposes to be formed by those rays which, entering the atmosphere, do not fall upon the pin; and, without any reflection, are only refracted at their entering and leaving the atmosphere, as at b and r u, fig. 11. In Fig. 11, this case, the red or least refrangible rays will issue at r, and the violet at u.\n\nTo distinguish the rays which fall upon the hoop in any particular direction, from those that came in any other, he made an opening in the hoop, as at P, fig. 9, by which means he could, with advantage, and at any distance from the centre, observe those rays unmixed with any other.\n\nTo account for the coloured streaks being larger next the shadow of the pin, and growing narrower to the place where the light was admitted, he flows, by fig. 12, Fig. 12, that the rays a b are farther separated by both the refractions than the rays c d.\n\nSometimes M. Du Tour observed, that the broader streaks were not disposed in this regular order; but then he found, that by turning the pin they changed their places, so that this circumstance must have been an accidental irregularity in the surface of the pin.\n\nThe white streaks mixed with the coloured ones he attributes to small cavities in the surface of the pin; for they also changed their places when the pin was turned upon its axis.\n\nHe also found, that bodies of various kinds, and of different sizes, always produced fringes of the same dimensions.\n\nExposing two pieces of paper in the beam of light, so that part of it passed between two planes formed by them,\nthem, M. Du Tour observed, that the edges of this light were bordered with two orange streaks. To account for them, he supposes, that the more refrangible of the rays which enter at \\( b \\) are so refracted, that they do not reach the surface of the body at \\( R \\); so that the red and orange light may be reflected from thence in the direction \\( dM \\), where the orange streaks will be formed; and, for the same reason, another streak of orange will be formed at \\( m \\), by the rays which enter the atmosphere on the other side of the chink. In a similar manner he accounts for the orange fringes at the borders of the white streaks, in the experiment of the hoop. He supposes, that the blue rays, which are not reflected at \\( R \\), pass on to \\( I \\); and that these rays form the blue tinge observable in the shadows of some bodies.\n\nThis, however, is mere trifling.\n\nWe may here make a general observation, applicable to all the attempts of philosophers to explain these phenomena by atmospheres. These attempts give no explanation whatever of the physical cause of the phenomena. A phenomenon is some individual fact or event in nature. We are said to explain it, when we point out the general fact in which it is comprehended, and show the manner in which it is so comprehended, or the particular modification of the general fact. Philosophy resembles natural history, having for its subject the events of nature; and its investigations are nothing but the classification of these events, or the arrangement of them under the general facts of which they are individual instances. In the present instance there is no general fact referred to. The atmosphere is a mere gratuitous supposition; and all that is done is to show a resemblance between the phenomena of inflection of light to what would be the phenomena were bodies surrounded with such atmospheres; and even in this point of view, the difficulties of Mairan and Du Tour are extremely deficient. They have been satisfied with very vague resemblances to a fact observed in one single instance, and not sufficiently examined or described in that instance, namely, the refraction of light through the atmosphere of this globe.\n\nThe attempt is to explain how light is turned out of its direction by passing near the surface of bodies. This indicates the action of forces in a direction transverse to that of the light. Newton took the right road of investigation, by taking the phenomenon in its original simplicity, and attending merely to this, that the rays are deflected from their former course; and the sole aim of his investigation was to discover the laws, or the more general facts in this deflection. He deduced from the phenomena, that some rays are more deflected than others, and endeavoured to determine in what rays the deflections are most remarkable; and no experiment of M. Du Tour has shown that he was mistaken in his modified assertion, that those rays are most inflected which pass nearest to the body. We say modified assertion; for Newton points out with great sagacity many instances of alternate fits of inflection and deflection; and takes it for granted, that the law of continuity is observed in these phenomena, and that the change of inflection into deflection is gradual.\n\nBut these analogical difficulties are eminently deficient in another respect. They are held out as mechanical explanations of the changes of motion observed in rays of light. When it shall be shown, that these are precisely such as are observed in refracting atmospheres, nothing is done towards deciding the original question; for the action of refracting atmospheres presents it in all its difficulties, and we must still ask how do these atmospheres produce this effect? No advance whatever is gained in science by thrusting in this hypothetical atmosphere; and Newton did wisely in attaching himself to the simple fact; and he thus gives us another step in science, by showing us a fact unknown before, viz. that the action of bodies on light is not confined to transparent bodies and inflects. He added another general fact to our former knowledge, that light as well as other matter is acted on at a distance; and thus he made a very important deduction, the same that reflection, refraction, and inflection, are probably forces brought about by the same forces.\n\nM. Le Cat has well explained a phenomenon of vision depending upon the inflection of light, which shows, sometimes that, in some cases objects by this means appear magnified. Looking at a distant steeple, when a wire, of any inflection's diameter than the pupil of his eye, was held near to it, and drawing it several times betwixt his eye and that object, he found, that, every time the wire passed before his pupil, the steeple seemed to change its place, and some hills beyond the steeple appeared to have the same motion, just as if a lens had been drawn betwixt his eye and them. He found also, that there was a position of the wire in which the steeple seemed not to have any motion, when the wire was passed before his eye; and in this case the steeple appeared less distinct and magnified. He then placed his eye in such a manner with respect to the steeple, that the rays of light by which he saw it must come very close to the edge of a window, where he had placed himself to make his observations; and passing the wire before his eye, he observed, that, when it was in the visual axis, the steeple appeared nearer to the window, on whichever side the wire was made to approach. He repeated this experiment, and always, with the same result, the object being by this means magnified, and nearly doubled.\n\nThis phenomenon he explains by fig. 14, in which B represents the eye, A the steeple, and C a section of the wire. The black lines express the cone of light by fig. 14, which the natural image of the steeple A is formed, and which is much narrower than the diameter of the wire C; but the dotted lines include not only that cone of light, slopped and turned out of its course by the wire, but also more distant rays inflected by the wire, and thereby thrown more converging into the pupil; just as would have been the effect of the interpolation of a lens between the eye and the object.\n\n**Sect. IV. Discoveries concerning Vision.**\n\nMaurolycus was the first who demonstrated that the crystalline humour of the eye is a lens which collects the light issuing from external objects, and converges them upon the retina. He did not, however, seem to be aware that an image of every visible object was thus formed upon the retina, though this seems hardly to have been a step beyond the discovery he had made. Montucia conjectures, that he was prevented from mentioning this part of the discovery by the difficulty of accounting for the upright appearance of objects. This discovery was made by Kepler; but he, too, was much puzzled with the inversion of the image upon the retina.\nna. The rectification of these images, he says, is the business of the mind; which, when it perceives an impression on the lower part of the retina, considers it as made by rays proceeding from the higher parts of objects; tracing the rays back to the pupil, where they cross one another. This is the true explanation of the difficulty, and is exactly the same as that which was lately given by Dr Reid.\n\nThe discoveries concerning vision were completed by Scheiner. For, in cutting away the coats of the back part of the eyes of sheep and oxen, and presenting several objects before them, he saw their images distinctly painted upon the retina. He did the same with the human eye, and exhibited this experiment at Rome in 1625.\n\nScheiner took a good deal of pains to ascertain the density and refractive power of all the humours of the eye, by comparing their magnifying power with that of water or glass in the same form and circumstances. The result of his inquiries was, that the aqueous humour does not differ much from water in this respect, nor the crystalline from glass; and that the vitreous humour is a medium between both. He also traces the progress of the rays of light through all the humours; and after discarding every possible hypothesis concerning the seat of vision, he demonstrates that it is in the retina, and shows that this was the opinion of Alhazen, Vitellio, Kepler, and all the most eminent philosophers. He advances many reasons for this hypothesis; answers many objections to it; and, by a variety of arguments, refutes the opinion that the seat of vision is in the crystalline lens.\n\nThe subject of vision occupied the attention of Descartes. He explains the methods of judging of the magnitudes, situations, and distances, of objects, by the direction of the optic axes; comparing it to a blind man's judging of the size and distance of an object, by feeling it with two sticks of a known length, when the hands in which he holds them are at a known distance from each other. He also remarks, that having been accustomed to judge of the situation of objects by their images falling on a particular part of the eye; if by any distortion of the eye they fall on a different place, we are apt to mistake their situation, or imagine one object to be two, in the same way as we imagine one stick to be two, when it is placed between two contiguous fingers laid across one another. The direction of the optic axes, he says, will not serve us beyond 15 or 20 feet, and the change of form of the crystalline not more than three or four feet. For he imagined that the eye conforms itself to different distances by a change in the curvature of the crystalline, which he supposed to be a muscle, the tendons of it being the ciliary processes. In another place, he says, that the change in the conformation of the eye is of no use to us for the purpose of judging of distances beyond four or five feet, and the angle of the optic axes not more than 100 or 200 feet: for this reason, he says, that the sun and moon are conceived to be much more nearly of the same size than they are in reality. White and luminous objects, he observes, appear larger than others, and also the parts contiguous to those on which the rays actually impinge; and for the same reason, if the objects be small, and placed at a great distance, they will always appear round, the figure of the angles disappearing.\n\nThe celebrated Dr Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, published, in 1709, An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision, in which he solves many difficulties. He does not admit that it is by means of those lines and angles, which are useful in explaining the theory of optics, that different distances are estimated by the sense of sight; neither does he think that the mere direction of the optic axes or the greater or less divergency of the rays of light are sufficient for this purpose. \"I appeal (says he) to experience, whether any one computes its distance by the signs of the angle made by the meeting of the two optic axes; or whether he ever thinks of the greater or less divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to his pupil: Nay, whether it be not perfectly impossible for him to perceive, by sense, the various angles wherewith the rays according to their greater or lesser divergency fell upon his eye.\" That there is a necessary connexion between these various angles, &c., and different degrees of distance, and that this connexion is known to every person skilled in optics, he readily acknowledges; but \"in vain (he observes) shall mathematicians tell me, that I perceive certain lines and angles, which introduce into my mind the various notions of distance, so long as I am conscious of no such thing.\" He maintains that distance, magnitude, and even figure, are the objects of immediate perception only by the sense of touch; and that when we judge of them by sight, it is from different sensations felt in the eye, which experience has taught us to be the consequence of viewing objects of greater or less magnitude, of different figures, and at different distances. These sensations, with the respective distances, figures, and magnitudes by which they are occasioned, become so closely associated in the mind long before the period of distinct recollection, that the presence of one instantly suggests the other; and we attribute to the sense of sight those notions which are acquired by the sense of touch, and of which certain visual sensations are merely the signs or symbols, just as words are the symbols of ideas. Upon these principles he accounts for single and erect vision. Subsequent writers have made considerable discoveries in the theory of vision; and among them there is hardly any one to whom this branch of science is so much indebted as to Dr Reid, and Dr Wells, whose reasonings we shall afterwards have occasion to detail.\n\nSect. V. Of Optical Instruments.\n\nGlass globes, and specula, seem to have been the only optical instruments known to the ancients. Alhazen gave the first hint of the invention of spectacles. From the writings of this author, together with the observations of Roger Bacon, it is not improbable that some monks gradually hit upon the construction of spectacles; to which Bacon's lesser segment was a nearer approach than Alhazen's larger one.\n\nIt is certain that spectacles were well known in the 14th century, and not long before. It is said that Alexander Spina, a native of Pisa, who died in 1313, happened to see a pair of spectacles in the hands of a person who would not explain them to him; but that he succeeded in making a pair for himself, and immediately made the construction public. It is also inscribed on the tomb of Salvius Armatus, a nobleman of Florence, who died 1317, that he was the inventor of spectacles.\n\nThough\nThough both convex and concave lenses were sufficiently common, yet no attempt was made to combine them into a telescope till the end of the 17th century. Descartes considers James Metius as the first constructor of the telescope; and says, that as he was amusing himself with mirrors and burning glasses, he thought of looking through two of his lenses at a time; and that happening to take one that was convex and another that was concave, and happening also to hit upon a pretty good adjustment of them, he found, that, by looking through them, distant objects appeared very large and distinct. In fact, without knowing it, he had made a telescope.\n\nOther persons say, that this great discovery was first made by John Lipperhein, a spectacle-maker at Middleburgh, or rather by his children; who were diverting themselves with looking through two glasses at a time, and placing them at different distances from one another. But Borelius, the author of a book entitled *De vero telescopii inventore*, gives this honour to Zacharias Joannides, i.e. Janjen, another spectacle-maker at the same place, who made the first telescope in 1590.\n\nThis ingenious mechanic had no sooner found the arrangement of glasses that magnified distant objects, than he enclosed them in a tube, and ran with his instrument to Prince Maurice; who, immediately conceiving that it might be useful in his wars, desired the author to keep it a secret. But this was found impossible; and several persons in that city immediately applied themselves to the making and selling of telescopes. One of the most distinguished of these was Hans Laprey, called Lipperhein by Sirturus. Some person in Holland being very early supplied by him with a telescope, he paid with many for the inventor; but both Metius above mentioned, and Cornelius Drebbel of Alcmar, in Holland, applied to the inventor himself in 1620; as also did Galileo, and many others. The first telescope made by Janjen did not exceed 15 or 16 inches in length; but Sirturus, who says that he had seen it, and made use of it, thought it the best that he had ever examined.\n\nJanjen directing his telescope to celestial objects, distinctly viewed the spots on the surface of the moon; and discovered many new stars, particularly seven very considerable ones in the Great Bear. His son, Joannes Zacharias, observed the lucid circle near the limb of the moon, from whence several bright rays seem to dart in different directions; and he says, that the full moon, viewed through this instrument, did not appear flat, but was evidently globular. Jupiter appeared round, and rather spherical; and sometimes he perceived two, sometimes three, and at other times even four small stars, a little above or below him; and, as far as he could observe, they performed revolutions round him.\n\nThere are some who say that Galileo was the inventor of telescopes; but he himself acknowledges, that he first heard of the instrument from a German; but, that being informed of nothing more than the effects of it, first by common report, and a few days after by a French nobleman, J. Badovere, at Paris, he himself discovered the construction, by considering the nature of refraction; and thus he had much more real merit than the inventor himself.\n\nAbout April or May, in 1609, it was reported at Venice, where Galileo (who was professor of mathematics in the university of Padua) then happened to be, that a Dutchman had presented to Count Maurice of Nassau, a certain optical instrument, by means of which, distant objects appeared as if they were near; but no further account of the discovery had reached that place, whereas though this was near 20 years after the first discovery of the telescope. Struck, however, with this account, Galileo returned to Padua, considering what kind of an instrument this must be. The night following, the construction occurred to him; and the day after, putting the parts of the instrument together, as he had previously conceived it; and notwithstanding the imperfection of the glasses that he could then procure, the effect answered his expectations, as he presently acquainted his friends at Venice, where, from several eminences, he showed to some of the principal senators of that republic a variety of distant objects, to their very great astonishment. When he had made farther improvements in the instrument, he made a present of one of them to the Doge, Leonardo Donati, and at the same time to all the senate of Venice; giving along with it a written paper, in which he explained the structure and wonderful uses that might be made of the instrument both by land and sea. In return for so noble an entertainment, the republic, on the 25th of August, in the same year, more than tripled his salary as professor.\n\nGalileo having amused himself for some time with the view of terrestrial objects, at length directed his tube towards the heavens; and found, that the surface of the moon was diversified with hills and valleys, like the earth. He found that the milky way and nebula consisted of a collection of fixed stars, which, on account either of their vast distance, or extreme smallness, were invisible to the naked eye. He also discovered innumerable fixed stars dispersed over the face of the heavens, which had been unknown to the ancients; and examining Jupiter, he found him attended by four stars, which, at certain periods, performed revolutions round him.\n\nThis discovery he made in January 1610, new style; and continuing his observations the whole of February following, he published, in the beginning of March, an account of all his discoveries, in his *Nuncius Sidereus*, printed at Venice.\n\nThe extraordinary discoveries contained in the *Nuncius Sidereus*, which was immediately reprinted both in Germany and France, were the cause of much debate among the philosophers of that time; many of whom could not give any credit to Galileo's account, while others endeavoured to decry his discoveries as nothing more than mere illusions.\n\nIn the beginning of July, 1610, Galileo being still at Padua, and getting an imperfect view of Saturn's ring, imagined that that planet consisted of three parts; and therefore, in the account which he gave of this discovery to his friends, he calls it *planetam tergeminam*.\n\nWhilst he was still at Padua, he observed some spots on the face of the sun; but he did not choose, at that time, to publish his discovery; partly for fear of incurring more of the hatred of many obstinate Peripatetics; and partly in order to make more exact observations on this remarkable phenomenon, as well as to form some conjecture concerning the probable cause of it. He therefore contented himself with communicating his observations to some of his friends at Padua and Venice, among\namong whom we find the name of Father Paul. This delay, however, was the cause of this discovery being contested with him by the famous Scheiner, who likewise made the same observation in October 1611, and we suppose had anticipated Galileo in the publication of it.\n\nIn November following Galileo was satisfied, that, from the September preceding, Venus had been continually increasing in bulk, and that she changed her phases like the moon. About the end of March 1614 he went to Rome, where he gratified the cardinals, and all the principal nobility, with a view of the new wonders which he had discovered in the heavens.\n\nTwenty-nine years Galileo enjoyed the use of his telescope, continually enriching astronomy with his observations: but by too close an application to that instrument, and the detriment he received from the nocturnal air, his eyes grew gradually weaker, till in 1639 he became totally blind; a calamity which, however, neither broke his spirits, nor interrupted the course of his studies.\n\nThe first telescope that Galileo constructed magnified only three times; but presently after, he made another which magnified 18 times; and afterwards, with great trouble and expense, he constructed one that magnified 33 times; and with this it was that he discovered the satellites of Jupiter and the spots of the sun.\n\nThe honour of explaining the rationale of the telescope is due to the celebrated Kepler. He made several discoveries relating to the nature of vision; and not only explained the theory of the telescope which he found in use, but also pointed out methods of constructing others of superior powers and more commodious application.\n\nIt was Kepler who first gave a clear explication of the effects of lenses, in converging and diverging the rays of a pencil of light. He showed, that a plano-convex lens makes rays that were parallel to its axis, to meet at the distance of the diameter of the sphere of convexity; but that if both sides of the lens be equally convex, the rays will have their focus at the distance of the radius of the circle, corresponding to that degree of convexity. He did not, however, investigate any rule for the foci of lenses unequally convex. He only says, in general, that they will fall somewhere in the middle, between the foci belonging to the two different degrees of convexity. We owe this investigation to Cavalieri, who laid down the following rule: As the sum of both the diameters is to one of them, so is the other to the distance of the focus.\n\nThe principal effects of telescopes depend upon these simple principles, viz. That objects appear larger in proportion to the angles which they subtend at the eye; and the effect is the same whether the pencils of rays, by which objects are visible to us, come directly from the objects themselves, or from any place nearer to the eye, where they may have been converged so as to form an image of the object; because they issue again from those points where there is no real substance, in certain directions, in the same manner as they did from the corresponding points in the objects themselves.\n\nIn fact, therefore, all that is effected by a telescope is, first, to make such an image of a distant object, by means of a lens or mirror; and then to give the eye some assistance for viewing that image as near as possible; so that the angle which it shall subtend at the eye, may be very large, compared with the angle which the object itself would subtend in the same situation. This is done by means of an eye-glass, which refracts the pencils of rays, that they may afterwards be brought to their several foci by the humours of the eye. But if the eye was so formed as to be able to see the image with sufficient distinctness at the same distance without any eye-glass, it would appear to him as much magnified as it does to another person who makes use of a glass for that purpose, though he would not in all cases have so large a field of view.\n\nIf, instead of an eye-glass, an object be looked at through a small hole in a thin plate or piece of paper, held close to the eye, it may be viewed very near to the eye, and, at the same distance, the apparent magnitude of the object will be the same in both cases. For if the hole be so small as to admit but a single ray from every point of the object, these rays will fall upon the retina in as many other points, and make a distinct image. They are only pencils of rays, which have a sensible bale, as the breadth of the pupil, that are capable, by their spreading on the retina, of producing an indistinct image. As very few rays, however, can be admitted through a small hole, there will seldom be light sufficient to view any object to advantage in this manner.\n\nIf no image be formed by the foci of the pencils without the eye, yet if, by the help of a concave eyeglass, the pencils of rays shall enter the pupil, just as they would have done from any place without the eye, the visual angle will be the same as if an image had actually been formed in that place. Objects will not appear inverted through this telescope, because the pencils which form the images of them, only cross one another once, viz. at the object glass, as in natural vision they do in the pupil of the eye.\n\nSuch is the telescope that was first discovered and Galilean used by philosophers. The great inconvenience attending it is, that the field of view is exceedingly small. For since the pencils of rays enter the eye very much in confusion diverging from one another, but few of them can be than others intercepted by the pupil. This inconvenience increases with the magnifying power of the telescope; so that it is a matter of surprise how, with such an instrument, Galileo and others could have made such discoveries. No other telescope, however, than this, was so much as thought of for many years after the discovery. Descartes, who wrote 30 years after, mentions no others as actually constructed.\n\nIt is to the celebrated Kepler that we are indebted for the construction of what we now call the astronomical improved telescope. The rationale of this instrument is explained, and the advantages of it are clearly pointed out, by this philosopher, in his Catoptrics; but, what is very surprising, he never actually reduced his theory into practice. Montucla conjectures, that the reason why he did not make trial of this new construction was, his not being aware of the great increase of the field of view; so that being engaged in other pursuits, he might not think it of much consequence to take any pains about the construction of an instrument, which could do little more than answer the same purpose with those which he already possessed. He must also have foreseen, that the length\nlength of this telescope must have been greater in proportion to its magnifying power, so that it might appear to him to be upon the whole not quite so good a construction as the former.\n\nThe first person who actually made an instrument of Kepler's construction was Father Scheiner, who has given a description of it in his *Rota Urfina*, published in 1630. If, says he, you insert two similar lenses in a tube, and place your eye at a convenient distance, you will see all terrestrial objects inverted, indeed, but magnified and very distinct, with a considerable extent of view. He afterwards subjoins an account of a telescope of a different construction, with two convex eye-glasses, which again reverses the images, and makes them appear in their natural position. This disposition of the lenses had also been pointed out by Kepler, but had not been reduced to practice. This construction, however, answered the end very imperfectly; and Father Rheita presently after discovered a better construction, using three eye-glasses instead of two.\n\nThe only difference between the Galilean and the astronomical telescope is, that the pencils by which the extremities of any object are seen in this case, enter the eye diverging; whereas, in the other, they enter it converging; but if the sphere of concavity in the eye-glass of the Galilean telescope be equal to the sphere of convexity in the eye-glass of another telescope, their magnifying power will be the same. The concave eye-glasses, however, being placed between the object-glass and its focus, the Galilean telescope will be shorter than the other, by twice the focal length of the eye-glass. Consequently, if the length of the telescopes be the same, the Galilean will have the greater magnifying power.\n\nHuygens was particularly eminent for his systematic knowledge of optics, and is the author of the chief improvements which have been made on all the dioptrical instruments till the discovery of the achromatic telescope. He was well acquainted with the theory of aberration arising from the spherical figure of the glasses, and has shown several ingenious methods of diminishing them by proper constructions of the eye-pieces. He first pointed out the advantages of two eye-glasses in the astronomical telescope and double microscope, and gave rules for this construction, which both enlarges the field and shortens the instrument. Mr Dollond adapted his construction to the terrestrial telescope of De Rheita; and his five eye-glasses are nothing but the Huygenian eye-piece doubled. This construction has been too hastily given up by the artists of the present day for another, also of Mr Dollond's, of four glasses.\n\nThe same Father Rheita, to whom we are indebted for the construction of a telescope for land objects, invented a binocular telescope, which Father Cherubin, of Orleans, afterwards endeavoured to bring into use. It consists of two telescopes fastened together, pointed to the same object. When this instrument is well fixed, the object appears larger, and nearer to the eye, when it is seen through both the telescopes, than through one of them only, though they have the very same magnifying power. But this is only an illusion, occasioned by the stronger impression made upon the eye, by two equal images, equally illuminated. This advantage, however, is counterbalanced by the inconvenience attending the use of it.\n\nThe first who distinguished themselves in grinding telescopic glasses were two Italians, Eustachio Divini at Rome, and Campani at Bologna, whose fame was much superior to that of Divini, or that of any other person of his time; though Divini himself pretended, of Campani that, in all the trials that were made with their glasses, and Divini's, of a great focal length, performed better than those of Campani, and that his rival was not willing to try them with equal eye-glasses. It is generally supposed, however, that Campani really excelled Divini, both in the goodness and the focal length of his object-glasses. It was with telescopes made by Campani that Cassini discovered the nearest satellites of Saturn. They were made by the express order of Louis XIV., and were of 86, 105, and 136 Paris feet in focal length.\n\nCampani sold his lenses for a great price, and took every possible method to keep his art of making them secret. His laboratory was inaccessible, till after his death; when it was purchased by Pope Benedict XIV., who presented it to the academy called the *Institut*, established in that city; and by the account which M. Fougeroux has given of what he could discover from it, we learn, that (except a machine, which M. Campani constructed, to work the balms on which he ground his glasses) the goodness of his lenses depended upon the clearness of his glass, his Venetian tripoli, the paper with which he polished them, and his great skill and address as a workman. It was also the general opinion that he owed much of his reputation to the secrecy and air of mystery which he affected; and that he made a great number of object-glasses which he rejected, throwing only those that were very good. He made few lenses of a very great focal distance; and having the misfortune to break one of 141 feet in two pieces, he took incredible pains to join the two parts together, which he did at length so effectually, that it was used as if it had been entire; but it is not probable that he would have taken so much pains about it, if, as he pretended, he could very easily have made another as good.\n\nSir Paul Neille, Dr Hooke says, made telescopes of 36 feet, pretty good, and one of 50, but not of proportional goodness. Afterwards Mr Reive, and then Mr Cox, who were the most celebrated in England as grinders of optic glasses, made some good instruments of 50 and 60 feet focal length, and Mr Cox made one of 100.\n\nThese, and all other telescopes, were far exceeded by extraordinary object-glasses of 600 feet focus made by M. Auzout; nay object but he was never able to manage it. Hartfocker is even said to have made some of a still greater focal length; but this ingenious mechanic, finding it impossible to make use of object-glasses the focal distance of which was much less than this, when they were enclosed in a tube, contrived a method of using them without a tube, by fixing them at the top of a tree, a high wall, or the roof of a house.\n\nMr Huygens, who was also an excellent mechanic, made considerable improvements on this contrivance of Hartfocker's. He placed the object-glass at the top of a long pole, having previously enclosed it in a short tube, which was made to turn in all directions by means of a ball and socket. The axis of this tube he could command with a fine filken string, so as to bring it into a line with the axis of another short tube which he held in his hand, and which contained the eye-glass. In this method he could make use of object-glasses of the greatest magnifying.\nfying power, at whatever altitude his object was, and even in the zenith, provided his pole was as long as his telescope; and to adapt it to the view of objects of different altitudes, he had a contrivance, by which he could raise or depress at pleasure, a stage that supported his object-glass.\n\nM. de la Hire, made some improvement in this method of managing the object-glass, by fixing it in the centre of a board, and not in a tube; but as it is not probable that this method will ever be made use of, since the discovery of both reflecting and achromatic telescopes, which are now brought to great perfection, and have even micrometers adapted to them, we shall not describe the apparatus minutely; but shall only give a drawing of M. Huygen's pole, with a short explanation. In fig. 1, \\(a\\) represents a pulley, by the help of which a flag \\(c\\), \\(d\\), \\(e\\), \\(f\\) (that supports the object-glass \\(k\\), and the apparatus belonging to it), may be raised higher or lower at pleasure, the whole being counterpoised by the weight \\(h\\), fastened to a string \\(g\\). \\(n\\) is a weight, by means of which the centre of gravity of the apparatus belonging to the object-glass is kept in the ball and socket, so that it may be easily managed by the string \\(u\\), and its axis brought into a line with the eye-glass at \\(o\\). When it was very dark, M. Huygens was obliged to make his object-glass visible by a lantern, \\(y\\), so constructed as to throw up to it the rays of light in a parallel direction.\n\nBefore leaving this subject, it must be observed, that M. Auzout, in a paper delivered to the Royal Society, observed, that the apertures which the object-glasses of refracting telescopes can bear with distinctness, are in the sub-duplicate ratio of their lengths; and upon this supposition he drew up a table of the apertures of object-glasses of a great variety of focal lengths, from 4 inches to 400 feet. Upon this occasion, however, Dr Hooke observed, that the same glass will bear a greater or less aperture, according to the less or greater light of the object.\n\nBut all these improvements were diminished in value by the discovery of the reflecting telescope. For a refracting telescope, even of 1000 feet focus, supposing it possible to be made use of, could not be made to magnify with distinctness more than 1000 times; whereas a reflecting telescope, not exceeding 9 or 10 feet will magnify 1200 times.\n\n\"It must be acknowledged, says Dr Smith, that Mr James Gregory of Aberdeen was the first inventor of the reflecting telescope; but his construction is quite different from Sir Isaac Newton's, and not nearly so advantageous.\"\n\nAccording to Dr Pringle, Mercenius was the man who entertained the first thought of a reflector. He certainly proposed a telescope with specula to the celebrated Descartes many years before Gregory's invention, though indeed in a manner so very unsatisfactory, that Descartes was so far from approving the proposal, that he endeavoured to convince Mercenius of its fallacy. Dr Smith, it appears, had never perused the two letters of Descartes to Mercenius which relate to that subject.\n\nGregory, a young man of uncommon genius, was led to the invention, in trying to correct two imperfections of the common telescope: the first was its too great length, which made it less manageable; the second, the incorrectness of the image. Mathematicians had demonstrated, that a pencil of rays could not be collected in a single point by a spherical lens; and also, that the image transmitted by such a lens would be in some degree incurvated. These inconveniences he believed would be obviated by substituting for the object-glass a metallic speculum, of a parabolic figure, to receive the incident rays, and to reflect them towards a small speculum of the same metal; this again was to return the image to an eye-glass placed behind the great speculum, which for that purpose was to be perforated in its centre. This construction he published in 1663, in his Optica Promota. But as Gregory, by his own account, was endowed with no mechanical dexterity, nor could find any workman capable of constructing his instrument, he was obliged to give up the pursuit: and probably, had not some new discoveries been made in light and colours, a reflecting telescope would never more have been thought of.\n\nAt an early period of life, Newton had applied himself to the improvement of the telescope; but imagining that Gregory's specula were neither very necessary, nor likely to be executed, he began with prosecuting the views of Descartes, who aimed at making a more perfect image of an object, by grinding lenses, not to the figure of a sphere, but to that of one of the conic sections. Whilst he was thus employed, three years after Gregory's publication, he happened to examine the colours, formed by a prism, and having by means of that simple instrument discovered the different refrangibility of the rays of light, he then perceived that the errors of telescopes arising from that cause alone, were some hundred times greater than those which were occasioned by the spherical figure of lenses. This circumstance forced, as it were, Newton to fall into Gregory's track, and to turn his thoughts to reflectors. \"The different refrangibility of the rays of light (says he in a letter to Mr Oldenburg, secretary to the Royal Society, dated Feb. 1672) made me take reflections into consideration; and finding them regular, so that the angle of reflection of all sorts of rays was equal to the angle of incidence, I understood that by their mediation optic instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, providing a reflecting substance could be found which would polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much light as glass transmits, and the art of communicating to it a parabolic figure he also obtained. Amidst these thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening plague, and it was more than two years before I proceeded further.\"\n\nIt was towards the end of 1668, or in the beginning of the following year, when Newton being obliged to have recourse to reflectors, and not relying on any artificer for making his specula, set about the work himself, and early in the year 1672 completed two small reflecting telescopes. In these he ground the great speculum into the concave portion of a sphere; not but that he approved of the parabolic form proposed by Gregory, though he found himself unable to accomplish it. In the letter that accompanied one of these instruments which he presented to the Society, he writes, \"that though he then despaired of performing that work (to wit, the parabolic figure of the great speculum) by geometrical rules, yet he doubted not but that the thing might in some measure be accomplished by mechanical devices.\"\n\nNot less did the difficulty appear to find a metallic substance\nsubstance that would be of a proper hardness, have the fewest pores, and receive the smoothest polish; a difficulty which he deemed almost insurmountable, when he considered, that every irregularity in a reflecting surface would make the rays of light stray five or six times more out of their due course, than similar irregularities in a refracting one. In another letter, written soon after, he informs the secretary, \"that he was very sensible that metal reflects less light than glass transmits; but as he had found some metallic substances more strongly reflective than others, to polish better, and to be freer from tarnishing than others, so he hoped that there might in time be found out some substances much freer from these inconveniences than any yet known.\" Newton therefore laboured till he found a composition that answered in some degree, and left it to those who should come after him to find a better. Huygens, one of the greatest geniuses of the age, and a distinguished improver of the refracting telescope, no sooner was informed by Mr Oldenburg of the discovery, than he wrote in answer, \"that it was an admirable telescope; and that Mr Newton had well considered the advantage which a concave speculum had over convex glasses in collecting the parallel rays, which, according to his own calculation, was very great: Hence that Mr Newton could give a far greater aperture to that speculum than to an object glass of the same focal length, and consequently produce a much greater magnifying power than by an ordinary telescope: Besides, that by the reflector he avoided an inconvenience inseparable from object glasses, which was the obliquity of both their surfaces, which vitiated the refraction of the rays that pass towards the side of the glass: Again, That by the mere reflection of the metallic speculum there were not so many rays lost as in glasses, which reflected a considerable quantity by each of their surfaces, and besides intercepted many of them by the obscurity of their substance: That the main business would be, to find a substance for this speculum that would bear as good a polish as glass. Lastly, He believed that Mr Newton had not omitted to consider the advantage which a parabolic speculum would have over a spherical one in this construction; but had despaired, as he himself had done, of working other surfaces than spherical ones with exactness.\" Huygens was not satisfied with thus expressing to the society his high approbation of the invention; but drew up a favourable account of the new telescope, which he published in the Journal des Savans for 1672, by which channel it was soon known over Europe.\n\nExcepting an unsuccessful attempt which the society made, by employing an artificer to imitate the Newtonian construction, but upon a larger scale, and a disguised Gregorian telescope, set up by Cassigrain abroad as a rival to Newton's, no reflector was heard of for nearly half a century after. But when that period was elapsed, a reflecting telescope of the Newtonian form was at last produced by Mr Hadley, the inventor of the reflecting quadrant. The two telescopes which Newton had made were but five inches long; they were held in the hand for viewing objects, and in power were compared to a five feet refractor; whereas Hadley's was about five feet long, was provided with a well-contrived apparatus for managing it, and equalled in performance the famous aerial telescope of Huygens of 123 feet in length. Excepting the manner of making the specula, we have, in the Philosophical Transactions of 1723, a complete description, with a figure of this telescope, together with that of the machine for moving it; but, by a strange omission, Newton's name is not once mentioned in that paper, so that any person not acquainted with the history of the invention, and reading that account only, might be apt to conclude that Hadley had been the sole inventor.\n\nThe same celebrated artist, after finishing two telescopes of the Newtonian construction, accomplished a third of the Gregorian form; but, it would seem, less successfully. Mr Hadley spared no pains to instruct Mr Molyneux and the Reverend Dr Bradley; and when those gentlemen had made a sufficient proficiency in the art, being desirous that these telescopes should become more public, they liberally communicated to some of the principal instrument-makers of London the knowledge they had acquired from him.\n\nMr James Short, as early as the year 1734, had signalized himself at Edinburgh by the excellence of his telescopes. Mr MacLaurin wrote that year to Dr Jurin, \"that Mr Short, who had begun with making glass specula, was then applying himself to improve the metallic; and that, by taking care of the figure, he was enabled to give them larger apertures that others had done; and that upon the whole they surpassed in perfection all that he had seen of other workmen.\" He added, \"that Mr Short's telescopes were all of the Gregorian construction; and that he had much improved that excellent invention.\" This character of excellence Mr Short maintained to the last; and with the more facility, as he was well acquainted with the theory of optics. It was supposed that he had fallen upon a method of giving the parabolic figure to his great speculum; a point of perfection that Gregory and Newton had despaired of attaining; and that Hadley had never, as far as we know, attempted. Mr Short indeed affirmed, that he had acquired that faculty, but never would tell by what peculiar means he effected it; so that the secret of working that configuration, whatever it was, died with that ingenious artist. Mr Mudge, however, has lately realized the expectation of Sir Isaac Newton, who, above 100 years ago, prefaced that the public would one day possess a parabolic speculum, not accomplished by mathematical rules, but by mechanical devices.\n\nThis was a desideratum, but it was not the only want supplied by this gentleman: he has taught us likewise a better composition of metals for the specula, how to grind them better, and how to give them a finer polish; and this last part (namely, the polish), he remarks, was the most difficult and essential of the whole operation. \"In a word (says Sir John Pringle), I am of opinion, there is no optician in this great city (which hath been so long and so justly renowned for ingenious and dexterous makers of every kind of mathematical instruments) so partial to his own abilities as not to acknowledge, that, Mr Mudge has opened to them all some new and important lights, and has greatly improved the art of making reflecting telescopes.\"\n\nThe late reverend and ingenious John Edwards devoted much of his time to the improvement of reflecting telescopes, and brought them to such perfection,\nfection, that Dr Maskelyne, the astronomer royal, found telescopes constructed by him to surpass in brightness, and other respects, those of the same size made by the best artists in London. The chief excellence of his telescopes arises from the composition, which, from various trials on metals and semimetals, he discovered for the specula, and from the true parabolic figure, which, by long practice, he had found a method of giving them, preferable to any that was known before him. His directions for the composition of specula, and for casting, grinding, and polishing them, were published, by order of the commissioners of longitude, at the end of the Nautical Almanack for the year 1787. To the same almanack is also annexed his account of the cause and cure of the tremors which particularly affect reflecting telescopes more than refracting ones, together with remarks on these tremors by Dr Maskelyne.\n\nBut in constructing reflecting telescopes of extraordinary magnifying powers, Dr Herschel has displayed skill and ingenuity surpassing all his predecessors in this department of mechanics. He has made them from 7, 10, 20, to even 40 feet in length; and with instruments of these dimensions he is now employed in making discoveries in astronomy. Of the construction, magnifying powers, and the curious collection of machinery by which his 40 feet telescope is supported and moved from one part of the heavens to another, accounts will be given under the word Telescope.\n\nThe greatest improvement in reflecting telescopes hitherto made public is that of Mr Dollond, of which an account has already been given in a preceding section, in which his discoveries in the science of Optics were explained. But, besides the obligation we are under to him for correcting the aberration of the rays of light in the focus of object-glasses, he made another considerable improvement in telescopes, viz., by correcting, in a great measure, both this kind of aberration, and also that which arises from the spherical form of lenses, by an expedient of a very different nature, viz., increasing the number of eye-glasses.\n\nIf any person, says he, would have the visual angle of a telescope to contain 20 degrees, the extreme pencils of the field must be bent or refracted in an angle of 10 degrees; which, if it be performed by one eye-glass, will cause an aberration from the figure, in proportion to the cube of that angle; but if two glasses be so proportioned and situated, as that the refraction may be equally divided between them, they will each of them produce a refraction equal to half the required angle; and therefore, the aberration being proportional to the cube of half the angle taken twice over, will be but a fourth part of that which is in proportion to the cube of the whole angle; because twice the cube of 1 is but \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the cube of 2; so the aberration from the figure, where two eye-glasses are rightly proportioned, is but a fourth of what it must unavoidably be, where the whole is performed by a single eye-glass. By the same way of reasoning, when the refraction is divided between three glasses, the aberration will be found to be but the ninth part of what would be produced from a single glass; because three times the cube of 1 is but one-ninth of the cube of 3. Whence it appears, that by increasing the number of eye-glasses, the indistinctness which is observed near the borders of the field of a telescope may be very much diminished.\n\nThe method of correcting the errors arising from the different refrangibility of light is of a different consideration from the former. For whereas the errors from the figure can only be diminished in a certain proportion according to the number of glasses, in this they may be entirely corrected by the addition of only one glass. Also in the day-telescope, where no more than two eye-glasses are absolutely necessary for erecting the object, we find, that by the addition of a third, rightly situated, the colours, which would otherwise make the image confused, are entirely removed. This, however, is to be understood with some limitation: for though the different colours into which the extreme pencils must necessarily be divided by the edges of the eye-glasses, may in this manner be brought to the eye in a direction parallel to each other, so as to be made to converge to a point on the retina; yet, if the glasses exceed a certain length, the colours may be spread too wide to be capable of being admitted through the pupil or aperture of the eye; which is the reason, that in long telescopes, constructed in the common manner, with three eye-glasses, the field is always very much contracted.\n\nThese considerations first set Mr Dollond on contriving how to enlarge the field, by increasing the number of eye-glasses without affecting the distinctness or brightness of the image; and though others had been about the same work before, yet, observing that some five-glass telescopes which were then made would admit of farther improvement, he endeavoured to construct one with the same number of glasses in a better manner; which so far answered his expectations, as to be allowed by the best judges to be a considerable improvement on the former.\n\nEncouraged by this success, he resolved to try if he could not make some farther enlargement of the field, by the addition of another glass, and by placing and proportioning the glasses in such a manner as to correct the aberrations as much as possible, without injuring the distinctness; and at last he obtained as large a field as is convenient or necessary, and that even in the longest telescopes that can be made.\n\nThese telescopes with six glasses having been well received, and some of them being carried into foreign countries, it seemed a proper time to the author to settle the date of his invention; on which account he drew up a letter, which he addressed to Mr Short, and which was read at the Royal Society, March 1, 1753.\n\nTo Mr Short we are indebted for the excellent contrivance of an equatorial telescope, or, as he likewife calls it, a portable observatory; for with it pretty accurate observations may be made with very little trouble, by those who have no building adapted to the purpose.\n\nThe instrument consists of a piece of machinery, by which a telescope mounted upon it may be directed to any degree of right ascension or declination, so that the place of any of the heavenly bodies being known, they may be found without any trouble, even in the daytime. As it is made to turn parallel to the equator, any object is easily kept in view, or recovered, without moving the eye from its situation. By this instrument most of the stars of the first and second magnitude have been seen even at mid-day, when the sun was shining bright; as also\nThis microscope was evidently a compound one, or rather something betwixt a telescope and a microscope; so that it is possible that single microscopes might have been known, and in use, some time before; but perhaps nobody thought of giving that name to single lenses; though, from the first use of lenses, they could not but have been used for the purpose of magnifying small objects. In this sense we have seen, that even the ancients were in possession of microscopes; and it appears from Jamblicus and Plutarch, quoted by Dr Rogers, that they gave such instruments as they used for this purpose the name of dioptra. At what time lenses were made so small as we now generally use them for magnifying in single microscopes, we have not found. But as this must necessarily have been done gradually, the only proper object of inquiry is the invention of the double microscope; and this is clearly given, by the evidence of Borellus above mentioned, to Z. Janzen, or his son.\n\nThe invention of compound microscopes is claimed by the same Fontana who arrogated to himself the discovery of telescopes; and though he did not publish any account of this invention till the year 1646 (notwithstanding he pretended to have made the discovery in 1618), Montucla, not from attending perhaps to the testimony of Borellus, is willing to allow his claim, as he thought there was no other person who seemed to have any better title to it.\n\nEustachio Divini made microscopes with two common object-glasses, and two plano-convex eye-glasses joined together on their convex sides so as to meet in a point. The tube in which they were inclosed was very large, and the eye-glasses almost as broad as the palm of a man's hand. Mr Oldenburg, secretary to the royal society, received an account of this instrument from Rome, and read it at one of their meetings, August 6, 1668.\n\nIt was about this time that Hartlacker improved single microscopes, by using small globules of glass, made by melting them in the flame of a candle, instead of the lenses which had before been made use of for that purpose. By this means he first discovered the animalcula in feminis masculinis, which gave rise to a new system of generation. A microscope of this kind, consisting of a globe of 7/10 of an inch in diameter, M. Huygens demonstrated to magnify 100 times; and since it is easy to make them of less than half a line in diameter, they may be made to magnify 300 times.\n\nBut no man distinguished himself so much by microscopic discoveries as the famous M. Leeuwenhoek, though he used only single lenses with short foci, preferring distinctness of vision to a large magnifying power.\n\nM. Leeuwenhoek's microscopes were all single ones, each of them consisting of a small double convex glass, set in a socket between two silver plates riveted together, and pierced with a small hole; and the object was fixed on the point of a needle, which could be placed at any distance from the lens. If the objects were solid, he fastened them with glue; and if they were fluid, or required to be spread upon glass, he placed them on a small piece of Muscovy talc, or thin glass; which he afterwards glued to his needle. He had, however, a different apparatus for viewing the circulation of the blood, which he could attach to the same microscopes.\nM. Leeuwenhoek bequeathed the greatest part of his microscopes to the Royal Society. They were placed in a small Indian cabinet, in the drawers of which were 13 little boxes, each of which contained two microscopes, neatly fitted up in silver.\n\nThe glafs of all these lenses is exceedingly clear, but none of them magnifies so much as those globules which are frequently used in other microscopes. Mr Folkes, who examined them, thought that they showed objects with much greater distinctness, a circumstance which M. Leeuwenhoek principally valued. His discoveries, however, are to be ascribed not so much to the goodness of his glasses, as to his great experience in using them.\n\nMr Baker, who also examined these microscopes, and reported concerning them to the Royal Society, found that the greatest magnifier enlarged the diameter of an object about 160 times, but that all the rest fell much short of that power. He therefore concluded that M. Leeuwenhoek must have had other microscopes of a much greater magnifying power for many of his discoveries.\n\nIt appears from M. Leeuwenhoek's writings, that he was not unacquainted with the method of viewing opaque objects by means of a small concave reflecting mirror, which was afterwards improved by M. Lieberk\u00fchn. For, after describing his apparatus for viewing cells in glass tubes, he adds, that he had an instrument to which he screwed a microscope set in brass, upon which microscope he fastened a little dish of bras, probably that his eye might be thereby assisted to see objects better; for he says he had filled the bras which was read his microscope, as bright as he could, that the light, while he was viewing objects, might be reflected from it as much as possible. This microscope, with its dish, is constructed upon principles so similar to those which are the foundation of our single microscope by reflection (see Microscope,) that it may well be supposed to have given the hint to the ingenious inventor of it.\n\nIn 1702, Mr Wilton made several ingenious improvements in the method of using single magnifiers, for the purpose of viewing transparent objects; and his microscope, which is also a necessary part of the solar microscope, is in very general use at this day, (See Microscope, sect. 1.)\n\nIn 1710, Mr Adams gave to the Royal Society the following account of his method of making small globules for large magnifiers. He took a piece of fine window-glass, and cut it with a diamond into several flips, not exceeding \u00bc of an inch in breadth; then, holding one of them between the forefinger and thumb of each hand over a very fine flame, till the glass began to soften, he drew it out till it was as fine as a hair, and broke; then putting each of the ends into the purest part of the flame, he had two globules, which he could increase or diminish at pleasure. If they were held a long time in the flame, they would have spots in them, so that he drew them out immediately after they became round. He broke off the stem as near to the globule as he could, and lodging the remainder between the plates, in which holes were drilled exactly round, the microscope, he says, performed to admiration. Through these magnifiers the same thread of very fine muslin appeared three or four times bigger than it did in the largest of Mr Wilton's magnifiers.\n\nThe ingenious Mr Grey hit upon a very easy expedient to make very good temporary microscopes, at a very little expense. They consist of nothing but small drops of water, taken up with a point of a pin, and put into a small hole made in a piece of metal. These globules of water do not, indeed, magnify to much as those of Mr Grey, which are made of glasses of the same size, because the refractive power of water is not so great; but the same purpose will be answered nearly as well by making them somewhat smaller.\n\nThe same ingenious person, observing that small heterogeneous particles inclosed in the glasses of which microscopes are made, were much magnified when those glasses were looked through, thought of making his microscopes of water that contained living animalcula, to see how they would look in this new situation; and he found his scheme to answer beyond his expectation, so that he could not even account for their being magnified to much as they were: for it was much more than they would have been magnified if they had been placed beyond the globe, in the proper place for viewing objects. But Montesquieu observes, that when any object is inclosed within this small transparent globe, the hinder-part of it acts like a concave mirror, provided they be situated between that surface and the focus; and that, by this means, they are magnified above 3\u00bd times more than they would have been in the usual way.\n\nTemporary microscopes of a different kind have been constructed by Dr Brewster. They were composed of turpentine varnish, which was formed into a plano-convex lens, by laying a drop of it upon a piece of plain glass; the under surface of the glass was then smoked, and the black pigment removed immediately below the fluid lens. These lenses lasted for a long time, and showed objects distinctly, even when combined into a compound microscope. See Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. and Microscope, p. 19.\n\nAfter the successful construction of the reflecting telescope, it was natural to expect that attempts would also be made to render a similar service to microscopes. Accordingly we find two plans of this kind. The first was that of Dr Robert Barker. His instrument differs in nothing from the reflecting telescope, excepting the distance of the two speculums, in order to adapt it to those pencils of rays which enter the microscope diverging; whereas they come to the telescope from very distant objects nearly parallel to each other.\n\nThis microscope is not so easy to manage as those of the common kind. For vision by reflection, as it is much more perfect, it is far more difficult than that by refraction. Nor is this microscope so useful for any but very small or transparent objects. For the object, being between the speculum and image, would, if it were large and opaque, prevent a due reflection.\n\nDr Smith invented a double reflecting microscope, Dr Smith's of which a theoretical and practical account is given reflecting in his remarks at the end of the second volume of his System of Optics. As it is constructed on principles different all others, from all others, and, in the opinion of some, superior to them all, the reader will not be displeased with the following practical description.\n\nA section of this microscope is shown in fig. 2, where Plate ABC and ade are two speculums, the former concave, and the latter convex, inclosed within the tube DEFG. The speculum ABC is perforated, and the object to be viewed.\nHistory viewed is to placed between the centre and principal focus of that speculum, that the rays flowing from it to ABC are reflected towards an image p q. But before that image is formed, they are intercepted by the convex speculum abc, and thence reflected through the hole BC in the vertex of the concave to a second image \u03c0\u03b1, to be viewed through an eye-glass l. The object may either be situated between the two specula, or, which is perhaps better, between the principal focus and vertex c of the convex speculum abc, a small hole being made in its vertex for the transmission of the incident rays. When the microscope is used, let the object be included between two little round plates of Mucovy-glass fixed in a hole of an oblong brass plate u m, intended to slide close to the back side of the convex speculum; which must therefore be ground flat on that side, and so thin that the object may come precisely to its computed distance from the vertex of the speculum. The slider must be kept tight to the back of the metal by a gentle spring. The distance of the object being thus determined, distinct vision to different eyes, and through different eye-glasses, must be procured by a gentle motion of the little tubes that contain these glasses. These tubes must be made in the usual form of those that belong to Sir Isaac Newton's reflecting telescope, having a small hole in the middle of each plate, at the ends of the tube, situated exactly in each focus of the glass. The use of these holes and plates is to limit the visible area, and prevent any straggling rays from entering the eye. To the tube of the eye-glass is fastened the arm g, on which the adjusting screw turns. A similar arm u is attached to the fixed tube X, in which the neck of the screw turns; and by turning the button y, the eye-tube is moved farther from or nearer to the object, by which means different sorts of eyes obtain distinct vision.\n\nThe rays which flow from the object directly through the hole in the concave speculum and through the eye-glass, by mixing with the reflected rays, would dilute the image on the retina, and therefore must be intercepted. This is done by a very simple contrivance. The little hole in the convex speculum is ground conical as in the figure; and a conical solid P, of which the base is larger than the orifice in the back of the convex speculum, supported on the slender pillar PQ, is so placed as to intercept all the direct rays from the eye-glass. The tubes are strongly blacked on their insides, and likewise the conical solid, to hinder all reflection of rays upon the convex speculum. The little base, too, of the solid should be made concave, that whatever light it may still reflect, may be thrown back upon the object; and its back-side being conical and blacked all over, will either absorb or laterally disperse any straggling rays which the concave speculum may scatter upon it, and so prevent their coming to the eye-glass.\n\nNotwithstanding the interpolation of this conical solid, yet when the eye-glass is taken out, distant objects may be distinctly seen through the microscope, by rays reflected from the metals, and diverging upon the eye from an image behind the convex speculum. But this mixture of foreign rays with those of the object, which is common to all kinds of microscopes in viewing transparent objects, is usually prevented by placing before the object a thick double convex lens l, to collect the sky-light exactly upon the object. This lens should be just so broad as to subtend the opposite angle to that which the concave speculum subtends at the object. The annular frame of the lens must be very narrow, and connected with the microscope by two or three slender wires or blades, whose planes produced may pass through the object, and intercept from it as little sky-light as possible.\n\nThis is not the place for explaining the principles of this microscope, or demonstrating its superiority over most others; nor are such explanation and demonstration necessary. Its excellence, as well as the principles upon which it is constructed, will be perceived by the reader, when he has made himself master of the laws of refraction and reflection as laid down in the sequel of this article.\n\nM. Lieberkuhn, in 1738 or 1739, made two capital improvements in microscopes, by the invention of the solar microscope, and the microscope for opaque objects. When he was in England in the winter of 1739, he showed an apparatus for each of these purposes, made by himself, to several gentlemen of the Royal Society, as well as to some opticians.\n\nThe microscope for opaque objects remedies the inconvenience of having the dark side of an object next the eye. For by means of a concave speculum of silver, highly polished, in the centre of which a magnifying lens is placed, the object is so strongly illuminated that it may be examined with all imaginable ease and pleasure. A convenient apparatus of this kind, with four different specula and magnifiers of different powers, was brought to perfection by Mr Cuff in Fleet-street. M. Lieberkuhn made considerable improvements in his solar microscope, particularly in adapting it to the view of opaque objects; but in what manner this was effected, M. \u00c6pinus, who was highly entertained with the performance, and who mentions the fact, was not able to recollect; and the death of the ingenious inventor prevented his publishing any account of it himself. M. \u00c6pinus invites those who came into the possession of M. Lieberkuhn's apparatus to publish an account of this instrument; but it does not appear that his method was ever published.\n\nThis improvement of M. Lieberkuhn's induced M. \u00c6pinus himself to attend to the subject; and he thus produced a very valuable improvement in this instrument. For by throwing the light upon the foreside of any object by means of a mirror, before it is transmitted through the object-lens, all kinds of objects are equally well represented by it.\n\nM. Euler proposed to introduce vision by reflected light into the magic lantern and solar microscope, by light introduced which many inconveniences to which those instruments were subjected might be avoided. For this purpose, he says, the microscope and that nothing is necessary but a large concave mirror, magic lantern perforated as for a telescope; and the light should be focused, situated, that none of it may pass directly through the perforation, so as to fall on the images of the objects upon the screen. He proposes to have four different machines, for objects of different sizes; the first for those of six feet long, the second for those of one foot, the third for those of two inches, and the fourth for those of two lines; but it is needless to be particular in the description.","sp":185,"ep":217},{"h":"INDEX","t":"A\n\nAcrochordus, characters and species of, No 116\nAnatomy of serpents, 12-41\nAnguis, characters and species of, 119-126\nAmphibena, characters, &c. 127-130\nAsp, 79\n\nB\n\nBanded rattle-snake, history of, 55\nBoa, characters, species, and history of, 60-71\nBlack Snake, 93\nBlack-tailed rattle-snake, 59\nBlue and green snake, 95\nCanine boa, 65\nCerastes, 81\nCrotalus, characters and species of, 53-59\nnatural history of, ib.\nCobra de Capello, 84\nColuber, characters, species, and history of, 72-101\nConstrictor boa, 61\n\nCoach-whip snake, Caecilia, characters, &c.

Of the Rise and Progress of Oratory.\n\nThe invention of oratory is, by the Egyptians, and the fables of the poets, ascribed to Mercury. And it is well known, that the Greeks made their deities the authors likewise of other arts, and supposed that they presided over them. Hence they gave Mercury the titles of *Aegeus* and *Egeus*, both which names come from words that signify \"to speak.\" And Aristeides calls eloquence the *gift of Mercury*; and for the same reason anciently the tongue was consecrated to him. He was likewise said to be the interpreter or messenger of the gods; which office very well fitted him, as he excelled in eloquence. Hence we read in the Sacred Writings, that when the people of Lystra took Barnabas and Paul for gods in human shape, because of that sudden and surprising cure which was wrought upon the lame man, they\nthey called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury; for this reason, as the inspired writer tells us, 'because he was the chief speaker,' that is (as the spectators then thought), the interpreter or spokesman of Barnabas.\n\nBut to pass over these fictions of the heathen deities, let us hear what Quintilian says of the origin of this art; who seems to give a very probable account of it in the following passage. \"The faculty of speech (says he) we derive from nature (A); but the art from observation. For as in physic, men, by seeing that some things promote health and others destroy it, formed the art upon those observations; in like manner, by perceiving that some things in discourse are said to advantage, and others not, they accordingly marked those things, in order to imitate the one and avoid the other. They also added some things from their own reason and judgment, which being confirmed by use, they began to teach others what they knew themselves.\" But no certain account can be given when, or by whom, this method of observation first began to take place. And Aristotle supposes, not without reason, that the first lineaments of the art were very rude and imperfect. Pausanias, indeed, in his Description of Greece, tells us, that Pittheus, the uncle of Theseus, taught it at Troezen a city of Peloponnesus, and wrote a book concerning it; which he read himself, as it was published by one of Epidaurus. But as Pittheus lived about 1000 years before Pausanias, who flourished in the time of the emperor Hadrian, some are of opinion he might be imposed upon by the Epidaurian, who published this book under the name of Pittheus. But be that as it will, it is very reasonable to believe, that the Greeks had the principles of this art so early as the time of Pittheus. For Theseus his nephew lived not long before the taking of Troy, which, according to Sir Isaac Newton, happened 904 years before the birth of Christ; at which time Cicero thought it was in much esteem among them. \"Homer (says he) would never have given Ulysses and Nestor in the Trojan war so great commendations on account of their speeches (to one of whom he attributes force, and to the other sweetness of expression), if eloquence had not in those times been in great repute.\" And lest any one should imagine, that in those days they made use only of such helps as nature and practice could afford them, the same poet informs us, that Peleus sent Phoenix with his son Achilles to the Trojan war, to instruct him not only in the art of war, but likewise of eloquence. But who were the professors of this art for some ages following is not known. For Quintilian says, that afterwards Empedocles is the first upon record who attempted any thing concerning it. And he, by Sir Isaac Newton's account, flourished about 500 years after Troy was taken. At which time, as Cicero observes, men being now sensible of the powerful charms of oratory, and the influence it had upon the mind, there immediately arose several masters of it; the chief of whom are mentioned by Quintilian, who tells us, that \"the oldest writers upon this art are Corax and Tisias, both of Sicily. After them came Gorgias of Leontium in the same island, who is said to have been the scholar of Empedocles, and by reason of his great age (for he lived to be 109 years old) had many contemporaries. Thrasyllus of Chalcodon, Prodicus of Ceos, orators of Abdera, Hippas of Elis, and Alcidamus, of Elea, lived in his time; as likewise Antiphon, who first wrote orations, and also upon the art, and is said to have spoken admirably well in his own defence; and besides these, Polycrates, and Theodore of Byzantium. These persons contributed different ways towards the improvement of the art. Corax and Tisias gave rules for methodizing a discourse, and adjusting its particular parts; as may be conjectured from Cicero's account of them, who says, \"Though some had spoke well before their time, yet none with order and method.\" But Gorgias seems to have excelled all the rest in fame and reputation: for he was so highly applauded by all Greece, that a golden statue was erected to him at Delphi, which was a distinguishing honour conferred upon him only. And he is said to have been so great a master of oratory, that in a public assembly he would undertake to declaim immediately upon any subject proposed to him. He wrote, as Cicero informs us, in the demonstrative or laudatory way; which requires most of the sublime, and makes what Diodorus Siculus says of him the more probable, that \"he first introduced the strongest figures, members of periods opposite in sense, of an equal length, or ending with a like sound, and other ornaments of that nature.\" And hence those figures, which give the greatest force and lustre to a discourse, were anciently called by his name. Cicero tells us further, that Thrasyllus and Gorgias were the first who introduced numbers into prose, which Hippocrates afterwards brought to perfection. Quintilian likewise mentions Protagoras, Gorgias, Prodicus, and Thrasyllus, as the first who treated of common places, and showed the use of them for the invention of arguments. Nor must we omit Plato, whose elegant dialogue upon this subject is still extant, which he entitles Gorgias. For though he does not lay down the common rules of the art; yet he very well explains the nature of it, and maintains its true end and use against the generality of its professors, who had greatly perverted the original design of it. Thus by the study and industry of so many ingenious and great men, the art of oratory was then carried to a considerable height among the Grecians: though many of those who professed it in those times employed their skill rather to promote their own reputation and applause, than to serve the real interests of truth and virtue. \"For they propounded in an arrogant manner (as Cicero says) to teach how a bad cause might be so managed, as to get the better of a good one.\" That is, they would undertake to charm the ears and strike the passions of their hearers in so powerful a manner, by sophistical reasonings, turns of wit, and fine language, as to impose falsehood upon them for truth; than which nothing could be either more disingenuous in itself, or prejudicial to society.\n\nBut those who succeeded them seem to have consulted\n\n(A) If Quintilian meant that the human race speak an articulate language by nature or instinct, he certainly deceived himself (see Language); but if his meaning was only that men have from nature a capability of speech, the observation is true, but not of much value. Parrots and other birds have a capability of uttering articulate sounds.\ned better, both for their own honour and that of their profession. Ifocrates was the most renowned of all Gorgias's scholars, whom Cicero frequently extols with the highest commendations, as the greatest master and teacher of oratory; \"whose school (as he says) like the Trojan horse, sent forth abundance of great men.\" Aristotle was chiefly induced to engage in this province from an emulation of his glory; and would often say in a verse of Sophocles, somewhat varied to his purpose,\n\nTo be silent it is a shame;\nWhile Ifocrates gets such fame.\n\nQuintilian says they both wrote upon the art, though there is no system of the former now extant. But that of Aristotle is esteemed the best and most complete of any in the Greek language. In this age the Grecian eloquence appeared in its highest perfection. Demosthenes was a hearer both of Ifocrates and Plato, as also of Ifeus (ten of whose orations are yet extant); and by the influence of a surprising genius, joined with indefatigable industry, made that advantage of their precepts, that he has been always esteemed by the best judges the prince of Grecian orators. His great adversary and rival Aeschines, after his banishment, is said to have gone to Rhodes, and employed his time there in teaching of rhetoric. Theodectes and Theophratus, both of them scholars of Aristotle, imitated their master in writing upon the art. And from that time the philosophers, especially the Stoics and Peripatetics, applied themselves to lay down the rules of oratory; which Socrates had before separated from the province of a philosopher. And there is yet preserved a treatise upon this subject, which some have ascribed to Demetrius Phalereus the Peripatetic, and scholar of Theophratus, though others more probably to Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Quintilian mentions several other famous rhetoricians in the following ages, who were likewise writers: As Hermagoras, Athenaeus, Apollonius Molon, Areus C\u00e6cius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Apollonius of Pergamus, and Theodore of Gadara. But of these nothing now remains upon the subject of oratory, except some tracts of Dionysius, who flourished in the reign of Augustus Caesar. Nor have there been wanting some eminent writers of this kind among the Greeks since the time of Quintilian; two of whom we cannot omit to mention, Hermogenes, and Longinus the author of the incomparable treatise Of the Sublime, a book which can scarcely be too much commended or too often read.\n\nIt was long before Rome received this art, and not without difficulty at first. The reason was, because the Romans were for several ages wholly addicted to military affairs, and to enlarge their territories; so that they not only neglected to cultivate learning, but thought the pursuit of it a thing of ill tendency, by diverting the minds of their youth from the cares and toils of war, to a more soft and indolent kind of life. Therefore so late as the year of their city 912, when by the industry of some Grecians the liberal arts began to flourish in Italy, a decree passed the senate, by which all philosophers and rhetoricians were ordered to depart out of Rome. But in a few years after, when Carneades, Cratolaus, and Diogenes, who were not only philosophers but orators, came ambassadors from Athens to Rome, the Roman youth were so charmed with the eloquence of their harangues, that they could no longer be kept from pursuing the study of oratory. And by a further acquaintance with the Greeks, it soon gained such esteem, that persons of the first quality employed their time and pains to acquire it. And a young gentleman, who was ambitious to advance himself in the service of his country, could have little hopes of success, unless he had laid the foundation of his future prospects in that study.\n\nSeneca tells us, that Lucius Plotius, a Gaul, was the first who taught the art of oratory at Rome in Latin; which, Cicero says, was while he was a boy; and when the most studious persons went to hear him, he lamented that he could not go with them; being prevented by the regard he paid to the opinion of some of his friends, who thought that greater improvements were made by exercises in the Greek language under Grecian masters. Seneca adds, that this profession continued for some time in the hands of freedmen; and that the first Roman who engaged in it was Blandus of the equestrian order, who was succeeded by others; some of whose lives are yet extant, written by Suetonius, as many of the Grecians are by Philostratus and Eunapius. Quintilian likewise gives us the names of those among the Romans, who wrote upon the art. \"The first (says he) as far as I can learn, who composed any thing upon this argument, was M. Cato the censor. After him Antony the orator began upon the subject, which is the only work he has left, and that imperfect. Then followed some of his note. But he who carried eloquence to its highest pitch among us, was Cicero; who has likewise by his rules given the best plan both to practise and teach the art. After whom modesty would require us to mention no more, had he not told us himself that his books of rhetoric slipt out of his hands, while he was but a youth. And those lesser things, which many persons want, he has purposely omitted in his discourses of oratory. Cornificius wrote largely upon the same subject; Stertinthus and Gallicio the father, each of them something. But Celsus and Lusus were more accurate than Gallicio; and in our times Virginius, Pliny, and Rutilius. And there are at this day some celebrated authors of the same kind, who, if they had taken in every thing, might have saved my pains.\" Time has since deprived us of most of the writers mentioned here by Quintilian. But we have the least reason to regret this loss, since it has preserved to us Cicero's treatises upon this subject; which we may well suppose to have been chiefly owing to their own excellency, and the great esteem they have always had in the world. Besides his Two books of Invention, which Quintilian here calls his Books of Rhetoric, there are extant of his, Three books of an Orator; one Of famous Orators; and another, which is called The Orator; as also his Topics, a preface Concerning the best sort of Orators, and a treatise Of the parts of Oratory. Each of which treatises, whether we regard the justness and delicacy of the thoughts, the usefulness of the rules, or the elegance and beauty of the style, deserves to be frequently perused by all who are lovers of eloquence. For who can be thought so well qualified to give the rules of any art, as he who excelled all mankind in the practice of them? But those Four Books to Herennius, which are published among Cicero's works, seem with good reason to be attributed to Cornificius, whom Quintilian here mentions. And Celsus is by some affirmed\nto have taught oratory, whom he also places among the rhetoricians, and whose Eight Books of Medicine are yet extant, written in so beautiful a style as plainly shows him to be a master of eloquence. But Quintilian himself outdid all who went before him in diligence and accuracy as a writer. His Institutions are so comprehensive, and written with such great exactness and judgement, that they are generally allowed to be the most perfect work of the kind. With this excellent author we shall finish the account of the Latin rhetoricians.\n\nThere were indeed some others in the following ages, whose works are yet extant; but as they contain nothing of moment which is not to be found in those already mentioned, we shall forbear to name them. Much less shall we descend to that numerous body of writers, who since the revival of learning have treated upon this subject, for the same reason. And a very good judge has not long since given it as his opinion, that the method of forming the best system of oratory, is to collect it from the finest precepts of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Longinus, and other celebrated authors; with proper examples taken from the choicest parts of the purest antiquity. And this is the method attempted to be pursued in the following treatise.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of the Nature of Oratory.\n\nThe terms rhetoric and oratory, having no other difference but that one is taken from the Greek language and the other from the Latin, may be used promiscuously; but the case is not the same with respect to the words rhetorician and orator. For although the Greeks used the former, both to express those who taught the art, and those who practised it; yet the Romans afterward, when they took that word into their language, confined it to the teachers of the art, and called the rest orators. And there seems to have been a sufficient reason for this distinction, since the art was the same in both, and might therefore go by either name: but the different province of rhetoricians and orators made it not improper that they should be called by different names. Besides, anciently, before rhetoric was made a separate and distinct art from philosophy, the same persons taught both. And then they were called not only rhetoricians but sophists. But because they often employed their art rather to vindicate what was false and unjust, than to support truth and virtue; this disingenuous conduct, by which they frequently imposed upon weak minds, brought a discredit both upon themselves and their profession. And therefore the name sophist or sophister, has been more generally used in an ill sense, to signify one skilled rather in the arts of cavilling, than qualified to speak well and accurately upon any subject.\n\nIt is not necessary to use many words, to prove that oratory is an art. For it is comprised under certain rules, agreeable to reason, delivered in a regular method, and fitted to attain the end it proposes; which are characters sufficient to denominate it an art. Indeed the case is the same here as in most other things, that a good genius is of itself more serviceable than the most exact acquaintance with all the rules of art, where that is wanting. But it is sufficient that art help nature, and carry it farther than it can otherwise advance without it. And he who is desirous to gain the reputation of a good orator, will find the assistance of art very necessary. Some persons have thought, that many of the common systems written upon the subject of oratory have been attended with this inconvenience, that, by burdening the mind with too great a number of rules about things of less importance, they have often-times rather discouraged than promoted the study of eloquence. This undoubtedly is an extreme which should be always carefully avoided. But, however, an indifferent guide in a strange road is better than none at all. It may be worth while to hear Quintilian's opinion upon this head. \"I would not (says he) have young persons think they are sufficiently instructed, if they have learned one of those compends which are commonly handed about, and fancy themselves safe in the decrees, as it were, of these technical writers. The art of speaking requires much labour, constant study, a variety of exercise, many trials, the greatest prudence, and readiness of thought. However, these treatises are useless, when they set you in a plain and open way, and do not confine you to one narrow track, from which he who thinks it a crime to depart must move as slowly as one that walks upon a rope.\" We see he is not for having us confine ourselves too closely to systems, though he thinks they are of service at first, till use and experience render them less necessary.\n\nThe business of oratory is to teach us to speak well; the object which, as Cicero explains it, is to speak justly, methodically, calmly, floridly, and copiously.\n\nNow, in order to speak justly, or pertinently, a person must be master of his subject, that he may be able to say all that is proper, and avoid whatever may appear foreign and trifling. And he must clothe his thoughts with such words and expressions as are most suited to the nature of the argument, and will give it the greatest force and evidence.\n\nAnd as it teaches to speak justly, so likewise methodically. This requires, that all the parts of a discourse be placed in their proper order, and with such just connection, as to reflect a light upon each other, and thereby to render the whole both clear in itself, and easy to be retained. But the same method is not proper for all discourses. And very frequently a different manner is convenient in handling the same subject. For it is plain, that art, as well as nature, loves variety; and it discovers the speaker's judgement, when the disposition of his discourse is so framed, as to appear easy and natural, rather than the effect of industry and labour.\n\nTo speak floridly, is so peculiar a property of this art, that some have wholly confined it to the pomp and ornaments of language. But that it extends farther, and respects things as well as words, we shall have occasion to show hereafter. It contains indeed the whole subject of elocution, but does not wholly consist in it. True and solid eloquence requires not only the beauties and flowers of language, but likewise the best sense and clearest reasoning. Besides, rhetoric gives rules for the several sorts of style, and directs the use of them agreeably to the nature of the subject.\n\nBut the force of oratory appears in nothing more than a copiousness of expression, or a proper manner of enlargement, suited to the nature of the subject; which is of great use in persuasion, and forms the last property, required by Cicero, of speaking well. A short and concise\nAnd as different kinds of discourses require different arguments, rhetoricians have considered them two ways; in general, under certain heads, as a common fund for all subjects; and in a more particular manner, as they\n\n\u00a7 3.

However, it is the business of art nature, and to treat of things in that manner dictates.","sp":345,"ep":349},{"h":"ION","t":"to demonstrative, deliberative, or judicial difference. At present we shall treat only upon the former. And now, that one thing may receive confirmation from another, it is necessary that some relation between them; for all things are adapted to prove one another. Thus, in the quantity of two things which we would be either equal or unequal, if they are of such that one cannot be applied to the other, then third thing, which may be applied to them; that must be equal at least to one of the two, applied to the other, and found equal to that readily conclude that these two things are if it be unequal to the other, we say that things are unequal. Because it is the certain known property of all quantities, that whatsoever two things are equal to a third, are equal to one another; and where one of any two things is equal to a third, and the other unequal, those two things are unequal to one another. What has been said of quantities,\nto have taught oratory, whom he also places among the rhetoricians, and whose Eight Books of Medicine are yet extant, written in so beautiful a style as plainly shows him to be a master of eloquence. But Qui himself outdid all who went before him in diligence and accuracy as a writer. His Institutions are so comprehensive, and written with such great exactness and judgement, that they are generally allowed to be the most perfect work of the kind. With this excellent author we shall finish the account of the Latin rhetoricians.\n\nThere were indeed some others in the following whole works are yet extant; but as they contain nothing of moment which is not to be found in those already mentioned, we shall forbear to name them. Must we defend to that numerous body of writers since the revival of learning have treated upon the subject, for the same reason. And a very good judge not long since given it as his opinion, that the art of forming the best system of oratory, is to collect from the finest precepts of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Longinus, and other celebrated authors; with examples taken from the choicest parts of the purity of antiquity. And this is the method attempted to be used in the following treatise.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of the Nature of Oratory.\n\nThe terms rhetoric and oratory, having no other difference but that one is taken from the Greek language and the other from the Latin, may be used promiscuously; but the case is not the same with respect to words rhetorician and orator. For although the ancients used the former, both to express those who knew the art, and those who professed it; yet the Romans afterward, when they took that word into their language, confined it to the teachers of the art, and called them orators. And there seems to have been a sufficient reason for this distinction, since the art was the same in both, and might therefore go by either name; but different province of rhetoricians and orators made it improper that they should be called by different names. Besides, anciently, before rhetoric was made a separate and distinct art from philosophy, the same persons used both. And then they were called not only rhetors but sophists. But because they often employed the art rather to vindicate what was false and unjust, than to support truth and virtue; this disingenuous conduct which they frequently imposed upon weak minds brought a discredit both upon themselves and their profession. And therefore the name sophist or sophistic has been more generally used in an ill sense, to signify skilled rather in the arts of cavilling, than qualified to speak well and accurately upon any subject.\n\nIt is not necessary to use many words, to prove oratory is an art. For it is comprised under certain rules, agreeable to reason, delivered in a regular method, and fitted to attain the end it proposes; these are characters sufficient to denominate it an art; indeed the case is the same here as in most other things, that a good genius is of itself more serviceable than the most exact acquaintance with all the rules of art, where that is wanting. But it is sufficient that art helps nature, and carry it farther than it can otherwise advance without it. And he who is desirous to gain the reputation of a good orator, will find the assistance of art very necessary. Some persons have thought, that many of the common systems written upon the subject...\ncife account of things is often attended with obscurity, from an omission of some necessary circumstances relating to them. Or, however, where that is not the case, yet for want of proper embellishments to enliven the discourse, and thereby to excite and fix the hearers attention, it is apt to slip through their minds without leaving any impression. But where the images of things are drawn in their full proportion, painted in their proper colours, set in a clear light, and represented in different views, with all the strength and beauties of eloquence, they captivate the minds of the audience with the highest pleasure, engage their attention, and by an irresistible force move and bend them to the design of the speaker.\n\nThe principal end and design of oratory is to persuade: for which reason it is frequently called the art of persuasion. Indeed the orator has often other subordinate views; as when he endeavours either to delight his hearers with what is pleasant and agreeable, or to conciliate their good opinion by a smooth and artful address: but still both these are in order to persuade and excite them to action.\n\nAn objection may, perhaps, hence be formed against eloquence, as an art which may be employed for persuading to ill as well as to good. There is no doubt that it may; and so reasoning may also be, and too often is, employed for leading men into error. But who would think of forming an argument from this against the cultivation of our reasoning powers? Reason, eloquence, and every art which ever has been studied among mankind, may be abused, and may prove dangerous in the hands of bad men; but it were perfectly childish to contend, that upon this account they ought to be abolished.\n\nWhile the orator employs his art in pursuing only those ends for which it was at first designed, the persuading men to good and virtuous actions, and diffusing them from every thing that is ill and vicious; nothing can be more commendable in itself, or useful to human societies.\n\n\u00a7 3. Of the Division of Oratory.\n\nOratory consists of four parts: invention, disposition, elocution, and pronunciation. This will appear by considering the nature of each of them, and what it contributes in forming an orator. Every one who aims to speak well and accurately upon any subject, does naturally in the first place inquire after and pursue such thoughts as may seem most proper to explain and illustrate the thing upon which he designs to discourse. And if the nature of it requires that he should bring reasons to confirm what he says, he not only seeks the strongest, and such as are likely to be best received; but also prepares to answer any thing which may be offered to the contrary. This is invention.\u2014After this he deliberates with himself in what method to dispose of those things which have occurred to his mind, that they may appear in the plainest light, and not lose their force by disorder and confusion.\u2014This is the business of disposition.\u2014His next concern is to give his thoughts an agreeable dress; by making choice of the fittest words, clearest expressions, smooth and harmonious periods, with other ornaments of style, as may best suit the nature of his subject, brighten his discourse, and render it most entertaining to his hearers. And this is called elocution.\u2014The last thing he attends to, is to deliver what he has thus composed, with a just and agreeable pronunciation. And daily experience convinces us, how much this contributes both to engage the attention and impress what is spoken upon the mind. This then is the method to which nature directs, in order to qualify ourselves for discoursing to the best advantage: Though by custom and habit these things become so familiar to us, that we do not always attend to them separately in their natural order. However, it is the business of art to follow nature, and to treat of things in that manner which she dictates.\n\nPart I. Of Invention.\n\nChap. I. Of Invention in general; and particularly of Common Places, and State of a Cause.\n\nInvention, considered in general, is the discovery of such things as are proper to persuade. And in order to attain this end, the orator proposes to himself three things: To prove or illustrate the subject upon which he treats; to conciliate the minds of his hearers; and to engage their passions in his favour. And as these require different kinds of arguments or motives, invention furnishes him with a supply for each of them, as will be shown in their order.\n\nAn argument, as defined by Cicero, is a reason which induces us to believe what before we doubted of.\n\nAnd as different kinds of discourses require different arguments, rhetoricians have considered them two ways; in general, under certain heads, as a common fund for all subjects; and in a more particular manner, as they are suited to demonstrative, deliberative, or judicial discourses. At present we shall treat only upon the former of these. And now, that one thing may receive proof and confirmation from another, it is necessary that there be some relation between them; for all things are not equally adapted to prove one another. Thus, in measuring the quantity of two things which we would show to be either equal or unequal, if they are of such a nature that one cannot be applied to the other, then we take a third thing, which may be applied to them both; and that must be equal at least to one of the two, which if applied to the other, and found equal to that also, we presently conclude that these two things are equal; but if it be unequal to the other, we say that these two things are unequal. Because it is the certain and known property of all quantities, that whatsoever two things are equal to a third, are equal to one another; and where one of any two things is equal to a third, and the other unequal, those two things are unequal to one another. What has been said of quantities,\nInvention will hold true in all other cases, so far as any two things or ideas agree to a third, so far they agree to one another. So likewise, on the contrary, as far as one of any two things or ideas does agree to a third, as the other does not, so far they disagree with one another; in which respect, one of them cannot be truly affirmed of the other. Since, therefore, in every proposition, one thing is spoken of another, if we would find out whether the two ideas agree to each other or not, where this is not evident of itself, we must find out some third thing, the idea of which agrees to one of them; and then that being applied to the other, as it does agree or disagree with it, so we may conclude, that the two things proposed do agree or disagree with one another. This will be made more clear by an example or two.\n\nShould it be inquired, Whether virtue is to be loved; the argument between virtue and love might be found by comparing them separately with each other, as a common measure to both. For since the idea of happiness agrees to that of love, and the idea of virtue to that of happiness; it follows, that the ideas of virtue and love agree to one another; and therefore it may be affirmed, That virtue is to be loved. But, on the contrary, because the idea of misery disagrees with that of love, but the idea of vice agrees to that of misery, the two ideas of vice and love must consequently disagree with one another; and therefore it would be false to affirm, That vice is to be loved. Now, this third thing logicians call the medium, or middle term, because it does as it were connect two extremes; that is, both parts of a proposition. But rhetoricians call it an argument, because it is so applied to what was before proposed, as to become the instrument of procuring our assent to it. Thus far as to the nature and use of arguments. We shall next explain by what methods they are to be sought.\n\nA lively imagination, and readiness of thought, are undoubtedly a very great help to invention. Some persons are naturally endowed with that quickness of fancy, and penetration of mind that they are seldom at a loss for arguments either to defend their own opinions, or to attack their adversaries. However, these things being the gift of nature, and not to be gained by art, do not properly fall under our present consideration.\n\nIt will be readily granted, that great learning and extensive knowledge are a noble fund for invention. An orator therefore should be furnished with a stock of important truths, solid maxims of reason, and a variety of knowledge, collected and treasured up both from observation and a large acquaintance with the liberal arts, that he may not only be qualified to express himself in the most agreeable manner, but likewise to support what he says with the strongest and clearest arguments.\n\nBut because all are not born with a like happy genius, and had not the same opportunity to cultivate their minds with learning and knowledge; and because nothing is more difficult than to dwell long upon the consideration of one thing, in order to find out the strongest arguments which may be offered for and against it; upon these accounts, art has prescribed a method to lessen, in some measure, these difficulties, and help every one to a supply of arguments upon any subject. And this is done by the contrivance of common places, which Cicero calls the feats or heads of arguments, and by a Greek name topoi. They are of two sorts, internal and external.\n\nI. Internal topics. Though things, with regard to rules of art their nature and properties, are exceedingly various, to supply yet they have certain common relations, by means of the place whereof the truth of what is either affirmed or denied concerning them in any respect may be evinced. The ancient Greek rhetoricians therefore reduced these relations to some general heads, which are termed loci or common places; because the reasons or arguments fitted to prove any proposition are resorted in them, as a common fund or receptacle. And they are called internal heads, because they arise from the subject upon which the orator treats; and are therefore distinguished from others named external, which he fetches from without, and applies to his present purpose, as will be shown hereafter. Cicero and Quintilian make them 16; three of which comprehend the whole thing they are brought to prove, namely, definition, enumeration, and notation; of the remaining 13, some contain a part of it, and the rest its various properties and circumstances, with other considerations relating to it; and these are, genus, species, antecedents, consequents, adjuncts, conjunctions, causes, effects, contraries, opposites, similitude, dissimilitude, and comparison.\n\nDefinition explains the nature of the thing defined, and shows what it is. And to whatsoever the definition agrees, the thing defined does likewise. If therefore Socrates be a rational creature, he is a man; because it is the definition of a man, that he is a rational creature.\n\nEnumeration takes in all the parts of a thing. And from this we prove, that what agrees to all the parts agrees to the whole; and what does not agree to any one or more parts, does not agree to the whole: As when Cicero proves to Philo that all the Roman state hated him, by enumerating the several ranks and orders of Roman citizens who all did so.\n\nNotation, or etymology, explains the meaning or signification of a word. From which we reason thus: \"If he cannot pay his debts, he is insolvent;\" for that is the meaning of the word insolvent.\n\nGenus is what contains under it two or more sorts of things, differing in nature. From this head logicians reason thus: \"Because every animal is mortal, and man is an animal, therefore man is mortal.\" But orators make a further use of this argument, which they call ascending from the hypothesis to the thesis; that is, from a particular to a general: As should a person, when speaking in praise of justice, take occasion from thence to commend and show the excellency of virtue in general, with a view to render that particular virtue more amiable. For since every species contains in it the whole nature of the genus to which it relates, besides what is peculiar to itself, whereby it is distinguished from it; what is affirmed of the genus, must of necessity be applicable to the species.\n\nSpecies is that which comprehends under it all the individuals of the same nature. From hence we may argue, \"He is a man, therefore he has a rational soul.\" And orators sometimes take occasion from this head to descend from the thesis to the hypothesis;\nInvention: that is, in treating upon what is more general, to introduce some particular contained under it, for the greater illustration of the general.\n\nAntecedents are such things as, being once allowed, necessarily or very probably follow. From this head an inseparable property is proved from its subject: as, It is material, and therefore corruptible.\n\nConsequents are such things as, being allowed, necessarily or very probably infer their antecedents. Hence the subject is proved from an inseparable property, in this manner: It is corruptible, and therefore material.\n\nAdjuncts are separable properties of things, or circumstances that attend them. There are very numerous, and afford a great variety of arguments, some of which usually occur in every discourse. They do not necessarily infer their subject; but, if fitly chosen, render a thing credible, and are a sufficient ground for assent. The way of reasoning from them we shall show presently.\n\nConjugates are words deduced from the same origin with that of our subject. By these the habit is proved from its acts: as, He who does justly is just. He does not act wisely, therefore he is not wise. But this inference will not hold, unless the actions appear continued and constant.\n\nA cause is that, by the force of which a thing does exist. There are four kinds of causes, matter, form, efficient, and end, which afford a great variety of arguments. The way of reasoning from them is to infer the effect from the cause: as, Man is endowed with reason, therefore he is capable of knowledge.\n\nAn effect is that which arises from a cause, therefore the cause is proved by it: as, He is endowed with knowledge, therefore with reason.\n\nContraries are things, which, under the same genus, are at the utmost distance from each other; so that what we grant to the one, we utterly deny the other: as Virtue ought to be embraced, therefore vice should be avoided.\n\nOpposites are such things, which, though repugnant to each other, yet are not directly contradictory; as, To love and to injure, to hate and to commend. They differ from contraries in this, that they do not absolutely exclude one another. An argument is drawn from things repugnant, thus: He will do a man mischief, therefore he does not love him. He loves a man, therefore he will not reproach him.\n\nSimilitude is an agreement of things in quality. Thus Cicero proves, that pernicious citizens ought to be taken out of the state, by the likeness they bear to corrupted members, which are cut off to prevent further damage to the body.\n\nDiffinitiude is a disagreement of things in quality. From this head Cicero shows the preference of his own exile to Piso's government of Macedonia; by the difference between their conduct, and the people's esteem of them.\n\nComparison is made three ways: for either a thing is compared with a greater, with a less, or with its equal. This place, therefore, differs from that of similitude on this account, that the quality was considered in that, but here the quantity. An argument from the greater is thus drawn: If five legions could not conquer the enemy, much less will two.\n\nWe shall just give one example of the manner of invention: reasoning from these heads, whereby the use of them may farther appear. If any one, therefore, should have endeavoured to persuade Cicero not to accept of his life upon the condition offered him by Antony, rising from that he would burn his Philippic orations which had these heads been spoken against him, he might be supposed to use such arguments as these; partly taken from the adjuncts of Cicero, partly from those of Antony, and partly from the thing itself. And first with regard to Cicero, it might be said, That so great a man ought not to purchase his life at so dear a price as the loss of that immortal honour which by so great pains and labour he had acquired. And this might be confirmed by another argument, That now he was grown old, and could not expect to live much longer. And from the character of Antony he might argue thus: That he was very crafty and deceitful; and only designed, by giving him hopes of life, to have the Philippics set burnt, which otherwise he knew would transmit to posterity an eternal brand of infamy upon him; and then he would take off the author. And this might be shown by comparison. For since he would not spare others, who had not so highly exasperated him, and from whom he had not so much to fear; certainly he would not forgive Cicero, since he knew well enough, that so long as he lived, he himself could never be in safety. And, lastly, An argument might also be fetched from the nature of the thing itself in the following manner: That Cicero, by this action would shamefully betray the state, and the cause of liberty, which he had through his whole life most courageously defended, with so great honour to himself, and advantage to the public. Upon such an account, a person might have used these or the like arguments with Cicero, which arise from the fore-mentioned heads.\n\nFrom this account of common places, it is easy to conceive what a large field of discourse they open to the soul mind upon every subject. At the same time, though we have mentioned them from our respect for the orators of Greece and Rome, we heartily subscribe to the opinion of a celebrated modern, who gives of them the following account:\n\n\"The Grecian sophists were the first inventors of this artificial system of oratory; and they showed a prodigious subtlety and fertility in the contrivance of these loci. Succeeding rhetoricians, dazzled by the plan, wrought them into a regular system, that one would think they meant to teach how a person might mechanically become an orator, without any genius at all. They gave him receipts for making speeches on all manner of subjects. At the same time, it is evident, that though this study of common places might produce very learned, showy academical declamations, it could never produce useful discourses on real business. The loci indeed supplied a most exuberant fecundity of matter. One who had no other aim, but to talk copiously and plentifully, by consulting them on every subject, and laying hold of all that they suggested, might discourse without end; and that too, though he had none but the most superficial knowledge of his subject. But such discourse could be no other than trivial. What is truly solid and persuasive, must be drawn ex subjectu causae, from a thorough knowledge of the subject, and profound meditation on it. They who would direct students of oratory...\"\nInvention to any other sources of argumentation, only deduce them; and by attempting to render rhetoric too perfect an art, they render it, in truth, a trilling and childish study.\"\n\nII. Of external topics. When the orator reasons from such topics as do not arise from his subject, but from things of a different nature, these are called external. They are all taken from authorities, and are by one general name called testimonies.\n\nNow a testimony may be expressed by writing, speech, or any other sign proper to declare a person's mind. And all testimonies may be distinguished into two sorts, divine and human. A divine testimony, when certainly known to be such, is incontestable, and admits of no debate, but should be acquiesced in without hesitation. Indeed the ancient Greeks and Romans esteemed the pretended oracles of their deities, the answers of their augurs, and the like fallacies, divine testimonies; but with us no one can be ignorant of their true notion, though they do not directly come under our present consideration. Human testimonies, considered as furnishing the orator with arguments, may be reduced to three heads; writings, witness, and contracts.\n\n1. By Writings, here, are to be understood written laws, wills, or other legal instruments, expressed and conveyed in that manner. And it is not so much the force and validity of such testimonies, considered in themselves, that is here intended, as the occasion of dispute which may at any time arise concerning their true design and import, when produced in proof upon either side of a controversy. And these are five; Ambiguity, Disagreement between the words and intention, Contrariety, Reasoning, and Interpretation.\n\nA writing is then said to be ambiguous, when it is capable of two or more senses, which makes the writer's design uncertain. Now ambiguity may arise either from single words, or the construction of sentences. From single words; as when either the sense of a word, or the application of it, is doubtful. As, should it be questioned, whether ready money ought to be included under the appellation of chattels left by a will; or, if a testator bequeath a certain legacy to his nephew Thomas, and he has two nephews of that name. But ambiguity is also sometimes occasioned from the construction of a sentence; as when several things or persons having been already mentioned, it is doubtful to which of them that which follows ought to be referred. For example, a person writes thus in his will: 'Let my heir give as a legacy to Titus a horse out of my stable, which he pleases.' Here it may be questioned, whether the word he refers to the heir or to Titus; and consequently, whether the heir be allowed to give Titus which horse he pleases, or Titus may choose which he likes best. Now as to controversies of this kind, in the first case above mentioned, the party who claims the chattels may plead, that all moveable goods come under that name, and therefore that he has a right to the money. This he will endeavour to prove from some instances where the word has been so used. The benefits of the opposite party is to refuse this, by showing that money is not there included. And if either side produce precedents in his favour, the other may endeavour to show that the cases are not parallel. As to the second case, arising from an ambiguity in the name, if any other invention, words or expressions in the will seem to countenance either of the claimants, he will not fail to interpret them to his advantage. So likewise, if any thing said by the testator, in his lifetime, or any regard shown to either of these nephews more than the other, may help to determine which of them was intended, a proper use may be made of it. And the same may be laid with regard to the third case. In which the legatee may rely on likewise from the common use of language, and show that in such expressions it is usual to make the reference to the last or next antecedent; and from thence plead, that it was the design of the testator to give him the option. But in answer to this, it may be said, that allowing it to be very often so, yet in this instance it seems more easy and natural to repeat the verb give after pleases, and so to supply the sentence, which he pleases to give him, referring it to the heir, than to bring in the verb chooses, which was not in the sentence before; and so, by flippantly the sense, which he pleases to choose, to give the option to Titus. But where controversies of this kind arise from a law, recourse may be had to other laws where the same thing has been expressed with greater clearness; which may help to determine the sense of the passage in dispute.\n\nA second controversy from writings is, when one party adheres to the words, and the other to what he affirms was the writer's intention. Now he who opposes the literal sense, either contends, that what he himself offers is the simple and plain meaning of the writing, or that it must be so understood in the particular case in dispute. An instance of the former is this, as we find it in Cicero. A person who died without children, but left a widow, had made this provision in his will: \"If I have a son born to me, he shall be my heir.\" And a little after: \"If my son die before he comes of age, let Curius be my heir.\" There is no son born: Curius therefore sues for the estate, and pleads the intention of the testator, who designed him for his heir, if he should have no son who arrived at age; and says, there can be no reason to suppose he did not intend the same person for his heir if he had no son, as if he should have one who afterwards died in his minority. But the heir at law insists upon the words of the will; which, as he says, require, that first a son should be born, and afterwards die under age, before Curius can succeed to the inheritance; and there being no son, a substituted heir, as Curius was, can have no claim where the first heir does not exist, from whom he derives his pretension, and was to succeed by the appointment of the will.\u2014Of the latter case, rhetoricians give this example: \"It was forbidden by a law to open the city gates in the night. A certain person notwithstanding, in time of war, did open them in the night, and let in some auxiliary troops, to prevent their being cut off by the enemy, who was posted near the town.\" Afterwards, when the war was over, this person is arraigned, and tried for his life, on account of this action. Now, in such a case, the prosecutor founds his charge upon the express words of the law; and pleads, that no sufficient reason can be assigned for going contrary to the letter of it, which would be to make a new law, and not to execute one already made. The defendant, on the other hand, alleges, That the fact he is charged\nwith cannot, however, come within the intention of the law; since he either could not, or ought not, to have complied with the letter of it in that particular case, which must therefore necessarily be supposed to have been excepted in the design of that law when it was made. But to this the prosecutor may reply, That all such exceptions as are intended by any law, are usually expressed in it: and instances may be brought of particular exceptions expressed in some laws; and if there be any such exception in the law under debate, it should especially be mentioned. He may further add, That to admit of exceptions not expressed in the law itself, is to enervate the force of all laws, by explaining them away, and in effect to render them useless. And this he may further corroborate, by comparing the law under debate with others, and considering its nature and importance, and how far the public interest of the state is concerned in the due and regular execution of it; from whence he may infer, that should exceptions be admitted in other laws of less consequence, yet, however, they ought not in this. Lastly, He may consider the reason alleged by the defendant, on which he founds his plea, and show there was not that necessity of violating the law in the present case, as is pretended. And this is often the more requisite, because the party who disputes against the words of the law, always endeavours to support his allegations from the equity of the case. If, therefore, this plea can be enervated, the main support of the defendant's cause is removed. For as the former arguments are designed to prevail with the judge, to determine the matter on this side the question from the nature of the case; so the intention of this argument is to induce him to it, from the weakness of the defence made by the opposite party. But the defendant will, on the contrary, use such arguments as may best demonstrate the equity of his cause, and endeavour to vindicate the fact from his good design and intention in doing it. He will say, That the laws have allotted punishments for the commission of such facts as are evil in themselves, or prejudicial to others; neither of which can be charged upon the action for which he is accused: That no law can be rightly executed, if more regard be had to the words and syllables of the writing, than to the intention of the legislator. To which purpose, he may allege that direction of the law itself, which says, \"The law ought not to be too rigorously interpreted, nor the words of it strained; but the true intention and design of each part of it duly considered.\" As also that saying of Cicero, \"What law may not be weakened and destroyed, if we bend the sense to the words, and do not regard the design and view of the legislator?\" Hence he may take occasion to complain of the hardship of such a procedure, that no difference should be made between an audacious and wilful crime, and an honest or necessary action, which might happen to disagree with the letter of the law, though not with the intent of it. And as it was observed before to be of considerable service to the accuser, if he could remove the defendant's plea of equity, so it will be of equal advantage to the defendant, if he can fix upon any words in the law, which may in the least seem to countenance his case, since this will take off the main force of the charge.\n\nThe third controversy of this kind is, when two writings happen to clash with each other, or at least invention seems to do so. Of this Hermogenes gives the following instance. One law enjoins: \"He who continues alone in a ship during a tempest, shall have the property of the ship.\" Another law says, \"A disinherited son shall enjoy no part of his father's estate.\" Now a son, who had been disinherited by his father, happens to be in his father's ship in a tempest, and continues there alone, when every one else had deserted it. He claims the ship by the former of these laws, and his brother tries his right with him by the latter. In such cases, therefore, it may first be considered, \"Whether the two laws can be reconciled. And if that cannot be done, then, Which of them appears more equitable. Also, Whether one be positive, and the other negative: because prohibitions are a sort of exceptions to positive injunctions. Or, If one be a general law, and the other more particular, and come nearer to the matter in question. Likewise, Which was last made: since former laws are often abrogated, either wholly or in part, by subsequent laws; or at least were designed to be so. Lastly, It may be observed, Whether one of the laws be not plain and express; and the other more dubious, or has any ambiguity in it. All, or any of which things, that party will not omit to improve for his advantage whose interest is concerned in it.\n\nThe fourth controversy is reasoning. As when something, not expressly provided for by a law, is inferred by a multitude, or parity of reason, from what is contained in it. Quintilian mentions this instance of it. \"There was a law made at Tarentum, to prohibit the exportation of wool; but a certain person exports sheep.\" In this case, the prosecutor may first compare the thing which occasions the charge, with the words of the law, and show their agreement, and how unnecessary it was that particular thing should have been expressly mentioned in the law, since it is plainly contained in it, or at least an evident consequence from it. He may then plead, that many things of a like nature are omitted in other laws for the same reason. And, lastly, He may urge the reasonableness and equity of the procedure. The defendant, on the other hand, will endeavour to show the deficiency of the reasoning, and the difference between the two cases. He will insist upon the plain and express words of the law, and set forth the ill tendency of such inferences and conclusions drawn from multitudes and comparisons, since there is scarce anything but in some respect may bear a resemblance to another.\n\nThe last controversy under this head is interpretation, in which the dispute turns upon the true meaning and explication of the law in reference to that particular case. We have the following instance of this in the Pandects: \"A man who had two sons both under age, substitutes Titius as heir to him who should die last, provided both of them died in their minority. They both perish together at sea before they came to age. Here arises a doubt, whether the substitution can take place, or whether the inheritance devolves to the heir at law.\" The latter pleads, That as neither of them can be said to have died last, the substitution cannot take place; which was suspended, upon the condition that one died after the other.\nInvention. But to this it may be said, It was the intention of the testator, that if both died in their natures, Titus should succeed to the inheritance; and therefore it makes no difference whether they died together, or one after the other: and so the law determines it.\n\n2. The second head of external arguments are Witnesses. They may either give their evidence, when absent, in writing subscribed with their name; or present, by word of mouth. And what both of them testify, may either be from hearsay; or what they saw themselves, and were present at the time it was done. As the weight of the evidence may be thought greater or less on each of these accounts, either party will make such use of it as he finds for his advantage. The characters of the witnesses are also to be considered; and if any thing be found in their lives or behaviour that is justly exceptionable, to invalidate their evidence, it ought not to be omitted. And how they are affected to the contending parties, or either of them, may deserve consideration; for some allowances may be judged reasonable in case of friendship, or enmity, where there is no room for any other exception. But regard should chiefly be had to what they testify, and how far the cause is affected by it. Cicero is very large upon most of these heads in his defence of Marcus Fonteius, with a design to weaken the evidence of the Gauls against him. And where witnesses are produced on one side only, as orators sometimes attempt to lessen the credit of this kind of proof, by pleading that witnesses are liable to be corrupted, or baffled by some prevailing interest or passion, to which arguments taken from the nature and circumstances of things are not subject; it may be answered on the other hand, that sophistical arguments and false colourings are not exposed to infamy or punishment, whereas witnesses are restrained by shame and penalties, nor would the law require them if they were not necessary.\n\n3. The third and last head of external arguments are Contracts; which may be either public or private. By public are meant the transactions between different states, as leagues, alliances, and the like; which depend on the laws of nations, and come more properly under deliberative discourses, to which we shall refer them. Those are called private, which relate to lesser bodies or societies of men, and single persons; and may be either written or verbal. And it is not so much the true meaning and purport of them that is here considered as their force and obligation. And, as the Roman law declares, \"Nothing can be more agreeable to human faith, than that persons should stand to their agreements.\" Therefore in controversies of this kind, the party whose interest it is that the contract should be maintained, will plead, that such covenants have the force of private laws, and ought religiously to be observed, since the common affairs of mankind are transacted in that manner; and therefore to violate them, is to destroy all commerce and society among men. On the other side it may be said, that justice and equity are chiefly to be regarded, which are immutable; and besides, that the public laws are the common rule to determine all differences, which are designed to redress those who are aggrieved. And indeed, where a compact has been obtained by force or fraud, it is in itself void, and has no effect either in law or reason. But on the other hand, the Roman lawyers seem to have very rightly determined, that all such obligations as are founded on natural equity, though not binding by national laws, and are therefore called nuda pacta, ought, however, in honour and confidence, to be performed.\n\nIII. Of the State of a Controversy. The ancients observing that the principal question or point of dilate a controversy in all controversies might be referred to some particular head, reduced their heads to a certain number, the manner that both the nature of the question might by that means be better known, and the arguments suited to it pal question be discovered with greater ease. And their heads they in dilute to some call states.\n\nBy the state of a controversy, then, we are to understand the principal point in dilute between contending parties, upon the proof of which the whole cause or content of controversy depends. We find it expressed by several other names in ancient writers; as, the constitution of the cause, the general head, and the chief question. And as this is the principal thing to be attended to in every such discourse; for it is what first requires the consideration of the speaker, and should be well fixed and digested in his mind, before he proceeds to look for arguments proper to support it. Thus Antony, the Roman orator, speaking of his own method in his pleading, says: \"When I understand the nature of the cause, and begin to consider it, the first thing I endeavour to do is, to settle with myself what that is to which all my discourse relating to the matter in dispute ought to be referred: then I diligently attend to these other two things, How to recommend myself, or those for whom I plead, to the good esteem of my hearers; and how to influence their minds, as may best suit my design.\" This way of proceeding appears very agreeable to reason and prudence. For what can be more absurd, than for a person to attempt the proof of any thing, before he has well settled in his own mind a clear and distinct notion what the thing is which he would endeavour to prove? Quintilian describes it to be, \"That kind of question which arises from the first conflict of causes.\" In judicial cases, it immediately follows upon the charge of the plaintiff, and plea of the defendant. Our common law expresses it by one word, namely the issue. Which interpreters explain, by describing it to be, \"That point of matter depending in suit, whereupon the parties join, and put their cause to the trial.\" Examples will further help to illustrate this, and render it more evident. In the cause of Milo, the charge of the Clodian party is, Milo killed Clodius. Milo's plea or defence, I killed him, but justly. From hence arises this grand question, or state of the cause, Whether it was lawful for Milo to kill Clodius? And that Clodius was lawfully killed by Milo, is what Cicero in his defence of Milo principally endeavours to prove. This is the main subject of that fine and beautiful oration. The whole of his discourse is to be considered as centering at last in this one point. Whatever different matters are occasionally mentioned, will, if closely attended to, be found to have been introduced somehow or other the better to support and carry on this design. Now in such cases, where the fact is not denied, but something is offered in its defence, the state of the cause is taken from the defendant's plea, who is obliged to make it good: As in the instance here given, the chief point in dispute was the lawfulness of Milo's action, which it was Cicero's business to demonstrate. But when the defendant denies the fact, the state of\nInvention of the cause arises from the accusation; the proof of which then lies upon the plaintiff, and not, as in the former case, upon the defendant. So in the case of Rufius, the charge made against him is, That he killed his father. But he denies the fact. The grand question therefore to be argued is, Whether or not he killed his father? The proof of this lay upon his accusers. And Cicero's design in his defence of him is to show, that they had not made good their charge. But it sometimes happens, that the defendant neither absolutely denies the fact, nor attempts to justify it; but only endeavours to qualify it, by denying that it is a crime of that nature, or deserves that name, by which it is expressed in the charge. We have an example of this proposed by Cicero: \"A person is accused of sacrilege, for taking a thing, that was sacred, out of a private house. He owns the fact, but denies it to be sacrilege; since it was committed in a private house, and not in a temple.\" Hence this question arises, Whether to take a sacred thing out of a private house, is to be deemed sacrilege, or only simple theft? It lies, upon the accuser to prove what the other denies; and therefore the state of the cause is here also, as well as in the preceding case, taken from the indictment.\n\nBut besides the principal question, there are other subordinate questions, which follow upon it in the course of a dispute, and should be carefully distinguished from it. Particularly that which arises from the reason, or argument, which is brought in proof of the principal question. For the principal question itself proves nothing, but is the thing to be proved, and becomes at last the conclusion of the discourse. Thus, in the case of Milo, his argument is, I killed Clodius justly, because he affinimated me. Unless the Clodian party be supposed to deny this, they give up their cause. From hence therefore this subordinate question follows, Whether Clodius affinimated Milo? Now Cicero spends much time in the proof of this, as the hinge on which the first question, and consequently the whole cause, depended. For if this was once made to appear, the lawfulness of Milo's killing Clodius, which was the grand question or thing to be proved, might be inferred as an allowed consequence from it. This will be evident, by throwing Milo's argument, as used by Cicero, into the form of a syllogism.\n\nAn affinim is lawfully killed:\nClodius was an affinim:\nTherefore he was lawfully killed by Milo whom he affinimated.\n\nIf the minor proposition of this syllogism was granted, no one would deny the conclusion; for the Roman law allowed of self-defence. But as Cicero was very sensible this would not be admitted, so he takes much pains to bring the court into the belief of it. Now where the argument brought in defence of the second question is confessed, or the orator supposes that it may be so, and therefore supports that with another argument, this occasions a third question consequent upon the former; and in like manner he may proceed to a fourth. But be they more or fewer, they are to be considered but as one chain of subordinate questions dependent upon the first. And though each of them has its particular state, yet none of these is what rhetorician call The state of the Cause, which is to be understood invention only of the principal question. And if, as it frequently happens, the first or principal question is itself directly proved from more than one argument; this makes no other difference, but that each of these arguments, so far as they are followed by others to support them, become a distinct series of subordinate questions, all dependent upon the first. As when Cicero endeavours to prove, that Rufius did not kill his father, from two reasons or arguments: Because he had neither any cause to move him to such a barbarous action, nor any opportunity for it.\n\nMoreover, besides these subordinate questions, there are also incidental ones often introduced, which have some reference to the principal question, and contribute towards the proof of it, though they are not necessarily connected with it, or dependent upon it. And each of these also has its state, though different from that of the cause. For every question, or point of controversy, must be stated, before it can be made the subject of disputation. And it is for this reason, that every new argument advanced by an orator is called a question; because it is considered as a fresh matter of controversy.\n\nIn Cicero's defence of Milo, we meet with several of this sort of questions, occasioned by some assertions which had been thrown out by the Clodian party to the prejudice of Milo. As, \"That he was unworthy to see the light, who owned he had killed a man;\" For Milo before his trial had openly confessed he killed Clodius. So likewise, \"That the senate had declared the killing of Clodius was an illegal action.\" And further, \"That Pompey, by making a new law to settle the manner of Milo's trial, had given his judgment against Milo.\" Now to each of these Cicero replies, before he proceeds to the principal question. And therefore, though the question, in which the state of a controversy consists, is said by Quintilian to arise from \"the first conflict of causes;\" yet we find by this instance of Cicero, that it is not always the first question in order, upon which the orator treats.\n\nBut it sometimes happens, that the same cause or controversy contains in it more than one state. Thus in judicial causes, every distinct charge occasions a new state. All Cicero's orations against Verres relate to one cause, founded upon a law of the Romans against unjust exactions made by their governors of provinces upon the inhabitants; but as that prosecution is made up of as many charges as there are orations, every charge, or indictment, has its different state. So likewise his oration in defence of Coriolanus has two states, in answer to a double charge made against him by his adversaries: one, \"for borrowing money of Clodia, in order to bribe certain slaves to kill a foreign ambassador;\" and the other, \"for an attempt afterwards to poison Clodia herself.\" Besides which, there were several other matters of a less heinous nature, which had been thrown upon him by his accusers, with a design, very likely, to render the two principal charges more credible; to which Cicero first replies, in the same manner as in his defence of Milo.\n\nThough all the examples we have hitherto brought to illustrate this subject have been taken from judicial cases, yet not only these, but very frequently discourses of the deliberative kind, and sometimes those of the demonstrative, are managed in a controversial way.\nAnd all controversies have their state. And therefore Quintilian very justly observes, that \"states belong both to general and particular questions; and to all sorts of causes, demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial.\" In Cicero's oration for the Manilian law, this is the main point in dispute between him and those who opposed that law: \"Whether Pompey was the fittest person to be intrusted with the management of the war against Mithridates?\" This is a subject of the deliberative kind. And of the same nature was that debate in the senate concerning the demolition of Carthage. For the matter in dispute between Cato, who argued for it, and those who were of the contrary opinion, seems to have been this: \"Whether it was for the interest of the Romans to demolish Carthage?\" And so likewise in those two fine orations of Cato and Caesar, given us by Sallust, relating to the conspirators with Catiline, who were then in custody, the controversy turns upon this: \"Whether those prisoners should be punished with death, or perpetual imprisonment?\" Examples of the demonstrative kind are not so common; but Cicero's oration concerning the 'Answers of the Footsayers,' may afford us an instance of it. Several prodigies had lately happened at Rome; upon which the footsayers being consulted, affixed this as the reason of them, because some places consecrated to the gods had been afterwards converted to civil uses. Clodius charged this upon Cicero; whose house was rebuilt at the public expense, after it had been demolished by Clodius, and the ground consecrated to the goddess Liberty. Cicero in this oration retorts the charge; and shows that the prodigies did not reflect him, but Clodius. So that the question in dispute was, \"To which of the two those prodigies related?\" This oration does not appear to have been spoken in a judicial way, and must therefore belong to the demonstrative kind. His invective against Piso is likewise much of the same nature, wherein he compares his own behaviour and conduct with that of Piso.\n\nAs to the number of these states, both Cicero and Quintilian reduce them to three. \"We must (says Quintilian) agree with those whose authority Cicero follows, who tells us, that three things may be inquired into in all disputes: Whether a thing is; what it is; and how it is. And this is the method which nature prescribes. For, in the first place, it is necessary the thing should exist about which the dispute is: because no judgment can be made either of its nature or quality till its existence be manifest; which is therefore the first question. But though it be manifest that a thing is, it does not presently appear what it is; and when this is known, the quality yet remains: and after these three are settled, no further inquiry is necessary.\" Now the first of these three states is called the conjectural state; as if it be inquired, \"Whether one person killed another?\" This always follows upon the denial of a fact by one of the parties; as was the case of Roscius. And it receives its name from hence, that the judge is left, as it were, to conjecture, whether the fact was really committed or not, from the evidence produced on the other side. The second is called the definitive state, when the fact is not denied; but the dispute turns upon the nature of it, and what name it is proper to give it: as in that example of Cicero, \"Whether to take a sacred thing out of a private house be theft or sacrilege?\" For in this case it is necessary to settle the distinct notion of those two crimes, and show their difference. The third is called the state of quality; when the contending parties are agreed both as to the fact, and the nature of it; but the dispute is, \"Whether it be just or unjust, profitable or unprofitable, and the like;\" as in the case of Milo.\n\nFrom what has been said upon this subject, the use of it may in a good measure appear. For whoever engages in a controversy, ought in the first place to consider with himself the main question in dispute, to fix it well in his mind, and keep it constantly in his view; without which he will be very liable to ramble from the point, and bewilder both himself and his hearers. And it is no less the business of the hearers principally to attend to this; by which means they will be helped to distinguish and separate from the principal question what is only incidental, and to observe how far the principal question is affected by it; to perceive what is offered in proof, and what is only brought in for illustration; not to be misled by digressions, but to discern when the speaker goes off from his subject, and when he returns to it again; and, in a word, to accompany him through the whole discourse, and carry with them the principal chain of reasoning upon which the cause depends, so as to judge upon the whole, whether he has made out his point, and the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Arguments suited to Demonstrative Discourses.\n\nThese consist either in praise or dispraise; and, agreeably to the nature of all contraries, one of them will serve to illustrate the other.\n\nNow we either praise persons or things.\n\nI. In praising or dispraising persons, rhetoricians describe two methods. One is, to follow the order in which every thing happened that is mentioned in the discourse; the other is, to reduce what is said under certain general heads, without a strict regard to the order of time.\n\n1. In pursuing the former method, the discourse may be very conveniently divided into three periods. The first of which will contain what preceded the person's birth; the second, the whole course of his life; and the third what followed upon his death.\n\nUnder the first of these may be comprehended what is proper to be said concerning his country or family. And therefore, if these were honourable, it may be said to his advantage, that he nowise disgraced them, but acted suitably to such a descent. But if they were not so, they may be either wholly omitted; or it may be said, that, instead of deriving thence any advantage to his character, he has conferred a lasting honour upon them; and that it is not of so much moment where, or from whom, a person derives his birth, as how he lives.\n\nIn the second period, which is that of his life, the qualities both of his mind and body, with his circumstances in the world, may be separately considered. Though, as Quintilian rightly observes, \"All external advantages are not praises for themselves, but according to the use that is made of them. For riches, and power, and interest, as they have great influence, and may be applied either to good or bad purposes, are...\"\nInvention, a proof of the temper of our minds; and therefore we are either made better or worse by them. But these things are a just ground for commendation, when they are the reward of virtue or industry. Bodily endowments are health, strength, beauty, activity, and the like; which are more or less commendable, according as they are employed. And where these, or any of them, are wanting, it may be shown, that they are abundantly compensated by the more valuable endowments of the mind. Nay, sometimes a defect in these may give an advantageous turn to a person's character; for any virtue appears greater, in proportion to the disadvantages the person laboured under in exerting it. But the chief topics of praise are taken from the virtues and qualifications of the mind. And here the orator may consider the disposition, education, learning, and several virtues, which shone through the whole course of the person's life. In doing which, the preference should always be given to virtue above knowledge or any other accomplishment. And in actions, those are most considerable, and will be heard with greatest approbation, which a person either did alone, or first, or wherein he had fewest associates; as likewise those which exceeded expectation, or were done for the advantage of others rather than his own. And further, as the last scene of a man's life generally commands the greatest regard, if anything remarkable at that time was either said or done, it ought particularly to be mentioned. Nor should the manner of his death, or cause of it, if accompanied with any commendable circumstances be omitted; as if he died in the service of his country, or in the pursuit of any other laudable design.\n\nThe third and last period relates to what followed after the death of the person. And here the public loss, and public honours conferred upon the deceased, are proper to be mentioned. Sepulchres, statues, and other monuments to perpetuate the memory of the dead, at the expense of the public, were in common use both among the Greeks and Romans. But in the earliest times, as these honours were more rare, so they were less costly. For as in one age it was thought a sufficient reward for him who died in the defence of his country, to have his name cut in a marble inscription, with the cause of his death; so in others it was very common to see the statues of gladiators, and persons of the meanest rank, erected in public places. And therefore a judgement is to be formed of these things from the time, custom, and circumstances, of different nations; since the frequency of them renders them less honourable, and takes off from their evidence as the rewards of virtue. But, as Quintilian says, \"Children are an honour to their parents, cities to their founders, laws to those who compiled them, arts to their inventors, and useful customs to the authors of them.\"\n\nAnd this may suffice for the method of praising persons, when we propose to follow the order of time, as Ilocrates has done in his funeral oration upon Evagoras king of Salamis, and Pliny in his panegyric upon the emperor Trajan. But as this method is very plain and obvious, so it requires the more agreeable defects to render it delightful; lest otherwise it seem rather like a history than an oration: For which reason, we find, that epic poets, as Homer, Virgil, and others, begin with the middle of their story; and afterwards take a proper occasion to introduce what preceded, to diversify the subject, and give the greater pleasure and entertainment to their readers.\n\n2. The other method above hinted was, to reduce the discourse to certain general heads without regarding the order of time. As if any one, in praising the elder Cato, should propose to do it, by showing that he was a most prudent senator, an excellent orator, and most valiant general; all which commendations are given him by Pliny. In like manner, the character of a good general may be comprised under four heads; skill in military affairs, courage, authority, and success; from all which Cicero commends Pompey. And agreeably to this method Suetonius has written the lives of the first twelve Caesars.\n\nBut in the praising of persons, care should always be taken to say nothing that may seem fictitious or out of character, which may call the orator's judgement or integrity in question. It was not without cause, therefore, that Lytippus the statuary, as Plutarch tells us, blamed Apelles for painting Alexander the Great with thunder in his hand; which could never suit his character as a man, however he might boast of his divine descent: for which reason Lytippus himself made an image of him holding a spear, as the sign of a warrior. Light and trivial things in commendations are likewise to be avoided, and nothing mentioned but what may carry in it the idea of something truly valuable, and which the hearers may be supposed to wish for, and is proper to excite their emulation. These are the principal heads of praise with relation to men. In dispraise, the heads contrary to these are requisite; which being sufficiently clear from what has been said, need not particularly be insisted on.\n\nII. We proceed therefore to the other part of the division, which respects things, as distinguished from persons. By which we are to understand all beings inferior to man, whether animate or inanimate; as likewise the habits and dispositions of men, either good or bad, when considered separately, and apart from their subjects, as arts and sciences, virtues and vices, with whatever else may be a proper subject for praise or dispraise. Some writers, indeed, have, for their own amusement and the diversion of others, displayed their eloquence in a jocose manner upon subjects of this kind. So Lucian has written in praise of a fly, and Synecus an elegant encomium upon baldness. Others, on the contrary, have done the like in a satirical way. Such is Seneca's apotheosis or consecration of the emperor Claudius; and the Mylopogon or beard-hater, written by Julian the emperor. Not to mention several modern authors, who have imitated them in such ludicrous compositions. But as to these things, and all of the like nature, the observation of Antony in Cicero seems very just: \"That it is not necessary to reduce every subject we discourse upon to rules of art.\" For many are so trivial, as not to deserve it; and others so plain and evident of themselves, as not to require it. But since it frequently comes in the way both of orators and historians to describe countries, cities, and facts, we shall briefly mention the principal heads of invention proper to illustrate each of these.\n\nCountries, then, may be celebrated from the pleasantest\nsantness of their situation, the clemency and wholesomeness of the air, and goodness of the soil; to which last may be referred the springs, rivers, woods, plains, mountains, and minerals. And to all these may be added their extent, cities, the number and antiquity of the inhabitants; their policy, laws, customs, wealth, character for cultivating the arts both of peace and war; their princes, and other eminent men they have produced. Thus Pacatus has given us a very elegant description of Spain, in this panegyric upon the emperor Theodosius, who was born there.\n\nCities are praised from much the same topics as countries. And here, whatever contributes either to their defence or ornament ought particularly to be mentioned; as the strength of the walls and fortifications, the beauty and splendour of the buildings, whether sacred or civil, public or private. We have in Herodotus a very fine description of Babylon, which was once the strongest, largest, and most regular city in the world. And Cicero has accurately described the city of Syracuse, in the island Sicily, in one of his orations against Verres.\n\nBut facts come much oftener under the cognizance of an orator. And these receive their commendation from their honour, justice, or advantage. But in describing them, all the circumstances should be related in their proper order; and that in the most lively and affecting manner suited to their different nature. Livy has represented the demolition of Alba by the Roman army, which was sent thither to destroy it, through the whole course of that melancholy scene, in a style so moving and pathetic, that one can hardly forbear condoling with the inhabitants, upon reading his account.\n\nBut in discourses of this kind, whether of praise or dispraise, the orator should (as he ought indeed upon all occasions) well consider where, and to whom, he speaks. For wise men often think very differently both of persons and things from the common people. And we find that learned and judicious men are frequently divided in their sentiments, from the several ways of thinking to which they have been accustomed. Besides, different opinions prevail, and gain the ascendant, at different times. While the Romans continued a free nation, love of their country, liberty, and public spirit, were principles in the highest esteem among them. And therefore, when Cato killed himself, that he might not fall into the hands of Caesar, and survive the liberty of his country, it was thought an instance of the greatest heroic virtue; but afterwards, when they had been accustomed to an arbitrary government, and the spirit of liberty was now lost, the poet Martial could venture to say,\n\nDeath to avoid 'tis madness sure to die.\n\nA prudent orator therefore will be cautious of opposing any settled and prevailing notions of those whom he addresses, unless it be necessary; and then he will do it in the loftiest and most gentle manner.\n\nChap. III. Of Arguments suited to Deliberative Discourses.\n\nThis kind of discourse must certainly have been very ancient; since, doubtless, from the first beginning of men's conversing together, they deliberated upon invention, their common interest, and offered their advice to each other. But neither those of the laudatory nor judicial kind could have been introduced, till mankind were settled in communities, and found it necessary to confer, and encourage virtue by public rewards, and bring vice the argument under the restraint of laws. The early practice of such discourses appears from sacred writ, where we find, that when Moses was ordered upon an embassy into Egypt, he would have excused himself for want of eloquence. And Homer represents the Greeks at the siege of Troy, as flocking like a swarm of bees to hear their generals harangue them. Nor is this part of oratory less conspicuous for its usefulness to mankind, than for its antiquity; being highly beneficial either in councils, camps, or any societies of men. How many instances have we upon record, where the fury of an enraged multitude has been checked and appeased by the prudent and artful persuasion of some particular person? The story of Agrippa Menenius, when the commons of Rome withdrew from the senators, and retired out of the city, is too well known to need reciting. And how often have armies been animated and fired to the most dangerous exploits, or recalled to their duty, when ready to mutiny, by a moving speech of their general? Many instances of which we find in history.\n\nAll deliberation respects something future, for it is in vain to consult about what is already past. The subject matter of it is, either things public or private, sacred or civil; indeed all the valuable concerns of mankind, both present and future, come under its regard. And the end proposed by this kind of discourse is chiefly profit or interest. But since nothing is truly profitable, but what is in some respect good; and every thing which is good in itself may not in all circumstances be for our advantage; properly speaking, what is both good and profitable, or beneficial good, is the end here designed. And therefore, as it sometimes happens, that what appears profitable may seem to interfere with that which is strictly just and honourable; in such cases it is certainly most advisable to determine on the safer side of honour and justice, notwithstanding some plausible things may be offered to the contrary. But where the dispute lies apparently between what is truly honest, and some external advantage proposed in opposition to it, all good men cannot but agree in favour of honesty. Such was the case of Regulus, who, being taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, was permitted to go to Rome upon giving his oath, that unless he could persuade the senate to set at liberty some young Carthaginian noblemen, then prisoners at Rome, in exchange for him, he should return again to Carthage. But Regulus, when he came to Rome, was so far from endeavouring to prevail with the senate to comply with the desire of the Carthaginians, that he used all his interest to dissuade them from hearkening to the proposal. Nor could the most earnest entreaties of his nearest relations and friends, nor any arguments they were able to offer, engage him to continue at Rome, and not return again to Carthage. He had then plainly in his view, on the one side, ease, security, affluence, honours, and the enjoyment of his friends; and on the other, certain death, attended with cruel torments. However, thinking the former\nformer not confident with truth and justice, he chose the latter. And he certainly acted as became an honest and brave man, in choosing death, rather than to violate his oath. Though whether he did prudently in persuading the senate not to make the exchange, or they in complying with him, we shall leave others to determine. Now, when it proves to be a matter of debate, whether a thing upon the whole be really beneficial or not; as here arise two parts, advice and diffusion, they will each require proper heads of argument. But as they are contrary to each other, he who is acquainted with one, cannot well be ignorant of the other. We shall therefore chiefly mention those proper for advice, from whence such as are suited to persuade will easily be perceived. Now the principal heads of this kind are these following, which are taken from the nature and properties of the thing itself under consideration.\n\n1. Pleasure often affords a very cogent argument in discourses of this nature. Every one knows what an influence this has upon the generality of mankind. Though, as Quintilian remarks, pleasure ought not of itself to be propounded as a fit motive for action in serious discourses, but when it is designed to recommend something useful, which is the case here. So, would any one advise another to the pursuit of polite literature, Cicero has furnished him with a very strong inducement to it from the pleasure which attends that study, when he says, \"If pleasure only was propounded by these studies, you would think them an entertainment becoming a man of sense and a gentleman. For other pursuits neither agree with all times, all ages, nor all places; but these studies improve youth, delight old age, adorn prosperity, afford a refuge and comfort in adversity, divert us at home, are no hindrance abroad, sleep, travel, and retire with us into the country.\"\n\n2. Profit, or advantage. This has no less influence upon many persons than the former; and when it respects things truly valuable, it is a very just and laudable motive. Thus Cicero, when he sends his Book of Offices to his son, which he wrote in Latin for his use, advises him to make the best advantage both of his tutor's instructions and the conversation at Athens, where he then was; but withal to peruse his philosophical treaties, which would be doubly useful to him, not only upon account of the subjects, but likewise of the language, as they would enable him to express himself upon those arguments in Latin, which before had only been treated of in Greek.\n\n3. Honour; than which no argument will sooner prevail with generous minds, or inflame them with greater ardour. Virgil has very beautifully described Hector's ghost appearing to \u00c6neas the night Troy was taken, and advising him to depart, from this motive of honour:\n\nO goddefs-born, escape by timely flight\nThe flames and horrors of this fatal night.\nThe foes already have possest the wall;\nTroy nods from high, and totters to her fall.\nEnough is paid to Priam's royal name;\nMore than enough to duty and to fame.\nIf by a mortal hand my father's throne\nCou'd be defended, 'twas by mine alone.\n\nThe argument here made use of to persuade \u00c6neas to leave Troy immediately, is, that he had done all that could be expected from him, either as a good subject or brave soldier, both for his king and country; which were sufficient to secure his honour; and now there was nothing more to be expected from him when the city was falling, and impossible to be saved; which, could it have been preferred by human power, he himself had done it.\n\nBut although a thing considered in itself appear beneficial if it could be attained, yet the expediency of undertaking it may still be questionable: in which case the following heads, taken from the circumstances which attend it, will afford proper arguments to engage in it.\n\n(1.) The possibility of succeeding may sometimes be argued, as one motive to this end. So Hannibal endeavoured to convince King Antiochus, that it was possible for him to conquer the Romans, if he made Italy the seat of the war; by observing to him, not only that the Gauls had formerly destroyed their city, but that he had himself defeated them in every battle he fought with them in that country.\n\n(2.) But an argument founded upon probability will be much more likely to prevail. For in many affairs of human life, men are determined either to prosecute them or not, as the prospect of success appears more or less probable. Hence Cicero, after the fatal battle at Pharsalia, dissuades those of Pompey's party, with whom he was engaged, from continuing the war any longer against Caesar; because it was highly improbable, after such a defeat, by which their main strength was broken, that they should be able to stand their ground, or meet with better success than they had before.\n\n(3.) But further, since probability is not a motive strong enough with many persons to engage in the prosecution of a thing which is attended with considerable difficulties, it is often necessary to represent the facility of doing it, as a further reason to induce them to it. And therefore Cicero makes use of this argument to encourage the Roman citizens in opposing Mark Antony (who upon the death of Caesar had assumed an arbitrary power), by representing to them, that his circumstances were then desperate, and that he might easily be vanquished.\n\n(4.) Again, If the thing advised can be shown to be in any respect necessary, this will render the motive still much stronger for undertaking it. And therefore Cicero joins this argument with the former, to prevail with the Roman citizens to oppose Antony, by telling them, that \"The consideration before them was, not in what circumstances they should live, but whether they should live at all, or die with ignominy and disgrace.\" This way of reasoning will sometimes prevail when all others prove ineffectual. For some persons are not to be moved till things are brought to an extremity, and they find themselves reduced to the utmost danger.\n\n(5.) To these heads may be added the consideration of the event, which in some cases carries great weight with it. As when we advise to the doing of a thing from this motive, That whether it succeed or not, it will yet be of service to undertake it. So after the great victory gained by Themistocles over the Persian fleet at...\nInvention. the straits of Salamis, Mardonius advised Xerxes to return into Asia himself, lest the report of his defeat should occasion an insurrection in his absence; but to leave behind him an army of 300,000 men under his command; with which, if he should conquer Greece, the chief glory of the conquest would redound to Xerxes; but if the design miscarried, the disgrace would fall upon his generals.\n\nThese are the principal heads which furnish the orator with proper arguments in giving advice. Cicero, in his oration for the Manilian law, where he endeavours to persuade the Roman people to choose Pompey for their general in the Mithridatic war, reasons from three of these topics, into which he divides his whole discourse; namely, the necessity of the war, the greatness of it, and the choice of a proper general.\u2014Under the first of these he shows, that the war was necessary, from four considerations; the honour of the Roman state, the safety of their allies, their own revenues, and the fortunes of many of their fellow citizens, which were all highly concerned in it, and called upon them to put a stop to the growing power of King Mithridates, by which they were all greatly endangered. So that this argument is taken from the head of necessity. The second, in which he treats of the greatness of the war, is founded upon the topic of possibility. For though he shows the power of Mithridates to be very great, yet not so formidable, but that he might be subdued; as was evident from the many advantages Lucullus had gained over him and his associates. In the third head, he endeavours to prevail with them to intrust the management of the war in the hands of Pompey, whom he describes as a consummate general, for his skill in military affairs, courage, authority, and success; in all which qualities he represents him as superior to any other of their generals whom they could at that time make choice of. The design of all which was, to persuade them, that they had very good reason to hope for success, and a happy event of the war, under his conduct. So that the whole force of his reasoning under this head is drawn from probability. These are the three general topics which make up that fine discourse. Each of which is indeed supported by divers other arguments and considerations, which will be obvious in perusing the oration itself, and therefore need not be here enumerated. On the contrary, in another oration he endeavours to dissuade the senate from consenting to a peace with Mark Antony, because it was base, dangerous, and impracticable.\n\nBut no small skill and address are required in giving advice. For since the tempers and sentiments of mankind, as well as their circumstances, are very different and various; it is often necessary to accommodate the discourse to their inclinations and opinions of things. And therefore the weightiest arguments are not always the most proper and fittest to be used on all occasions. Cicero, who was an admirable master of this art, and knew perfectly well how to suit what he said to the taste and relish of his hearers, in treating upon this subject, distinguishes mankind into two sorts; the ignorant and unpolished, who always prefer profit to honour; and such as are more civilized and polite, who prefer honour and reputation to all other things.\u2014Wherefore they are to be moved by these different views: Praise, glory, and virtue, influence the one: Invention, while the other is only to be engaged by a prospect of gain and pleasure. Besides, it is plain, that the generality are much more inclined to avoid evils than to pursue what is good; and to keep clear of scandal and disgrace, than to practise what is truly generous and noble. Persons likewise of a different age act from different principles; young men for the most part view things in a different light from those who are older and have had more experience, and consequently are not to be influenced by the same motives.\n\nChap. IV. Of Arguments suited to Judicial Discourses.\n\nIn judicial controversies there are two parties; the plaintiff or prosecutor, and the defendant or person charged. The subject of them is always something and the affair. And the end propounded by them Cicero calls fitted to equity, or rights and equity; the former of which arises from the laws of the country, and the latter from reason and the nature of things. For at Rome the praetors had a court of equity, and were empowered, in many cases relating to property, to relax the rigour of the written laws. But as this subject is very copious, and causes may arise from a great variety of things, writers have reduced them to three heads, which they call states, to some one of which all judicial proceedings may be referred; namely, whether a thing is, what it is, or how it is. By the state of a cause therefore is meant the principal question in dispute, upon which the whole affair depends. Which, if it stops in the first inquiry, and the defendant denies the fact, the state is called conjectural; but if the fact be acknowledged, and yet denied to be what the adversary calls it, it is termed definitive; but if there is no dispute either about the fact or its name, but only the justice of it, it is called the state of quality: as was shown more largely before (see No. 15.) But we there considered these states only in a general view, and deferred the particular heads of argument proper for each of them to this judicial kind of discourses; where they most frequently occur, and from which examples may easily be accommodated to other subjects.\n\nAll judicial causes are either private or public. Those are called private, which relate to the right of particular persons; and they are likewise called civil causes, as they are conversant about matters of property.\u2014Public causes are those which relate to public justice and the government of the state; which are also called criminal, because by them crimes are prosecuted, whether capital, or those of a less heinous nature. We shall take the heads of the arguments only from this latter kind, because they are more copious, and easy to be illustrated by examples; from which such as agree to the former, namely, civil causes, will sufficiently appear.\n\n1. The conjectural state. When the accused person denies the fact, there are three things which the prosecutor has to consider; whether he would have done it, whether he could, and whether he did it. And hence arise three topics; from the will, the power, and the signs or circumstances which attended the action. The affections of the mind discover the will; as passion, an old grudge, a desire of revenge, a resentment\nInvention. Sentiment of an injury, and the like. Therefore Cicero argues from Clodius's hatred of Milo, that he designed his death; and from thence infers, that he was the aggressor in the combat between them, wherein Clodius was killed. This is what he principally endeavours to prove, and comes properly under this state: for Milo owned that he killed him, but alleged that he did it in his own defence. So that in regard to this point, which of them assaulted the other? the charge was mutual. The prospect of advantage may also be alleged to the same purpose. Hence it is said of L. Caecilius, that whenever he sat as judge in a case of murder, he used to advise and move the court to examine to whom the advantage arose from the death of the deceased. And Cicero puts this to Antony concerning the death of Caesar. \"If any one (says he) should bring you upon trial, and use that saying of C\u00e6sars, *Qui bono?* 'Who got by it?' look to it, I beseech you, that you are not confounded. To these arguments may be added, hope of impunity, taken either from the circumstances of the accused person, or of him who suffered the injury. For persons, who have the advantage of interest, friends, power, or money, are apt to think they may easily escape; as likewise such who have formerly committed other crimes with impunity. Thus Cicero represents Clodius as hardened in vice, and above all the restraint of laws, from having so often escaped punishment upon committing the highest crimes. On the contrary, such a confidence is sometimes raised from the condition of the injured party, if he is indigent, obscure, timorous, or defective of friends; much more if he has an ill reputation, or is loaded with popular hatred and resentment. It was this presumption of the obscurity of Roelius, who lived in the country, and his want of interest at Rome, which encouraged his accusers to charge him with killing his father, as Cicero shows in his defence of him. Lastly, The temper of a person, his views, and manner of life, are considerations of great moment in this matter. For persons of bad morals, and such as are addicted to vice, are easily thought capable of committing any wickedness. Hence Sallust argues from the evil disposition and vicious life of Catiline, that he affected to raise himself upon the ruins of his country.\u2014The second head is the power of doing a thing: and there are three things which relate to this, the place, the time, and opportunity. As if a crime is said to have been committed in a private place, where no other person was present; or in the night; or when the injured person was unable to provide for his defence. Under this head may likewise be brought in the circumstances of the persons; as if the accused person was stronger, and so able to overpower the other; or more active, and so could easily make his escape. Cicero makes great use of this topic in the case of Milo, and shows, that Clodius had all the advantages of place, time, and opportunity, to execute his design of killing him. The third head comprehends the signs and circumstances which either preceded, accompanied, or followed, the commission of the fact. So threats, or the accused person being seen at or near the place before the fact was committed, are circumstances that may probably precede murder; fighting, crying out, bloodshed, are such as accompany it; paleness, trembling, inconsistent answers, hesitation, or faltering of the speech, something found upon the person accused invention, which belonged to the deceased, are such as follow it. Thus Cicero proves, that Clodius had threatened the death of Milo, and given out that he should not live above three days at the farthest.\u2014These arguments, taken from conjectures, are called presumptions, which, though they do not directly prove that the accused person committed the fact with which he is charged; yet when laid together, they appeared very strong, sentence by the Roman law might sometimes be given upon them, to convict him.\n\nThere are the topics from which the prosecutor takes his arguments. Now the business of the defendant is to invalidate these. Therefore such as are brought from the will, he either endeavours to show are not true, or so weak as to merit very little regard. And he refutes those taken from the power, by proving that he wanted either opportunity or ability: as, if he can show, that neither the place nor time insisted on was at all proper; or that he was then in another place. In like manner he will endeavour to confute the circumstances, if they cannot be directly denied, by showing that they are not such as do necessarily accompany the fact, but might have proceeded from other causes, though nothing of what is alleged had been committed; and it will be of great service to assign some other probable cause. But sometimes the defendant does not only deny that he did the fact, but charges it upon another. Thus Cicero, in his oration for Roelius, not only defends him from each of these three heads, but likewise charges the fact upon his accusers.\n\n2. The definitive state, which is principally concerned in defining and fixing the name proper to the fact: though orators seldom make use of exact definitions, but commonly choose larger descriptions, taken from various properties of the subject or thing described.\n\nThe heads of argument in this state are much the same to both parties. For each of them defines the fact his own way, and endeavours to refute the other's definition. We may illustrate this by an example from Quintilian: \"A person is accused of sacrilege, for stealing money out of a temple, which belonged to a private person.\" The fact is owned; but the question is, Whether it be properly sacrilege? The prosecutor calls it so, because it was taken out of a temple. But since the money belonged to a private person, the defendant denies it to be sacrilege, and says it is only simple theft. Now the reason why the defendant uses this plea, and inflicts upon the definition, is, because by the Roman law the penalty of theft was only four times the value of what was stolen; whereas sacrilege was punished with death. The prosecutor then forms his definition agreeable to his charge, and says, \"To steal anything out of a sacred place is sacrilege.\" But the defendant excepts against this definition, as defective; and urges, that it does not amount to sacrilege, unless the thing stolen was likewise sacred. And this case might once, perhaps, have been a matter of controversy, since we find it expressly determined in the Pandects, that \"An action of sacrilege should not lie, but only of theft, against any one who should steal the goods of private persons deposited in a temple.\"\n\nThe second thing is the proof brought by each party to support his definition; as in the example given.\nInvention, given us by Cicero, of one \"who carried his cause by bribery, and was afterwards prosecuted again upon an action of prevarication.\" Now, if the defendant was cast upon this action, he was, by the Roman law, subjected to the penalty of the former prosecution. Here the prosecutor defines prevarication to be, Any bribery or corruption in the defendant, with a design to pervert justice. The defendant, therefore, on the other hand, restrains it to bribing only the prosecutor.\n\nAnd if this latter sense agrees better with the common acceptation of the word, the prosecutor in the third place pleads the intention of the law, which was to comprehend all bribery in judicial matters under the term of prevarication. In answer to which the defendant endeavours to show, either from the head of contraries, that a real prosecutor and a prevaricator are used as opposite terms in the law; or from the etymology of the word, that a prevaricator denotes one who pretends to appear in the prosecution of a cause, while in reality he favours the contrary side; and consequently, that money given for this end only can, in the sense of the law, be called prevarication.\n\nLastly, The prosecutor pleads, that it is unreasonable that he who does not deny the fact should escape by a cavil about a word. But the defendant insists upon his explication as agreeable to the law; and says, the fact is misrepresented and blackened, by affixing to it a wrong name.\n\n3. The third state is that of quality, in which the dispute turns upon the justice of an action. And here the defendant does not deny he did the thing he is charged with; but affirms it to be right and equitable, from the circumstances of the case, and the motives which induced him to it.\n\nAnd, first, He sometimes alleges, the reason of doing it was in order to prevent some other thing of worse consequence, which would otherwise have happened. We have an instance of this in the life of Epaminondas, who, with two other generals joined in the command with him, marched the Theban army into Peloponnesus against the Lacedemonians; but by the influence of a contrary faction at home, their commissions were superseded, and other generals sent to command the army. But Epaminondas, being sensible that, if he obeyed this order at that time, it would be attended with the loss of the whole army, and consequently the ruin of the state, refused to do it; and having persuaded the other generals to do the like, they happily finished the war in which they were engaged; and upon their return home, Epaminondas taking the whole matter upon himself, on his trial was acquitted. The arguments proper in this case are taken from the justice, usefulness, or necessity, of the action. The accuser therefore will plead, that the fact was not just, profitable, nor necessary, considered either in itself or comparatively with that for the sake of which it is said to have been done; and he will endeavour to show, that what the defendant affirms for the reason of what he did might not have happened as he pretends. Besides, he will represent of what ill consequence it must be, if such crimes go unpunished. The defendant, on the other hand, will argue from the same heads, and endeavour to prove the fact was just, useful, or necessary. And he will further urge, that no just estimate can be made of invention, any action, but from the circumstances which attend it; as the design, occasion, and motives for doing it, which he will represent in the most favourable light to his own cause, and endeavour to set them in such a view, as to induce others to think they could not but have done the same in the like circumstances.\n\nAgain, The cause of an action is sometimes charged by the defendant upon the party who received the damage, or some other person, who either made it necessary, or enjoined him to do it. The first of these was Milo's plea for killing Clodius, because he assaulted him with a design to take away his life. Here the fact is not denied, as in the case of Rufius above-mentioned, under the conjectural state; but justified from the reason of doing it. For that an assassin might be justly killed, Cicero shows both from law and reason. The accuser, therefore, in such a case, will, if there be room for it, deny the truth of this allegation. So the friends of Clodius affirmed that Milo was the aggressor, and not Clodius; which Cicero, in his defence of Milo, principally labours to refute. In the second case, the prosecutor will say, No one ought to offend because another has offended first; which defeats the course of public justice, renders the laws useless, and destroys the authority of the magistrate. The defendant, on the other hand, will endeavour to represent the danger and necessity of the case, which required an immediate remedy, and in that manner; and urges, that it was vain and impracticable to wait for redress in the ordinary way, and therefore no ill consequence can arise to the public. Thus Cicero, in defending Sextius, who was prosecuted for a riot in bringing armed men into the forum, shows that his design was only to repel force with force; which was then necessary, there being no other means left for the people to assemble, who were excluded by a mob of the contrary party. Of the third case we have also an example in Cicero, who tells us, that \"in making a league between the Romans and Samnites, a certain young nobleman was ordered by the Roman general to hold the swine (designated for a sacrifice); but the senate afterwards disapproving the terms, and delivering up their general to the Samnites, it was moved, Whether this young man ought not likewise to be given up?\" Those who were for it might say, that to allege the command of another, is not a sufficient plea for doing an ill action; and this is what the Roman law now expressly declares. But in answer to that, it might be replied, that it was his duty to obey the command of his general, who was answerable for his own orders, and not those who were obliged to execute them; and therefore, to give up this young nobleman would be to punish one person for the fault of another.\n\nLastly, A fact is sometimes rather excused than defended, by pleading that it was not done designingly, or with any ill intent. This is called concession; and consists of two parts, apology and entreaty. The former represents the matter as the effect of inadvertency, chance, or necessity. Aristotle gives us an example of inadvertency or imprudence in a woman at Athens, who gave a young man a love potion, which killed him; for which she was tried, but acquitted: though afterwards this was made criminal by the Roman law. The case\nInvention of Adrafinus, as related by Herodotus, is an instance of chance; who being intrusted by Croesus with the care of his son, as they were hunting, killed him accidentally with a javelin which he threw at a boar. It is necessity, when a person excuses his making a default from defects of weather, sickness, or the like. Thus Cicero pleaded his illness, contracted by the fatigue of a long journey, as an excuse for not appearing in the senate upon the summons of Mark Antony, who threatened to oblige him to it by pulling his house down. But what the defendant here attributes to inadvertency, chance, or necessity, the opposite party will attribute to design, negligence, or some other culpable reason; and represent it as a matter injurious to the public to introduce such precedents; and also produce instances, if that can be done, where the like excuses have not been admitted. On the other hand, the defendant will insist on his innocence, and show the hardship and severity of judging men's actions rather by the event, than from the intention: that such a procedure makes no difference between the innocent and the guilty; but must necessarily involve many honest men in ruin and destruction, discourage all virtuous and generous designs, and turn greatly to the prejudice of human society. He will also consider the instances alleged by the accuser, and show the difference between them and his own case. And, lastly, He will have recourse to entreaty, or a submissive address to the equity and clemency of the court, or party offended, for pardon; as Cicero has done in his oration to Caesar, in favour of Ligarius.\n\nCHAP. V. Of the Character and Address of an Orator.\n\nHaving considered and explained the first part of propriety of manners Invention, which furnishes the orator with such arguments as are necessary for the proof of his subject, we are next to show what are the proper means to conciliate the minds of his hearers; to gain their affections; and to recommend both himself, and what he says, to and address their good opinion and esteem. For the parts of invention are commonly thus distinguished; that the first respects the subject of the discourse, the second the speaker, and the third the hearers. Now the second of these, what we have at present to explain, is by Quintilian called a propriety of manners. And in order to express this it is necessary, as he tells us, \"that every thing appear easy and natural, and the disposition of the speaker be discovered by his words.\" We may form an easy conception of this from the conduct of such persons as are most nearly concerned in each other's welfare. As when relations or friends converse together upon any affairs of importance, the temper and disposition of the speaker plainly shows itself by his words and manner of address. And what nature here directs to without colouring or disguise, the orator is to endeavour to perform by his art. Though indeed, if what a person says be inconsistent with his usual conduct and behaviour at other times, he cannot expect it should gain much credit, or make any deep impression upon his hearers; which may be one reason why the ancient rhetoricians make it so necessary a qualification in an orator, that he be a good man; since he should always be consistent with himself, and, as we say, talk in character. And therefore it is highly requisite, that he should not only gain the skill of assuming those qualities which the nature and circumstances of his discourse require him to express; but likewise, that he should use his utmost endeavours to get the real habits implanted in his mind. For as by this means they will be always expressed with greater ease and facility; so, by appearing constantly in the course of his life, they will have more weight and influence upon particular occasions.\n\nNow there are four qualities, more especially suited to the character of an orator, which should always appear in his discourses, in order to render what he says acceptable to his hearers; and these are wisdom, integrity, benevolence, and modesty.\n\n1. Wisdom is necessary; because we easily give into those whom we esteem wiser and more knowing than ourselves. Knowledge is very agreeable and pleasant to all, but few make very great improvements in it; either by reason they are employed in other necessary affairs, and the mind of man cannot attend to many things at once; or because the way to knowledge at first is hard and difficult, so that persons either do not care to enter upon the pursuit of it, or, if they do, they are many times soon discouraged, and drop it, for want of sufficient resolution to surmount its difficulties. Such, therefore, as either cannot, or do not care to give themselves the trouble of examining into things themselves, must take up with the representation of others; and it is an ease to them to hear the opinion of persons whom they esteem wiser than themselves. No one loves to be deceived; and those who are fearful of being misled, are pleased to meet with a person in whose wisdom, as they think, they can safely trust. The character of wisdom therefore is of great service to an orator, since the greater part of mankind are swayed by authority rather than arguments.\n\n2. But this of itself is not sufficient, unless the opinion of integrity be joined with it. Nay, so far from it, that the greater knowledge and understanding a man is supposed to have, unless he likewise have the character of an honest man, he is often the more suspected. For knowledge without honesty, is generally thought to dispose a person, as well as qualify him, to deceive.\n\n3. And to both these qualities the appearance of kindness and benevolence should likewise be added. For though a person have the reputation of wisdom and honesty, yet if we apprehend he is either not well affected to us, or at least regardless of our interest, we are in many cases apt to be jealous of him. Mankind are naturally swayed by their affections, and much influenced through love or friendship; and therefore nothing has a greater tendency to induce persons to credit what is said, than intimations of affection and kindness. The best orators have been always sensible what great influence the expressions of kindness and benevolence have upon the minds of others, to induce them to believe the truth of what they say; and therefore they frequently endeavour to impress them with the opinion of it. Thus Demosthenes begins his celebrated oration for Ctesiphon. \"It is my hearty prayer (says he) to all the deities, that this my defence may be received by you with the same affection which I have always expressed for you and your city.\" And it is a very fine image of it which we have in Cicero, where,\nInvention where, in order to influence the judges in favour of Milo, he introduces him speaking thus, as became a brave man, and a patriot, even upon the supposition he should be condemned by them: \"I bid my fellow citizens adieu: may they continue flourishing and prosperous; may this famous city be preserved, my most dear country, however it has treated me; may my fellow citizens enjoy peace and tranquillity without me, since I am not to enjoy it with them, though I have procured it for them: I will withdraw, I will be gone.\"\n\n4. Modesty. It is certain, that what is modestly spoken is generally better received than what carries in it an air of boldness and confidence. Most persons, though ignorant of a thing, do not care to be thought so; and would have some deference paid to their understanding. But he who delivers himself in an arrogant and assuming way seems to upbraid his hearers with ignorance, while he does not leave them to judge for themselves, but dictates to them, and as it were demand their assent to what he says; which is certainly a very improper method to win upon them. For not a few, when convinced of an error in such a way, will not own it; but will rather adhere to their former opinion, than seem forced to think right, when it gives another the opportunity of a triumph. A prudent orator therefore will behave himself with modesty, that he may not seem to insult his hearers; and will set things before them in such an engaging manner, as may remove all prejudice either from his person or what he affirms. This is particularly necessary in the exordium of a discourse. If the orator set out with an air of arrogance and ostentation, the self-love and pride of the hearers will be presently awakened, and will follow him with a very fulsome eye throughout all his progress. His modesty should discover itself not only in his expressions at the beginning, but in his whole manner; in his looks, in his gestures, in the tone of his voice. Every auditory take in good part those marks of respect and awe, which are paid to them by one who addresses them. Indeed the modesty of an introduction should never betray any thing mean or abject. It is always of great use to an orator, that together with modesty and deference to his hearers, he should show a certain sense of dignity, arising from a persuasion of the justice or importance of the subject of which he is to speak. For to speak timorously, and with hesitation, destroys the credit of what is offered; and so far as the speaker seems to distrust what he says himself, he often induces others to do the like.\n\nBut, as has been said already, great care is to be taken that these characters do not appear feigned and counterfeit. For what is fictitious can seldom be long concealed. And if this be once discovered, it makes all that is said suspected, how specious soever it may otherwise appear.\n\nIt is further necessary, that the orator should know the world, and be well acquainted with the different tempers and dispositions of mankind. Nor indeed can any one reasonably hope to succeed in this province, without well considering the circumstances of time and place, with the sentiments and dispositions of those to whom he speaks; which, according to Aristotle, may be distinguished four ways, as they discover themselves by the several affections, habits, ages, and fortunes, of mankind.\n\nAnd each of these require a different conduct and manner of address.\n\nThe affections denote certain emotions of the mind, which, during their continuance, give a great turn to the disposition. For love prompts to one thing, and hatred to another. The like may be said of anger, lenity, and the rest of them.\n\nPersons differ likewise according to the various habits of their mind. So a just man is inclined one way, and an unjust man another; a temperate man to this, and an intemperate man to the contrary.\n\nAnd as to the several ages of men, Aristotle has described them very accurately; and how persons are differently affected in each of them. He divides the lives of men, considered as hearers, into three stages; youth, middle age, and old age.\u2014Young men, he says, have generally strong passions, and are very eager to obtain what they desire, but are likewise very mutable, so that the same thing does not please them long. They are ambitious of praise, and quick in their resentments; lavish of their money, as not having experienced the want of it; frank and open, because they have not often been deceived; and credulous for the same reason. They readily hope the best, because they have not suffered much, and are therefore not so fickle of the uncertainty of human affairs; for which reason they are likewise more easily deceived. They are modest, from their little acquaintance with the world. They love company and cheerfulness, from the briskness of their spirits. In a word, they generally exceed in what they do; love violently, hate violently, and act in the same manner through the rest of their conduct.\u2014The disposition of old men is generally contrary to the former. They are cautious, and enter upon nothing hastily; having in the course of many years been often imposed upon; having often erred, and experienced the prevailing corruption of human affairs; for which reason they are likewise suspicious, and moderate in their affections either of love or hatred. They pursue nothing great and noble, and regard only the necessaries of life. They love money; having learned by experience the difficulty of getting it, and how easily it is lost. They are fearful, which makes them provident. Commonly full of complaints, from bodily infirmities, and a deficiency of spirits. They please themselves rather with the memory of what is past, than with any future prospect; having so short a view of life before them, in comparison of what is already gone; for which reason also, they love to talk of things past; and prefer them to what is present, of which they have but little relish, and know they must shortly leave them. They are soon angry, but not to excess. Lastly, They are compassionate, from a sense of their own infirmities, which makes them think themselves of all persons most exposed.\u2014Persons of a middle age, between these two extremes, as they are freed from the rashness and temerity of youth, so they have not yet suffered the decays of old age. Hence in every thing they generally observe a better conduct. They are neither too hasty in their assent as the one, nor so minute-ly scrupulous as the other, but weigh the reasons of things. They regard a decency in their actions; are careful and industrious; and as they undertake what appears just and laudable upon better and more deliberate consideration than young persons, so they pursue them\nAs to the different fortunes of mankind, they may be considered as noble, rich, or powerful; and the contrary to these.\u2014Those of high birth, and noble extraction, are generally very tender of their honour, and ambitious to increase it; it being natural for all persons to desire an addition to those advantages of which they find themselves already possessed. And they are apt to consider all others as much their inferiors, and therefore expect great regard and deference should be shown them.\u2014Riches, when accompanied with a generous temper, command respect, from the opportunities they give of being useful to others; but they usually elate the mind, and occasion pride. For as money is commonly said to command all things, those who are possessed of a large share of it, expect others should be at their beck; since they enjoy that which all desire, and which most persons make the main pursuit of their lives to obtain.\u2014But nothing is more apt to swell the mind than power. This is what all men naturally covet, even when perhaps they would not use it. But the views of such persons are generally more noble and generous than of those who only pursue riches and the heaping up of money. A state contrary to these gives a contrary turn of mind; and in lower life, persons dispositions usually differ according to their station and circumstances. A citizen and a courtier, a merchant and a soldier, a scholar and a peasant, as their pursuits are different, so is generally their turn and disposition of mind.\n\nIt is the orator's business, therefore, to consider these several characters and circumstances of life, with the different bias and way of thinking they give to the mind; that he may conduct himself in his behaviour and manner of speaking, as will render him most acceptable, and gain him the good esteem of those whom he addresses.\n\n**Chap. VI. Of the Passions.**\n\nAs it is often highly necessary for the orator, so it requires his greatest skill, to engage the passions in his art. And, doubtless, nothing more discovers its empire over the minds of men, than this power to excite, appease, and sway their passions, agreeably to the design of the speaker. Hence we meet with the characters of admirable, divine, and other splendid titles, ascribed to eloquence by ancient writers. It has indeed been objected by some, that whatever high encomiums may be given of this art by the admirers of it, it is however disingenuous to deceive and impose upon mankind, as those seem to do, who, by engaging their passions, give a bias to their minds, and take them off from the consideration of the truth; whereas every thing should be judged of from the reasons brought to support it, by the evidence of which it ought to stand or fall. But, in answer to this, it may be considered that all fallacy is not culpable. We often deceive children for their good; and physicians sometimes impose on their patients, to come at a cure. And why, therefore, when persons will not be prevailed with by reason and argument, may not an orator endeavour, by engaging their passions, to persuade them to that which is for their advantage? Besides, Quintilian makes it a necessary qualification of an orator, that he be an honest man, and one who will not abuse his art. But since those of a contrary character will leave no methods untried in order to carry their point, it is requisite for those who design well to be acquainted with all their arts, without which they will not be a match for them; as in military affairs it is highly advantageous for the general of an army to get himself informed of all the designs and stratagems of the enemy, in order to counteract them. Indeed this part of oratory is not necessary at all times, nor in all places. The better prepared persons are to consider truth, and act upon the evidence of it, the less occasion there appears for it. But the greater part of mankind either do not duly weigh the force of arguments, or refuse to act agreeably to their evidence. And where this is the case, that persons will neither be convinced by reason, nor moved by the authority of the speaker, the only way left to put them upon action, is to engage their passions. For the passions are to the mind, what the wind is to a ship; they move, and carry it forward; and he who is without them, is in a manner without action, dull and lifeless. There is nothing great or noble to be performed in life wherein the passions are not concerned. The Stoics, therefore, who were for eradicating the passions, both maintained a thing in itself impossible, and which, if it was possible, would be of the greatest prejudice to mankind. For while they appeared such zealous affirers of the government of reason, they scarce left it anything to govern; for the authority of reason is principally exercised in ruling and moderating the passions, which, when kept in a due regulation, are the springs and motives to virtue. Thus hope produces patience, and fear industry; and the like might be shown of the rest. The passions therefore are not to be extirpated, as the Stoics affected, but put under the direction and conduct of reason. Indeed where they are ungovernable, and resist the control of reason, they are, as some have fitly called them, diseases of the mind; and frequently hurry men to vice, and the greatest misfortunes of life: just as the wind, when it blows moderately, carries on the ship; but if it be too boisterous and violent, may overturn her. The charge therefore brought against this art, for giving rules to influence the passions, appears groundless and unjust; since the proper use of the passions is, not to hinder the exercise of reason, but engage men to act agreeably to reason. And if an ill use be sometimes made of this, it is not the fault of the art but of the artist.\n\nWe shall here consider the passions, as they may be separately referred, either to demonstrative, deliberative, or judicial discourses; though they are not wholly confined to any of them.\n\n1. To the demonstrative kind, we may refer joy and sorrow, love and hatred, emulation and contempt.\n\nJoy is an elation of the mind, arising from a sense of some present good. Such a reflection naturally creates a pleasant and agreeable sensation, which ends in a delective delightful calm and serenity. This is heightened by a description of former evils, and a comparison between them and the present felicity. Thus Cicero endeavours to excite in the minds of his fellow citizens the highest tenor of joy and delight at Catiline's departure from Rome, by representing to them the imminent danger which threatened\nInvention threatened both them and the city while he continued among them.\n\nSorrow, on the contrary, is an uneasiness of mind arising from a sense of some present evil. This passion has generally a place in funeral discourses. And it may be heightened, like the former, by comparison, when any past happiness is set in opposition to a present calamity. Hence Cicero aggravates the sorrow at Rome occasioned by the death of Metellus, from his character, and great services to the public, while living.\n\nLove excites us to esteem any person for some excellency, and to do him all the good in our power. It is distinguished from friendship, which is mutual; and therefore love may continue where friendship is lost; that is, the affection may remain on one side. And when we assist a person from no other motive but to do him a kindness, Aristotle calls this goodwill. Love takes its rise from a variety of causes. Generosity, benevolence, integrity, gratitude, courtesy, and other social virtues, are great incitements to love any one endowed with such qualities. And persons generally love those who are of a like disposition with themselves, and pursue the same views. It is therefore the chief art of a flatterer to suit himself in every thing to the inclination of the person whose good graces he courts. When the orator would excite this affection towards any person, it is proper to show, that he is possessed of at least some, if not all, of these agreeable qualities. When the conspirators with Catiline were to be brought to justice, Cicero was very sensible of the envy he should contract on that account, and how necessary it was for him to secure the love of the Roman senate for his support and protection in that critical juncture. And this he endeavours to do in his fourth oration against Catiline, by representing to them in the most pathetic manner, that all the labours he underwent, the difficulties he contended with, and the dangers to which he was exposed on that account, were not for his own sake, but for their safety, quiet, and happiness.\n\nHatred is opposed to love, and produced by the contrary dispositions. And, therefore, persons hate those who never did them any injury, from the ill opinion they have of their base and vicious inclinations. So that the way to excite this passion is by showing that any one has committed some heinous fact with an ill intent. And the more nearly affected persons are by such actions, in what they account of the greatest concern, the higher in proportion their hatred rises. Since life, therefore, is esteemed the most valuable good, Cicero endeavours to render Mark Antony odious to the citizens of Rome, by describing his cruelty.\n\nEmulation is a disquiet, occasioned by the felicity of another, not because he enjoys it, but because we desire the like for ourselves. So that this passion is in itself good and laudable, as it engages men to pursue those things which are so. For the proper objects of emulation are any advantages of mind, body, or fortune, acquired by study or labour.\n\nEmulation therefore is excited by a lively representation of any desirable advantages which appear to be attainable, from the example of others who are or have been possessed of them. But where the felicity of another occasions an uneasiness, not from the want of it, but because he enjoys it, this passion is called envy, which the ancients describe as a hideous monster, feeding upon itself, and being its own tormentor. Aristotle justly observes, that it most usually affects such persons as were once upon a level with those they envy. For most men naturally think so well of themselves, that they are uneasy to see those who were formerly their equals advanced above them. But as this is a base and vicious passion, the orator is not to be informed how to excite it, but how to lessen or remove it. And the method prescribed by Cicero for this purpose is, to show that the things which occasioned it have not happened to the envied person undeservedly but are the just reward of his industry or virtue; that he does not too much convert them to his own profit or pleasure, as to the benefit of others; and that the same pains and difficulties are necessary to preserve them with which they were at first acquired.\n\nContempt is opposed to emulation, and arises from misconduct in things not of themselves vicious: As where a person either acts below his station and character, or affects to do that for which he is not qualified. Thus Cicero endeavours to expose C\u00e6cilius, and bring him into contempt of the court, for pretending to rival him in the accusation of Verres, for which he was altogether unfit.\n\n2. To deliberative discourses may be referred fear, of the passions which may be referred to hope, and shame.\n\nFear arises from the apprehension of some great and impending evil. For the greatest evils, while they appear at a distance, do not much affect us. Such discourses especially if they have been injured, or apprehend so likewise those who are addicted to do injuries, or who bear us an ill will. And the examples of others, who have suffered in a like case, or from the same persons, help to excite fear. From the circumstances therefore either of the thing or person, it will not be difficult for the orator to offer such arguments as may be proper to awaken this passion. So Demosthenes, when he would persuade the Athenians to put themselves in a condition of defence against King Philip, enumerates the several acts of hostility already committed by him against the neighbouring states. And because men's private concerns generally more affect them than what relates to the public, it is proper sometimes to show the necessary connexion these have with each other, and how the ruin of one draws the other after it.\n\nThe contrary passion to fear is hope; which arises either from a prospect of some future good, or the apprehension of safety from those things which occasion our fear. Young persons are easily induced to hope the best, from the vigour of their spirits. And those who have escaped former dangers are encouraged to hope for the like success for the future. The examples of others also, especially of wise and considerate men, have often the same good effect. To find them calm and sedate when exposed to the like dangers naturally creates confidence and the hopes of safety. But nothing gives persons such firmness and steadiness of mind under the apprehension of any difficulties, as a consciousness of their own integrity and innocence. Let dangers come from what quarter they will, they are best prepared\nInvention, prepared to receive them. They can calmly view an impending tempest, observe the way of its approach, and prepare themselves in the best manner to avoid it.\n\nIn Cicero's oration for the Manilian law, he encourages the Roman citizens to hope for success against Mithridates, if they choose Pompey for their general, from the many instances of his former successes which he there enumerates.\n\nShame arises from the apprehension of those things that hurt a person's character. Modesty has been wisely implanted in mankind by the great Author of nature, as a guardian of virtue, which ought for this reason to be cherished with the greatest care; because, as Seneca has well observed, \"if it be once lost, it is scarce ever to be recovered.\" Therefore the true cause or foundation of shame is any thing base or vicious; for this wounds the character, and will not bear reflection. And he must arrive at no small degree of insensibility, who can stand against such a charge, if he be conscious to himself that it is just. Therefore, to deter persons from vicious actions, or to expose them for the commission of them, the orator endeavours to let them in such a light as may most awaken this passion, and give them the greatest uneasiness by the reflection. And because the bare representation of the thing itself is not always sufficient for this purpose, he sometimes enforces it by enlarging the view, and introducing those persons as witnesses of the fact for whom they are supposed to have the greatest regard. Thus, when some of the Athenians, in an arbitration about certain lands which had been referred to them by the contending parties, proposed it as the shortest way of deciding the controversy, to take the possession of them in their own hands; Cydias, a member of the assembly, to dissuade them from such an unjust action, desired them to imagine themselves at that time in the general assembly of the states of Greece (who would all hear it if shortly), and then consider how it was proper to act. But where persons labour under an excess of modesty which prevents them from exerting themselves into things fit and laudable, it may sometimes be necessary to shew that it is faulty and ill grounded. On the other hand, immodesty, or impudence, which consists in a contempt of such things as affect the reputation, can never be too much discouraged and exposed. And the way of doing this is to make use of such arguments as are most proper to excite shame. We have a very remarkable instance of it in Cicero's second Philippic, wherein he affixes this character upon Mark Antony through every scene of his life.\n\n3 To judicial discourses, may be referred anger and lenity, pity and indignation.\n\nAnger is a resentment, occasioned by some affront or injury, done without any just reason. Now men are more inclined to resent such a conduct, as they think they least deserve it. Therefore persons of distinction and figure, who expect a regard should be paid to their character, can the least bear any indications of contempt. And those who are eminent in any profession or faculty, are apt to be offended if reflections are cast either upon their reputation or art. Magistrates also, and persons in public stations, sometimes think it incumbent on them to resent indignities for the support of their office. But nothing sooner inflames this passion, than if good services are rewarded with flights and neglect. The instance of Narses, the Roman general, is remarkable in this kind; who, after he had been successful in his wars with the Goths, falling under the displeasure of the emperor Justinian, was removed from the government of Italy, and received by the empress with this taunt, That he must be sent to weave among the girls; which so provoked him, that he said he would weave such a web, as they would never be able to unravel. And accordingly, he soon after brought down the Longobards, a people of Germany, into Italy; where they settled themselves in that part of the country, which from them is now called Lombardy. (See Narses.) The time and place in which an injury was done, and other circumstances that attended it, may likewise contribute very much to heighten the fact. Hence Demosthenes, in his oration against Midias, endeavours to aggravate the injury of being struck by him, both as he was then a magistrate, and because it was done at a public festival. From hence it appears, that the persons who most usually occasion this passion are such as neglect the rules of decency, contemn and insult others, or oppose their inclinations; as likewise the ungrateful, and those who violate the ties of friendship, or requite favours with injuries. But when the orator endeavours to excite anger, he should be careful not to exceed due bounds in aggravating the charge, lest what he says appear rather to proceed from prejudice, than a strict regard to the merit of the action.\n\nLenity is the remission of anger. The designs of men's actions are principally to be regarded; and therefore what is done ignorantly, or through inadvertency, is sooner forgiven. Also to acknowledge a fault, submit, and ask pardon, are the ready means to take off resentment. For a generous mind is soon cooled by submission. Besides, he who repents of his fault, does really give the injured party some satisfaction, by punishing himself; as all repentance is attended with grief and uneasiness of mind, and this is apt very much to abate the desire of revenge. As, on the contrary, nothing is more provoking, than when the offender either audaciously justifies the fact, or confidently denies it. Men are likewise wont to lay aside their resentment, when their adversaries happen by some other means to suffer what they think a sufficient satisfaction. Lastly, Easy circumstances, a lucky incident, or anything which gives the mind a turn to mirth and pleasure, has a natural tendency to remove anger. For anger is accompanied with pain and uneasiness, which very ill suit joy and cheerfulness. The orator therefore, in order to afflauge and pacify the minds of his auditors, will endeavour to lessen their opinion of the fault, and by that means to take off the edge of their resentment. And to this purpose, it will be proper either to represent that the thing was not designed, or that the party is sorry for it; or to mention his former services; as also to show the credit and reputation which will be gained by a generous forgiveness. And this last topic is very artfully wrought up by Cicero, in his address to Caesar in favour of Ligarius.\n\nPity arises from the calamities of others, by reflecting, that we ourselves are liable to the like misfortunes. So that evils, considered as the common lot of human nature, are principally the cause of pity. And this makes the difference between pity and good will, which arises merely from a regard to the circumstances of those who want\nInvention want our assistance. But considering the uncertainty of every thing about us, he must seem in a manner divested of humanity, who has no compassion for the calamities of others; since there is no affliction which happens to any man, but either that, or some other as great, may fall upon himself. But those persons are generally most touched with this passion, who have met with misfortunes themselves. And by how much greater the distress is, or by how much the person appears least deserving it, the higher pity does it excite; for which reason, persons are generally most moved at the misfortunes of their relations and friends, or those of the best figure and character. The orator, therefore, in order to excite the greater pity, will endeavour to heighten the idea of the calamity, from the several circumstances both of the thing itself and the person who labours under it. A fine example of this may be seen in Cicero's defence of Murena, Cap. 40, &c.\n\nIndignation, as opposed to pity, is an uneasiness at the felicity of another who does not seem to deserve it. But this respects only external advantages, such as riches, honours, and the like; for virtues cannot be the object of this passion. Aristotle therefore says, \"that pity and indignation are generally to be found in the same persons, and are both evidences of a good disposition.\" Now the orator excites this passion, by showing the person to be unworthy of that felicity which he enjoys. And as, in order to move compassion, it is sometimes of use to compare the former happy state of the person with his present calamity; so here, the greater indignation is raised, by comparing his former mean circumstances with his present advancement: as Cicero does in the case of Vatinus.\n\nThese are the passions with which an orator is principally concerned. In addressing to which, not only the greatest warmth and force of expression is often necessary, but he must likewise first endeavour to impress his own mind with the same passion he would excite in others.\n\nA man may convince, and even persuade others to act, by mere reason and argument. But that degree of eloquence which gains the admiration of mankind, and properly denominates one an orator, is never found without warmth or passion. Passion, when in such a degree as to rouse and kindle the mind, without throwing it out of the possession of itself, is universally found to exalt all the human powers. It renders the mind infinitely more enlightened, more penetrating, more vigorous and masterly, than it is in its calm moments. A man, actuated by a strong passion, becomes much greater than he is at other times. He is conscious of more strength and force; he utters greater sentiments, conceives higher designs, and executes them with a boldness and a felicity of which on other occasions he could not think himself capable. But chiefly, with respect to persuasion, is the power of passion felt. Almost every man in passion is eloquent. Then he is at no loss for words and arguments. He transmits to others, by a fort of contagious sympathy, the warm sentiments which he feels; his looks and gestures are all persuasive; and nature here shows herself infinitely more powerful than art. This is the foundation of that just and noted rule, Si vis me fleere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi.\n\nThe warmth, however, which we express, must be suited to the occasion and the subject; for nothing can be more preposterous than an attempt to introduce great vehemence into a subject, which is either of slight importance, or which, by its nature, requires to be treated calmly. A temperate tone of speech is that for which there is most frequent occasion; and he who is on every subject passionate and vehement, will be considered as a blusterer, and meet with little regard.\n\nPART II. OF DISPOSITION.\n\nAs Invention supplies the orator with necessary materials, so Disposition directs him how to place them in the most proper and suitable order. Disposition, therefore, considered as a part of oratory, naturally follows invention. And what is here chiefly intended by it is, the placing the several parts of a discourse in a just method and dependence upon one another.\n\nWriters are not all agreed in determining the parts of an oration; though the difference is rather in the manner of considering them, than in the things themselves. But Cicero, whom we shall here follow, mentions five, namely, Introduction, Narration, Proposition, Confirmation, Confutation, and Conclusion.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Introduction.\n\nThe design of this is to prepare the minds of the hearers for a suitable reception of the remaining parts that are to follow. And for this end, three things are requisite; that the orator gain the good opinion of his hearers, that he secure their attention, and give them some general notion of his subject.\n\n1. Good opinion. When the orator introduces his discourse with his own person, he will be careful to do it with modesty, and seem rather to extenuate his virtues and abilities, than to magnify them. And where the nature of the subject may seem to require it, he will endeavour to show, that some just and good reason induced him to engage in it. We have a very fine example of this in Cicero's oration for the poet Aulus Licinius Archias, which begins thus: \"If I have any natural genius, which I am sensible is very small, or any ability in speaking, wherein I own I have been very conversant; or any skill acquired from the study and precepts of the best arts, to which my whole life has been devoted; this Aulus Licinius has, in a particular manner, a right to demand of me the fruit of all these things. For as far back as I can remember, and call to mind what passed in my youth to the present time, he has been my chief adviser and encourager both to undertake and pursue this course of studies.\" When the orator sets out with the persons of those to whom the discourse is made, it is not unusual to commend them for their virtues, and those especially which have a more immediate relation to the present subject. Thus Cicero begins his oration of thanks for the pardon of Marcellus, with an encomium upon the mildness, clemency, and wisdom of Caesar, to whom it was addressed.\nBut sometimes the orator expresses his gratitude for past favours; as Cicero has done in his orations, both to the people and senate of Rome, after his return from banishment.\u2014And at other times he declares his concern for them and their interest; in which manner Cicero begins his fourth oration against Catiline, which was made in the senate. \"I perceive (says he) that all your countenances and eyes are turned on me; I perceive that you are solicitous, not only for your own danger, and that of the state, but for mine likewise, if that should be removed. Your affection for me is pleasant in misfortunes, and grateful in sorrow; but I adjure you to lay it aside, and, forgetting my safety, consider yourselves and your children.\" But in judicial cases, both the character of the person whose cause he espouses, and that of the adverse party likewise, furnish the orator with arguments for exciting the good will of his hearers: The former, by commemorating his virtues, dignity, or merits, and sometimes his misfortunes and calamities. So Cicero, in his defence of Placcus, begins his oration in commending him on the account of his services done to the public, the dignity of his family, and his love to his country. And Demosthenes, in his oration against Midias, sets out with a recital of his vices, in order to recommend his own cause to the favourable opinion of the court.\n\n2. Attention. On this head, Cicero says, \"We shall be heard attentively on one of these three things; if we propose what is great, necessary, or for the interest of those to whom the discourse is addressed.\" So that, according to him, the topics of attention are much the same with those of good opinion, when taken from the subject. And indeed, people are naturally led to attend either to those things or persons of which they have entertained a favourable opinion. But in order to gain this point, the orator sometimes thinks it proper to request the attention of his audience. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Cluentius, after having shown the impositions of the charge against him, concludes his introduction in the following manner, speaking to the judges: \"Wherefore I entreat, that while I briefly and clearly reply to a charge of many years standing, you will, according to your usual custom, give me a kind and attentive hearing.\" And again, in his second Philippic, addressing himself to the senate: \"But as I must say something for myself, and many things against Mark Antony; one of these I beg of you, that you will hear me kindly, while I speak for myself; and the other I will undertake for, that when I speak against him, you shall hear me with attention.\" But though the introduction be the most usual and proper place for gaining attention, yet the orator finds it convenient sometimes to quicken and excite his hearers in other parts of his discourse, when he observes they flag, or has something of moment to offer.\n\n3. Some general account of the subject of the discourse. This is always necessary; which the two others are not. And therefore it must be left to the prudence of the orator when to use or omit them as he shall judge proper, from the nature of his discourse, the circumstance of his hearers, and how it stands with them. But some account of the subject is what cannot be neglected. For every one expects to be soon informed of the design of the speaker, and what he proposes to treat of. Nor when they are all made use of, is it necessary they should always stand in the order we have here placed them.\n\nCicero sometimes enters immediately upon his subject, and introduces the other heads afterwards. As in his third oration against Catiline, made to the body of the Roman people, which begins thus: \"You see that the state, all your lives, estates, fortunes, wives and children, and this seat of the greatest empire, the most flourishing and beautiful city, having by the favour of heaven towards you, and my labours, counsels, and dangers, been this day rescued from fire and sword and the very jaws of destruction, are preserved and restored to you.\" And then he proceeds to recommend himself to their esteem and benevolence, from the consideration of these benefits.\n\nThese are the heads which commonly furnish matter for this part of a discourse. But orators often take occasion from the time, place, largeness of the assembly, or some other proper circumstance, to compliment their hearers, recommend themselves, or introduce the subject with which they are about to treat. Instances of each may be furnished by the circumstances of the case, or other ornament, which they accommodate to the occasion of their discourse. Thus Ilocrates enters upon his celebrated panegyric in praise of his countrymen the Athenians with the following comparison: \"I have often wondered what could be their design who brought together these assemblies, and instituted the gymnastic sports, to propose so great rewards for bodily strength; and to vouchsafe no honour to those who applied their private labours to serve the public, and so cultivated their minds as to be serviceable to others, to whom they ought to have shewn greater regard. For although the strength of a champion was doubled, no benefit would from thence accrue to others; but all enjoy the prudence of one man, who will hearken to his advice.\" In some cases, orators have recourse to a more covert and artful way of opening their subject, endeavour to remove jealousies, apologize for what they are about to say, and seem to refer it to the candour of the hearers to judge of it as they please. Cicero appears to have been a perfect master of this art, and used it with great success. Thus in his seventh Philippic, where he seems to express the greatest concern, lest what he was about to say should give any offence to the senate to whom he was speaking: \"I (says he) who always declared for peace, and to whom peace among ourselves, as it is wished for by all good men, was in a particular manner desirable; who have employed all my industry in the forum, in the senate, and in the defence of my friends, whence I have arrived to the highest honours, a moderate fortune, and what reputation I enjoy; I therefore, who owe what I am to peace, and without it could not have been the person I am, be that what it will, for I would arrogate nothing to myself; I speak with concern and fear, how you will receive what I am going to say; but I beg and entreat you, from the great regard I have always expressed for the support and advancement of your honour, that if anything said by me should at first appear harsh or unfit to be received, you will notwithstanding please to hear it without offence, and not reject it till I have explained myself: I then, for I must repeat it again, who have always approved of peace, and promoted it, am against a peace with Mark Antony,\"\nThis is called infinuation; and may be necessary, where a cause is in itself doubtful, or may be thought so from the received notions of the hearers, or the impressions already made upon them by the contrary side. An honest man would not knowingly engage in a bad cause; and yet, through prevailing prejudice, that may be so esteemed which is not so in itself. In these cases, therefore, great caution and prudence are necessary to give such a turn to things, and place them in that view as may be least liable to offence. And because it sometimes happens that the hearers are not so much displeased at the object as the person, Quintilian's rule seems very proper, when he says, \"If the subject displease, the character of the person should support it; and when the person gives offence, he should be helped by the cause.\"\n\n**Chap. II. Of Narration.**\n\nThe orator having prepared his hearers to receive his discourses with candour and attention, and acquainted them with his general design in the introduction, before he proceeds directly to his subject, often finds it necessary to give some account of what preceded, accompanied, or followed upon it. And this he does in order to enlarge the view of the particular point in dispute, and place it in a clearer light. This is called narration; which is a recital of something done, in the order and manner in which it was done. Hence it is easy to perceive what those things are which properly enter into a narration. And such are the cause, manner, time, place, and consequences of an action; with the temper, fortune, views, ability, associates, and other circumstances of those concerned in it. Not that each of these particulars is necessary in every narration; but so many of them at least as are requisite to set the matter in a just light, and make it appear credible. Besides, in relating a fact, the orator does not content himself with such an account of it as is barely sufficient to render what he says intelligible to his hearers; but describes it in so strong and lively a manner, as may give the greatest evidence to his relation, and make the deepest impression upon their minds. And if any part of it appear at present less probable, he promises to clear up and remove any remaining doubts in the progress of his discourse. For the foundation of his reasoning afterwards is laid in the narration, from whence he takes his arguments for the confirmation. And therefore it is a matter of no small importance that this part be well managed, since the success of the whole discourse so much depends upon it. See Narration.\n\nThere are four properties required in a good narration; that it be short, clear, probable, and pleasant.\n\n1. The brevity of a narration is not to be judged of merely from its length: for that may be too long, which contains but a little; and that too short, which comprehends a great deal. Wherefore this depends upon the nature of the subject, since some things require more words to give a just representation of them, and others fewer. That may properly therefore be called a short narration, which contains nothing that could well have been omitted, nor omits anything which was necessary to be said. Now, in order to avoid both these extremes, care should be taken not to go farther back in the account of things, nor to trace them down lower, than the subject requires; to say that only in the general, which does not need a more particular explication; not to assign the causes of things, when it is enough to show they were done; and to omit such things as are sufficiently understood, from what either preceded, or was consequent upon them. But the orator should be careful, lest, while he endeavours to avoid prolixity, he run into obscurity. Horace was very sensible of this danger, when he said,\n\nBy striving to be short, I grow obscure.\n\n2. Perspicuity. This may justly be esteemed the chief excellency of language. For as the design of speech is to communicate our thoughts to others, that must be its greatest excellence which contributes most to this end; and that, doubtless, is perspicuity. As perspicuity therefore is requisite in all discourse, so it is particularly serviceable in a narration, which contains the substance of all that is to be said afterwards. Wherefore, if this be not sufficiently understood, much less can those things which receive their light from it. Now the following things render a narration clear and plain: Proper and significant words, whose meaning is well known and determined; short sentences, though full and explicit, whose parts are not perplexed, but placed in their just order; proper particles to join the sentences, and show their connexion and dependence on each other; a due regard to the order of time, and other circumstances necessary to be expressed; and, lastly, suitable transitions.\n\n3. Probability. Things appear probable when the causes assigned for them appear natural; the manner in which they are described is easy to be conceived; the consequences are such as might be expected; the characters of the persons are justly represented; and the whole account is well attested, consistent with itself, and agreeable to the general opinion. Simplicity likewise in the manner of relating a fact, as well as in the style, without any reserve or appearance of art, contributes very much to its credibility. For truth loves to appear naked and open, stript of all colouring or disguise. The conspiracy of Catiline was so daring and extravagant, that no one but such a desperado could ever have undertaken it with any hopes of success. However, Cicero's account of it to the senate was so full and exact, and so well suited to the character of the person, that it presently gained credit. And therefore, when upon the conclusion of Cicero's speech, Catiline, who was present, immediately stood up, and desired they would not entertain such hard thoughts of him, but consider how much his family had always been attached to the public interest, and the great services they had done the state; their resentment rose so high, that he could not be heard: upon which he immediately left the city, and went to his associates.\n\n4. The last thing required in a narration is, that it be pleasant and entertaining. And this is more difficult, because it does not admit of that accurate composition and pompous dress which delight the ear, and recommend some other parts of a discourse. For it certainly requires no small skill in the speaker, while he endeavours to express every thing in the most natural, plain, and easy manner, not to grow flat and tiresome.\nDisposition. For Quintilian's remark is very just, that \"the most experienced orators find nothing in eloquence more difficult, than what all who hear it fancy they could have said themselves.\" And the reason of this seems very obvious. For as all art is an imitation of nature, the nearer it resembles that, the more perfect it is in its kind. Hence unexperienced persons often imagine that to be easiest which suits best with those natural ideas to which they have been accustomed; till, upon trial, they are convinced of their mistake. Wherefore, to render this part of a discourse pleasant and agreeable, recourse must be had to variety both in the choice of words and turns of the expression. And therefore questions, admirations, interlocutions, imagery, and other familiar figures, help very much to diversify and enliven a narration, and prevent it from becoming dull and tedious, especially when it is carried on to any considerable length.\n\nHaving given a brief account of the nature and properties of a narration, we shall now proceed to consider the uses of it.\n\nLaudatory orations are usually as it were a sort of continued narration, set off and adorned with florid language and fine images proper to grace the subject, which is naturally so well fitted to afford pleasure and entertainment. Therefore a separate narration is more suited to deliberative and judicial discourses. In Cicero's oration for the Manilian law (which is of the former kind), the design of the narration is to show the Roman people the necessity of giving Pompey the command of the army against King Mithridates, by representing the nature of that war, which is done in the following manner: \"A great and dangerous war (says he) threatens your revenues and allies from two very powerful kings, Mithridates and Tigranes; one of whom not being pursued after his defeat, and the other provoked, they think they have an opportunity to seize Asia. Letters are daily brought from those parts to worthy gentlemen of the equestrian order, who have large concerns there in farming your revenues: they acquaint me, as friends, with the state of the public affairs, and danger of their own; that many villages in Bithynia, which is now your province, are burnt down; that the kingdom of Ariobarzanes, which borders upon your revenues, is entirely in the enemy's power; that Lucullus, after several great victories, is withdrawn from the war; that he who succeeds him is not able to manage it; that all the allies and Roman citizens wish and desire the command of that war may be given to one particular person; and that he alone, and no other, is dreaded by the enemies. You see the state of the case; now consider what ought to be done.\" Here is an unhappy scene of affairs, which seemed to call for immediate redress. The causes and reasons of it are assigned in a very probable manner, and the account well attested by persons of character and figure. And what the consequences would be, if not timely prevented, no one could well be ignorant. The only probable remedy suggested in general is, the committing that affair to one certain person, which he afterwards shows at large could be no other than Pompey. But in Cicero's defence of Milo (which is of the judicial kind), the design of the narration, which is greatly commended by Quintilian, is to prove that, in the combat between Clodius and Milo, the former was the aggressor. And in order to make this appear, he gives a summary account of the conduct of Clodius the preceding year; and from the course of his actions and behaviour, shows the inveterate hatred he bore to Milo, who obstructed him in his wicked designs. For which cause he had often threatened to kill him, and given out that he should not live beyond such a time; and accordingly he went from Rome without any other apparent reason, but that he might have an opportunity to attack him in a convenient place near his own house, by which he knew Milo was then obliged to pass. Milo was in the senate that day, where he stood till they broke up, then went home, and afterwards set forward on his journey. When he came to the place in which he was to be assaulted, Clodius appeared every way prepared for such a design, being on horseback, and attended with a company of desperate ruffians ready to execute his commands; whereas Milo was with his wife in a chariot, wrapped up in his cloak, and attended with servants of both sexes. These were all circumstances which preceded the fact. And as to the action itself, with the event of it, the attack, as Cicero says, was begun by the attendants of Clodius from a higher ground, who killed Milo's coachman; upon which Milo, throwing off his cloak, leaped out, and made a brave defence against Clodius's men, who were got about the chariot. But Clodius, in the heat of the skirmish, giving out that Milo was killed, was himself slain by the servants of Milo, to avenge, as they thought, the death of their master. Here seems to be all the requisites proper to make this account credible. Clodius's open and avowed hatred of Milo, which proceeded so far as to threaten his life; the time of his leaving Rome; the convenience of the place; his habit and company so different from those of Milo; joined with his known character of a most profligate and audacious wretch, could not but render it very probable that he had formed that design to kill Milo. And which of them began the attack, might very reasonably be credited from the advanced ground on which Clodius and his men were placed; the death of Milo's coachman at the beginning of the combat; the skirmish afterwards at the chariot; and the reason of Clodius's own death at last, which does not appear to have been intended, till he had given out that Milo was killed.\n\nBut a distinct and separate narration is not always necessary in any kind of discourse. For if the matter be well known before, a set and formal narrative will be tedious to the hearers. Or if one party has done it already, it is needless for the other to repeat it. But there are three occasions especially, in which it may seem very requisite: when it will bring light to the subject; when different accounts have already been given out concerning it; or when it has been misrepresented by the adverse party. If the point in controversy be of a dubious nature, or not sufficiently known to the hearers, a distinct account of the matter, with the particular circumstances attending it, must be very serviceable, in order to let them into a true state of the case, and enable them to judge of it with greater certainty.\n\nMoreover, where the opposite party has set the matter in a false light by some artful and invidious turn, or loaded it with any odious circumstances, it seems no less necessary that endeavours should be used to remove any ill impressions, which otherwise might remain upon the minds.\nDisposition, minds of the hearers, by a different and more favourable representation. And if any thing can be fixed upon to make the contrary account appear absurd or incredible, it ought particularly to be remarked. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Sextus Roelius, shows that he was many miles distant from Rome at the time he was charged with having killed his father there. \"Now (says he), while Sextus Roelius was at Aemilia, and this Titus Roelius [his accuser] at Rome, Sextus Roelius [the father] was killed at the baths on Mount Palatine, returning from supper. From whence I hope there can be no doubt who ought to be suspected of the murder. And, were not the thing plain of itself, there is this farther suffusion to fix it upon the prosecutor; that, after the fact was committed, one Manlius Glaucia, an obscure fellow, the freedman, client, and familiar, of this Titus Roelius, first carried the account of it to Aemilia, not to the son of the deceased, but to the house of Titus Capito his enemy;\" with more to the same purpose. But what we bring it for is, to show the use which Cicero makes of this narration for retorting the crime upon the prosecutors.\n\nBut the orator should be very careful, in conducting this part, to avoid every thing which may prejudice the cause he espouses. Falshood, and a misrepresentation of facts, are not to be justified; but no one is obliged to say those things which may hurt himself. We shall just mention one instance of this from Cicero, where he has shown great skill in this respect, in pleading before Caesar for the pardon of Ligarius, who had joined with Pompey in the civil war. For Ligarius, having been represented by the adverse party as an enemy to Caesar, and so esteemed by Caesar himself; Cicero very artfully endeavours in his narration to take off the force of this charge, by showing, that, when the war first broke out, he refused to engage in it; which he would not have done, had he borne any personal hatred to Caesar. \"Quintus Ligarius (says he), before there was any suspicion of a war, went into Africa as a legate to the proconsul Caius Confidius; in which he so approved himself, both to the Roman citizens and allies, that, when Confidius left the province, the inhabitants would not be satisfied he should leave the government in the hands of any other person. Therefore Quintus Ligarius having excused himself in vain for some time, accepted of the government against his will; which he so managed during the peace, that both the citizens and allies were greatly pleased with his integrity and justice. The war broke out on a sudden, which those in Africa did not hear till it was begun: but upon the news of it, partly through inconsiderate haste, and partly from blind fear, they looked out for a leader, first for their own safety, and then as they were affected; when Ligarius, thinking of home, and desirous to return to his friends, would not be prevailed on to engage in any affairs. In the mean time, Publius Acutius Varus, the praetor, who was formerly governor of Africa, coming to Utica, recourse was immediately had to him, who very eagerly took upon himself the government; if that can be called a government, which was conferred on a private man by the clamour of the ignorant multitude, without any public authority. Ligarius, therefore, who endeavoured to avoid every thing of that kind, ceased to act soon after the arrival of Varus.\" Here Cicero ends his narrative. For though Ligarius afterwards joined with Pompey's party, yet to have mentioned that, which was nothing more than what many others had done, whom Caesar had already pardoned, could have served only to increase his displeasure against him. And therefore he doubtless showed great skill in so managing his account, as to take off the main force of the accusation, and by that means make way for his pardon, which he accordingly obtained.\n\nChap. III. Of the Proposition.\n\nIn every just and regular discourse, the speaker's intention is to prove or illustrate something. And when he lays down the subject upon which he designs to treat, in a distinct and express manner, this is called the proposition.\n\nOrators use several ways in laying down the subject of their discourses. Sometimes they do it in one general subject, which an proposition. We have an instance of this in Cicero's oration speech to the senate, the day after Caesar was killed (as seems to it is given us by Dion Cassius), in which his design was treat, to persuade them to peace and unanimity. \"This (says he) being the state of our affairs, I think it necessary that we lay aside all the discord and enmity which have been among us, and return again to our former peace and agreement.\" And then he proceeds to offer his reasons for this advice.\n\nAt other times, to give a clearer and more distinct view of their discourse, they subjoin to the proposition the general heads of argument by which they endeavour to support it. This method Cicero uses in his seventh Philippic, where he says, \"I who have always commended and advised to peace, am against a peace with Mark Antony. But why am I adverse to peace? Because it is safe, because it is dangerous, and because it is impracticable. And I beseech you to hear me with your usual candour, while I make out these three things.\"\n\nBut when the subject relates to several different things, which require each of them to be separately laid down subject re- in distinct propositions, it is called a partition; though some have made two kinds of partition, one of which things, and they call separation, and the other enumeration. By the requires former of these, the orator shows in what he agrees with his adversary, and wherein he differs from him. So, in the case formerly mentioned, of a person accused of forgery, for the crime of stealing private money out of a temple, he is called a who pleads for the defendant says, \"He owns the fact; partition, but it being private money, the point in question is, Whether this be sacrilege?\" And in the case of Milo, Cicero, speaking of Clodius, says, \"The point which now comes before the court, is not, Whether he was killed or not; that we confess; but, Whether justly or unjustly?\" Now in reality here is no partition, since the former branch of the proposition is what is agreed upon, and given up; and consequently it is only the latter that remains to be disputed. It is called enumeration, when the orator acquaints his hearers with the several parts of his discourse upon which he designs to treat. And this alone, properly speaking, is a partition. Thus Cicero states his plea in his defence of Murcia: \"I perceive the accusation consists of three parts: the first respects the conduct of his life; the second his dignity; and the third contains a charge of bribery.\"\n\nThere are three things requisite in a good parti-\nA partition is said to be short, when each proposition contains in it nothing more than what is necessary. So that the brevity here required is different from that of a narration; for that consists chiefly in things, this in words. And, as Quintilian justly observes, brevity seems very proper here, where the orator does not show what he is then speaking of, but what he designates to discourse upon.\n\nAgain, it ought to be complete and perfect. And for this end, care must be taken to omit no necessary part in the enumeration.\n\nBut, however, there should be as few heads as is consistent with the nature of the subject. The ancient rhetoricians prescribe three or four at the most. And we do not remember that Cicero ever exceeds that number. But it is certain, the fewer they are, the better, provided nothing necessary be omitted. For too large a number is both difficult of retention, and apt to introduce that confusion which partition is designed to prevent.\n\nHitherto we have been speaking only of those heads into which the subject or general argument of the discourse is at first divided. For it is sometimes convenient to divide these again, or at least some of them, into several parts or members. And when this happens, it is best done, as the speaker comes to each of them in the order at first laid down; by which means the memory of the hearers will be less burdened than by a multitude of particulars at one and the same time. Thus Cicero, in his oration for the Aemilian law, comprises what he designs to say under three general heads. \"First (says he) I shall speak of the nature of the war, then of its greatness, and lastly about the choice of a general.\" And when he comes to the first of these, he divides it again into four branches; and shows, \"how much the glory of the Romans, the safety of their allies, their greatest revenues, and the fortunes of many of their citizens, were all concerned in that war.\" The second head, in which he considers the greatness of the war, has no division. But when he comes to the third head, concerning the choice of a general, he divides that likewise into four parts; and shows, that so many virtues are necessary in a consummate general, such a one as was proper to have the management of that war, namely, skill in military affairs, courage, authority, and success: all which he attributes to Pompey. And this is the scheme of that celebrated oration.\n\nThis subdividing, however, should never have place but when it is absolutely necessary. To split a subject into a great many minute parts, by divisions and subdivisions without end, has always a bad effect in speaking. It may be proper in a logical treatise; but it makes an oration appear hard and dry, and unnecessarily fatigues the memory. In a sermon, there may be from three to five, or six heads, including subdivisions; seldom should there be more.\n\nFurther, some divide their subject into two parts, and propose to treat upon it negatively and positively; by showing first what it is not, and then what it is. But while they are employed to prove what it is not, they are not properly treating upon that, but something else; which seems as irregular as it is unnecessary. For he who proves what a thing is, does at the same time show what it is not. However, in fact, there is a sort of division by affirmation and negation, which may sometimes be conveniently used. As if a person, charged with killing another, should thus state his defence: \"I had done right if I had killed him, but I did not kill him.\" Here indeed, if the latter can be plainly made to appear, it may seem needless to insist upon the former. But if that cannot be so fully proved, but there may be room left for suspicion, it may be proper to make use of both: for all persons do not see things in the same light, and he who believes the fact, may likewise think it just; while he who thinks it unjust, may not believe it, but rather suppose, had it really been committed by the party, he would not have denied it, since he looked upon it as defensible. And this method of proceeding, Quintilian compares to a custom often used in traffic, when persons make a large demand at first, in order to gain a reasonable price. Cicero uses this way of reasoning in his defense of Milo; but in the contrary order; that is, he first answers the charge; and then justifies the fact, upon the supposition that the charge was true. For he proves, first, that Clodius was the aggressor; and not Milo, as the contrary party had asserted: and then, to give the greater advantage to his cause, he proceeds to show, that if Milo had been the aggressor, it would however have been a glorious action to take off such an abandoned wretch, who was not only a common enemy to mankind, but had likewise often threatened his life.\n\nA good and just partition is attended with considerable advantages. For it gives both light and ornament to a discourse. And it is also a great relief to the hearers, who, by means of these stops and rests, are much better enabled to keep pace with the speaker without confusion, and by calling their thoughts either way, from what has been said, both know and are prepared for what is to follow. And as persons, in travelling a road with which they are acquainted, go on with greater pleasure and less fatigue, because they know how far it is to their journey's end; so to be apprised of the speaker's design, and the several parts of his discourse which he proposes to treat on, contributes very much to relieve the hearer, and keep up his attention. This must appear very evident to all who consider how difficult it is to attend long and closely to one thing, especially when we do not know how long it may be before we are like to be released. Whereas, when we are beforehand acquainted with the scheme, and the speaker proceeds regularly from one thing to another, opportunity is given to ease the mind, by relaxing the attention, and recalling it again when necessary. In a sermon, or in a pleading at the bar, few things are of greater consequence than a proper or happy division. It should be studied with much accuracy and care; for if one take a wrong method at first setting out, it will lead him astray in all that follows. It will render the whole discourse either perplexed or languid; and though the hearers may not be able to tell where the fault or disorder lies, they will be sensible there is a disorder somewhere, and find themselves little affected by what is spoken. The French writers of sermons study neatness and elegance in the division of their subjects much more than the English do; whose distributions, though sensible and just, yet are often inartificial and verbose.\nCHAP. IV. Of Confirmation.\n\nThe orator having acquainted his hearers, in the proposition, with the subject on which he designs to discourse, usually proceeds either to prove or illustrate what he has there laid down. For some discourses require nothing more than an enlargement or illustration, to set them in a proper light, and recommend them to the hearers; for which reason, likewise, they have often no distinct proposition. But where arguments are brought in defense of the subject, this is properly confirmation. For, as Cicero defines it, \"confirmation is that which gives proof, authority, and support to a cause, by reasoning.\" And for this end, if any thing in the proposition seems obscure, or liable to be misunderstood, the orator first takes care to explain it, and then goes on to offer such arguments for the proof of it, and represent them in such a light, as may be most proper to gain the attention of his hearers.\n\nBut here it is proper to observe, that there are different ways of reasoning fitted to different arts. The mathematician treats his subject after another manner than the logician, and the orator in a method different from them both. Two methods of reasoning are employed by orators, the synthetic and analytic.\n\nI. Every piece of synthetic reasoning may be resolved into a syllogism or series of syllogisms, (see Logic). Thus we may reduce Cicero's argument, by which he endeavours to prove that Clodius assaulted Milo, and not Milo Clodius, to a syllogism in this manner:\n\nHe was the aggressor, whose advantage it was to kill the other.\nBut it was the advantage of Clodius to kill Milo, and not Milo to kill him.\nTherefore Clodius was the aggressor, or he assaulted Milo.\n\nThe thing to be proved was, that Clodius assaulted Milo, which therefore comes in the conclusion; and the argument, by which it is proved, is taken from the head of profit or advantage. Thus the logician would treat this argument; and if either of the premises were questioned, he would support it with another syllogism. But this short and dry way of reasoning does not at all suit the orator: who not only for variety changes the order of the parts, beginning sometimes with the minor, and at other times with the conclusion, and ending with the major; but likewise clothes each part with such ornaments of expression as are proper to enliven the subject, and render it more agreeable and entertaining. And he frequently subjoins, either to the major proposition, or minor, and sometimes to both, one or more arguments to support them; and perhaps others to confirm or illustrate them as he thinks it requisite. Therefore, as a logical syllogism consists of three parts or propositions, a rhetorical syllogism frequently contains four, and many times five parts. And Cicero reckons this last the most complete. But all that is said in confirmation of either of the premises is accounted but as one part. This will appear more evident by examples: By a short syllogism Cicero thus proves, that the Carthaginians were not to be trusted: \"Those who have often deceived us, by violating their engagements, ought not to be trusted. For if we receive any damage by their treachery, we can blame nobody but ourselves. But the Carthaginians have often so deceived us. Therefore it is madness to trust them.\" Here the major proposition is supported by a reason. The minor needed none; because the treachery of the Carthaginians was well known. So that this syllogism consists of four parts. But by a syllogism of five parts he proves somewhat more largely and elegantly, that the world is under the direction of a wise governor. The major is this: \"These things are better governed which are under the direction of wisdom, than those which are not.\" This he proves by several instances: \"A house managed with prudence has everything in better order, and more convenient, than that which is under no regulation. An army commanded by a wise and skilful general is in all respects better governed than one which has a fool or a madman at the head of it. And the like is to be said of a ship, which performs her course best under the direction of a skilful pilot.\" Then he proceeds to the minor thus: \"But nothing is better governed than the universe.\" Which he proves in this manner: \"The rising and setting of the heavenly bodies keep a certain determined order; and the several seasons of the year do not only necessarily return in the same manner, but are suited to the advantage of the whole; nor did the vicissitudes of night and day ever become prejudicial, by altering their course.\" From all which he concludes, \"that the world must be under the direction of a wise governor.\" In both these examples, the regular order of the parts is observed. We shall therefore produce another, in which the order is directly contrary; for beginning with the conclusion, he proceeds next to the minor proposition, and so ends with the major. In his defence of C\u00e6lius, his design is to prove that C\u00e6lius had not led a loose and vicious life, with which his enemies had charged him. And this he does, by showing he had closely followed his studies, and was a good orator. This may probably at first sight appear but a weak argument; though to him who considers what Cicero everywhere declares necessary to gain that character, it may perhaps be thought otherwise. The sense of what he says here may be reduced to this syllogism.\n\nThose who have pursued the study of oratory, so as to excel in it, cannot have led a loose and vicious life.\nBut C\u00e6lius has done this.\nTherefore his enemies charge him wrongfully.\n\nBut let us hear Cicero himself. He begins with the conclusion, thus: \"C\u00e6lius is not chargeable with profuseness, extravagancy, contracting of debts, or intemperance, a vice which age is so far from abating, that it rather increases it. Nay, he never engaged in amours, and those pleasures of youth, as they are called, which are soon thrown off, as reason prevails.\" Then he proceeds to the minor, and shows from the effects, that C\u00e6lius had closely applied himself to the best arts, by which he means those necessary for an orator: \"You have now heard him make his own defence, and you formerly heard him engaged in a prosecution (I speak this to vindicate, not to applaud him), you could not but perceive his manner of speaking, his ability, his good sense, and command of language. Nor did he only discover a good genius,\"\nPart II.\n\nDisposition: genius, which will oftentimes do much of itself when it is not improved by industry; but what he said (if my affection for him did not bias my judgment) appeared to be the effect of learning, application, and study.\" And then he comes to the major: \"But be assured, that those vices charged upon C\u00e6lius, and the studies upon which I am now discoursing, cannot meet in the same person. For it is not possible that a mind, disturbed by such irregular passions, should be able to go through what we orators do, I do not mean only in speaking, but even in thinking.\" And this he proves by an argument taken from the scarcity of good orators. \"Can any other reason be assigned, why so few, both now, and at all times, have engaged in this province, when the rewards of eloquence are so magnificent, and it is attended with so great delight, applause, glory, and honour? All pleasures must be neglected; diversions, recreations, and entertainments omitted; and even the conversation of all our friends must in a manner be laid aside. This it is which deters persons from the labour and study of oratory; nor their want of genius or education.\"\n\n2. By Enthymem. But orators do not often use complete syllogisms, but most commonly enthymemes. An enthymem, as is shown elsewhere, is an imperfect syllogism, consisting of two parts; the conclusion, and one of the premises. And in this kind of syllogism, that proposition is omitted, whether it be the major or minor, which is sufficiently manifest of itself, and may easily be supplied by the hearers. But the proposition that is expressed is usually called the antecedent, and the conclusion the consequent. So if the major of that syllogism be omitted, by which Cicero endeavours to prove that Clodius assaulted Milo, it will make this enthymem:\n\nThe death of Milo would have been an advantage to Clodius.\n\nTherefore Clodius was the aggressor; or, therefore, he assaulted Milo.\n\nIn like manner, that other syllogism above mentioned, by which he shows that the Carthaginians ought not to be trusted, by omitting the minor, may be reduced to the following enthymem:\n\nThose who have often broke their faith ought not to be trusted.\n\nFor which reason the Carthaginians ought not to be trusted.\n\nEvery one would readily supply the minor, since the perfidiousness of the Carthaginians was known to a proverb. But it is reckoned a beauty in enthymemes, when they consist of contrary parts, because the turn of them is most acute and pungent. Such is that of Micipia in Sallust: \"What stranger will be faithful to you who are an enemy to your friends?\" And likewise that of Cicero for Milo, speaking of Clodius: \"You fit as avengers of his death; whose life you would not restore, did you think it in your power.\" Orators manage enthymemes in the same manner they do syllogisms; that is, they invert the order of the parts, and confirm the proposition by one or more reasons; and therefore a rhetorical enthymem frequently consists of three parts, as a syllogism does of five. Though, strictly speaking, a syllogism can consist of no more than three parts, and an enthymem but of two: and the arguments brought to support either of the propositions constitute so many new Disposition-enthymems, of which the part they are designed to prove is the conclusion. To illustrate this by an example:\n\nAn honest man thinks himself under the highest obligation to his country.\n\nTherefore he should shun no danger to serve it.\n\nIn this enthymem the major is wanting, which would run thus: \"He who is under the highest obligations to another, should shun no danger in order to serve him.\" This last proposition is founded upon the common principle of gratitude; which requires that, to the utmost of our power, a return should be made in proportion to the kindness received. And this being a maxim generally allowed, it is omitted by the orator. But now this enthymem, consisting of the minor and conclusion, might be managed in some such manner as this, beginning with the conclusion: \"An honest man ought to shun no danger, but readily expose his life for the safety and preservation of his country.\" Then the reason of this conduct might be added, which is the antecedent of the enthymem, or minor of the syllogism: \"For he is sensible that his obligations to his country are so many, and so great, that he can never fully requite them.\" And this again might be confirmed by an enumeration of particulars: \"He looks upon himself as indebted to his country for every thing he enjoys; for his friends, relations, all the pleasures of life, and even for life itself. Now the orator calls this one enthymem, though in reality there are two: For the second reason, or argument, added to the first, becomes the antecedent of a new enthymem, of which the first reason is the consequent. And if these two enthymemes were expressed separately in the natural order of the parts, the former would stand thus: \"An honest man thinks himself under the highest obligations to his country; therefore he ought to shun no danger for its preservation.\" The latter thus: \"An honest man esteems himself indebted to his country for every thing he enjoys; therefore he thinks he is under the highest obligations to it.\" The same thing might be proved in the like way of reasoning, by arguments of a different kind. From comparison, thus: \"As it would be thought safe and ungrateful in a son not to hazard himself for the preservation of his father; an honest man must certainly esteem it so when his country is in danger.\" Or from an example, in this manner: \"An honest man in like circumstances would propose to himself the example of Decius who freely gave up his life for the service of his country. He gave up his life indeed, but did not lose it; for he cannot be said to have lost his life, who lives in immortal honour.\" Orators frequently intermix such arguments to adorn and illustrate their subject with others taken from the nature and circumstances of things. And now, if we consider a little this method of reasoning, we shall find it the most plain and easy imaginable. For when any proposition is laid down, and one or more reasons subjoined to prove it, each reason joined with the proposition makes a distinct enthymem, of which the proposition is the conclusion. Thus Cicero, in his seventh Philippic, lays down this as the foundation of his discourse, \"That he is against a peace with Mark Antony; for which he gives three reasons: 'Because it is base, because it is dangerous,\nThese severally joined with the proposition, form three enthymemes; and upon each of these he discourses separately, which make up that oration. And this method is what persons for the most part naturally fall into, who know nothing of the terms syllogism or enthymeme. They advance something, and think of a reason to prove it, and another perhaps to support that; and, so far as their invention will assist them, or they are matters of language, they endeavour to set what they say in the plainest light, give it the best drefs, embellish it with proper figures and different turns of expression; and, as they think convenient, illustrate it with similitudes, comparisons, and the like ornaments, to render it most agreeable, till they think what they have advanced sufficiently proved. As this method of arguing therefore is the most plain, easy, and natural; so it is what is most commonly used in oratory. Whereas a strict syllogistical way of discoursing is dry and jejune, cramps the mind, and does not admit of those embellishments of language which are a great advantage to the orator: for which reason he seldom uses complete syllogisms; and when he does, it is with great latitude. In every discourse care should be taken not to blend arguments confusedly together that are of a separate nature. \"All arguments (says the elegant Dr Blair) are directed to prove one or other of these three things; that something is true; that it is morally right or fit; or that it is profitable and good. These make the three great subjects of disputation among mankind; truth, duty, and interest. But the arguments directed towards any one of them are generally distinct; and he who blends them all under one topic, which he calls his argument, as, in sermons especially, is too often done, will render his reasoning indistinct and irrelevant. Suppose, for instance, that I am recommending to an audience benevolence, or the love of our neighbour; and that I take my first argument from the inward satisfaction which a benevolent temper affords; my second, from the obligation which the example of Christ lays upon us to this duty; and third, from its tendency to procure us the good will of all around us; my arguments are good, but I have arranged them wrong: for my first and third arguments are taken from considerations of interest, internal peace, and external advantages; and between these, I have introduced one, which rests wholly upon duty. I should have kept those classes of arguments, which are addressed to different principles in human nature, separate and distinct.\"\n\nH. The other method of reasoning is the analytic, in which the orator conceals his intention concerning the point he is to prove, till he has gradually brought his hearers to the designed conclusion. They are led on, step by step, from one known truth to another, till the conclusion be drawn from them, as the natural consequence of a chain of propositions. As, for instance, when one intending to prove the being of a God, sets out with observing that every thing which we see in the world has had a beginning; that whatever has had a beginning, must have had a prior cause; that in human productions, art known in the effect, necessarily infers design in the cause; and proceeds leading you from one cause to another, till you arrive at one supreme first cause, from whom is derived all the order and design visible in his works. This is much the same with the Socratic method, by which that philosopher silenced the sophists of his age.\n\nHe proceeded by several questions, which being separately granted, the thing designed to be inferred was afterwards put, which, by reason of its similitude with several cafes allowed before, could not be denied. But this is a captious way of reasoning; for while the respondent is not aware of what is designed to be inferred, he is easily induced to make those concessions, which otherwise he would not. Besides, it is not so well suited to continued discourses, as to those which are interlocutory; and therefore we meet with it oftentimes in the Socratic dialogues both of Plato and Xenophon. However, it may be made use of in oratory by a figure called subjection, when the same person first puts the question, and then makes the answer. So in the famous cause of Epaminondas, general of the Thebans, who was accused for refusing to surrender his command to his successor appointed by the state, till after he had engaged the enemy, and given them a total defeat, Cicero thus represents his accuser pleading for the words of the law against Epaminondas, who alleged the intention of it in his defence: \"Should Epaminondas add that exception to the law, which, he says, was the intention of the writer, namely, Except anyone refuse to give up his command when it is for the interest of the public he should not; would you admit of it? I believe not. Should you yourselves, which is a thing most remote from your justice and wisdom, in order to screen him, order this exception to be added to the law, without the command of the people; would the Thebans suffer it to be done? No, certainly. Can it be right then to come into that, as if it was written, which it would be a crime to write? I know it cannot be agreeable to your wisdom to think so.\"\n\nUnder the analytic method may be comprehended May comprehending nearly the same with the Socratic, by example. Rhetoricians use this word in a different sense from the common acceptation. For that reasoning is usually called an example, which is brought either to prove or illustrate some general assertion: As if any one should say, that human bodies may be brought to sustain the greatest labours by use and exercise; and in order to prove this should relate what is said of Milo of Croton, that \"by the constant practice of carrying a calf several furlongs every day, he could carry it as far after it had grown to its full size.\" But in oratory the word example is used for any kind of similitude; or, as Velleius defines it, \"When one thing is inferred from another, by reason of the likeness which appears between them.\" Hence it is called an imperfect induction, which infers something from several others of a like nature, and has always the greatest force when the examples are taken from facts. Now facts may be compared with respect to some agreement or similitude between them, which in themselves are either equal or unequal. Of the former kind this is an instance: \"Cato acted as became a patriot and a lover of his country's liberty, in opposing the arms of Caesar: and therefore so did Cicero.\" The reason of the inference is founded in the parity of the case, which equally concerned all good subjects of the Roman government at that time. For all were alike obliged to oppose a common enemy, who endeavoured to subvert the constitution, and subject them to his own arbitrary power. But though an example...\nample consists in the comparison of two single facts, yet several persons may be concerned in each fact. Of this kind is that which follows: \"As Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus, acted illegally in the first triumvirate, by engrossing the sole power into their own hands, and by that means violating the public liberty; so likewise did Augustus, Mark Antony, and Lepidus, in the second triumvirate, by pursuing the same measures.\" But when Cicero defends Milo for killing Clodius, from the like instances of Ahala, Servilius, Scipio Nasica, Lucius Opimius, and others; that is not an example, but an induction: because one thing is there inferred from its similitude to several others. But when a comparison is made between two facts that are unequal, the inference may be either from the greater to the less, or from the less to the greater. From the greater to the less in this manner: \"Caesar had no just pretensions to the Roman government, and therefore much less had Antony.\" The reason lies in the difference between the two persons. Caesar had very much enlarged the bounds of the Roman empire by his conquests, and greatly obliged the populace by his generosity; but as he had always acted by an authority from the senate and people of Rome, these things gave him no claim to a power over them. Much less then had Antony any such pretence, who always acted under Caesar, and had never performed any signal services himself. Cicero has described the difference between them in a very beautiful manner in his second Philippic, thus speaking to Antony: \"Are you in anything to be compared to him? He had a genius, sagacity, memory, learning, care, thought, diligence; he had performed great things in war, though detrimental to the state; he had for many years designed to get the government into his hands, and obtained his end by much labour and many dangers; he gained over the ignorant multitude by public shows, buildings, concagories, and feasts; obliged his friends by rewards, and his enemies by a show of clemency. In a word, he subjected a free state to slavery, partly through fear, and partly compliance. I can liken you to him for ambition of power; but in other things you are in no respect to be compared with him.\" By a comparison from the less to the greater, Cicero thus argues against Catiline: \"Did the brave Scipio, when a private man, kill Tiberius Gracchus, for attempting to weaken the state; and shall we confide bear with Catiline endeavouring to destroy the world by fire and sword?\" The circumstances of these two cases were very different; and the comparison runs between a private man and a confidant intrusted with the highest authority; between a design only to raise a tumult, and a plot to destroy the government: whence the orator justly infers, that what was esteemed lawful in one case, was much more so in the other. The like way of reasoning is sometimes used from other similitudes, which may be taken from things of all kinds, whether animate or inanimate. Of the former sort is that of Cicero speaking of Murena, when candidate for the consulship, after he had himself gone through that office: \"If it is usual (says he) for such persons as are lately arrived in port, to give those who are going out the best account they can with relation to the weather, pirates, and coasts; because thus nature directs us to assist those who are entering upon the same dangers which we ourselves have escaped: how ought I, who now after a great storm am brought within a near prospect of land, to be affected towards him, who, I perceive, must be exposed to the greatest tempests of the state?\" He alludes to the late disturbances and tumults occasioned by the conspiracy of Catiline, which had been so happily suppressed by him in the time of his consulate. Of the latter kind is that of Quintilian: \"As the ground is made better and more fruitful by culture, so is the mind by instruction.\" There is both a beauty and justness in this figure.\n\nBut comparisons are sometimes made between facts and other things, in order to infer some difference or opposition between them. In comparing two facts, on account of some disagreement and unlikeness, the inference is made from the difference between one and the other in that particular respect only. As thus: \"Though it was not effected cruelty in Brutus to put his two sons to death, for endeavouring to betray their country; it might be so in Manlius, who put his son to death, only for engaging the enemy without orders, though he gained the victory.\" The difference between the two facts lies in the different nature of the crime. The sons of Brutus entered into a conspiracy to betray their country; and though they miscarried in it, yet the intention and endeavours they used to accomplish it were criminal in the highest degree. But young Manlius could only be charged with rashness. His design was honourable, and intended for the interest of his country; only it was irregular, and might have proved of ill consequence to military discipline. Now in all such cases, the force of the argument is the stronger the greater the difference appears. But the same facts which differ in one respect may agree in many others; as in the example here mentioned. Brutus and Manlius were both magistrates as well as fathers; they both killed their sons, and that for a capital crime by the Roman law. In any of which respects they may be compared in a way of similitude: as, \"If Brutus might lawfully put his son to death for a capital crime, so might Manlius.\" But now contrary facts do not only differ in some certain respect, but are wholly opposite to each other; so that what is affirmed of the one must be denied of the other; and if one be a virtue, the other is a vice. Thus Cicero compares the conduct of Marcellus and Verres in a way of opposition. \"Marcellus (says he), who had engaged, if he took Syracuse, to erect two temples at Rome, would not beautify them with the spoils he had taken: Verres, who had made no vows to Honour and Virtue, but to Venus and Cupid, endeavoured to plunder the temple of Minerva. The former would not adorn the gods with the spoils of other deities: the latter carried the ornaments of Minerva, a virgin, into the house of a harlot.\" If therefore the conduct of Marcellus was laudable and virtuous, that of Verres must bear the contrary character. But this way of reasoning has likewise place in other respects. Thus Cicero, in the quarrel between Caesar and Pompey, advised to peace from the difference between a foreign and domestic war: \"That the former might prove beneficial to the state; but in the latter, whichever side conquered, the public must suffer.\" And thus the ill effects of intemperance may be shown in a way of opposition: \"That as temperance preserves the health of the body, keeps up the vigour of the mind, and prolongs life; so excess must necessarily have the contrary effects.\"\n\nThus we have given a brief account of the principal ways...\nways of reasoning commonly made use of by orators. As to the disposition of arguments, or the order of placing them, some advice to put the weaker, which cannot wholly be omitted, in the middle; and such as are stronger, partly in the beginning, to gain the esteem of the hearers, and render them more attentive; and partly at the end, because what is last heard is likely to be retained longest: But if there are but two arguments, to place the stronger first, and then the weaker; and after that to return again to the former, and insist principally upon that. But this must be left to the prudence of the speaker, and the nature of the subject. Though to begin with the strongest, and to gradually descend to the weakest, can never be proper, for the reason last mentioned. Nor ought arguments to be crowded too close upon one another; for that takes off from their force, as it breaks in upon the attention of the hearers, and does not leave them sufficient time duly to consider them. Nor indeed should more be used than are necessary; because the fewer they are, the more easily they are remembered. And the observation of a great master of eloquence upon this subject is certainly very just, that arguments ought rather to be weighed than numbered.\n\n**CHAP. V. Of Confutation.**\n\nThe forms of reasoning here are the same as have been already explained under confirmation. Confutation, however, is often the more difficult task; because he who is to confute a thing comes usually prepared; but he who is to confute it is frequently left to a sudden answer. For which reason, in judicial cases, Quintilian says, \"It is as much easier to accuse than defend, as it is to make a wound than to heal it.\" Therefore, not only a good judgment, but a readiness of thought also, seems necessary for this province. But, in all disputes, it is of the greatest consequence to observe where the fires of the controversy lies. For without attending to this, persons may cavil about different matters, without understanding each other, or deciding anything. And in confutation, what the adversary has advanced ought carefully to be considered, and in what manner he has expressed himself. As to the things themselves, whether they immediately relate to the matter in dispute, or are foreign to it. Those things that are foreign to the subject may either be passed over in silence, or in a very few words shown to be insignificant. And there ought likewise to be a distinction made between such things as relate to the subject, according to their importance. Those that appear to have no great weight should be lightly remarked. For to insist largely upon such matters is both tiresome to the hearers, and apt to bring the judgment of the speaker into question. And therefore things of that nature are generally better turned off with an air of neglect, a pungent question, or an agreeable jest, than confuted by a serious and laboured answer. But those things, which relate to the merits of the cause, may be confuted either by contradicting them, or by showing some mistake in the reasoning, or their invalidity when granted.\n\nThings may be contradicted several ways. What is apparently false may be expressly denied. Thus Cicero in his defense of Cluentius: \"When the accuser had said, that the man fell down dead after he had drank off his cup, denies that he died that day.\" And things which the adversary cannot prove, may likewise be denied. Of which we have also an instance in Cicero, who first upbraids Mark Antony as guilty of a breach not only of good breeding, but likewise of friendship, for reading publicly a private letter he had sent him. And then adds, \"But what will you say now, if I should deny that ever I sent you that letter? How will you prove it? By the handwriting? In which I confess you have a peculiar skill, and have found the benefit of it. But how can you make it out? For it is in my secretary's hand. I cannot but envy your master who had so great a reward for teaching you to understand just nothing. For what can be more unbecoming not only an orator, but even a man, than for anyone to offer such things, which if the adversary denies he has nothing more to say?\" It is an handsome way of contradicting a thing, by showing that the adversary himself maintained the contrary. So when Oppius was charged with defrauding the soldiers of their provisions, Cicero refutes it, by proving, that the same persons charged Oppius with a design to corrupt the army by his liberality. An adversary is never more effectually silenced than when you can fall contradictions upon him; for this is flabbing him with his own weapon. Sometimes a thing is not in express terms denied, but represented to be utterly incredible. And this method exposes the adversary more than a bare denial. So when some persons reproached Cicero with cowardice, and a shameful fear of death, he recites their reasons in such a manner, that any one would be inclined to think the charge entirely false. \"Was it becoming me (says he) to expect death with that composure of mind as some have imagined? Well, and did I then avoid it? Nay, was there anything in the world that I could apprehend more desirable? Or, when I had done the greatest things in such a crowd of ill-minded persons about me, do you think banishment and death were not always in my view, and continually founding in my ears as my certain fate, while I was so employed? Was life desirable when all my friends were in such sorrow, and myself in so great distress, deprived of all the gifts both of nature and fortune? Was I so inexperienced, so ignorant, so void of reason and prudence? Had I never seen or heard anything in my whole life? Did all I had read and studied avail nothing? What! did not I know that life is short, but the glory of generous actions permanent? When death is appointed for all, does it not seem eligible, that life, which must be wrested from us, should rather be freely devoted to the service of our country, than reserved to be worn out by the decays of nature? Was not I sensible, there has been this controversy among the wisest men, that some say, the minds of men and their consciences utterly perish at death; and others, that the minds of wise and brave men are then in their greatest strength and vigour, when they are set free from the body?\" The first state is not greatly to be dreaded, to be void of sense: but the other, of enjoying larger capacities, is greatly to be desired. Therefore, since I always aimed at dignity, and thought nothing was worth living for without it; how should I, who am past the usefulness, and did do great things in it, be afraid to die?\" Thus far Cicero. There is likewise an ironical way of contradicting a thing, by restoring that and other things of the like nature upon the\nThus Cicero, in his oration against Vatinus, says: \"You have objected to me, that I defended Cornelius, my old friend, and your acquaintance. But pray why should I not have defended him? Has Cornelius carried any law contrary to the omens? Has he violated any law? Has he assaulted the consul? Did he take possession of a temple by force of arms? Did he drive away the tribune, who opposed the passing a law? Has he thrown contempt upon religion? Has he plundered the treasury? Has he pillaged the state? No, these, all these, are your doings.\" Such an unexpected return is sometimes of great service to abate the confidence of an adversary.\n\nA second way of confutation is, by observing some flaw in the reasoning of the adverse party. We shall endeavour to illustrate this from the several kinds of reasoning treated of before under confirmation. And first, as to syllogisms; they may be refuted, either by showing some mistake in the premises, or that the conclusion is not justly deduced from them. So when the Clodian party contended, that Milo ought to suffer death for this reason, because he had confessed that he had killed Clodius; that argument, reduced to a syllogism, would stand thus:\n\nHe who confesses he has killed another, ought not to be allowed to see the light.\nBut Milo confesses this.\nTherefore he ought not to live.\n\nNow the force of this argument lies in the major or first proposition; which Cicero refutes, by proving, that the Roman people had already determined contrary to what is there alleged: \"In what city (says he) do these men dispute after this weak manner? In that wherein the first capital trial was in the case of the brave Horatius, who, before the city enjoyed perfect freedom, was saved by the suffrages of the Roman people, though he confessed that he killed his sister with his own hand.\" But when Cicero accused Verres for maladministration in his government of Sicily, Hortensius, who defended him, being sensible the allegations brought against him could not be denied, had no other way left to bring him off, but by pleading his military virtues in abatement, which at that time were much wanted, and very serviceable to the state. The form of the argument was this:\n\nThat the Romans then wanted good generals.\nThat Verres was such.\nAnd consequently, that it was for the interest of the public that he should not be condemned.\n\nBut Cicero, who knew his design, states the argument for him in his charge; and then answers it by denying the consequence, since the crimes of Verres were of so heinous a nature, that he ought by no means to be pardoned on the account of any other qualifications: Though indeed he afterwards refutes the minor or second proposition, and shows that he had not merited the character of a good general. Enthymemes may be refuted, either by showing that the antecedent is false, or the consequent not justly inferred from it. As thus, with respect to the former case:\n\nA strict adherence to virtue has often proved detrimental.\nTherefore virtue ought not constantly to be embraced.\n\nHere the antecedent may be denied. For virtue is always beneficial to those who strictly adhere to it, both in the present satisfaction it affords them, and the future rewards they may certainly expect from it. And as to the latter case, in this manner:\n\nShe is a mother.\nTherefore she loves her children.\n\nNow as the certainty of that inference depends upon this general assertion, That all mothers love their children, which is not true, the mistake of the reasoning may be shown from the instance of Medea and others, who destroyed their own children. As to induction and example, by which the truth or equity of a thing is proved from its likeness to one or more other things; the reasoning in either is invalid, if the things compared can be shown not to have that similitude or agreement on which the inference is founded. One instance therefore may serve for both. As when Cicero, after the death of Caesar, pleaded for the continuance of his laws, but not of those which were made afterwards by Mark Antony: Because, though both were in themselves invalid, and impositions upon the public liberty; yet some of Caesar's were useful, and others could not be set aside without disturbance to the state, and injuring particular persons; but those of Antony were all detrimental to the public.\n\nThe last method of confutation before-mentioned was, when the orator does in some sense grant the adversary his argument, and at the same time shows its invalidity. And this is done by a variety of ways, according to the different nature of the subject. Sometimes he allows what was said may be true; but pleads, that what he contends for is necessary. This was the method by which Hortensius professed to bring off Verres, as we have already shown from Cicero, whose words are these, addressing himself to the judges; \"What shall I do? which way shall I bring in my accusation? where shall I turn myself? for the character of a brave general is placed like a wall against all the attacks I can make. I know the place, I perceive where Hortensius intends to display himself. He will recount the hazards of war, the necessities of the state, the scarcity of commanders; and then he will entreat you, and do his utmost to persuade you not to suffer the Roman people to be deprived of such a commander upon the testimony of the Sicilians, nor the glory of his arms to be filled by a charge of avarice.\" At other times the orator pleads, that although the contrary opinion may seem to be attended with advantage, yet that his own is more just, or honourable. Such was the case of Regulus, when his friends endeavoured to prevail with him to continue at Rome, and not return to Carthage, where he knew he must undergo a cruel death. But as this could not be done without violating his oath, he refused to hearken to their persuasions. Another way of confutation is, by retorting upon the adversary his own argument. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Ligarius, says: \"You have, Tubero, that which is most definable to an accuser, the confession of the accused party; but yet such a\nconfession, that he was on the same side that you, Tubero, chose yourself, and your father too, a man worthy of the highest praise. Wherefore, if there was any crime in this, you ought first to confess your own before you attempt to fasten any upon Ligarius.\" The orator takes this advantage where an argument proves too much, that is, more than the person designed it for, who made use of it. Not much unlike this is what they call inversion, by which the orator shows, that the reasons offered by the opposite party make for him. So when C\u00e6cilius urged, that the province of accusing Verres ought to be granted to him, and not to Cicero, because he had been his treasurer in Sicily at the time those crimes were committed with which he was charged, and consequently knew most of that affair; Cicero turns the argument upon him, and shows, for that very reason he was the most unfit of any man to be intrusted with his prosecution; since having been concerned with him in his crimes, he would certainly do all in his power to conceal or lessen them. Again, sometimes the charge is acknowledged, but the crime shifted off to another. Thus, when Sextius was accused of sedition, because he had got together a body of gladiators, and brought them into the forum, where a warm engagement happened between them and Clodius's faction; Cicero owns the fact, but charges the crime of sedition upon Clodius's party in being the aggressors. Another method made use of for the same purpose is to alleviate the charge, and take off the force of it, by showing, that the thing was not done with that intention which the adversary inferrates. Thus Cicero, in his defence of King Dejotarus, owns he had raised some forces, though not to invade the Roman territories, as had been alleged, but only to defend his own borders, and send aid to the Roman generals.\n\nWe have hitherto been speaking of the methods of confutation used by orators, in answering those arguments which are brought by the contrary party. But sometimes they raise such objections themselves to what they have said, as they imagine may be made by others; which they afterwards answer, the better to induce their hearers to think that nothing considerable can be offered against what they have advanced, but what will admit of an easy reply. Thus, when Cicero, at the request of the Sicilians, had undertaken the accusation of Verres, it came under debate, whether he, or C\u00e6cilius, who had been Verres's quaestor in Sicily, should be admitted to that province. Cicero, therefore, in order to set him aside, among other arguments, shows his incapacity for such an undertaking, and for that end recounts at large the qualifications necessary for an orator. Which he represents to be so many and great, that he thought it necessary to start the following objection to what he had himself said upon that subject. \"But you will say perhaps, Have you all these qualifications?\" To which he thus replies: \"I wish I had; but it has been my constant study from my youth to gain them. And if, from their greatness and difficulty, I have not been able to attain them, who have done nothing else through my whole life; how far, do you imagine, you must be from it, who never thought of them before; and even now, when you are entering upon them, have no apprehension what, and how great, they are?\" This is an effectual way of defeating an adversary, when the objection is well founded, and clearly answered. But we shall have occasion to consider this matter more largely hereafter, under the figure of preludes, to which it properly relates.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Conclusion.\n\nRhetoricians make the conclusion of a discourse to the conclusion of two parts: recapitulation, and an address to the audience. Recapitulation is a summary account of what the speaker has before offered in maintenance of his subject; and is designed both to refresh the memory of the hearers, and to bring the principal arguments together into a narrow compass, that they may appear in a stronger light. Now there are several things necessary to a good repetition.\n\nAnd first, it must be short and concise; since it is designed to refresh the memory, and not to burden it. For this end, therefore, the chief things only are to be touched upon; those on which the cause principally depends, and which the orator is most desirous should be regarded by his hearers. Now these are, The general heads of the discourse, with the main arguments brought to support them. But either to infill particularly upon every minute circumstance, or to enlarge upon those heads which it may be thought proper to mention, carries in it not so much the appearance of a repetition, as of a new discourse.\n\nAgain, it is convenient in a repetition to recite things in the same order in which they were at first laid down. By this means the hearers will be enabled much better to keep pace with the speaker as he goes along; and if they happen to have forgot any thing, they will the more readily recall it. And besides, this method appears most simple and open, when the speaker reviews what he has said in the same manner it was before delivered, and sets it in the clearest light for others to judge of it. But though a repetition contains only the same things which had been more largely treated of before; yet it is not necessary they should be expressed in the same words. Nay, this would many times be tiresome and unpleasant to the hearers; whereas a variety of expression is grateful, provided the sense be the same. Besides, every thing ought now to be represented in the strongest terms, and in so lively a manner, as may at the same time both entertain the audience, and make the deepest impression upon their minds. We have a very exact and accurate example of repetition in Cicero's oration for Quintius. Cicero was then a young man, and seems to have kept more closely to the rules of art, than afterwards, when, by use and practice, he had gained a greater freedom of speaking. We formerly cited the partition of this speech, upon another occasion, which runs thus: \"We deny, Sextus Nevius, that you were put into the possession of the estate of P. Quintius, by the praetor's edict. This is the dispute between us. I will therefore show, first, that you had no just cause to apply to the praetor for the possession of the estate of P. Quintius; then that you could not possess it by the edict; and lastly, that you did not possess it. When I have proved these three things, I will conclude.\" Now Cicero begins his conclusion with a repetition of those three heads, and a summary account of the several arguments he made use of under each of them.

It has been several times taken by the French, and last of all in 1792, but restored after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

The inhabitants supply Genoa with a great deal of timber for building ships; and carry on a great trade in linen cloth, paper, oil, wine, and honey.\u2014Although the county of Nice be on this side of the mountains, geographers have always considered it as a province of Italy, since they have given to this beautiful part of Italy the river Var for a western limit, which is also the boundary of the county, and flows into the sea at a league distance from the capital. This province is partly covered by the maritime Alps; and is bordered on the east by Piedmont, and the states of Genoa; on the south by the Mediterranean; on the west by the Var; and on the north by Dauphiny. Its length is about 20 leagues of the country, which make about 36 English miles; its breadth is 10 leagues; and its population is about 129,000 souls.\n\nThe city of Nice is the capital, and the seat of the senate, the bishopric, and government. It has become, within these few years, a delightful abode, by the number of strangers who assemble there in the winter, either to re-establish their health, or to enjoy the mildness of the climate, and the beauty of the country, where an unceasing verdure presents eternal spring.\n\nThe town is situated on the sea shore, and is backed by a rock entirely insulated, on which was formerly a castle, much esteemed for its position; but it was destroyed in the year 1706 by Marechal Berwick, the garrison being too thin to defend the extent of the works. There is a distinction between the old and the new town; this last is regular, the houses are well built, and the streets are wide. Its position is by the side of the sea, and it is terminated, on one side, by a charming terrace, which serves for a promenade.\n\nAny person may live peaceably in this province, without fear of being troubled on points of faith, provided he conduct himself with decorum. The town has three suburbs. 1st, That of St John, which conduces to Cimier, about three leagues north from Nice, &c. The promenades this way are very delightful, and may be enjoyed in a carriage. 2d, That of the Poudriere.\nThat of the Croix de Marbre, or Marble Cross.\n\nThis suburb is new; and the English almost all lodge in it, being very near the town. The houses are commodious, facing on one side the great road which leads to France, and on the other a fine garden, with a prospect of the sea. All the houses are separate from each other: the company hire them for the season, i.e. from October till May. Apartments may be had from 15 to 250 louis. The proprietors commonly furnish linen, plate, &c. There are also in the town very large and commodious houses; as well as the new road, which is opened from the town to the port, by cutting that part of the rock which inclined toward the sea. The situation is delightful, and warmest in winter, being entirely covered from the north wind, and quite open to the south.\n\n\"The company is brilliant at Nice, and the amusements of the Carnival are, in proportion to the size of the town, as lively as in any of the great ones in France. There is always an Italian opera, a concert and masked ball, alternately; and the company play rather high.\n\n\"It is impossible to find a happier climate than Nice, both for summer and winter. Reamur's thermometer, in 1781, never fell more than three degrees below the freezing point, and that only for two days; while at Geneva it fell ten: and in the course of the winter of 1785 it fell only two degrees; while at Geneva it fell 15. The month of May is rarely so fine in France as February at Nice. The summer is not so hot as might be expected. The thermometer never rises more than 24 degrees (86\u00b0 Fahrenheit) above temperate in the shade; and there is always an agreeable sea breeze from ten in the morning till sunset, when the land breeze comes on. There are three chains of graduated mountains, the last of which confound their summits with the Alps; and to this triple rampart is owing the mild temperature so sensibly different from that of the neighbouring parts.\n\n\"The cultivation of the ground is as rich as can be desired. There are alternately rows of corn and beans, separated by vines attached to different fruit-trees, the almond and the fig; so that the earth being incessantly cultivated, and covered with trees, olive, orange, cedar, pomegranate, laurel, and myrtle, causes the constant appearance of spring, and forms a fine contrast with the summits of the Alps, in the background, covered with snow.\"\n\nNice, an ancient town of Asia, in Natolia, now called Nice, with a Greek archbishop's see.

See Creed.\n\nNicephorus Gregoras, a Greek historian, was born about the close of the 13th century, and flourished in the 14th, under the emperors Andronicus, John Palaeologus, and John Cantacuzenus. He was a great favourite of the elder Andronicus, who made him librarian of the church of Constantinople, and sent him Nicephorus, ambassador to the prince of Servia. He accompanied this emperor in his misfortunes, and assisted at his death; after which he repaired to the court of the younger Andronicus, where he seems to have been well received; and it is certain that, by his influence over the Greeks, that church was prevailed on to refuse entering into any conference with the legates of Pope John XXII. But in the dispute which arose between Barlaam and Palamos, taking the part of the former, he maintained it zealously in the council that was held at Constantinople in 1351, for which he was cast into prison, and continued there till the return of John Palaeologus, who released him; after which he held a disputation with Palamos, in the presence of that emperor. He compiled a history, which in 11 books contains all that passed from 1204, when Constantinople was taken by the French, to the death of Andronicus Palaeologus the younger, in 1341.\u2014The best edition of this work is that of the Louvre, in Greek and Latin, in 1792.\n\nNicephorus, Caliphus, a Greek historian, who flourished in the 14th century under the emperor Andronicus Palaeologus the elder, wrote an ecclesiastical history in 23 books; 18 of which are still extant, containing the transactions of the church from the birth of Christ to the death of the emperor Phocas in 610.\u2014We have nothing else but the arguments of the other five books, from the commencement of the reign of the emperor Heraclius, to the end of that of Leo the Philosopher, who died in the year 911. Nicephorus dedicated his history to Andronicus Palaeologus the elder. It was translated into Latin by John Langius; and has gone through several editions, the best of which is that of Paris, in 1630.\n\nNic\u00e9ron, John Francis, a French philosopher, was born at Paris in 1613. Having finished his academical studies, with a success which raised the greatest hopes of him, he entered into the order of the Minims, and took the habit in 1632; and, as is usual, he changed the name given him at his baptism for that of Francis, the name of his paternal uncle, who was also a Minim, or Franciscan. The inclination and taste which he had for mathematics appeared early. He began to apply himself to that science in his philosophical studies, and devoted to it all the time he could spare from his other employments, after he had completed his studies in theology. All the branches of the mathematics, however, did not equally engage his attention; he confined himself particularly to optics, and only learned of the rest as much as was necessary for rendering him perfect in this. There remain still, in several houses wherein he dwelt, especially at Paris, some excellent performances, which discover his skill in this way, and which make us regret that a longer life did not suffer him to carry it to that perfection which he desired; since one cannot help being surprized that he proceeded so far as he did, in the midst of those occupations and travels by which he was forced from it, during the short space of time which he lived. He hath himself observed, in the preface to his Thaumaturgus Opticus, that he went twice to Rome; and that, on his return home, he was appointed teacher of theology. He was afterwards chosen to accompany Father Francis de la Noue, vicar general of the order, in his visitation of the convents throughout all France. But the eagerness of\nof his passion for study put him upon making the best of all the moments he had to spare for books; and that wife economy furnished him with as much as satisfied him. Being taken sick at Aix in Provence, he died there Sept. 22. 1646, aged 33. He was an intimate acquaintance of Des Cartes. The following are his principal works: 1. L'Interpretation des chiffres, ou r\u00e8gles pour bien entendre et expliquer facilement toutes sortes des chiffres simples, &c. 2. La perspective curieuse, ou magie artificielle des effets merveilleux de l'optique, catoptrique, et dioptrique. This is only an essay to the following work: 3.

He was of an ancient and noble family, who were in very high repute about 1540. He studied with success in the Mazarine college at Paris, and afterwards at the college Du Plessis. In a short time, resolving to forsake the world, he consulted one of his uncles, who belonged to the order of Barnabite Jesuits. This uncle examined him; and, not dissident of his election, introduced him as a probationer to that society at Paris. He was received there in 1702, took the habit in 1703, and made his vows in 1704, at the age of 19.\n\nAfter he had professed himself, he was sent to Montargis, to go through a course of philosophy and theology; thence he went to Loches in Touraine to teach those sciences. He received the priesthood at Poitiers in 1708. As he was not arrived at the age to assume this order, a dispensation, which his uncommon piety had merited, was obtained in his favour. The college of Montargis having recalled him, he was their professor of rhetoric two years, and of philosophy four.\u2014In spite of all these avocations, he was humbly attentive to every call and work of charity, and to the instruction of his fellow creatures, many of whom heard him deliver out fit rules of conduct for them, not only from the pulpits of most of the churches within the province, but even from those of Paris.\u2014In 1716, his superiors invited him to that city, that he might have an opportunity of following, with the more convenience, those studies for which he always had expressed the greatest inclination. He not only understood the ancient but the modern languages; a circumstance of infinite advantage in the composition of those works which he has given to the public, and which he carried on with great assiduity to the time of his death, which happened, after a short illness, July 8. 1738, at the age of 53. His works are, 1.

His father was a barrister at law; and both his parents were of good families in Cornwall. After receiving the first rudiments of his education at a private school in the country, where his docility and sweetness of temper endeared him equally to his master and his school fellows, Frank was in a few years removed to Weyminster, and from thence to Oxford, where he was admitted a commoner (or sojourner) of Exeter college, under the tuition of Mr John Haviland, on March 4. 1714. There he applied himself diligently to all the usual academical studies, but particularly to natural philosophy and polite literature.\nNicholls literature, of which the fruits were most conspicuous in his subsequent lectures on physiology. After reading a few books on anatomy, in order to perfect himself in the nomenclature of the animal parts then adopted, he engaged in dissections, and then devoted himself to the study of nature, perfectly free and unbiased by the opinions of others.\n\nOn his being chosen reader of anatomy in that university, he employed his utmost attention to elevate and illustrate a science which had there been long depressed and neglected; and by quitting the beaten track of former lecturers, and minutely investigating the texture of every bowel, the nature and order of every vessel, &c. he gained a high and just reputation. He did not then reside at Oxford; but, when he had finished his lectures, used to repair to London, the place of his abode, where he had determined to settle. He had once an intention of fixing in Cornwall, and for a short time practised there with great reputation; but being soon tired of the fatigues attendant on that profession in the country, he returned to London, bringing back with him a great insight, acquired by diligent observation, into the nature of the miliary fever, which was attended with the most salutary effects in his subsequent practice at London.\n\nAbout this time he resolved to visit the continent, partly with a view of acquiring the knowledge of men, manners, and languages; but chiefly to acquaint himself with the opinions of foreign naturalists on his favourite study. At Paris, by conversing freely with the learned, he soon recommended himself to their notice and esteem. Windlow's was the only good system of physiology at that time known in France, and Morgagni's and Santorini's of Venice in Italy, which Dr Nicholls likewise soon after visited. On his return to England, he repeated his physiological lectures in London, which were much frequented, not only by students from both the universities, but also by many surgeons, apothecaries, and others. Soon after, his new and successful treatment of the miliary fever, then very prevalent in the southern parts of England, added much to his reputation. In 1725, at a meeting of the Royal Society, he gave his opinion on the nature of aneurysms, in which he differed from Dr Freind in his History of Physic.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1728, he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, to which he afterwards communicated the description of an uncommon disorder (published in the Transactions), viz. a polypus, resembling a branch of the pulmonary vein (for which Tulpus has strangely mistaken it), coughed up by an asthmatic person. He also made observations (in the same volume of the Transactions) on a treatise by M. Helvetius of Paris, on the Lungs. Towards the end of the year 1729, he took the degree of doctor of physic at Oxford. At his return to London, he underwent an examination by the president and censors of the College of Physicians, previous to his being admitted a candidate, which every practitioner must be a year before he can apply to be chosen a fellow. Dr Nicholls was chosen into the college on June 26, 1732; and two years after, being chosen Gulstonian reader of Pathology, he made the structure of the heart, and the circulation of the blood, the subject of his lectures. In 1736, at the request of the president, he again read the Gulstonian lecture; taking for his subject those parts of the human body which serve for the secretion and discharge of the urine; and the causes, symptoms, and cure of the diseases occasioned by the stone. In 1739, he delivered the anniversary Harveian oration. In 1743, he married Elizabeth, youngest daughter of the celebrated Dr Mead, by whom he had five children, two of whom died young. Two sons and a daughter survived him. In 1748, Dr Nicholls undertook the office of chirurgical lecturer, beginning with a learned and elegant dissertation on the Anima Medica. About this time, on the death of Dr John Cunningham, one of the elects of the college, Dr Abraham Hall was chosen to succeed him in preference to our author, who was his senior, without any apparent reason. With a just resentment, he immediately resigned the office of chirurgical lecturer, and never after attended the meetings of the fellows, except when business of the utmost importance was in agitation.\n\nIn 1751, he took some revenge in an anonymous pamphlet, entitled \"The petition of the Unborn Babes to the Censors of the Royal College of Physicians of London?\" in which Dr Nefit (Pocus), Dr Maule (Maulus), Dr Barrowby (Barboune), principally, and Sir William Brown, Sir Edward Hulfe, and the Scots incidentally, are the objects of his satire.\n\nIn 1753, on the death of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. in his 94th year, Dr Nicholls was appointed to succeed him as one of the king's physicians, and held that office till the death of his royal master in 1760; when this most skilful physician was superseded with something like the offer of a pension, which he rejected with disdain.\n\nThe causes, &c. of the uncommon disorder of which the late king died, viz. a rupture of the right ventricle of the heart, our author explained in a letter to the earl of Macclesfield, president of the Royal Society, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. I.\n\nIn 1772, to a second edition of his treatise De Anima Medica, he added a dissertation De motu cordis et sanguinis in homine nato et non nato, inscribed to his learned friend and coadjutor the late Dr Lawrence.\n\nTired at length of London, and also desirous of superintending the education of his son, he removed to Oxford, where he had spent most agreeably some years in his youth. But when the study of the law recalled Mr Nicholls to London, he took a house at Epsom, where he passed the remainder of his life in a literary retirement, not inattentive to natural philosophy, especially the cultivation of grain, and the improvement of barren soils, and contemplating also with admiration the internal nature of plants, as taught by Linnaeus.\n\nHis constitution never was robust. In his youth, at Oxford, he was with difficulty recovered from a dangerous fever by the skill of Doctors Frampton and Frewen; and afterwards at London he had frequently been afflicted with a catarrh, and an inveterate asthmatic cough, which, returning with great violence at the beginning of the year 1778, deprived the world of this valuable man on January 7th, in the 80th year of his age.\n\nDr Lawrence, formerly president of the college of physicians, who gratefully ascribed all his physiological and medical knowledge to his precepts, and who, while he\nNicias he lived, loved him as a brother, and revered him as a parent, two years after printed, and gave to his friends, a few copies of an elegant Latin Life of Dr Nicholls (with his head prefixed, a striking likeness, engraved by Hall from a model of Golfei, 1779); from which, through the medium of the Gentleman's Magazine, the above particulars are chiefly extracted.","sp":7,"ep":9},{"h":"NICIAS","t":"a celebrated painter of Athens, flourished about 322 years before the Christian era; and was universally extolled for the great variety and noble choice of his subjects, the force and relievo of his figures, his skill in the distribution of the lights and shades, and his dexterity in representing all sorts of four-footed animals, beyond any master of his time.

The largest of these islands is about 40 miles long and 15 broad, and the inhabitants are said to be a harmless sort of people, ready to supply the ships that stop there with provisions. The fourth end of the great Nicobar is placed in east longitude 94\u00b0 23' 30\"; and we collect from Mr Rennell's Memoir, that it is within the 12th degree of north latitude.\n\nOf the northernmost island, which is called Carnicobar, we have, in the second volume of the Asiatic Researches, some interesting information respecting both the produce and natural history of the country, and the manners of its inhabitants. The author of the memoir is Mr G. Hamilton, who, in his account of this island, says, \"It is low, of a round figure, about 40 miles in circumference, and appears at a distance as if entirely covered with trees; however, there are several well cleared and delightful spots upon it. The soil is a black kind of clay, and marshy. It produces in great abundance, and with little care, most of the tropical fruits, such as pine apples, plantains, papayas, cocoa-nuts, and areca-nuts; also excellent yams, and a root called cachu. The only four-footed animals upon the island are, hogs, dogs, large rats, and an animal of the lizard kind, but large, called by the natives tolongui; these frequently carry off fowls and chickens. The only kind of poultry are hens, and those not in great plenty. There is an abundance of snakes of many different kinds, and the inhabitants frequently die of their bites. The timber upon the island is of many sorts, in great plenty, and some of it remarkably large, affording excellent materials for building or repairing ships.\n\n\"The natives are low in stature, but very well made, and surprisingly active and strong; they are copper-coloured, and their features have a cast of the Malay, quite the reverse of elegant. The women in particular are extremely ugly. The men cut their hair short, and the women have their heads shaved quite bare, and wear no covering but a short petticoat, made of a sort of rush or dry grass, which reaches half way down the thigh. This grass is not interwoven, but hangs round the person something like the thatching of a house. Such of Nicobar. them as have received presents of cloth petticoats from the ships, commonly tie them round immediately under the arms. The men wear nothing but a narrow strip of cloth about the middle, in which they wrap up their privacies so tight that there hardly is any appearance of them. The ears of both sexes are pierced when young; and by squeezing into the holes large plugs of wood, or hanging heavy weights of shells, they contrive to render them wide, and disagreeable to look at. They are naturally disposed to be good humoured and gay, and are very fond of fitting at table with Europeans, where they eat everything that is set before them; and they eat most enormously. They do not care much for wine, but will drink bumpers of arrack as long as they can feel. A great part of their time is spent in feasting and dancing. When a feast is held at any village, every one that chooses goes uninvited, for they are utter strangers to ceremony. At those feasts they eat immense quantities of pork, which is their favourite food. Their hogs are remarkably fat, being fed upon the cocoa-nut kernel and sea water; indeed all their domestic animals, fowls, dogs, &c., are fed upon the same. They have likewise plenty of small sea fish, which they strike very dexterously with lances, wading into the sea about knee deep. They are sure of killing a very small fish at 10 or 12 yards distance. They eat the pork almost raw, giving it only a hasty grill over a quick fire. They roast a fowl, by running a piece of wood through it, by way of spit, and holding it over a brisk fire until the feathers are burnt off, when it is ready for eating, in their taste. They never drink water; only cocoa-nut milk, and a liquor called soura which oozes from the cocoa-nut tree after cutting off the young sprouts or flowers. This they suffer to ferment before it is used, and then it is intoxicating; to which quality they add much by their method of drinking it, by sucking it slowly through a small straw. After eating, the young men and women, who are fancifully dressed with leaves, go to dancing, and the old people surround them smoking tobacco and drinking soura. The dancers, while performing, sing some of their tunes, which are far from wanting harmony, and to which they keep exact time. Of musical instruments they have only one kind, and that the simplest. It is a hollow bamboo about two feet and a half long and three inches in diameter, along the outside of which there is stretched from end to end a single string made of the threads of a split cane, and the place under the string is hollowed a little to prevent it from touching. This instrument is played upon in the same manner as a guitar. It is capable of producing but few notes; the performer, however, makes it speak harmoniously, and generally accompanies it with the voice.\n\n\"Their houses are generally built upon the beach; in villages of 15 or 20 houses each; and each house contains a family of 20 persons and upwards. These habitations are raised upon wooden pillars about 10 feet from the ground; they are round, and, having no windows, are like bee-hives, covered with thatch. The entry is through a trap door below, where the family mount by a ladder, which is drawn up at night. This manner of building is intended to secure the houses from being infested with snakes and rats; and for that purpose the pillars are bound round with a smooth kind of leaf,\"\nleaf, which prevents animals from being able to mount; besides which, each pillar has a broad round flat piece of wood near the top of it, the projecting of which effectually prevents the further progress of such vermin as may have passed the leaf. The flooring is made with thin strips of bamboos, laid at such distances from one another as to leave free admittance for light and air; and the inside is neatly finished and decorated with fishing lances, nets, &c.\n\n\"The art of making cloth of any kind is quite unknown to the inhabitants of this island; what they have is got from the ships that come to trade in coconuts.\n\n\"They purchase a much larger quantity of cloth than is consumed upon their own island. This is intended for the Choury market. Choury is a small island to the southward of theirs, to which a large fleet of their boats sails every year about the month of November, to exchange cloth for canoes; for they cannot make these themselves. This voyage they perform by the help of the sun and stars, for they know nothing of the compass.\n\n\"In their disposition there are two remarkable qualities. One is their entire neglect of compliment and ceremony; and the other, their aversion to dishonesty. A Caribocobarian travelling to a distant village, upon business or amusement, passes through many towns in his way without speaking to any one; if he is hungry or tired, he goes into the nearest house, and helps himself to what he wants, and sits till he is fed, without taking the smallest notice of any of the family unless he has business or news to communicate. Theft or robbery is so very rare amongst them, that a man going out of his house never takes away his ladder or shuts his door, but leaves it open for any body to enter that pleases without the least apprehension of having anything stolen from him.\n\n\"Their intercourse with strangers is so frequent, that they have acquired in general the barbarous Portuguese so common over India; their own language has a sound quite different from most others, their words being pronounced with a kind of stop, or catch in the throat, at every syllable.\n\n\"They have no notion of a God, but they believe firmly in the devil, and worship him from fear. In every village there is a high pole erected with long strings of ground rattans hanging from it, which, it is said, has the virtue to keep him at a distance. When they see any signs of an approaching storm, they imagine that the devil intends them a visit, upon which many superstitious ceremonies are performed. The people of every village march round their own boundaries, and fix up at different distances small sticks split at the top, into which split they put a piece of cocoa-nut, a whip of tobacco, and the leaf of a certain plant; whether this is meant as a peace offering to the devil or a scarecrow to frighten him away, does not appear.\n\n\"When a man dies, all his live stock, cloth, hatchets, fishing lances, and in short every moveable thing he possessed, is buried with him, and his death is mourned by the whole village. In one view this is an excellent custom, seeing it prevents all disputes about the property of the deceased amongst his relations. His wife must conform to custom by having a joint cut off from one of her fingers; and if she refuses this, she must submit to have a deep notch cut in one of the pillars of her house.\n\n\"I was once present at the funeral of an old woman. When we went into the house which had belonged to the deceased, we found it full of her female relations; some of them were employed in wrapping up the corpse in leaves and cloth, and others tearing to pieces all the cloth which had belonged to her. In another house hard by, the men of the village with a great many others from the neighbouring towns, were fitting drinking jars and smoking tobacco. In the mean time two stout young fellows were busy digging a grave in the sand near the house. When the women had done with the corpse, they set up a most hideous howl, upon which the people began to assemble round the grave, and four men went up into the house to bring down the body; in doing this they were much interrupted by a young man, son to the deceased, who endeavoured with all his might to prevent them; but finding it in vain, he clung round the body, and was carried to the grave along with it; there, after a violent struggle, he was turned away and conducted back to the house. The corpse being now put into the grave, and the lashings which bound the legs and arms cut, all the live stock which had been the property of the deceased, consisting of about half a dozen hogs, and as many fowls, was killed, and hung in above it; a man then approached with a bunch of leaves stuck upon the end of a pole, which he swept two or three times gently along the corpse, and then the grave was filled up. During the ceremony, the women continued to make the most horrible vocal concert imaginable: the men said nothing. A few days afterwards, a kind of monument was erected over the grave, with a pole upon it, to which long strips of cloth of different colours were hung.\n\n\"Polygamy is not known among them; and their punishment of adultery is not less severe than effectual. They cut, from the man's offending member, a piece of the foreskin proportioned to the frequent commission or enormity of the crime.\n\n\"There seems to subsist among them a perfect equality. A few persons, from their age, have a little more respect paid to them; but there is no appearance of authority one over another. Their society seems bound rather by mutual obligations continually conferred and received; the simplest and best of all ties.\"\n\nIt is our wish to take all opportunities of laying before our readers every authentic fact which can throw light upon the philosophy of the human mind. In this narrative of Mr Hamilton's respecting the natives of Caribocobar, there is however one circumstance at which we stumble. It is known to the learned, that the philosophers of Greece and Rome, as well as the magi of Persia, admitted two self-existent beings, a good and an evil (see Polytheism); but we never before read of any people who had no notion of a God, and yet firmly believed in the devil. We could give instances of men worshipping the evil principle from fear, and neglecting the worship of the benevolent principle from a persuasion that he would do them all the good in his power without being bribed by sacrifices.\nNicodemus, critics and oblations; but this is the only instance of which we have ever heard, of a people, under the influence of religion, who had no notion of a God! As good as is least as apparent in the world as evil, it appears to us so very unnatural to admit an evil and deny a good principle, that we cannot help thinking that Mr Hamilton, from his ignorance of the language of Carnicobar, (which he acknowledges to be different from most others), has not a perfect acquaintance with the religious creed of the natives: and that they believe in a good as well as in an evil principle, though they worship only the latter, from a persuasion, that to adore the former could be of no advantage either to him or to themselves.\n\nNancowry or Soury, and Comerty, two other of the Nicobar islands, are said to be the best peopled, containing not less than 800 inhabitants. Between these islands there is a safe and spacious harbour. On the north point of Nancowry, within the harbour, the Danes have long retained a fixed settlement, protected by a sergeant and a few soldiers and slaves.","sp":9,"ep":11},{"h":"NICODEMUS","t":"a disciple of Jesus Christ, a Jew by nation, and by feet a Pharisee (John iii. 1. &c.) The Scripture calls him a ruler of the Jews, and our Saviour gives him the name of a master of Israel. When our Saviour began to manifest himself by his miracles at Jerusalem, at the first passover that he celebrated there after his baptism, Nicodemus made no doubt but that he was the Messiah, and came to him by night, that he might learn of him the way of salvation. Jesus told him, that no one could see the kingdom of heaven except he should be born again. Nicodemus taking this in the literal sense, made answer, \"How can a man that is old be born again?\" Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb?\" To which Jesus replied, \"If a man be not born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.\" Nicodemus asks him, \"How can these things be?\" Jesus answered, \"Are you a master of Israel, and are you ignorant of these things? We tell you what we know, and you receive not our testimony. If you believe not common things, and which may be called earthly, how will you believe me if I speak to you of heavenly things? Nobody has ascended into heaven but the Son of God, who came down from thence. And just as Moses lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up on high. For God so loved the world that he has given his only Son, so that no man who believes in him shall perish, but shall have eternal life.\"\n\nAfter this conversation Nicodemus became a disciple of Jesus Christ; and there is no doubt to be made, but he came to hear him as often as our Saviour came to Jerusalem. It happened on a time, that the priests and Pharisees had sent officers to seize Jesus (John vii. 45. &c.), who returning to them, made their report, that never man spoke as he did; to which the Pharisees replied, \"Are you also of his disciples? Is there any one of the elders or Pharisees that have believed in him?\" Then Nicodemus thought himself obliged to make answer, saying, \"Does the law permit us to condemn any one before he is heard?\" To which they replied, \"Are you also a Galilean? Read the Scriptures, and you will find that never any prophet came out of Galilee.\" After this the council was dismissed. At last Nicodemus declared himself openly a disciple of Jesus Christ (John xix. 39, 40.), when he came with Joseph of Arimathea to pay the last duties to the body of Christ, which they took down from the cross, embalmed, and laid in a sepulchre.\n\nWe are told, that Nicodemus received baptism from the disciples of Christ; but it is not mentioned whether before or after the passion of our Lord. It is added, that the Jews being informed of this, deposed him from his dignity of senator, excommunicated him, and drove him from Jerusalem; but that Gamaliel, who was his cousin-german, took him to his country house, and maintained him there till his death, when he had him buried honourably near St Stephen.

See BITHYNIA.\n\nNICOMEDES I. had no sooner taken possession of his father's throne, before Christ 270, than, according to the custom which has in all ages been too prevalent among the depots of the east, he caused two of his brothers to be put to death. The youngest, Zibaces, having saved himself by timely flight, landed on the coast of Bithynia, which was then known by the names of Thracia Thynica, and Thracia Asiatica, and there maintained a long war with his brother. Nicomedes being informed that Antiochus Soter, king of Syria, was making great preparations to attack him at the same time, called in the Gauls to his assistance; and on this occasion that people first passed into Asia\u2014Nicomedes having with their assistance repulsed Antiochus,\nNicomedes, thus, overcame his brother, and acquired the possession of all his father's dominions, bestowed upon them that part of Asia Minor which from them was called Gallo-Grecia, and Gallatia. Having now no enemies to contend with, he applied himself to the enlarging and adorning of the city of Aflacus, which he called after his own name Nicomedia. He had two wives, and by one of them he was persuaded to leave his kingdom to her son, in preference to his elder brothers; but when or how he died is not certainly known.\n\nNicomedes II., the grandson of the former, began his reign like him, by sacrificing his brothers to his jealousy, after having waded to the throne in the blood of Prusias his father. He assumed the name of Epiphanes, or \"the Illustrious,\" though he performed nothing worthy of this title, or even of notice, during the whole time of his long reign. He was succeeded by his son\u2014\n\nNicomedes III., named by antiphrasis, Philopater, because he had murdered his father to get possession of his crown. This monarch having entered into alliance with Mithridates the Great king of Pontus, invaded Paphlagonia; and having seized on that country, he attempted likewise to make himself master of Cappadocia. This country, however, was at that time subject to his powerful ally; who thereupon marching into Bithynia at the head of an army, drove Nicomedes from the throne, and raised his brother Socrates to it in his room. The dethroned prince had recourse to the Romans, who expelled the usurper, and restored him to his hereditary dominions. For this favour they preferred him, and at length prevailed upon him, contrary to his own inclination, and the opinion of his friends, to make incursions into the territories of Mithridates, with whom Rome wanted a subject of dispute. The king of Pontus bore for some time the devastations committed by Nicomedes with great patience, that he might not seem to be the aggressor; but at last he routed his army on the banks of the Amnus, drove him a second time from his dominions, and obliged him to seek for shelter in Paphlagonia, where he led a private life till the time of Sylla, who replaced him on the throne. He was succeeded by his son\u2014\n\nNicomedes IV., who performed nothing which the many writers who flourished in his time have thought worth transmitting to posterity. As he died without issue male, he left his kingdom by his last will to the Romans, who reduced it to the form of a province. Sallust, disagreeing with the ancients, tells us, that Nicomedes left a son named Mula or Myra; and introduces Mithridates as complaining of the Romans to Arsaces king of Parthia, for seizing on the kingdom of Bithynia, and excluding the son of a prince who had on all occasions shown himself a steady friend to their republic. But this Mula was the daughter and not the son of Nicomedes, as we are told in express terms by Suetonius, Velleius Paterculus, and Appian. All we know of her is, that upon the death of her father she claimed the kingdom of Bithynia for her son, as the next male heir to the crown, but without success; no motives of justice being of such weight with the ambitious Romans as to make them part with a kingdom.","sp":11,"ep":12},{"h":"NICOMEDIA","t":"in Ancient Geography, a metropolis of Bithynia, built by Nicomedes the grandfather of Prusias.

He received at the baptismal font the name of Nikita, which afterwards, when he became monk, he changed to Nicon, the appellation by which he is more generally known. He was educated in the convent of St Macarius, under the care of a monk. From the course of his studies, which were almost solely directed to the Holy Scriptures, and the exhortations of his preceptor, he imbibed at a very early period the strongest attachment to a monastic life; and was only prevented from following the bent of his mind by the persuasions and authority of his father. In conformity, however, to the wishes of his family, though contrary to his own inclination, he entered into matrimony; and, as that state precluded him from being admitted into a convent, he was ordained a secular priest. With his wife he continued ten years, partly in the country and partly at Moscow, officiating as a parish priest. The loss of three children, however, gave him a total disgust to the world; in consequence of which, his wife was persuaded to take the veil, and he became a monk; his retreat was in an island of the White sea, and a kind of ecclesiastical establishment was formed, as remarkable for the austerities of its rules as the situation was in its solitude. There were about 12 monks, but they all lived in different cells. Such a system, combined with the most gloomy ideas, occasioned so much cloistered pride as tarnished his character, when he was afterwards called up to fulfil the duties of a public and exalted station. Our limits do not permit us to be minute in our account of his life, we must therefore be contented with barely reciting general facts. Within less than the space of five years, Nicon was successively\nsuccessively created archimandrite, or abbot of the Novofpatkoi convent, archbishop of Novogorod, and patriarch of Ruffia. That he was worthy of these rapid promotions, few will doubt who are acquainted with his character; for he was possessed of very extraordinary qualities, such as even his enemies allow and admire. His courage was undaunted, his morals irreproachable, his charity extensive and exalted, his learning deep and comprehensive, and his eloquence commanding. When archbishop, he obtained the respect of the inhabitants by his unwearied affability in the discharge of his trust; and conciliated their affections by acts of unbounded charity: Nor was he less conspicuous in the discharge of the office of patriarch, to which dignity he was appointed in 1652, in the 39th year of his age.\n\nNor was he only distinguished in his own profession, for he shone even as a statesman. At length, however, he fell a victim to popular discontents; which misfortune, though he was far from deserving it, was certainly the effect of imprudence. He abdicated the office of patriarch, which would otherwise have been taken from him, in July 1658, and bore his reverse of fortune with heroic magnanimity: he returned to a cell, and commenced his former austeritys. His innocence, however, could not protect him from further malice: his enemies obtained him to be formally deposed in 1666. This degradation was followed by imprisonment, which was for some time very rigorous, because he, conscious of his own innocence, refused to accept pardon for crimes of which he was not guilty. In 1676, however, he was removed to the convent of St Cyril, and enjoyed perfect liberty.\n\nNicon survived his deposition 15 years. In 1681, he requested and obtained permission to return to the convent of Jerusalem, that he might end his days in that favourite spot; but he expired upon the road near Yaroslav, in the 66th year of his age.

See Botany Index.\u2014There are seven species, of which the most remarkable is the tabacum, or common tobacco plant. This was first discovered in America by the Spaniards about the year 1560, and by them imported into Europe. It had been used by the inhabitants of America long before; and was called by those of the islands yoli, and petun by the inhabitants of the continent. It was sent into Spain from Tabaco, a province of Yucatan, where it was first discovered, and from whence it takes its common name. Sir Walter Raleigh is generally said to have been the first that introduced it into England about the year 1585, and who taught his countrymen how to smoke it. Dr Cotton Mather, however, (in his Christian Philosopher) says, that in the above year one Mr Lane carried over some of it from Virginia, which was the first time it had ever been seen in Europe. Tobacco is commonly used among the oriental nations, though it is uncertain by whom it was introduced among them. Considerable quantities of it are cultivated in the Levant, on the coasts of Greece and the Archipelago, in Italy, and in the island of Malta.\n\nThere are two varieties of that species of nicotiana which is cultivated for common use, and which are distinguished by the names of Oronokoe, and sweet-scented tobacco. They differ from each other only in the figure of their leaves; those of the former being longer and narrower than the latter. They are tall herbaceous plants, growing erect with fine foliage, and rising with a strong stem from six to nine feet high. The stalk near the root, is upward of an inch diameter, and surrounded with a kind of hairy or velvet clammy substance, of a yellowish green colour. The leaves are rather of a deeper green, and grow alternately at the distance of two or three inches from each other. They are oblong, of a spear-shaped oval, and simple; the largest about 25 inches long, but decreasing in size as they ascend, till they come to be only 10 inches long, and about half as broad. The face of the leaves is much corrugated, like those of spinach when fully ripe. Before they come to maturity, when they are about five or six inches long, the leaves are generally of a full green, and rather smooth; but as they increase in size, they become rougher, and acquire a yellowish cast. The stem and branches are terminated by large bunches of flowers collected into clusters, of a delicate red; the edges, when full blown, inclining to a pale purple. They continue in succession till the end of the summer; when they are succeeded by seeds of a brown colour, and kidney-shaped. These are very small, each capsule containing about 1000; and the whole produce of a single plant is reckoned at about 35000. The seeds ripen in the month of September.\n\nMr Carver informs us, that the Oronokoe, or, as it is called, the long Virginian tobacco, is the kind best suited for bearing the rigour of a northern climate, the strength as well as the scent of the leaves being greater than that of the other. The sweet-scented sort flourishes most in a sandy soil, and in a warm climate,\nNicotiana where it greatly exceeds the former in the celerity of its growth; and is likewise, as its name intimates, much more mild and pleasant.\n\nCulture.\u2014Tobacco thrives best in a warm, kindly, rich soil, that is not subject to be overrun by weeds. In Virginia, the soil in which it thrives best is warm, light, and inclining to be sandy; and therefore, if the plant is to be cultivated in Britain, it ought to be planted in a soil as nearly of the same kind as possible. Other kinds of soil might probably be brought to suit it, by a mixture of proper manure; but we must remember, that whatever manure is made use of, must be thoroughly incorporated with the soil. The best situation for a tobacco plantation is the southern declivity of a hill, rather gradual than abrupt, or a spot that is sheltered from the north winds: but at the same time it is necessary that the plants enjoy a free air; for without that they will not prosper.\n\nAs tobacco is an annual plant, those who intend to cultivate it ought to be as careful as possible in the choice of the seeds; in which, however, with all their care, they may be sometimes deceived. The seeds are to be sown about the middle of April, or rather sooner in a forward season, in a bed prepared for this purpose of such soil as has been already described, mixed with some warm rich manure. In a cold spring, hot beds are most eligible for this purpose, and gardeners imagine that they are always necessary: but Mr Carver tells us, that he is convinced, when the weather is not very severe, the tobacco seeds may be raised without doors; and for this purpose gives us the following directions.\n\n\"Having sown the seed in the manner above directed, on the least apprehension of a frost after the plants appear, it will be necessary to spread mats over the beds, a little elevated from the ground by poles laid across, that they may not be crushed. These, however, must be removed in the morning, soon after the sun appears, that they may receive as much benefit as possible from its warmth and from the air. In this manner proceed till the leaves have attained about two inches in length and one in breadth; which they will do in about a month after they are sown, or near the middle of May, when the frosts are usually at an end. One invariable rule for their being able to bear removal is, when the fourth leaf is sprouted, and the fifth just appears. Then take the opportunity of the first rains or gentle showers to transplant them into such a soil and situation as before described; which must be done in the following manner.\u2014The land must be ploughed, or dug up with spades, and made as mellow and light as possible. When the plants are to be placed, raise with the hot small hillocks at the distance of two feet or a little more from each other, taking care that no hard spots or lumps are in it; and then just indent the middle of each, without drilling holes, as for some other plants.\n\n\"When your ground is thus prepared, dig in a gentle manner from their native bed such plants as have attained the proper growth for transplanting above-mentioned; and drop, as you pass, one on every hillock. Insert a plant gently into each centre, pressing the soil around gently with your fingers; and taking the greatest care, during the operation, that you do not break off any of the leaves, which are at this time exquisitely tender. If the weather proves dry Nicotiana, after they are thus transplanted, they must be watered with soft water, in the same manner as is usually done to coleworts, or plants of a similar kind. But though you now seem to have a sufficient quantity of plants for the space you intend to cultivate, it is yet necessary that you continue to attend to your bed of seedlings, that you may have enough to supply any deficiencies which through accident may arise. From this time great care must be taken to keep the ground soft and free from weeds, by often stirring with your hoe the mould round the roots; and to prune off the dead leaves that sometimes are found near the bottom of the stalks.\n\n\"The difference of this climate from that in which I have been accustomed to observe the progress of this plant, will not permit me to direct with certainty the time which is most proper to take off the top of it, to prevent it from running to seed. This knowledge can only be acquired by experience. When it has risen to the height of more than two feet, it commonly begins to put forth the branches on which the flowers and seeds are produced; but as this expansion, if suffered to take place, would drain the nutriment from the leaves, which are the most valuable part, and thereby lessen their size and efficacy, it becomes needful at this stage to nip off the extremity of the stalk to prevent its growing higher. In some other climates, the top is commonly cut off when the plant has fifteen leaves; but if the tobacco is intended to be a little stronger than usual, this is done when it has only thirteen; and sometimes, when it is designed to be remarkably powerful, eleven or twelve are only allowed to expand. On the contrary, if the planter is desirous of having his crop very mild, he suffers it to put forth eighteen or twenty: but in this calculation, the three or four lower leaves next the ground, which do not grow so large and fine as the others, are not to be reckoned.\n\n\"This operation, denominated topping the tobacco, is much better performed by the finger and thumb than with any instrument; because the grasp of the fingers closes the pores of the plant; whereas, when it is done by instruments, the juices are in some degree exhausted. Care must also be taken to nip off the sprouts that will be continually springing up at the junction of the leaves with the stalks. This is termed succouring, or suckering, the tobacco; and ought to be repeated as often as occasion requires.\n\n\"As it is impossible to ascertain the due time for topping the plant, so it is equally impossible, without experiment, to ascertain the time it will take to ripen in this country. The apparent signs of its maturity are these: The leaves, as they approach a state of ripeness, become more corrugated or rough; and when fully ripe, appear mottled with yellowish spots on the raised parts; whilst the cavities retain their usual green colour. They are at this time also thicker than they have been before; and are covered with a downy velvet, like that formerly mentioned, on the stalks. If heavy rains happen at this critical period, they will wash off this excrement substance, and thereby damage the plants. In this case, if the frothy nights are not begun, it is proper to let them stand a few days longer; when, if the weather be moderate, they will recover this substance again. But if a frost unexpectedly happens during\nNicotiana. ring the night, they must be carefully examined in the morning, before the sun has any influence upon them; and those which are found to be covered with frothy particles, whether thoroughly ripe or not, must be cut up; for though they may not all appear to be arrived at a state of maturity, yet they cannot be far from it, and will differ but little in goodness from those that are perfectly so.\n\nTobacco is subject to be destroyed by a worm; and without proper care to exterminate this enemy, a whole field of plants may soon be lost. This animal is of the horned species, and appears to be peculiar to the tobacco plant; so that in many parts of America it is distinguished by the name of the tobacco worm. In what manner it is first produced, or how propagated, is unknown; but it is not discernible till the plants have attained about half their height; and then appears to be nearly as large as a gnat. Soon after this it lengthens into a worm; and by degrees increases in magnitude to the bigness of a man's finger. In shape it is regular from its head to its tail, without any diminution at either extremity. It is indented or ribbed round at equal distances, nearly a quarter of an inch from each other; and having at every one of these divisions a pair of feet or claws, by which it fastens itself to the plant. Its mouth, like that of the caterpillar, is placed under the fore part of the head. On the top of the head, between the eyes, grows a horn about half an inch long, and greatly resembling a thorn; the extreme part of which is of a brown colour, a firm texture, and the extremity sharp pointed. It is easily crushed; being only, to appearance, a collection of green juice enclosed in a membranaceous covering, without the internal parts of an animated being. The colour of its skin is in general green, intermixed with several spots of a yellowish white; and the whole covered with a short hair scarcely be discerned. These worms are found the most predominant during the latter end of July and the beginning of August; at which time the plants must be particularly attended to, and every leaf carefully searched. As soon as a wound is discovered, and it will not be long before it is perceptible, care must be taken to destroy the cause of it, which will be found near it, and from its unsubstantial texture may easily be crushed; but the best method is to pull it away by the horn, and then crush it.\n\nWhen the tobacco is fit for being gathered, as will appear from an attention to the foregoing directions, on the first morning that promises a fair day, before the sun is risen, take an axe or a long knife, and holding the stalk near the top with one hand, fever it from its root with the other, as low as possible. Lay it gently on the ground, taking care not to break off the leaves, and there let it remain exposed to the rays of the sun throughout the day, or until the leaves, according to the American expression, are entirely wilted: that is, till they become limber, and will bend any way without breaking. But if the weather should prove rainy without any intervals of sunshine, and the plants appear to be fully ripe, they must be housed immediately. This must be done, however, with great care, that the leaves, which are in this state very brittle, may not be broken. They are next to be placed under proper shelter, either in a barn or covered hovel, where they cannot be affected by rain or too much air, thinly scattered on the floor; and if the sun does not appear for several days, they must be left to wilt in that manner; but in this case the quality of the tobacco will not be quite so good.\n\nWhen the leaves have acquired the above-mentioned flexibility, the plants must be laid in heaps, or rather in one heap if the quantity is not too great, and in about 24 hours they will be found to sweat. But during this time, when they have lain for a little while, and begin to ferment, it will be necessary to turn them; bringing those which are in the middle to the surface, and placing those which are at the surface in the middle. The longer they lie in this situation, the darker coloured is the tobacco; and this is termed sweating the tobacco. After they have lain in this manner for three or four days, (for a longer continuance might make the plants turn mouldy), they may be fastened together in pairs with cords or wooden pegs, near the bottom of the stalk, and hung across a pole, with the leaves suspended in the same covered place, a proper interval being left between each pair. In about a month the leaves will be thoroughly dried, and of a proper temperature to be taken down. This state may be ascertained by their appearing of the same colour with those imported from America. But this can be done only in wet weather.\u2014The tobacco is exceedingly apt to attract the humidity of the atmosphere, which gives it a pliability that is absolutely necessary for its preservation; for if the plants are removed in a very dry season, the external parts of the leaves will crumble into dust, and a considerable waste will ensue.\n\nCure. As soon as the plants are taken down, they must again be laid in a heap, and pressed with heavy logs of wood for about a week; but this climate may possibly require a longer time. While they remain in this state, it will be necessary to introduce your hand frequently into the heap, to discover whether the heat be not too intense; for in large quantities this will sometimes be the case, and considerable damage will be occasioned by it. When they are found to heat too much, that is, when the heat exceeds a moderate glowing warmth, part of the weight by which they are pressed must be taken away; and the cause being removed, the effect will cease. This is called the second or last sweating; and, when completed, which it generally will be about the time just mentioned, the leaves must be stripped from the stalks for use. Many omit this last sweating; but Mr Carver thinks that it takes away any remaining harshness, and renders the tobacco more mellow. The strength of the stalk also is diffused by it through the leaves, and the whole mass becomes equally meliorated.\u2014When the leaves are stripped from the stalks, they are to be tied up in bunches or hands, and kept in a cellar or other damp place; though if not handled in dry weather but only during a rainy season, it is of little consequence in what part of the house or barn they are laid up. At this period the tobacco is thoroughly cured, and as proper for manufacturing as that imported from the colonies.\n\nOur author advises the tobacco planter, in his first trials, not to be too avaricious, but to top his plants before they have gained their utmost height: leaving only about the middle quantity of leaves directed before to give it a tolerable degree of strength. For though\nNicotiana this, if excessive, might be abated during the cure by an increase of sweating, or be remedied the next season by suffering more leaves to grow; it can never be added; and, without a certain degree of strength, the tobacco will always be tasteless and of little value. On the contrary, though it be ever so much weakened by sweating, and thereby rendered mild, yet it will never lose the aromatic flavour, which accompanied that strength, and which greatly adds to its value. A square yard of land, he tells us, will rear about 500 plants, and allow proper space for their nurture till they are fit for transplanting.\n\nThe following extract, which is copied from a manuscript of Dr Barham (A), for directing the raising, cultivating, and curing tobacco in Jamaica, is perhaps worthy of the attention of those who wish to be further acquainted with this subject.\n\n\"Let the ground or woodland wherein you intend planting tobacco be well burned, as the greater the quantity of wood ashes the better. The spot you intend raising your plants on must be well freed with ashes, laid smooth and light: then blow the feed from the palm of your hand gently on the bed, and cover it over with palm or plantain leaves.\n\n\"When your plants are about four inches high, draw them and plant them out about three feet under; and when they become as high as your knee; cut or pluck off the top; and if there are more than 12 leaves on the plant, take off the overplus, and leave the rest entire.\n\n\"The plant should now be daily attended to, in order to destroy the caterpillars that are liable to infest it; as also to take off every sprout or sucker that puts out at the joints, in order to throw the whole vegetable nourishment into the large leaves.\n\n\"When the edges and points of the leaves begin to turn a little yellow, cut down the stalks about ten o'clock in the morning, taking the opportunity of a fine day, and be careful the dew is fully off the plant, and do not continue this work after two in the afternoon. As fast as it is cut let it be carried into your tobacco house, which must be so close as to shut out all air, (on this much depends), and hung up on lines tied across, for the purpose of drying.\n\n\"When the stalks begin to turn brownish, take them off the lines, and put them in a large bin, and lay on them heavy weights for 12 days; then take them out, and strip off the leaves, and put them again into the bin, and let them be well pressed, and so as no air gains admission for a month. Take them out; tie them in bundles about 60 leaves in each, which are called monocoes; and are ready for sale. But observe to let them always be kept close till you have occasion to dispose of them.\n\n\"Let your curing house be well built, and very close and warm; if a boarded building, it will not be amiss, in a wet situation, to cover the whole outside with thatch and plantain straw, to keep off the damps; for by this care you preserve the fine volatile oil in the leaves. Observe, no smoke is to be made use of or admitted into your curing house.\"\n\nFor an account of the medical effects of tobacco. See Materia Medica Index.\n\nThe most common uses of this plant, are either as a stimulantary when taken by way of snuff, as a masticatory by chewing it in the mouth, or as effluvia by smoking it; and when taken in moderation, it is not an unhealthful amusement. Before pipes were invented, it was usually smoked in segars, and they are still in use among some of the southern nations. The method of preparing these is at once simple and expeditious. A leaf of tobacco being formed into a small twisted roll, somewhat larger than the item of a pipe, and about eight inches long, the smoke is conveyed through the winding folds which prevent it from expanding, as through a tube; so that one end of it being lighted, and the other applied to the mouth, it is in this form used without much inconvenience. But, in process of time, pipes being invented, they were found more commodious vehicles for the smoke, and are now in general use.\n\nAmong all the productions of foreign climes introduced into these kingdoms, scarce any has been held in higher estimation by persons of every rank than tobacco. In the countries of which it is a native, it is considered by the Indians as the most valuable offering that can be made to the beings they worship. They use it in all their civil and religious ceremonies. When once the spiral wreaths of its smoke ascend from the feathered pipe of peace, the compact that has been just made is considered as sacred and inviolable. Likewise, when they address their great Father, or his guardian spirits, residing, as they believe, in every extraordinary production of nature, they make liberal offerings to them of this valuable plant, not doubting but that they are thus secured of protection.\n\nTobacco is made up into rolls by the inhabitants of the interior parts of America, by means of a machine called a tobacco wheel. With this machine they spin the leaves after they are cured, into a twist of any size they think fit; and having folded it into rolls of about 20 pounds each, they lay it by for use. In this state it will keep for several years, and be continually improving, as it always grows milder. The Illinois usually form it into carrots; which is done by laying a number of leaves, when cured, on each other after the ribs have been taken out, and rolling them round with pack-thread, till they become cemented together. These rolls commonly measure about 18 or 20 inches in length, and nine round in the middle part.\n\nTobacco forms a very considerable article in commerce; for an account of which see the articles Glasgow and Virginia.\n\nNictitating Membrane, a thin membrane chiefly found in the bird and fish kind, which covers the eyes of these animals, sheltering them from the dust or too much light; yet is so thin and pellucid, that they can see pretty well through it.\n\n(A) This gentleman was contemporary with Sir Hans Sloane.

At the death of Pertinax he was declared emperor of Rome; and his claims to that elevated station were supported by a sound understanding, prudence of mind, moderation, courage, and virtue. He proposed to imitate the actions of the venerable Antoninus, of Trajan, of Titus, and M. Aurelius. He was remarkable for his fondness of ancient discipline. He never suffered his soldiers to drink wine, but obliged them when thirsty to use water and vinegar. He forbade the use of silver or gold utensils in his camp. All the bakers and cooks were driven away, and the soldiers were ordered to live during the expedition they undertook merely upon biscuits. In his punishments Niger was inexorable: he condemned ten of his soldiers to be beheaded in the presence of the army because they had stolen and eaten a fowl. The sentence was heard with groans. The army interfered; and when Niger consented to diminish the punishment, for fear of kindling rebellion, he yet ordered the criminals to make each a restoration of ten fowls to the person whose property they had stolen. They were besides ordered not to light a fire the rest of the campaign, but to live upon cold aliments and to drink nothing but water. Such great qualifications in a general seemed to promise the restoration of ancient discipline in the Roman armies; but the death of Niger frustrated every hope of reform. Severus, who had also been invested with the imperial purple, marched against him: some battles were fought, and Niger was at last defeated, A.D. 195.

The source of the Niger is supposed to be in that mountainous region in western Africa, which gives origin to the rivers Gambia and Senegal, which discharge their waters into the Western ocean, while the Niger rising from the opposite side of the mountains, takes an easterly direction.

The Niger is called Joliba by the natives.","sp":17,"ep":17},{"h":"NIGHT","t":"that part of the natural day during which the sun is underneath the horizon; or that space wherein it is dark.\n\nNight was originally divided by the Hebrews and other eastern nations into three parts or watches. The Romans, and after them the Jews, divided the night into four parts or watches; the first of which began at sunset, and lasted till nine at night, according to our way of reckoning; the second lasted till midnight.\nNight; the third till three in the morning; and the fourth ended at sunrise. The ancient Gauls and Germans divided their time not by days but by nights; and the people of Iceland and the Arabs do the same at this day. The like is observed of the Anglo-Saxons.\u2014The length and shortness of night or of darkness is according to the season of the year and position of the place; and the causes of this variety are now well known. See Astronomy, &c.\n\nNight, in scripture language, is used for the times of heathenish ignorance and profaneness (Rom. xiii. 12); for adversity and affliction (H. xxi. 12); and, lastly, for death (John ix. 4).\n\nNight Angling, a method of catching large and shy fish in the night-time. Trout, and many other of the better sorts of fish, are naturally shy and fearful; they therefore prey in the night as the securest time.\u2014The method of taking them on this plan is as follows: The tackle must be strong, and need not be so fine as for day fishing, when every thing is seen; the hook must be baited with a large earth worm, or a black snail, and thrown out into the river; there must be no lead to the line, so that the bait may not sink, but be kept dawdling along, upon or near the surface. Whatever trout is near the place will be brought thither by the motion of the water, and will seize the worm or snail. The angler will be alarmed by the noise which the fish makes in rising, and must give him line, and time to swallow the hook; then a flight touch secures him. The best and largest trouts are found to bite thus in the night; and they rise mostly in the still and clear deeps, not in the swift and shallow currents. Sometimes, though there are fish about the place, they will not rise at the bait: in this case the angler must put on some lead to his line, and sink it to the bottom.\n\nNight Mare, or Incubus. See Medicine, No. 329.\n\nNight Walkers. See Medicine, No. 329, and Noctambull.\n\nNight Walkers, in Law, are such persons as sleep by day and walk by night, being oftentimes pilferers or disturbers of the public peace. Constables are authorized by the common law to arrest night-walkers and suspicious persons, &c. Watchmen may also arrest night-walkers, and hold them until the morning; and it is said, that a private person may arrest any suspicious night-walker, and detain him till he give a good account of himself. One may be bound to the good behaviour for being a night-walker; and common night-walkers, or haunters of bawdy-houses, are to be indicted before justices of peace, &c. But it is not held lawful for a constable, &c., to take up any woman as a night-walker on bare suspicion only of being of ill fame, unless she be guilty of a breach of the peace, or some unlawful act, and ought to be found misdoing.\n\nNightingale, a species of motacilla.

It is said, that a large glass of warm vinegar, taken as soon as possible after eating the berries, will prevent their bad effects.\n\nNight Watching, a practice of very remote antiquity, which belongs to the oldest regulations of police. So early as the time of Solomon we find mention made of watching it, and likewise in the Psalms of David. Sentinels were stationed in different places in Athens and other cities of Greece, and they were kept to their duty by the vigilance of the Thesmophore. There were also vet. i. Palaestra nocturni in the city of Rome, as appears from the commentaries of Heubach on the police of the Romans. It appears, however, that the design of these institutions was rather the prevention of fires, than the guarding against alarms or dangers by night, although attention was likewise paid to these in process of time. The apprehension of fires was the pretext of Augustus, when he wished to strengthen the night-watch for suppressing nocturnal commotions.\n\nIt does not appear that calling out the hours became an established practice before the erection of city gates, and probably had its rise in Germany; yet it would have been attended with advantages in ancient Rome, where there were no public clocks, nor anything in private houses to indicate the hours. The periods for soldiers to mount guard were determined by water-clocks; at the end of each hour they blew a horn, and by means of this signal each individual might ascertain the hour of the night. It seems evident, however, that these regulations were only attended to in time of war.\n\nIn the city of Paris, night-watching was established, as at Rome, in the very commencement of its monarchy; and De la Mare quotes the ordinances of Clothaire II. upon this subject, in the year 595. The citizens at first kept watch in rotation; but this practice was afterwards set aside, and, by the payment of a certain sum of money, a permanent watch was established. In the opinion of the learned and indefatigable Beckmann, the establishment of single watchmen, to call out the hours through the streets, is peculiar to Germany, and only copied by surrounding nations in more modern times. The elector, John George, in 1588, appointed watchmen at Berlin; and Mabillon describes it as a practice peculiar to that country. Horns are made use of by watchmen in some places, and rattles in others, the former being most proper for villages, and the latter for cities.\n\nThe Chinese, so early as the ninth century, had watchmen posted on their towers, who announced the hours both by day and night, by striking forcibly on a suspended board, which in that country is said to be in use to the present period; and at Peterburgh, in Russia, the watchmen employ a suspended plate of iron for a similar purpose. In this manner also Christians are assembled together in the Levant, for the purpose of attending divine service; and monks were thus awakened in monasteries at the most early periods, to attend to the proper hours of prayer.\n\nWe find mention made of firepole-watchmen in Germany in the 14th century. In the year 1563, a church-tower was erected in Leipzig, and an apartment built in it for a permanent watchman, who was obliged to proclaim the hours every time the clock struck. Permanent watchmen were kept in many of the steeples at Ulm in the 15th century. The same thing was practised at Frankfort on the Main, at Oettingen, and many other places; and Montaigne was astonished at finding a man on the steeple of Constance, who kept watch.","sp":17,"ep":18},{"h":"NIGIDUS FIGULUS","t":"PUBLIUS, one of the most learned men of ancient Rome, flourished at the same time with Cicero.

This problem has been solved by James Bruce, Esq. of Kinmaird, in Scotland; who spent several years at the court of Abyssinia, and by the favour of the emperor and great people of the country was enabled to accomplish the arduous task.\n\nIn the account of his travels, this gentleman has been at particular pains to show, that none of those who undertook this task ever succeeded in it but himself. The inquiry concerning its springs, he says, began either before history or tradition, and is by some supposed to be the origin of hieroglyphics. Though Egypt was the country which received the greatest benefit from this river, it was not there that the inquiries concerning its inundation began: it being probable that everything relative to the extent and periodical time of that inundation would be accurately settled (which could not be done but by a long series of observations) before any person would venture to build houses within its reach.\n\nThe philosophers of Meroe, in our author's opinion, were the first who undertook to make a number of observations sufficient to determine these points; their country being so situated, that they could perceive everything relative to the increase or decrease of the river without any danger from its overflowing. Being much addicted to astronomy, it could not long escape them, that the heliacal rising of the dog-star was a signal for Egypt to prepare for the inundation; without which it was vain to expect any crop. The connection of this celestial sign with the annual rising of the river would undoubtedly soon become a matter of curiosity; and as this could not easily be discovered, it was natural for an ignorant and superstitious people to ascribe the whole to the action of the dog-star as a deity. Still, however, by those who were more enlightened, the phenomenon would be ascribed to natural causes; and a great step towards the discovery of these, undoubtedly was that of the sources of the river itself. In the early ages, when travelling into foreign countries was impracticable by private persons, the inquiry into the sources of the Nile became an object to the greatest monarchs. Scopelis is said to have preferred the honour of discovering them almost to all the victories he obtained. Alexander the Great is well known to have had a great curiosity to discover these fountains. On his arrival at the temple of Jupiter Ammon, he is said to have made inquiry concerning the fountains of the Nile, even before he asked about his own descent from Jupiter. The priests are said to have given him proper directions for finding them; and Alexander took the most ready means of accomplishing his purpose, by employing natives of Ethiopia to make the search. These discoverers, in the opinion of Mr Bruce, missed their aim, by reason of the turn which the Nile takes to the east in the latitude of 9\u00b0 where it begins to surround the kingdom of Gojam; but which they might imagine to be only a winding of the river soon to be compensated by an equal turn to the west. \"They therefore (says he) continued their journey south till near the line, and never saw it more; as they could have no possible notion it had turned back behind them, and that they had left it as far north as latitude 9\u00b0.\" They reported then to Alexander, what was truth, that they had ascended the Nile, as far south as latitude 9\u00b0; where it unexpectedly took its course to the east, and was seen no more. The river was not known, nor to be heard of near the line, or farther southward, nor was it diminished in size, nor had it given any symptom that they were near its source; they had found the Nile calentem (warm), while they expected its rise among melting snows.\n\nMr Bruce is of opinion that this turn of the Nile to the eastward was the occasion of Alexander's extravagant mistake, in supposing that he had discovered the fountains of the Nile when he was near the source of the Indus; and which he wrote to his mother, though he afterwards caused it to be erased from his books.\n\nPtolemy Philadelphus succeeded Alexander in his attempt to discover the source of the Nile; but he likewise proving unsuccessful, the task was next undertaken by Ptolemy Euergetes, the most powerful of the Greek princes who sat on the throne of Egypt. \"In this (says Mr Bruce) he had probably succeeded, had he not mistaken the river itself. He supposed the Siris, now the Tacazz\u00e9, to be the Nile; and ascending in the direction of its stream, he came to Axum, the capital of Sire and of Ethiopia. But the story he tells of the snow which he found knee-deep on the mountains of Samen, makes me question whether he ever crossed the Siris, or was himself an ocular witness of what he says he observed there.\"\n\nCaesar had the same curiosity with other conquerors to visit the springs of the Nile, though his situation did not allow him to make any attempt for that purpose. Nero, however, was more active. He sent two centuries into Ethiopia, with orders to explore the unknown fountains of this river; but they returned without having accomplished their errand. They reported, that after having gone a long way, they came to a king of Ethiopia, who furnished them with necessaries, and recommendations to some other kingdoms adjacent; passing which, they came to immense lakes, of which nobody knew the end, nor could they ever hope to find it. Their story, however, is by Mr Bruce supposed to be a fiction;\nNo other attempt was made by the ancients to discover the sources of this celebrated river; and the matter was looked upon to be an impossibility, insomuch that caput Nili quereere became a proverb, denoting the impossibility of any undertaking. The first who, in more modern ages, made any attempt of this kind, was a monk sent into Abyssinia in the year 522, by Nomofus, ambassador from the emperor Justin. This monk is called Cosmas the Hermit, and likewise Indoplatytes, from his supposed travels into India. He proceeded as far as the city of Axum, but did not visit that part of the country where the head of the Nile lies; nor, in Mr Bruce's opinion, would it have been practicable for him to do so. The discovery, however, is said to have been made at last by Peter Paez the missionary. But the truth of this account is denied by Mr Bruce, for the following reasons:\n\n1. \"No relation of this kind (says he) was to be found in three copies of Peter Paez's history, to which I had access when in Italy, on my return home. One of these copies I saw at Milan; and, by the interest of friends, had an opportunity of perusing it at my leisure. The other two were at Bologna and Rome. I ran through them rapidly; attending only to the place where the description ought to have been, and where I did not find it: but having copied the first and last page of the Milan manuscript, and comparing them with the two last mentioned, I found that all the three were, word for word, the same, and none of them contained one syllable of the discovery of the source.\"\n\n2. Alphonso Mendez came into Abyssinia about a year after Paez's death. New and desirable as that discovery must have been to himself, to the pope, king of Spain, and all his great patrons in Portugal and Italy; though he wrote the history of the country, and of the particulars concerning the mission in great detail and with good judgement, yet he never mentions this journey of Peter Paez, though it probably must have been conveyed to Rome and Portugal after his inspection and under his authority.\n\n3. Balthazar Tellez, a learned Jesuit, has wrote two volumes in folio, with great candour and impartiality, considering the spirit of those times; and he declares his work to be compiled from those of Alphonso Mendez the patriarch, from the two volumes of Peter Paez, as well as from the regular reports made by the individuals of the company in some places, and by the provincial letters in others; to all which he had complete access, as also to the annual reports of Peter Paez, among the rest from 1598 to 1622; yet Tellez makes no mention of such a discovery, though he is very particular as to the merit of each missionary during the long reign of Facilidias, which occupies more than half the two volumes.\"\n\nThe first, and indeed the only account of the fountains of the Nile, published before that of Mr Bruce, was Kircher's; who says that he took it from the writings of Peter Paez. The time when the discovery is said to have been made was the 21st of April 1618; at which season the rains are begun, and therefore very wholesome; so that the Abyssinian armies are not without extreme necessity in the field; between September and February at farthest is the time they are abroad from the capital and in action.\n\n\"The river (says Kircher) at this day, by the Ethiopians, is called Abay; it rises in the kingdom of Gojam, in a territory called Sabala, whose inhabitants are called Agoua. The source of the Nile is situated in the west part of Gojam, in the highest part of a valley, which resembles a great plain on every side surrounded by high mountains. On the 21st of April 1618, being here, together with the king and his army, I ascended the place, and observed everything with great attention: I discovered first two round fountains each about four palms in diameter, and saw, with the greatest delight, what neither Cyrus the Persian, nor Cambyses, nor Alexander the Great, nor the famous Julius Caesar, could ever discover. The two openings of these fountains have no issue in the plain on the top of the mountain, but flow from the root of it. The second fountain lies about a stone's cast west from the former: the inhabitants say that this whole mountain is full of water; and add, that the whole plain about the fountain is floating and unsteady, a certain mark that there is water concealed under it; for which reason the water does not overflow at the fountain, but forces itself with great violence out at the foot of the mountain. The inhabitants together with the emperor, who was then present with his army, maintain, that that year it trembled very little on account of the drought; but in other years, that it trembled and overflowed so that it could scarce be approached without danger. The breadth of the circumference may be about the cast of a sling: below the top of this mountain the people live about a league distant from the fountain to the west; and this place is called Geeth; and the fountain seems to be about a cannon-shot distant from Geeth; moreover the field where the fountain is, is on all sides difficult of access, except on the north side, where it may be ascended with ease.\"\n\nOn this relation Mr Bruce observes, that there is no such place as Sabala; it ought to have been named Sacala, signifying the highest ridge of land, where the water falls equally down on both sides, from east and west, or from north and south. So the sharp roofs of our houses, where the water runs down equally on the opposite sides, are called by the same name. Other objections are drawn from the situation of places, and from the number and situation of the fountains themselves, every one of which Mr Bruce found by actual menuration to be different from Kircher's account. The following, however, he looks upon to be decisive that Paez never was on the spot. He says, \"the field in which the fountains of the Nile are, is of very difficult access; the ascent to it being very steep, excepting on the north, where it is plain and easy. Now, if we look at the beginning of this description, we should think it would be the descent, not the ascent, that would be troublesome; for the fountains were placed in a valley, and people rather descend into valleys than ascend into them; but supposing it was a valley in which there was a field upon which there was a mountain, and on the mountain these fountains; still, I say, that these mountains are nearly inaccessible on the three sides; but that the most difficult of them all is the north, the way we ascend from the plain of Goutto. From the east, by Sacala, the ascent is made from the valley of Litchambara, and from the plain of Afloa to the south you have the almost perpendicular craggy cliff of Geeth, covered with thorny\nthorny bushes, and bamboos, which cover the mouths of the caverns; and on the north you have the mountains of Aformalha, thick set with all sorts of thorny trees and shrubs, especially with the kantufia; these thickets are, moreover, filled with wild beasts, especially huge, long-haired baboons, which we frequently met walking upright. Through these high and difficult mountains we have only narrow paths, like those of sheep, made by the goats, or the wild beasts we are speaking of, which, after we had walked on them for a long space, landed us frequently at the edge of some valley or precipice, and forced us to go back again to seek a new road. From towards Zeggan to the westward, and from the plain where the river winds too much, is the only easy access to the fountains of the Nile: and they that ascend to them by this way will not even think that approach too easy.\"\n\nPeter Heiling, a Protestant of Lubeck, resided several years in the country of Gojiam, and was even governor of it, but he never made any attempt to discover the source of the Nile; dedicating himself entirely to a frivolous and solitary life. The most extraordinary attempt, however, that ever was made to discover the source of this or any other river, was that of a German nobleman named Peter Joseph de Roux, comte de Defreval. He had been in the Danish navy from the year 1721; and, in 1739, was made rear-admiral. That same year he resigned his commission, and began his attempt to discover the source of the Nile in Egypt. To this country he took his wife along with him; and had no sooner reached Cairo, than he quarrelled with a Turkish mob on a point of etiquette; which instantly brought upon them the janizaries and guards of police, to take them into custody. The countess exerted herself in an extraordinary manner; and armed only with a pair of pistols, put all the janizaries to flight, and even wounded several of them; so that her husband was left at liberty to pursue his plan of discovery. To accomplish this, he provided a barge with small cannon, and furnished with all necessary provisions for himself and his wife, who was still to accompany him. Before he set out, however, it was suggested to him, that supposing government might protect him so far as to allow his barge to pass the confines of Egypt safely, and to the first cataract; supposing also that she was arrived at Ibrim, or Deir, the last garrisons depending on Cairo; yet still some days journey above the garrisons of Deir and Ibrim began the dreadful deserts of Nubia; and farther south, at the great cataract of Jan Adel, the Nile falls 20 feet down a perpendicular rock\u2014so that here his voyage must undoubtedly end. The count, however, flattered himself with being able to obtain such assistance from the garrisons of Ibrim and Deir as would enable him to take the vessel to pieces, and to carry it above the cataract, where it could again be launched into the river. To facilitate this scheme he had even entered into a treaty with some of the barbarians named Kennoufs, who reside near the cataract, and employ themselves in gathering senna, which abounds in their country. These promised to assist him in this extraordinary adventure; but, luckily for the count, he suffered himself at last to be persuaded by some Venetian merchants at Cairo not to proceed in person on such a dangerous and unheard-of navigation, but rather to depute Mr. Norden, his lieutenant, who was likewise to serve as his draughtsman, to reconnoitre the forts of Ibrim and Deir, as well as the cataract of Jan Adel, and renew his treaty with the Kennoufs. This gentleman accordingly embarked upon one of the vessels common on the Nile, but met with a great many difficulties and dangers before he could reach Syene and the first cataract; after which having with still greater difficulty reached Ibrim, instead of meeting with any encouragement for the count to proceed on his voyage, he was robbed of all he had by the governor of the fort, and narrowly escaped with his life; it having been for some time determined by him and his soldiers that Mr. Norden should be put to death. By these difficulties the count was so much disheartened, that he determined to make no more attempts on the Nubian side. He now resolved to enter Abyssinia by the island of Mafush. With this view he undertook a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope, in order to reach the Red sea by the straits of Babelmandel: but having begun to use his Spanish commission, and taken two English ships, he was met by Commodore Barnet, who made prizes of all the vessels he had with him, and sent home the count himself passenger in a Portuguese ship to Lisbon.\n\nThus Mr. Bruce considers himself as the first European who reached the sources of this river. He informs us that they are in the country of the Agows, as Kircher had said; so that the latter must either have visited them himself, or have had very good information concerning them. The name of the place through which is the passage to the territory of the Agows, is Abala; a plain or rather valley, generally about half a mile, and never exceeding a whole mile, in breadth. The mountains which surround it are at first of an inconsiderable height, covered to the very top with herbage and acacia trees; but as they proceed to the southward they become more rugged and woody.\u2014On the top of these mountains are delightful plains producing excellent pasture. Those to the west join a mountain called Aformalha, where, from a direction nearly southeast, they turn south, and enclose the villages and territory of Sacala, which lie at the foot of them; and still lower, that is, more to the westward, is the small village of Geeth, where the fountains of the Nile are situated. Here the mountains are in the form of a crescent; and along these the river takes its course. Those which enclose the east side of the plain run parallel to the former in their whole course, making part of the mountains of Lechtabara, or at least joining with them, and these two, when behind Aformalha, turn to the south, and then to the south-west, taking the same form as they do; only making a greater curve, and enclosing them likewise in the form of a crescent, the extremity of which terminates immediately above a small lake named Gooderoo in the plain of Affoa, below Geeth, and directly at the fountains of the Nile.\n\nHaving passed several considerable streams, all of which empty themselves into the Nile, our traveller found himself at last obliged to ascend a very steep and rugged mountain, where no other path was to be found but a very narrow one made by the sheep or goats, and which in some places was broken, and full of holes; in others, he was obstructed with large stones, which seemed to have remained there since the creation. The whole was covered with thick wood; and he was everywhere flopped by the kantufia, as well as by several other\nthorny plants almost as troublesome as that. Having at last, however, reached the top, he had a sight of the Nile immediately below him; but so diminished in size, that it now appeared only a brook scarcely sufficient to turn a mill. The village of Geeth is not within sight of the fountains of the river, though not more than 600 yards distant from them. The country about that place terminates in a cliff of about 300 yards high, which reaches down to the plain of Aifoa, continuing in the same degree of elevation till it meets the Nile again about 17 miles to the southward, after having made the circuit of the provinces of Gojam and Damot. In the middle of this cliff is a vast cave running straight northward, with many bye-paths forming a natural labyrinth, of sufficient bigness to contain the inhabitants of the whole village with their cattle. Into this Mr Bruce advanced about 100 yards; but he did not choose to go farther, as the candle he carried with him seemed ready to go out; and the people assured him that there was nothing remarkable to be seen at the end. The face of this cliff, fronting the south, affords a very picturesque view from the plain of Aifoa below; parts of the houses appearing at every flage through the bushes and thickets of trees. The mouths of the cavern above mentioned, as well as of several others which Mr Bruce did not see, are hid by almost impenetrable fences of the worst kind of thorn; nor is there any other communication between the upper part and the houses but by narrow winding sheep paths, very difficult to be discovered; all of them being allowed to be overgrown, as a part of the natural defence of the people. The edge of the cliff is covered with lofty and high trees, which seem to form a natural fence to prevent people from falling down; and the beauty of the flowers which the Abyssinian thorns bear, seems to make some amends for their bad qualities.\n\nFrom the edge of the cliff of Geeth, above where the village is situated, the ground slopes with a descent due north, till we come to a triangular marsh upwards of 86 yards broad, and 286 from the edge of the cliff, and from a priest's house where Bruce resided. On the east, the ground descends with a very gentle slope from the large village of Sacala, which gives its name to the territory, and is about six miles distant from the source, though to appearance not above two. About the middle of this marsh, and not quite 40 yards from the foot of the mountain of Geeth, rises a circular hillock about three feet from the surface of the marsh itself, though founded apparently much deeper in it. The diameter of this hillock is not quite 12 feet, and it is surrounded by a shallow trench which collects the water, and sends it off to the eastward. This is firmly built of sod brought from the sides, and kept constantly in repair by the Agows, who worship the river, and perform their religious ceremonies upon this as an altar. In the midst of it is a circular hole, in the formation or enlargement of which the work of art is evidently discernible. It is always kept clear of grass and aquatic plants, and the water in it is perfectly pure and limpid, but without any ebullition or motion discernible on its surface. The mouth is some parts of an inch less than three feet diameter, and at the time our author first visited it (Nov. 5, 1770), the water stood about two inches from the brim, nor did it either increase or diminish during all the time of his residence at Geeth. On putting down the shaft of a lance, he found a very feeble resistance at six feet four inches, as if from weak rushes and grasses; and, about six inches deeper, he found his lance had entered into soft earth, but met with no obstruction from stones or gravel: and the same was confirmed by using a heavy plummet, with a line befouled with soap.\n\nThis is the first fountain of the Nile.\n\nThe second fountain is situated at about ten feet distant from the former, a little to the west of south; and is only 11 inches in diameter, but eight feet three inches deep. The third is about 20 feet SSW from the first; the mouth being somewhat more than two feet in diameter, and five feet eight inches in depth. These fountains are made use of as altars, and from the foot of each issues a brisk running rill, which, uniting with the water of the first trench, goes off at the east side in a stream which, our author conjectures, would fill a pipe about two inches diameter. The water of these fountains is extremely light and good, and intensely cold, though exposed to the scorching heat of the sun, without any shelter; there being no trees nearer than the cliff of Geeth. The longitude of the principal fountain was found by Mr Bruce to be $36^\\circ 55' 30''$ E. from Greenwich. The elevation of the ground, according to his account, must be very great, as the barometer stood only at 22 English inches. \"Neither (says he) did I vary sensibly from that height any of the following days. I stood at Geeth; and thence I inferred, that at the sources of the Nile I was then more than two miles above the level of the sea; a prodigious height, to enjoy a sky perpetually clear, as also a hot sun never overcast for a moment with clouds from rising to setting.\" In the morning of Nov. 6, the thermometer stood at $44^\\circ$, at noon $95^\\circ$, and at sunset $46^\\circ$. It was extremely cold at night, and still more so about an hour before sunrise.\n\nThe Nile thus formed by the union of streams from these three fountains, runs eastward through the marsh for about 30 yards, with very little increase of its water, but still distinctly visible, till it is met by the grassy brink of the land descending from Sacala. By this it is turned gradually NE, and then due north; and in the two miles in which it flows in that direction it receives many small streams from springs on each side; so that about this distance from the fountains it becomes a stream capable of turning a common mill. Our traveller was much taken with the beauty of this spot. \"The small rising hills about us (says he) were all thick covered with verdure, especially with clover the largest and finest I ever saw; the tops of the heights covered with trees of a prodigious size: the stream, at the banks of which we were fitting, was limpid, and pure as the finest crystal; the sod covered thick with a kind of bushy tree, that seemed to affect to grow to no height, but, thick with foliage and young branches, rather to assist the surface of the water; whilst it bore, in prodigious quantities, a beautiful yellow flower, not unlike a single rose of that colour, but without thorns; and indeed, upon examination, we found that it was not a species of the rose, but of the hypericum.\"\n\nHere Mr Bruce exults greatly in his success; as having not only seen the fountains of the Nile, but the river itself running in a small stream; so that the ancient saying of the poet,\n\n*Nec licuit populis parvum te Nile videre,* could not be applied to him. Here he stepped over it, he says, more than 50 times, though he had told us, in the preceding page, that it was three yards over. From this ford, however, the Nile turns to the westward; and, after\nafter running over loose stones occasionally in that direction about four miles farther, there is a small cataract of about six feet in height; after which it leaves the mountainous country, and takes its course through the plains of Goutto. Here it flows so gently that its motion is scarcely to be perceived, but turns and winds in its direction more than any river he ever saw; forming more than 20 sharp angular peninsulas in the space of five miles. Here the soil is composed of a marly clay, quite destitute of trees, and very difficult to travel through; and where its stream receives no considerable addition. Issuing out from thence, however, it is joined by several rivulets which fall from the mountains on each side, so that it becomes a considerable stream, with high and broken banks covered with old timber trees for three miles. In its course it inclines to the north-east, and winds very much, till it receives first a small river named Divon, and then another named Dee-ahka, or the river Dee. Turning then sharply to the east, it falls down another cataract, and about three miles below receives the Jemma, a pure and limpid stream, not inferior in size to itself. Proceeding still to the northward, it receives a number of other streams, and at last crosses the southern part of the lake Tzana or Dembea, preserving the colour of its stream during its passage, and issuing out at the west side of it in the territory of Dara.\n\nThere is a ford, though very deep and dangerous, at the place where the Nile first affirms the name of a river, after emerging from the lake Dembea; but the stream in other places is exceedingly rapid: the banks in the course of a few miles become very high, and are covered with the most beautiful and variegated verdure that can be conceived. It is now confined by the mountains of Begemder, till it reaches Alata, where is the third cataract. This, we are informed by Mr Bruce, is the most magnificent sight he ever beheld; but he thinks that the height has rather been exaggerated by the missionaries, who make it 50 feet; and after many attempts to measure it, he is of opinion that it is nearly 40 feet high. At the time he visited it, the river had been pretty much swelled by rains, and fell in one sheet of water, without any interval, for the space of half an English mile in breadth, with such a noise as stunned and made him giddy for some time. The river, for some space both above and below the fall, was covered with a thick mist, owing to the small particles of the water dashed up into the air by the violence of the shock. The river, though swelled beyond its usual size, retained its clearness, and fell into a natural basin of rock; the stream appearing to run back against the foot of the precipice over which it falls with great violence; forming innumerable eddies, waves, and being in excessive commotion, as may easily be imagined. Jerome Lobo pretends that he was able to reach the foot of the rock, and sit under the prodigious arch of water spouting over it; but Mr Bruce does not hesitate to pronounce this to be an absolute falsehood. The noise of the cataract, which, he says, is like the loudest thunder, could not but confound and destroy his sense of hearing; while the rapid motion of the water before his eyes would dazzle the sight, make him giddy, and utterly deprive him of all his intellectual powers. \"It was a most magnificent sight,\" says Mr Bruce, \"that ages, added to the greatest length of human life, would not deface or eradicate from my memory: it struck me with a kind of stupor, and a total oblivion of where I was, and of every other sublunary concern.\"\n\nAbout half a mile below the cataract, the Nile is confined between two rocks, where it runs in a narrow channel with impetuous velocity and great noise. At the village of Alata there is a bridge over it, consisting of one arch, and that no more than 25 feet wide. This bridge is strongly fixed into the solid rock on both sides, and some part of the parapet still remains. No crocodiles ever come to Alata, nor are any ever seen beyond the cataract.\n\nBelow this tremendous water-fall the Nile takes a south-east direction, along the western side of Begemder and Amhara on the right, enclosing the province of Gojam. It receives a great number of streams from both sides, and after several turns takes at last a direction almost due north, and approaches within 62 miles of its source. Notwithstanding the vast increase of its waters, however, it is still fordable at some seasons of the year; and the Galla cross it at all times without any difficulty, either by swimming, or on goatskins blown up like bladders. It is likewise crossed on small rafts, placed on two skins filled with wind: or by twisting their hands round the tails of the horses who swim over; a method always used by the women who follow the Abyssinian armies, and are obliged to cross unfordable rivers. In this part of the river crocodiles are met with in great numbers; but the superstitious people pretend they have charms sufficiently powerful to defend themselves against their voracity.\u2014The Nile now seems to have forced its passage through a gap in some very high mountains which bound the country of the Gongas, and falls down a cataract of 280 feet high; and immediately below this are two others, both of very considerable height. These mountains run a great way to the westward, where they are called Dyre or Tegla, the eastern end of them joining the mountains of Kuara, where they have the name of Fazzebo. These mountains, our author informs us, are all inhabited by Pagan nations; but the country is less known than any other on the African continent. There is plenty of gold washed down from the mountains by the torrents in the rainy season; which is the fine gold of Sennar named Tilbar.\n\nThe Nile, now running close by Sennar in a direction nearly north and south, makes afterwards a sharp turn to the east; affording a pleasant view in the fair season, when it is brim-full, and indeed the only ornament of that bare and inhospitable country. Leaving Sennar, it passes by many large towns inhabited by Arabs, all of them of a white complexion; then passing Gerri, and turning to the north-east, it joins the Tacazze, passing during its course through this country, a large and populous town named Chendi, probably the Candace of the ancients. Here Mr Bruce supposes the ancient island or peninsula of Meroe to have been situated. Having at length received the great river Atbara, the Ahababoras of the ancients, it turns directly north for about two degrees; then making a very unexpected turn west by south for more than two degrees in longitude, and winding very little, it arrives at Korti, the first town in Barabra, or kingdom of Dongola. From Korti it runs almost south-west till it passes Dongola, called also Beja, the capital of Barabra; after which it comes\nto Mocho, a considerable town and place of refreshment to the caravans when they were allowed to pass from Egypt to Ethiopia. From thence turning to the north-east it meets with a chain of mountains in about $22^\\circ 15'$ of N. latitude, where is the seventh cataract named Jan Adel. This is likewise very tremendous, though not above half as high as that of Alata. This course is now continued till it falls into the Mediterranean; there being only one other cataract in the whole space, which is much inferior to any of those already described.\n\nThis very particular and elaborate account of the sources of the Nile and of the course of the river given by Mr Bruce, hath not escaped criticism. We find him accused by the reviewers, not only of having brought nothing to light that was not previously known to the learned, but even of having revealed nothing which was not previously published in Guthrie's Geographical Grammar. This, however, seems by no means a fair and candid criticism. If the sources of the Nile, as described by Mr Bruce, were known to the author of Guthrie's Grammar, they must likewise have been to every retailer of geography since the time of the missionaries; which, as the reviewers have particularized that book, would not seem to have been the case. If anything new was published there previous to the appearance of Mr Bruce's work, it must probably have been derived indirectly from himself; of which clandestine method of proceeding that gentleman has had frequent occasion to complain in other cases. It is alleged, however, that he has given the name of Nile to a stream which does not deserve it. This, like all other large rivers, is composed of innumerable branches; to visit the top of every one of which would be indeed an Herculean task. The source of the largest branch, therefore, and that which has the longest course, is undoubtedly to be accounted the source of the river; but here it is denied that Mr Bruce had sufficient information. \"Of the innumerable streams (say they) that feed the lake of Tzana, there is one that ends in a bog, to which Mr Bruce was conducted by Woldo, a lying guide, who told him it was the source of the Nile. Mr Bruce, in a matter of far less importance, would not have taken Woldo's word; but he is persuaded, that in this case he spoke truth; because the credulous barbarians of the neighbouring district paid something like worship to this brook, which, at the distance of 14 miles from its source, is not 20 feet broad, and nowhere one foot deep. Now it is almost unnecessary to observe, that the natives of that country being, according to Mr Bruce's report, pagans, might be expected to worship the pure and salutary stream, to which, with other extraordinary qualities, their superstition ascribed the power of curing the bite of a mad dog. Had he traced to its source any of the other rivulets which run into the lake Tzana, it is not unlikely that he might have met with similar instances of credulity among the ignorant inhabitants of its banks. Yet this would not prove any one of them in particular to be the head of the Nile. It would be trifling with the patience of our readers to say one word more on the question, whether the Portuguese Jesuits or Mr Bruce discovered what they erroneously call the head of the Nile. Before either they or he had indulged themselves in a vain triumph over the labours of antiquity, they ought to have been sure that they had effected what antiquity was unable to accomplish. Now the river described by the Jesuit Kircher, who collected the information of his brethren, as well as by Mr Bruce, is not the Nile of which the ancients were in quest. This is amply proved by the prince of modern geographers, the incomparable D'Anville (at least till our own Rennell appeared), in a copious memoir published in the 26th volume of the Memoirs of the Academy of Belles Lettres, p. 45.\u2014See Rennell's Map of Herodotus, p. 441.\n\nTo this learned dissertation we refer our readers; adding only what seems probable from the writings of Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus, that the ancients had two meanings when they spoke of the head or source of the Nile: First, Literally, the head or source of that great western stream now called the White River, which contains a much greater weight of waters, and has a much longer course than the river described by the Jesuits and by Mr Bruce; and, 2dly, Metaphorically, the cause of the Nile's inundation. This cause they had discovered to be the tropical rains, which fall in the extent of 16 degrees on each side of the line; which made the sacrificial of Minerva's temple of Sais in Egypt tell that inquisitive traveller Herodotus, that the waters of the Nile run in two opposite directions from its source; the one north into Egypt, the other south into Ethiopia; and the reports of all travellers into Africa serve to explain and confirm this observation. The tropical rains, they acknowledge, give rise to the Nile and all its tributary streams which flow northward into the kingdom of Senaar, as well as to the Zebec, and so many large rivers which flow south into Ethiopia; and then, according to the inclination of the ground, fall into the Indian or Atlantic ocean. Such then, according to the Egyptian priests, is the true and philosophical source of the Nile; a source discovered above 3000 years ago, and not, as Mr Bruce and the Jesuits have supposed, the head of a paltry rivulet, one of the innumerable streams that feed the lake Tzana.\"\n\nOn this severe criticism, however, it is obvious to remark, that if the source of the Nile has been discovered so many years ago, there is not the least probability that the finding of it should have been deemed an impossible undertaking, which it most certainly was, by the ancients.\u2014That the finding out the fountains of the river itself was an object of their inquiry, cannot be doubted; and from the accounts given by Mr Bruce, it appears very evident that none of the ancients had equal success with himself; though indeed the Jesuits, as has already been observed, seem to have a right to dispute it with him. From the correspondence of his accounts with that of the Jesuits, it appears certain that the most considerable stream which flows into the lake Tzana takes its rise from the fountains at Geeth already described; and that it is the most considerable plainly appears from its stream being visible through the whole breadth of the lake, which is not the case with any of the rest. The preference given to this stream by the Agows, who worship it, seems also an irrefutable proof that they look upon it to be the great river which passes through Ethiopia and Egypt; nor will the argument of the reviewers hold good in supposing that other streams are worshipped, unless they could prove that they are so. As little can it be any objection or disparagement\ndisparagement to Mr Bruce's labours, that he did not discover the sources of the western branch of the Nile called the White River. Had he done so, it might next have been objected that he did not visit the springs of the Tacazze, or any other branch. That the origin of the White river was unknown to the ancients may readily be allowed; but so were the fountains of Geeth, as evidently appears from the erroneous position of the sources of the eastern branch of the Nile laid down by Ptolemy. Our traveller, therefore, certainly has the merit, if not of discovering the sources, at least of confirming the accounts which the Jesuits have given of the sources of the river called the Nile; and of which the White river, whether greater or smaller, seems to be accounted only a branch. The superior veneration paid to the eastern branch of this celebrated river will also appear from the variety of names given to it, as well as from the import of these names; of which Mr Bruce gives the following account.\n\nBy the Agows it is named Gzeir, Geefa, or Seir; the first of which terms signifies a god. It is likewise named Ab, father; and has many other names, all of them implying the most profound veneration. Having descended into Gojam it is named Abay; which, according to Mr Bruce, signifies the river that suddenly swells and overflows periodically with rain. By the Gonas on the south side of the mountains Dyre and Tegla, it is called Dahli, and by those on the north side Kowas; both of which names signify a watching dog, the latrator anubis, or dog-star. In the plain country between Fazuolo and Sennar it is called Nile which signifies blue; and the Arabs interpret this name by the word Azergue; which name it retains till it reaches Halfaia, where it receives the White river.\n\nFormerly the Nile had the name of Siris, both before and after it enters Beja, which the Greeks imagined was given to it on account of its black colour during the inundation; but Mr Bruce affirms us that the river has no such colour. He affirms, with great probability, that this name in the country of Beja imports the river of the dog-star, on whose vertical appearance this river overflows; \"and this idolatrous worship (says he) was probably part of the reason of the question the prophet Jeremiah asks: And what hast thou to do in Egypt to drink the water of Seir, or the water profaned by idolatrous rites?\" As for the first, it is only the translation of the word bahar applied to the Nile. The inhabitants of the Barabra to this day call it Bahar el Nil, or the sea of the Nile, in contradiction to the Red sea, for which they have no other name than Bahar el Molech, or the Salt sea. The junction of the three great rivers, the Nile flowing on the west side of Moroc; the Tacazze, which washes the east side, and joins the Nile at Maggiran in N. Lat. 17\u00b0; and the Mareb, which falls into this last something above the junction, gives the name of Triton to the Nile.\n\nThe name Aegyptus, which it has in Homer, and which our author supposes to have been a very ancient name even in Ethiopia, is more difficult to account for. This has been almost universally supposed to be derived from the black colour of the inundation; but Mr Bruce, for the reasons already given, will not admit of this. \"Egypt (says he) in the Ethiopic is called y Gipt, Agar; and an inhabitant of the country, Gypa, for precisely so it is pronounced; which means the country of ditches or canals, drawn from the Nile on both sides at right angles with the river: nothing surely is more obvious than to write y Gipt, so pronounced, Egypts; and, with its termination us or os, Egypts. The Nile is also called Kronides, Jupiter; and has had several other appellations bestowed upon it by the poets; though these are rather of a transitory nature than to be ranked among the ancient names of the river. By some of the ancient fathers it has been named Geon; and by a strange train of miracles they would have it to be one of the rivers of the terrestrial paradise; the same which is said to have encompassed the whole land of Cush or Ethiopia. To effect this, they are obliged to bring the river a great number of miles, not only under the earth, but under the sea also; but such reveries need no refutation.\n\nUnder the article Egypt we have so fully explained the cause of the annual inundation of the Nile, that, with regard to the phenomenon itself, nothing farther seems necessary to be added. We shall therefore only extract from Mr Bruce's work what he has said concerning the mode of natural operation by which the tropical rains are produced; which are now universally allowed to be the cause of the annual overflowing of this and other rivers.\n\nAccording to this gentleman, the air is so much rarified by the sun during the time that he remains almost stationary over the tropic of Capricorn, that the other winds loaded with vapours rush in upon the land from the Atlantic ocean on the west, the Indian ocean on the east, and the cold Southern ocean beyond the Cape. Thus a great quantity of vapour is gathered, as it were, into a focus; and as the same causes continue to operate during the progress of the sun northward, a vast train of clouds proceed from south to north, which, Mr Bruce informs us, are sometimes extended much farther than at other times. Thus he tells us, that for two years some white dappled clouds were seen at Gondar, on the 7th of January; the sun being then 34\u00b0 distant from the zenith, and not the least cloudy speck having been seen for several months before. About the first of March, however, it begins to rain at Gondar, but only for a few minutes at a time, in large drops; the sun being then about 5\u00b0 distant from the zenith. The rainy season commences with violence at every place when the sun comes directly over it; and before it commences at Gondar, green boughs and leaves appear floating in the Bahar el Abiad, or White river, which, according to the accounts given by the Gallo, our author supposes to take its rise in about 30\u00b0 north latitude.\n\nThe rains therefore precede the sun only about 5\u00b0; but they continue and increase after he has passed it. In April all the rivers in the southern parts of Abyssinia begin to swell, and greatly augment the Nile, which is now also farther augmented by the vast quantity of water poured into the lake Tzana. On the first days of May, the sun passes the village of Gerr, which is the limit of the tropical rains; and it is very remarkable, that, though the sun still continues to operate with unabated vigour, all his influence cannot bring the clouds farther northward than this village;\nthe reason of which Mr Bruce, with great reason, supposes, to be the want of mountains to the northward. In confirmation of this opinion, he observes, that the tropical rains stop at the latitude of $14^\\circ$ instead of $16^\\circ$ in the western part of the continent. All this time, however, they continue violent in Abyssinia; and in the beginning of June the rivers are all full, and continue so while the sun remains stationary in the tropic of Cancer.\n\nThis excessive rain, which would sweep off the whole soil of Egypt into the sea were it to continue without intermission, begins to abate as the sun turns southward; and on his arrival at the zenith of each place, on his passage towards that quarter, they cease entirely: the reason of which is no less difficult to be discovered than that of their coming on when he arrives at the zenith in his passage northward. Be the reason what it will, however, the fact is certain; and not only so, but the time of the rains ceasing is exact to a single day; inasmuch, that on the 25th of September the Nile is generally found to be at its highest at Cairo, and begins to diminish every day after. Immediately after the sun has passed the line, he begins the rainy season to the southward; the rains constantly coming on with violence as he approaches the zenith of each place; but the inundation is now promoted in a different manner, according to the difference of circumstances in the situation of the places. From about $6^\\circ$ S. Lat., a chain of high mountains runs all the way along the middle of the continent towards the Cape of Good Hope, and intercepts the southern part of the peninsula nearly in the same manner that the Nile does the northern. A strong wind from the south, stopping the progress of the condensed vapours, dashes them against the cold summits of this ridge of mountains, and forms many rivers, which escape in the direction either of east or west as the level presents itself. If this is towards the west, they fall down the sides of the mountains into the Atlantic, and if on the east into the Indian ocean.\u2014\"The clouds (says Mr Bruce), drawn by the violent action of the sun, are condensed, then broken, and fall as rain on the top of this high ridge, and swell every river; while a wind from the ocean on the east blows like a monsoon up each of these streams, in a direction contrary to their current during the whole time of the inundation; and this enables boats to ascend into the western parts of Sotala, and the interior country, to the mountains where lies the gold. The same effect, from the same cause, is produced on the western side towards the Atlantic; the high ridge of mountains being placed between the different countries west and east, is at once the source of their riches, and of those rivers which conduct to the treasures, which would be otherwise inaccessible, in the eastern parts of the kingdoms of Benin, Congo, and Angola.\n\n\"There are three remarkable appearances attending the inundation of the Nile. Every morning in Abyssinia is clear, and the sun shines. About nine, a small cloud not above four feet broad, appears in the east, whirling violently round as if upon an axis; but arriving near the zenith, it first abates its motion, then loses its form, and extends itself greatly, and seems to call up vapours from all the opposite quarters. These clouds having attained nearly the same height, rush against each other with great violence, and put me always in mind of Eliisa foretelling rain on Mount Carmel. The air, impelled before the heaviest mists, or swiftest mover, makes an impression of its form on the collection of clouds opposite; and the moment it has taken possession of the space made to receive it, the most violent thunder possible to be conceived instantly follows, with rain: after some hours the sky again clears, with a wind at north; and it is always disagreeably cold when the thermometer is below $63^\\circ$.\n\n\"The second thing remarkable is the variation of the thermometer. When the sun is in the southern tropic, $36^\\circ$ distant from the zenith of Gondar, it is seldom lower than $72^\\circ$; but it falls to $68^\\circ$, and $63^\\circ$, when the sun is immediately vertical; so happily does the approach of rain compensate the heat of a too scorching sun.\n\nThe third is that remarkable stop in the extent of the rain northward, when the sun that has conducted the vapours from the line, and should seem now more than ever to be in the possession of them, is here overruled suddenly; till, on his return to Gerrit, again it resumes the absolute command over the rain, and reconducts it to the line, to furnish distant deluges to the southward.\"\n\nWith regard to the Nile itself, it has been said that the quantity of earth brought down by it from Abyssinia is so great, that the whole land of Egypt is produced from it. This question, however, is discussed under the article Egypt, where it is shown that this cannot possibly be the case.\u2014Among other authorities there quoted was that of Mr Volney, who strenuously argues against the opinion of Mr Savary and others, who have maintained that Egypt is the gift of the Nile. Notwithstanding this, however, we find him asserting that the soil of Egypt has undoubtedly been augmented by the Nile, in which case it is not unreasonable to suppose that it has been produced by it altogether.\u2014\"The reader (says he) will conclude, doubtless, from what I have said, that writers have flattered themselves too much in supposing they could fix the precise limits of the enlargement and rise of the Delta. But, though I would reject all illusory circumstances, I am far from denying the fact to be well founded; it is plain from reason, and an examination of the country. The rise of the ground appears to me demonstrated by an observation on which little stress has been laid. In going from Rofetta to Cairo, when the waters are low, as in the month of March, we may remark, as we go up the river, that the shore rises gradually above the water; so that if overflowed two feet at Rofetta, it overflows from three to four at Faona, and upwards of twelve at Cairo (A). Now by reasoning from this fact, we may deduce the proof of an increase by sediment; for the layer of mud being in proportion to the thickness of the sheets of water by which it is deposited, must be more or less considerable\n\n(A) \"It would be curious to ascertain in what proportion it continues up to Aswan. Some Copts, whom I have interrogated on the subject, assured me that it was much higher through all the Said than at Cairo.\"\nconsiderable as these are of a greater or less depth; and we have seen that the like gradation is observable from Aboan to the sea.\n\n\"On the other hand, the increase of the Delta manifests itself in a striking manner, by the form of Egypt along the Mediterranean. When we consider its figure on the map, we perceive that the country which is in the line of the river, and evidently formed of foreign materials, has assumed a semicircular shape, and that the shores of Arabia and Africa, on each side, have a direction towards the bottom of the Delta; which manifestly discovers that this country was formerly a gulf, that in time has been filled up.\n\n\"This accumulation is common to all rivers, and is accounted for in the same manner in all: the rain water and the snow descending from the mountains into the valleys, hurry incessantly along with them the earth they wash away in their descent. The heavier parts, such as pebbles and sands, soon stop, unless forced along by a rapid current. But when the waters meet only with a fine and light earth, they carry away large quantities with the greatest facility. The Nile, meeting with such a kind of earth in Abyssinia and the interior parts of Africa, its waters are loaded and its bed filled with it; nay, it is frequently so embarrassed with this sediment as to be straitened in its course. But when the inundation restores to it its natural energy, it drives the mud that has accumulated towards the sea, at the same time that it brings down more for the ensuing season; and this, arrived at its mouth, heaps up, and forms shoals, where the declivity does not allow sufficient action to the current, and where the sea produces an equilibrium of resistance. The stagnation which follows occasions the groarser particles, which till then had floated, to sink; and this takes place more particularly in those places where there is least motion, as towards the shores, till the sides become gradually enriched by the spoils of the upper country and of the Delta itself; for if the Nile takes from Abyssinia to give to the Thebais, it likewise takes from the Thebais to give to the Delta, and from the Delta to carry to the sea. Wherever its waters have a current, it defoils the same territory that it enriches. As we ascend towards Cairo, when the river is low, we may observe the banks worn steep on each side and crumbling in large flakes. The Nile, which undermines them, depriving their light earth of support, it falls into the bed of the river; for when the water is high, the earth imbibes it; and when the sun and drought return, it cracks and moulders away in great flakes, which are hurried along by the Nile.\"\n\nThus does Mr Volney argue for the increase of the Delta in the very same manner that others have argued for the production of the whole country of Egypt; an opinion which he is at great pains to refute. Under the article Egypt, however, it is shown that the Nile does not bring down any quantity of mud sufficient for the purposes assigned; and with regard to the argument drawn from the shallowness of the inundation when near the sea, this does not prove any rise of the land; but as Mr Reemel has judiciously observed in his remarks on the inundation of the Ganges, arises from the nature of the fluid itself. The reason, in short, is this: The surface of the sea is the lowest point to which the waters of every inundation have a tendency; and when they arrive there, they spread themselves over it with more ease than anywhere else, because they meet with less resistance. Their motion, however, by reason of the small declivity, is less swift than that of the waters farther up the river, where the declivity is greater; and consequently the latter being somewhat impeded in their motion, are in some degree accumulated. The surface of the inundation, therefore, does not form a perfectly level plain, but one gradually sloping from the interior parts of the country towards the sea; so that at the greatest distance from the ocean the water will always be deepest, even if we should suppose the whole country to be perfectly smooth, and composed of the most solid materials.\u2014This theory is easily underflood from observing a quantity of water running along a wooden spout, which is always more shallow at the end of the spout where it runs off than at the others.\u2014With regard to Mr Volney's other arguments, they are without doubt contradictory; for if, as he says, the river takes from Abyssinia to give to the Thebais, from Thebais to give to the Delta, and from Delta to the sea, it undoubtedly follows, that it gives nothing to any part of the land whatever, but that altogether is swept into the Mediterranean sea; which, indeed, some very trifling quantities excepted, is most probably the case.\n\nIt has been remarked by Mr Pococke, a very judicious traveller, that, in the beginning of the inundation, the waters of the Nile run red, and sometimes green; and while they remain of that colour, they are unwholesome. He explains this phenomenon by supposing, that the inundation at first brings away that red or green filth which may be about the lakes where it takes its rise; or about the sources of the small rivers which flow into it, near its principal source; \"for,\" says he, although there is so little water in the Nile when at lowest, that there is hardly any current in many parts of it, yet it cannot be supposed that the water should stagnate in the bed of the Nile so as to become green. Afterwards the water begins to be red and still more turbid, and then it begins to be wholesome.\" This circumstance is explained by Mr Bruce in the following manner: The country about Narea and Caffa, where the river Abiad takes its rise, is full of immense marshes, where, during the dry season, the water stagnates, and becomes impregnated with every kind of corrupted matter. There, on the commencement of the rains, overflow into the river Abiad, which takes its rise there. The overflowing of these vast marshes first carries the discoloured water into Egypt; after which follows that of the great lake Tzana, through which the Nile passes; which having been stagnated, and without rain, under a scorching sun for six months, joins its putrid waters to the former. In Abyssinia also, there are very few rivers that run after November, but all of them stand in prodigious pools, which, by the heat of the sun, likewise turn putrid, and on the commencement of the rains throw off their stagnant water into the Nile; but at last, the rains becoming constant, all this putrid matter is carried off, and the sources of the inundation become sweet and wholesome. The river then passing through the kingdom of Sennaar, the soil of which is this red bole, becomes coloured with that earth; and a mixture, along with the moving sands of the deserts, of which it receives\nreceives a great quantity when raised by the wind, precipitates all the viscous and putrid matters which float in the waters; whence Mr Pococke judiciously observes, that the Nile is not wholesome when the water is clear and green, but when fo red and turbid that it stains the water of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe rains in Abyssinia, which cease about the 8th of September, generally leave a sickly season in the low country; but the diseases produced by these rains are removed by others which come on about the end of October, and cease about the 8th of November. On these rains depend the latter crops of the Abyssinians; and for these the Agows pray to the river, or the genius or spirit residing in it. In Egypt, however, the effect of them is seldom perceived; but in some years they prove excessive; and it has been observed that the Nile, after it has fallen, has again risen in such a manner as to alarm the whole country. This is said to have happened in the time of Cleopatra, when it was supposed to prefigure the extinction of the government of the Ptolemies; and in 1737 it was likewise imagined to portend some dreadful calamity.\n\nThe quantity of rain, by which all this inundation is occasioned, varies considerably in different years, at least at Gondar, where Mr Bruce had an opportunity of measuring it. In 1770 it amounted to 35\u00bd inches; but in 1771 it amounted to no less than 41,355 inches from the vernal equinox to the 8th of September. What our author adds concerning the variation of the rainy months seems totally irreconcilable with what he had before advanced concerning the extreme regularity of the natural causes by which the tropical rains are produced. \"In 1770 (says he) August was the rainy month; in 1771, July. When July is the rainy month, the rains generally cease for some days in the beginning of August, and then a prodigious deal falls in the latter end of that month and first week of September. In other years July and August are the violent rainy months, while June is fair. And lastly, in others, May, June, July, August, and the first week of September.\" If this is the case, what becomes of the regular attraction of the clouds by the sun as he advances northwards; of the coming on of the rains when he arrives at the zenith of any place, in his passage to the tropic of Cancer; and of their ceasing when he comes to the same point in his return southward?\n\nUnder Abyssinia we have mentioned a threat of one of the Abyssinian monarchs, that he would direct the course of the Nile and prevent it from fertilizing the land of Egypt; and it has likewise been related, that considerable progress was made in this undertaking by another emperor. Mr Bruce has bestowed an entire chapter on the subject; and is of opinion, that \"there seems to be no doubt that it is possible to diminish or divert the course of the Nile, that it should be insufficient to fertilize the country of Egypt; because the Nile, and all the rivers that run into it, and all the rains that fall on these rivers, fall in a country two miles above the level of the sea; therefore it cannot be denied, that there is level enough to divert many of the rivers into the Red Sea, or perhaps still easier by turning the course of the river Abiad till it meets the level of the Niger, or pass through the desert into the Mediterranean. Alphonso Albuquerque is said to have written frequently to the king of Portugal to send him pioneers from Madeira, with people accustomed to level grounds, and prepare them for sugar canes; by whose assistance he meant to turn the Nile into the Red Sea. This undertaking, however, if it really had been projected, was never accomplished; nor indeed is there any probability that ever such a mad attempt was proposed. Indeed, though we cannot deny that there is a possibility in nature of accomplishing it, yet the vast difficulty of turning the course of so many large rivers may justly stigmatize it as impracticable; not to mention the obstructions which must naturally be suggested from the apparent imutility of the undertaking, and those which would arise from the opposition of the Egyptians.\n\nIt has already been observed in a quotation from the reviewers, that Herodotus was informed by the satirist or secretary of the treasury of Minerva, that one half of the waters of the Nile run north and the other south. This is also taken notice of by Mr Bruce; who gives the following explanation of it. \"The secretary was probably of that country himself, and seems by his observation to have known more of it than all the ancients together. In fact we have seen, that between 13\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 north latitude, the Nile, with all its tributary streams, which have their rise and course within the tropical rains, falls down into the flat country (the kingdom of Sennar), which is more than a mile lower than the high country in Abyssinia; and thence, with a little inclination, it runs into Egypt. Again, in latitude 9\u00b0, in the kingdom of Gingiro, the Zebu runs south or south-east, into the Inner Ethiopia, as do also many other rivers, and, as I have heard from the natives of that country empty themselves into a lake, as those on the north side of the line do into the lake Tzana, thence distributing their waters to the east and west. These become the heads of great rivers, that run through the interior countries of Ethiopia (corresponding to the sea coast of Melinda and Mombaza) into the Indian ocean; whilst, on the westward, they are the origin of the vast streams that fall into the Atlantic, passing through Benin and Congo, southward of the river Gambia and the Sierra Leone. In short, the periodical rains from the tropic of Capricorn to the line, being in equal quantity with those that fall between the line and the tropic of Cancer, it is plain, that if the land of Ethiopia sloped equally from the line southward and northward, the rains that fall would go, the one half north and the other half south; but as the ground from 9\u00b0 north declines all southward, it follows, that the rivers which run to the southward must be equal to those that run northward, plus the rain that falls in the 5\u00b0 north latitude, where the ground begins to slope to the southward; and there can be little doubt that is at least one of the reasons why there are in the southern continent so many rivers larger than the Nile, that run both into the Indian and Atlantic oceans.\"\n\nFrom this account given to Herodotus, it has been supposed, by some writers on geography, that the Nile divides itself into two branches, one of which runs northward into Egypt, and one through the country of the Negroes westward into the Atlantic ocean. This opinion was first broached by Pliny.\u2014It has been adopted by the Nubian geographer, who urges\nurges in support of it, that if the Nile carried down all the rains which fall into it from Abyssinia, the people of Egypt would not be safe in their houses. But to this Mr Bruce answers, that the waste of water in the burning deserts through which the Nile passes is so great, that unless it was supplied by another stream, the White River, equal in magnitude to itself, and which, rising in a country of perpetual rains, is thus always kept full, it never could reach Egypt at all, but would be lost in the sands, as is the case with many other very considerable rivers in Africa. \"The rains (says he) are collected by the four great rivers in Abyssinia; the Mareb, the Bowihi, the Taccazze, and the Nile. All these principal, and their tributary streams, would, however, be absorbed, nor be able to pass the burning deserts, or find their way into Egypt, were it not for the White River, which having its source in a country of almost perpetual rains, joins to it a never-failing stream equal to the Nile itself.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this article with some account of the Agows who inhabit the country about the sources of the Nile. These, according to Mr Bruce, are one of the most considerable nations in Abyssinia, and can bring into the field about 4000 horse and a great number of foot; but were once much more powerful than they are now, having been greatly reduced by the invasions of the Galla. Their province is nowhere more than 60 miles in length, or than 30 in breadth; notwithstanding which they supply the capital and all the neighbouring country with cattle, honey, butter, wax, hides, and a number of other necessary articles; whence it has been customary for the Abyssinian princes to exact a tribute rather than military service from them. The butter is kept from putrefaction during the long carriage, by mixing it with a small quantity of a root somewhat like a carrot, which they call mormico. It is of a yellow colour, and answers the purpose perfectly well; which in that climate it is very doubtful if salt could do. The latter is besides used as money; being circulated instead of silver coin, and used as change for gold. Brides paint their feet, hands, and nails, with this root. A large quantity of the seed of the plant was brought into Europe by Mr Bruce.\n\nThe Agows carry on a considerable trade with the Shangalla and other black savages in the neighbourhood; exchanging the produce of their country for gold, ivory, horns of the rhinoceros, and some fine cotton. The barbarity and thievish disposition of both nations, however, render this trade much inferior to what it might be.\n\nIn their religion the Agows are gross idolaters, paying divine honours to the Nile, as has already been observed. Mr Bruce, who lodged in the house of the priest of the river, had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with many particulars of their devotion. He heard him address a prayer to the Nile, in which he styled it the \"Most High God, the Saviour of the world. In this prayer he petitioned for seasonable rain, plenty of grass, and the preservation of a kind of serpents; deprecating thunder very pathetically. The most sublime and lofty titles are given by them to the spirit which they suppose to reside in the river Nile; calling it everlasting God, Light of the World, Eye of the World, God of Peace, their Saviour, and Father of the Universe.\n\nThe Agows are all clothed in hides, which they manufacture in a manner peculiar to themselves. These hides are made in the form of a shirt reaching down to their feet, and tied about the middle with a kind of girdle or girdle. The lower part of it resembles a large double petticoat, one fold of which they turn back over their shoulders, fastening it with a broach or skewer across their breast before, and the married women carry their children in it behind. The younger fort generally go naked. The women are marriageable at nine years of age, though they commonly do not marry till eleven; and they continue to bear children till 30, and sometimes longer. They are generally thin and below the middle size, as well as the men. Barrenness is quite unknown among them.\n\nThe country of the Agows has a very elevated situation, and is of course so temperate that the heat may easily be borne, though little more than 10\u00b0 from the equator. The people, however, are but short lived; which may in part be owing to the oppression they labour under. This, according to Mr Bruce, is excessive. \"Though their country (says he) abounds with all the necessaries of life, their taxes, tributes, and services, especially at present, are so multiplied upon them, whilst their distresses of late have been so great and frequent, that they are only the manufacturers of the commodities they sell, to satisfy these constant exorbitant demands, and cannot enjoy any part of their own produce themselves, but live in penury and misery scarcely to be conceived. We saw a number of women wrinkled and sun-burnt so as fearlessly to appear human, wandering about under a burning sun, with one and sometimes two children upon their backs; gathering the seeds of bent grass to make a kind of bread.","sp":19,"ep":29},{"h":"NILOMETER","t":"or NILOSCOPE, an instrument used among the ancients to measure the height of the water of the river Nile in its overflows.\n\nThe word comes from \u039d\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 Nile (and that from \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"new mud,\" or as some others would have it, from \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \"I flow,\" and \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9, \"mud,\") and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"measure.\" The Greeks more ordinarily call it, \u039d\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1.\n\nThe nilometer is said, by several Arabian writers, to have been first set up, for this purpose, by Joseph during his regency in Egypt: the measure of it was 16 cubits, this being the height of the increase of the Nile, which was necessary to the fruitfulness of Egypt.\n\nFrom the measure of this column, Dr Cumberland deduces an argument, in order to prove that the Jewish and Egyptian cubits were of the same length.\n\nIn the French king's library is an Arabic treatise on nilometers, entitled Neil fi alhal al Nil; wherein are described all the overflows of the Nile, from the first year of the Hegira to the 875th.\n\nHerodotus mentions a column erected in a point of the island Delta, to serve as a nilometer; and there is still one of the same kind in a mosque of the same place.\n\nAs all the riches of Egypt arise from the inundations of the Nile, the inhabitants used to supplicate them at the hands of their Serapis; and committed the most execrable crimes, as actions, forsooth, of religion, to obtain the favour. This occasioned Constantine expressly\nNilometer to prohibit these sacrifices, &c., and to order the nilometer to be removed into the church; whereas, till that time, it had been in the temple of Serapis. Julian the Apostate had it replaced in the temple, where it continued till the time of Theodosius the Great.\n\nThe following is Mr Bruce's account of the nilometer. \"On the point of the island Rhode, between Geeza and Cairo, near the middle of the river, is a round tower enclosing a neat well or cistern lined with marble. The bottom of this well is on the same level with the bottom of the Nile, which has free access to it through a large opening like an embrasure. In the middle of the well rises a thin column of eight faces of blue and white marble; of which the foot is on the same plane with the bottom of the river. This pillar is divided into 20 peeks, of 22 inches each. Of these peeks the two lowermost are left, without any division, to stand for the quantity of sludge which the water deposits there. Two peeks are then divided, on the right hand, into 24 digits each; then on the left, four peeks are divided into 24 digits; then on the right, four; and on the left another four; again, four on the right, which completes the number of 18 peeks from the first division marked on the pillar, each peek being 22 inches. Thus the whole marked and unmarked amounts to something more than 36 feet English.\n\nOn the night of St John, when, by the falling of the dew, they perceive the rain water from Ethiopia mixed with the Nile at Cairo, they begin to announce the elevation of the river, having then five peeks of water marked on the nilometer, and two unmarked for the sludge, of which they take no notice. Their first proclamation, supposing the Nile to have risen 12 digits, is 12 from 6, or it wants 12 digits to be six peeks. When it has risen three more, it is nine from six; and so on, till the whole 18 be filled, when all the land of Egypt is fit for cultivation. Several canals are then opened, which convey the water into the desert, and hinder any further stagnation on the fields. There is indeed a great deal of more water to come from Ethiopia; but were the inundation suffered to go on, it would not drain soon enough to fit the land for tillage: and to guard against this mischief is the principal use of the nilometer, though the Turkish government makes it an engine of taxation. From time immemorial the Egyptians paid, as tribute to the king, a certain proportion of the fruit of the ground; and this was anciently ascertained by the elevation of the water on the nilometer, and by the mensuration of the land actually overflowed. But the Saracen government, and afterwards the Turkish, has taxed the people by the elevation alone of the water, without attending to its course over the country, or the extent of the land actually overflowed; and this tax is sometimes cruelly oppressive.","sp":29,"ep":30},{"h":"NIMBUS","t":"in antiquity, a circle observed on certain medals, or round the heads of some emperors; answering to the circles of light drawn round the images of saints.","sp":30,"ep":30},{"h":"NIMEGUEN","t":"a large, handsome, and strong town of the Netherlands, and capital of Dutch Gelderland, with a citadel, an ancient palace, and several forts.

What the sacred historian says of him is short; and yet he says more of him than of any other of the posterity of Noah, till he comes to Abraham. He tells us, that \"Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth;\" that he was a \"mighty hunter before the Lord,\" even to a proverb; and that \"the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.\"\n\nFrom this account he is supposed to have been a man of extraordinary strength and valour. Some represent him as a giant; all consider him as a great warrior. It is generally thought, that by the words a mighty hunter, is to be understood, that he was a great tyrant; but some of the rabbins interpret those words favourably, saying, that Nimrod was qualified by a peculiar dexterity and strength for the chase, and that he offered to God the game which he took; and several of the moderns are of opinion, that this passage is not to be understood of his tyrannical oppressions, or of hunting of men, but of beasts. It must be owned, that the phrase before the Lord may be taken in a favourable sense, and as a commendation of a person's good qualities; but in this place the generality of expositors understand it otherwise.\n\nHunting must have been one of the most useful employments in the times just after the dispersion, when all countries were over-run with wild beasts, of which it was necessary they should be cleared, in order to make them habitable; and therefore nothing seemed more proper to procure a man esteem and honour in those ages.\nNimrod, ages, than his being an expert hunter. By that exercise, we are told, the ancient Persians fitted their kings for war and government; and hunting is still, in many countries, considered as one part of a royal education.\n\nThere is nothing in the short history of Nimrod which carries the least air of reproach, except his name, which signifies a rebel; and that is the circumstance which seems to have occasioned the injurious opinions which have been entertained of him in all ages. Commentators, being prepossessed in general that the curse of Noah fell upon the posterity of Ham, and finding this prince stigmatized by his name, have interpreted every passage relating to him to his disadvantage. They represent him as a rebel against God, in perverting the defendants of Noah to disobey the divine command to disperse, and in setting them to build the tower of Babel, with an impious design of scaling heaven. They brand him as an ambitious usurper, and an insolent oppressor; and make him the author of the adoration of fire, of idolatrous worship given to men, and the first persecutor on the score of religion. On the other hand, some account him a virtuous prince, who, far from advising the building of Babel, left the country, and went into Assyria, because he would not give his consent to that project.\n\nNimrod is generally thought to have been the first king after the flood; though some authors, supposing a plantation or dispersion prior to that of Babel, have made kings in several countries before his time. Mizraim is thought, by many who contend for the antiquity of the Egyptian monarchy, to have begun his reign much earlier than Nimrod; and others, from the uniformity of the languages spoken in Assyria, Babylonia, Syria, and Canaan, affirm those countries to have been peopled before the confusion of tongues.\n\nThe four cities Moses gives to Nimrod constituted a large kingdom in those early times, when few kings had more than one; only it must be observed, that possessions might at first have been large, and afterwards divided into several parcels; and Nimrod being the leader of a nation, we may suppose his subjects settled within these limits: whether he became possessor of those cities by conquest or otherwise, does not appear; it is most probable he did not build Babel, all the posterity of Noah seeming to have been equally concerned in that affair; nor does it appear that he built the other three, though the founding of them, and many more, with other works, are attributed to him by some authors. It may seem also a little strange, that Nimrod should be preferred to the regal dignity, and enjoy the most cultivated part of the earth then known, rather than any other of the elder chiefs or heads of nations, even of the branch of Ham. Perhaps it was conferred on him for his dexterity in hunting; or, it may be, he did not assume the title of king till after his father Cush's death, who might have been settled there before him, and left him the sovereignty; but we incline to think, that he seized Shinar from the descendants of Shem, driving out Cush, who from thence went and founded Nineveh, and other cities in Assyria.\n\nThe Scripture does not inform us when Nimrod began his reign: Some date it before the dispersion; but such a conjecture does not seem to suit with the Mosaic history; for before the dispersion we read of no city but Babel; nor could there well be more, while all mankind were yet in a body together; but when Nimrod assumed the regal title, there seem to have been other cities; a circumstance which shows it was a good while after the dispersion. The learned writers of the Universal History place the beginning of his reign 30 years from that event, and in all likelihood it should be placed rather later than earlier.\n\nAuthors have taken a great deal of pains to find Nimrod in profane history: some have imagined him to be the same with Belus, the founder of the Babylonish empire; others take him to be Ninus, the first Assyrian monarch. Some believe him to have been Ezechus, the first Chaldean king after the deluge; and others perceive a great resemblance between him and Bacchus, both in actions and name. Some of the Mohammedan writers suppose Nimrod to have been Zohak, a Persian king of the first dynasty; others contend for his being Cay Caus, the second king of the second race; and some of the Jews say he is the same with Amraphel the king of Shiner, mentioned by Moses. But there is no certainty in these conjectures, nor have we any knowledge of his immediate successors.\n\nThe Scripture mentions nothing as to the death of Nimrod; but authors have taken care that such an essential circumstance in his history should not be wanting. Some of the rabbins pretend he was slain by Elau, whom they make his contemporary. There is a tradition that he was killed by the fall of the tower of Babel, which was overthrown by tempestuous winds. Others say, that as he led an army against Abraham, God sent a squadron of gnats, which destroyed most of them, and particularly Nimrod, whose brain was pierced by one of those insects.","sp":30,"ep":31},{"h":"NINE","t":"the last of the radical numbers or characters; from the combination of which any definite number, however large, may be produced. \"It is observed by arithmeticians (says Hume), that the products of 9 compose always either 9 or some lesser products of 9, if you add together all the characters of which any of the former products is composed: thus of 18, 27, 36, which are products of 9, you make 9, by adding 1 to 8, 2 to 7, 3 to 6.

It is very difficult exactly to assign the time of its foundation; but it cannot be long after the building of Babel. It was situated upon the banks of the Tigris; and in the time of the prophet Jonas, who was sent thither under Jeroboam II. king of Israel, and, as Calmet thinks, under the reign of Pul, father of Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, Nineveh was a very great city, its circuit being three days journey (Jonah iii. 3.) Diodorus Siculus, who has given us the dimensions of it, says it was 480 stadia in circumference, or 47 miles; and that it was surrounded with lofty walls and towers; the former being 200 feet in height, and so very broad that three chariots might drive on them abreast; and the latter 200 feet in height, and 1500 in number; and Strabo allows it to have been much\nNineveh, much greater than Babylon. Diodorus Siculus was, however, certainly mistaken, or rather his transcribers, as the authors of the Universal History think, in placing Nineveh on the Euphrates, since all historians as well as geographers who speak of that city, tell us in express terms that it stood on the Tigris. At the time of Jonah's mission thither, it was so populous, that it was reckoned to contain more than six score thousand persons, who could not distinguish their right hand from their left (Jonah iv. 11.), which is generally explained of young children that had not yet attained to the use of reason; so that upon this principle it is computed that the inhabitants of Nineveh were then above 600,000 persons.\n\nNineveh was taken by Arbaces and Belefs, in the year of the world 3257, under the reign of Sardanapalus, in the time of Ahaz, king of Judah, and about the time of the foundation of Rome. It was taken a second time by Affyages and Nabopolassar from Chynaladanus king of Assyria in the year 3378. After this time, Nineveh no more recovered its former splendour. It was so entirely ruined in the time of Lucianus Samoactenfis, who lived under the emperor Adrian, that no footsteps of it could be found, nor so much as the place where it stood. However, it was rebuilt under the Persians, and destroyed again by the Saracens about the seventh age.\n\nModern travellers say (A), that the ruins of ancient Nineveh may still be seen on the eastern banks of the Tigris, opposite to the city Mosul or Mouful: (See Mousul). Profane historians tell us, that Ninus first founded Nineveh; but the Scripture affirms us, that it was Ashur or Nimrod.\n\nThe sacred authors make frequent mention of this city; and Nahum and Zephaniah foretold its ruin in a very particular and pathetic manner.","sp":31,"ep":32},{"h":"NINIA","t":"or Ninian, commonly called St Ninian, a holy man among the ancient Britons. He resided at or near a place called by Ptolemy Lencopibia, and by Bede Candida Casa; but the English and Scotch called it Whitthorne. We mention him, because he is said to have been the first who converted the Scots and Picts to the Christian faith; which he did during the reign of Theodosius the Younger. Bede informs us, that he built a church dedicated to St Martin, in a style unknown to the Britons of that time; and adds, that during his time the Saxons held this province (Galluvia, now Galloway), and that, as in consequence of the labours of this saint the converts to Christianity increased, an episcopal see was established there. Dr Henry, considering that \"few or none of the writings of the most ancient fathers of the British church are now extant, and since little being said of them by their contemporaries, we can know little of their personal history and of the extent of their erudition,\" gives a short account of some of them. Of St Ninian he says, \"he was a Briton of noble birth and excellent genius. After he had received as good an education at home as his own country could afford, he travelled for his further improvement, and spent several years at Rome, which was then the chief seat of learning as well as of empire. From thence he returned into Britain, and spent his life in preaching the gospel in the most uncultivated parts of it, with equal zeal and success.\"\n\nThere is a small town called St Ninian, about a mile south of Stirling.

Her mother was a lady of exemplary piety; but her father early inspired her with the love of pleasure. Having lost her parents at 14 years of age, and finding herself mistress of her own actions, she resolved never to marry: she had an income of 10,000 livres a-year; and, according to the lessons she had received from her father, drew up a plan of life and gallantry, which she pursued till her death. Never delicate with respect to the number, but always in the choice, of her pleasures, she sacrificed nothing to interest; but loved only while her taste for it continued; and had among her admirers the greatest lords of the court. But notwithstanding the levity of her conduct, she had many virtues.\u2014She was constant in her friendship, faithful to what are called the laws of honour, of strict veracity, disinterested, and more particularly remarkable for perfect probity. Women of the most respectable characters were proud of the honour of having her for their friend; at her house was an affable\n\n---\n\n(A) This assertion, however, is far from seeming probable; for every trace of it seems to have totally disappeared, even so early as A.D. 627, that the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the celebrated battle between the emperor Heraclius and the Persians. There are few things in ancient history which have more puzzled the learned world, than to determine the spot where this city stood. Mr Ives informs us, that some have imagined it stood near Jonah's tomb; others, however, place it at another place, some hours journey up the Tigris. These different opinions, however, seem perfectly reconcilable; for it appears at least probable, that ancient Nineveh took in the whole of the ground which lies between these two ruined places. Mr Ives adds, that \"what confirms this conjecture is, that much of this ground is now hilly, owing no doubt to the rubbish of the ancient buildings. There is one mound of 200 or 300 yards square, which stands some yards north-east of Jonah's tomb, wherein it is likely a fortification once stood.

Lat. 36. 43.\n\nNIobe, in fabulous history, according to the fictions of the poets, was the daughter of Tantalus, and wife of Amphion king of Thebes; by whom she had seven sons and as many daughters. Having become so proud of her fertility and high birth, as to prefer herself before Latona, and to slight the sacrifices offered up by the Theban matrons to that goddess, Apollo and Diana, the children of Latona, resented this contempt. The former slew the male children and the latter the females; upon which Niobe was struck dumb with grief, and remained without sensation. Cicero is of opinion, that on this account the poets feigned her to be turned into stone.\n\nThe story of Niobe is beautifully related in the fifth book of the Metamorphoses of Ovid. That poet thus describes her transformation into stone.\n\nWidow'd and childless, lamentable state!\nA doleful sight, among the dead thy seat;\nHarden'd with woes, a statue of despair,\nTo ev'ry breath of wind unmov'd her hair;\nHer cheek still redd'ning, but its colour dead,\nFaded her eyes, and set within her head.\nNo more her pliant tongue its motion keeps,\nBut stands congeal'd within her frozen lips.\nStagnate and dull, within her purple veins,\nIts current stopp'd, the lifeless blood remains.\nHer feet their usual offices refuse,\nHer arms and neck their graceful gestures lose:\nAction and life from every part are gone,\nAnd ev'n her entrails turn to solid stone.\nYet still she weeps; and whirl'd by stormy winds,\nBorne thro' the air, her native country finds;\nThere fix'd, she stands upon a bleak hill;\nThere yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distil.\n\nNiobe in this statue is represented as in an ecstacy of grief for the loss of her offspring, and about to be converted into stone herself. She appears as if deprived of all sensation by the excess of her sorrow, and incapable either of shedding tears or of uttering any lamentations, as has been remarked by Cicero in the third book of his Tusculan Questions. With her right hand the clasps one of her little daughters, who throws herself into her bosom; which attitude equally shows the ardent affection of the mother, and expresses that natural confidence which children have in the protection of a parent. The whole is executed in such a wonderful manner, that this, with the other statues of her children, is reckoned by Pliny among the most beautiful works of antiquity: but he doubts to whom of the Grecian artists he ought to ascribe the honour of them (a). We have no certain information at what period this celebrated work was transported from Greece to Rome, nor do we know where it was first erected. Flamininius Vacca only says, that all these statues were found in his time not far from the gate of St John, and that they were afterwards placed by the grand duke Ferdinand in the gardens of the Villa de Medici near Rome.\u2014An ingenious and entertaining traveller (Dr Moore), speaking of the statue of Niobe, says, \"The author of Niobe has had the judgement not to exhibit all the distresses which he might have placed in her countenance. This consummate artist was afraid of disturbing her features too much, knowing full well that the point where he was to expect most sympathy was there, where distress co-operated with beauty, and where our pity met our love. Had he sought it one step farther in expression, he had lost it.\"\n\nIn the following epigram this statue is ascribed to Praxiteles:\n\n\u1f18\u03ba \u039e\u03ce\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5 \u0398\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9. \u1f18\u03ba \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u1ff3\n\u0396\u03c9\u1f74\u03bd \u03a0\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2.\n\nWhile for my children's fate I vainly mourn'd,\nThe angry gods to maffy stone me turn'd;\nPraxiteles a nobler feat has done,\nHe made me live again from being stone.\n\nThe author of this epigram, which is to be found in the 4th book of the Anthology, is unknown.

Amidst the general corruption into which all mankind were fallen at this time, Noah alone was found to be just and perfect in his generation, walking with God (Gen. vi. 9). This extraordinary person having therefore found favour in the eyes of the Lord, and God seeing that all flesh had corrupted their ways, told Noah, that he was resolved to destroy mankind from the face of the earth, by a flood of waters; and not them alone, but all the beasts of the earth, and every creeping thing, as well as the fowls of the air (Ibid. 7.). The Lord therefore directed Noah, as a means of preserving him and his family (for he had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who were all married before the flood), to build an ark or vessel, of a certain form and size fitted to that end, and which might besides accommodate such numbers of animals of all sorts, that were liable to perish in the flood, as would be sufficient to preserve the several species, and again replenish the earth; together with all necessary provisions for them; all which Noah performed, as may be seen more particularly under the article Ark.\n\nIn the year of the world 1656, and in the 600th year of his age, Noah, by God's appointment, entered the ark, together with his wife, his three sons, their wives, and all the animals which God caused to come to Noah; and being all entered, and the door of the ark being shut upon the outside, the waters of the deluge began to fall upon the earth, and increased in such a manner, that they were fifteen cubits above the tops of the highest mountains, and continued thus upon the earth for 150 days; so that whatever had life upon the earth, or in the air, was destroyed, except such as were with Noah in the ark. But the Lord remembering Noah, sent a wind upon the earth, which caused the waters to subside; so that upon the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat; and Noah having uncovered the roof of the ark, and observing the earth was dry, he received orders from the Lord to come out of it, with all the animals that were therein; and this he did in the five hundred and first year of his age, on the 27th day of the second month. But the history of the deluge is more circumstantially related already under the article DELUGE.\n\nThen he offered as a burnt sacrifice to the Lord one of all the pure animals that were in the ark; and the Lord accepted his sacrifice, and said to him, that he would no more pour out his curse upon the whole earth, nor any more destroy all the animals as he had now done. He gave Noah power over all the brute creation, and permitted him to eat of them, as of the herbs and fruits of the earth; except only the blood, the life of which God did not allow them. He bid him increase and multiply, made a covenant with him, and God engaged himself to send no more an universal deluge upon the earth; and as a memorial of his promise, he let his bow in the clouds, to be as a pledge of the covenant he made with Noah (Gen. ix.).\n\nNoah, being a husbandman, began now to cultivate the vine; and having made wine and drank thereof, he unwarily made himself drunk, and fell asleep in his tent, and happened to uncover himself in an indecent posture. Ham, the father of Canaan, having observed him in this condition, made himself sport with him, and acquainted his two brothers with it, who were without. But they, instead of making it a matter of sport, turned away from it, and going backwards they covered their father's nakedness, by throwing a mantle over him. Noah awaking, and knowing what Ham had done, said, that Canaan the son of Ham should be accursed, that he should be a slave of slaves in respect of his brethren. It is thought he had a mind to spare the person of his son Ham, for fear the curse might light upon\nupon the other children of Ham, who had no part in this action. He cursed Canaan by a spirit of prophecy, because the Canaanites his descendants were after this to be rooted out by the Israelites. Noah added, Let the Lord, the God of Shem, be blessed, and let Canaan be the servant of Shem. And he was so in effect, in the person of the Canaanites subdued by the Hebrews. Lastly, Noah said, Let God extend the possession of Japheth; let Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant. This prophecy had its accomplishment, when the Grecians, and afterwards the Romans, being descended from Japheth, made a conquest of Asia, which was the portion of Shem.\n\nBut Noah lived yet after the deluge three hundred and fifty years; and the whole time of his life having been nine hundred and fifty years, he died in the year of the world 2056. He left three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, of whom mention is made under their several names; and according to the common opinion, he divided the whole world amongst them, in order to repopulate it. To Shem he gave Asia, to Ham Africa, and Europe to Japheth. Some will have it, that besides these three sons he had several others. The spurious Berosus gives him thirty, called Titans, from the name of their mother Titaea. They pretend that the Teutons or Germans are derived from a son of Noah called Thuiticon. The false Methodius also makes mention of Jonithus or Jonicus, a pretended son of Noah.\n\nSt Peter calls Noah a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter ii. 5.), because before the deluge he was incessantly preaching and declaring to men, not only by his discourses, but by his unblameable life, and by the building of the ark, in which he was employed five score years, that the wrath of God was ready to pour upon them. But his preaching had no effect, since, when the deluge came, it found mankind plunged in their former enormities (Mat. xxiv. 37.).\n\nSeveral learned men have observed, that the Heathens confounded Saturn, Deucalion, Ogyges, the god Cebus or Uranus, Janus, Proteus, Prometheus, &c. with Noah. The wife of Noah is called Noria by the Gnostics; and the fable of Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha is manifestly invented from the history of Noah.\n\nThe Rabbins pretend, that God gave Noah and his sons (all who are not of the chosen race of Abraham they call Noachidae) certain general precepts, which contain, according to them, the natural right which is common to all men indifferently, and the observation of which alone will be sufficient to save them. After the law of Moses, the Hebrews would not suffer any stranger to dwell in their country, unless he would conform to the precepts of the Noachidae. In war they put to death, without quarter, all that were ignorant of them. These precepts are seven in number.\n\nThe first directs, that obedience be paid to judges, magistrates, and princes.\n\nBy the second, the worship of false gods, superstition, and sacrilege, are absolutely forbidden.\n\nThe third forbids cursing the name of God, blasphemies, and false oaths.\n\nThe fourth forbids all incestuous and unlawful connexions, as sodomy, bestiality, and crimes against nature.\n\nThe fifth forbids the effusion of blood of all sorts of animals, murder, wounds, and mutilations.\n\nThe sixth forbids thefts, cheats, lying, &c.\n\nThe seventh forbids to eat the parts of an animal still alive, as was practised by some Pagans.\n\nTo these the Rabbins have added some others; but what inclines us to doubt the antiquity of these precepts is, that no mention is made of them in Scripture, or in the writings of Josephus or Philo; and that none of the ancient fathers knew anything of them.","sp":36,"ep":37},{"h":"NOB","t":"a sacerdotal city of the tribe of Benjamin or Ephraim.

We should therefore (as far as concerns the question about its expediency in civil life, or the contrary) most cheerfully pass it over in silence, did we not esteem it our duty to give our readers at least some idea of it, and were it not our business to lay before them a few of those arguments which of late have been so copiously retailled both for and against this illustrious order of civil society: leaving them, however, that liberty which every man unquestionably ought to be allowed of judging for themselves as they shall see most proper.\n\nWhether that equality of rank and condition which has of late been so loudly contended for would be more agreeable to the order of nature, or more conducive to the happiness and prosperity of mankind, may indeed be made a question; but it is a question, we apprehend, which cannot receive different answers from men capable of reflecting without prejudice and partiality. A state of perfect equality can subsist only among\nNobility among beings possessing equal talents and equal virtues; but such beings are not men. Were all mankind under the constant influence of the laws of virtue, a distinction of ranks would be unnecessary; but in that case civil government itself would likewise be unnecessary, because men would have attained all that perfection to which it is the object of civil government as well as of religion to guide them: every man then would be a law unto himself. But whilst, in so many breasts, the selfish passions predominate over those which are social, violence must be restrained by authority; and there can be no authority without a distinction of ranks, such as may influence the public opinion.\n\nIt is well observed by Hume, that government is founded only on opinion; and that this opinion is of two kinds, opinion of interest, and opinion of right. When a people are persuaded that it is their interest to support the government under which they live, that government must be very stable. But among the worthless and unthinking part of the community, this persuasion has seldom place. All men, however, have a notion of rights\u2014of a right to property and a right to power: and when the majority of a nation considers a certain order of men as having a right to that eminence in which they are placed, this opinion, call it prejudice or what we will, contributes much to the peace and happiness of civil society. There are many, however, who think otherwise, and imagine that \"the society in which the greatest equality prevails must always be the most secure. These men conceive it to be the business of a good government to distribute as equally as possible those blessings which bounteous nature offers to all.\" It may readily be allowed that this reasoning is conclusive; but the great question returns, \"How far can equality prevail in a society which is secure? and what is possible to be done in the equal distribution of the blessings of nature?\" Till these questions be answered, we gain nothing by declaiming on the rights and equality of men; and the answers which have sometimes been given to them suppose a degree of perfection in human nature, which, if it were real, would make all civil institutions useless, as well as the reveries of those reformers. The conduct of the democratic states of Pagan antiquity, together with the oppressive anarchy and shameful violences which we have seen and still see in a neighbouring kingdom, will be considered by many as a full and satisfactory answer, deduced from experience, to all the schemes of the visionary theorist: such facts at least render the abolition of the order of nobility a matter of more importance, and of infinitely greater difficulty, than those who plead for it are disposed to allow.\n\nIt is an opinion not uncommon, and at least plausible, that the nobility of a well regulated state is the best security against monarchical despotism or lawless usurpation on the one hand, and the confusion of democratic insolence on the other. Self interest is the most powerful principle in the human breast; and it is obviously the interest of such men to preserve that balance of power in society upon which the very existence of their order depends. Corrupted as the present age confessedly is, a very recent instance could be given, in which the British House of Peers rescued at once the sovereign and the people from the threatened tyranny of a factious junto. As it is our business, however, to exhibit all opinions of any celebrity, we shall lay before our readers a short extract from Du Laure's Critical History of the French Nobility, which contains, in few but forcible words, some of the common arguments against this distinction of ranks.\n\n\"Nobility (says he), a distinction equally impolitic and immoral, and worthy of the times of ignorance and of rapine, which gave it birth, is a violation of the rights of that part of the nation that is deprived of it; and as equality becomes a stimulus towards distinction, so on the other hand this is the radical vice of a government and the source of a variety of evils. It is almost impossible that there should be any uncommon instances of virtue in a state, when reputations belong exclusively to a certain class of society, and when it costs them no more to obtain these than the trouble of being born. Amongst this list of privileged persons, virtues, talents, and genius, must of course be much less frequent than in the other classes, since, without the possession of any of these qualities, they who belong to it are still honoured and rewarded. Those who profit by this absurd subversion of principles, and those who lose by this unjust distribution of favours, which seem to have grown into a right, cannot have any other than false, immoral, and pernicious ideas concerning merit.\"\n\nA perfect equality, however, in rank and fortune has seldom been contended for, except by the most ignorant enthusiasts. It is indeed doubtful whether it could possibly exist. The more moderate and rational reformers have acknowledged, that as these differences have always existed in some way or other, so, from the infinite variety of talents and attainments in the world, we have reason to expect they will exist in every form of government and among every people. The question, therefore, is reduced to this: Whether the present mode of distinction, or any other which could be instituted in its stead, be upon the whole the best? That the present is not perfect, or wholly without faults, few will be sanguine enough to contradict: and a wise man in the sober hour of philosophical reflection will scarce presume to assert, that any other scheme which human ingenuity can plan would be wholly without imperfection, or altogether free from error. The case is, the errors of our own system are present, and on this account we see and feel them with peculiar force: the other plan we look forward to perhaps in too sanguine a manner, and we probably forget, in the delusive heat of imagination, that if distinction depended entirely on merit, we should scarce find a society of men so honest, or so able, as always to reward it according to its deserts; or if this were possible, as perhaps in the nature of things it is not, such is the self-partiality of the generality of men, that few would think he were dealt justly by if he were not promoted as well as his neighbour; and it is clearly impossible to promote every one. For such reasons then, and many more which our limits oblige us to omit, many think (and we are inclined to think with them), that it is safer to remain as we are, as we know the evils that attend our situation, and are still able to bear them, rather than to hazard a change, which,\nNobility, which, with some benefits, might also perhaps increase the troubles, and destroy many of the pleasures of social life.\n\nPerhaps it may not be amiss to lay before our readers the following observations from that most judicious commentator on the laws of England, Mr Justice Blackstone, on this important subject.\n\n\"The distinction of rank and honours (says he) is necessary in every well-governed state, in order to reward such as are eminent for their services to the public, in a manner the most desirable to individuals, and yet without burden to the community; exciting thereby an ambitious, yet laudable ardour, and generous emulation, in others. And emulation, or virtuous ambition, is a spring of action which, however dangerous or invidious in a mere republic or under a despotic sway, will certainly be attended with good effects under a free monarchy; where, without destroying its existence, its excesses may be continually restrained by that superior power from which all honour is derived. Such a spirit, when nationally diffused, gives life and vigour to the community; it sets all the wheels of government in motion, which, under a wise regulator, may be directed to any beneficial purpose; and thereby every individual may be made subservient to the public good, while he principally means to promote his own particular views. A body of nobility is also more peculiarly necessary in our mixed and compounded constitution, in order to support the rights of both the crown and the people, by forming a barrier to withstand the encroachments of both. It creates and preserves that gradual scale of dignity, which proceeds from the peasant to the prince; rising like a pyramid from a broad foundation, and diminishing to a point as it rises. It is this ascending and contracting proportion that adds stability to any government; for when the departure is sudden from one extreme to another, we may pronounce that state to be precarious. The nobility, therefore, are the pillars, which are reared from among the people, more immediately to support the throne; and, if that falls, they must also be buried under its ruins. Accordingly, when in the 17th century the commons had determined to extirpate monarchy, they also voted the house of lords to be useless and dangerous. And since titles of nobility are thus expedient in the state, it is also expedient that their owners should form an independent and separate branch of the legislature. If they were confounded with the mass of the people, and like them had only a vote in electing representatives, their privileges would soon be borne down and overwhelmed by the popular torrent, which would effectually level all distinctions. It is therefore highly necessary that the body of nobles should have a distinct assembly, distinct deliberations, and distinct powers from the commons.\"\u2014These remarks, at a time like the present, deserve our serious attention; nor do we suppose our readers will be displeased, if we add the following observations on the subject from a periodical publication of long standing and very considerable merit.\n\n\"Birth and nobility are a stronger obligation to virtue than is laid upon meaner persons. A vicious or dishonourable nobleman is in effect perjured; for his honour is his oath.\n\n\"Under the patriarchal scheme, and at the first setting out of the tribes, the heads of families had their Nobility, particular escutcheons, and their genealogies recorded with the utmost exactness: Even the Ancient of Days confirmed this; he often put his people in mind of the glory and virtues of their forefathers; and hath set a precedent for attainders, by visiting the third and fourth generation.\n\n\"It is a vulgar error to suppose, that his blest Son chose his followers out of the meanest of the people, because mechanics; for this was part of the education of every Jewish nobleman: Two of the number, being his kinsmen, were of the royal house of David; one was a Roman gentleman, and another of the royal family of Syria; and for the rest, he had the same right of creation as his Father and his vicegerents, of advancing the poor to honour, and of exalting the lowly and meek.\n\n\"The ancient Greeks and Romans paid great regard to nobility; but when the levelling principle obtained, and the people shared power and honour, those states soon dwindled and came to ruin. And in present Rome, great respect is paid to the renowned families of Colonna and Caesarei. In Venice, the notion of nobility is carried so high as to become inconsistent with a republican scheme. The Spaniards pay more regard to their old nobles than to their old Christians; and the French are but little behind them. What was said of the duke of Montmorency by Henry IV.\n\n\"That he was a better gentleman than himself,\" was, perhaps, the reason why the last heir of so illustrious a family was cut off, to make the house of Bourbon the first in France.\u2014The Welsh, Irish, and Poles, are remarkable for their attachment to blood and pedigree.\n\n\"It is for the sake of the meanest of our people, that the high value and regard for quality should be kept up; for they are best governed by those who seem formed for power: the robe of authority fits easily upon them, and submission is as much our choice as our duty; but upstarts prove the worst of tyrants.\n\n\"The ancient legislators, who studied human nature, thought it advisable, for the better government of states, that the people should be divided into the noble and the common. They judged it for the universal good of mankind, that the valiant and the wise should be separated from the rest, and appointed for council and command.\n\n\"To this I take it that the institution of nobility is owing in all countries; even those nations which we are pleased to call savage, distinguish the wise and the valiant, obey them as counsellors and commanders, which is placing them in the rank of nobles.\n\n\"Some, I know, look upon the institution of nobility to be one of the grossest impositions upon the common sense of mankind; they confine it indeed to hereditary nobility; they allow, that those who have done the commonwealth any signal service should be distinguished with honours, but it seems an absurdity to them that a man should be born a legislator, as if wisdom or a knowledge of government ran in the blood. But if they would consider how strong the love of posterity is planted in human nature, they must allow that nothing can be a stronger motive to great and worthy actions, than the notion that a man's posterity will reap the honour and profit of his labours.\"\nNobility. Besides, we are to suppose that men born to honours and a high fortune may be bred up in generous sentiments, and formed for the station they are to fill; that they must be strangers to those vicious falsehoods and corruptions which necessity first, and then habit, puts men upon practising, whose lives are spent in pursuit of their fortunes. I will own, notwithstanding all these advantages, that many of them are like rocks whose heads are in the clouds, but are so barren that they are quite incapable of producing anything; but in general, were their minds only upon a level with those of other men, we should expect better fruit from them.\n\n\"As authority is founded in opinion, all wise commonwealths have been extremely jealous in keeping up the honour of their nobility. Wherever they become base, effeminate, cowardly, or servile, their authority finks, they fall into contempt; then the people begin to consider them as useless to government, and look upon their privileges as a grievance to society, and perhaps they think how to get rid of them, as happened in the commonwealth of Florence, where, after the expulsion of the duke of Athens, a petty tyrant of that city, many of the nobility having behaved fervently to him, and insolently to the people, were degraded from the senate and the magistracy, and rendered incapable of holding any employment in the commonwealth.\n\n\"Father Paul, the Venetian, says, that you must either keep your nobility free from taint, or have no nobility at all: That the high employments of the commonwealth should be bestowed amongst the most ancient families, unless where a person should distinguish himself by some signal service to the state. Such a man would think himself sufficiently rewarded by the honour of being put upon a footing with the ancient nobility; and the nobility would be pleased to find that no commoner, except some of great reputation and merit, was to hold any of the employments usually possessed by their body. If the person so preferred should not be rich enough to support the dignity of the office, the state may give him a pension, but by no means should employments be made lucrative; which not only exhaust and weaken the commonwealth, but wherever the high employments are sought for profit, the nobility lose their generous sentiments, and it is a means of introducing corruption amongst them.\"\n\nThe origin of nobility in Europe is by some referred to the Goths; who, after they had seized a part of Europe, rewarded their captains with titles of honour, to distinguish them from the common people. We shall only in this place further consider the manner in which in our own country they may be created, and the incidents attending them; referring for a fuller account of their origin in Europe to the articles Revolution, and Civil Society.\n\n1. The right of peerage seems to have been originally territorial; that is, annexed to lands, honours, castles, manors, and the like; the proprietors and possessors of which were (in right of those estates) allowed to be peers of the realm, and were summoned to parliament to do suit and service to their sovereign; and, when the land was alienated, the dignity passed with it as appendant. Thus in England the bishops still sit in the house of lords in right of succession to certain ancient baronies annexed, or supposed to be Nobility annexed, to their episcopal lands; and thus in Henry VI., the possession of the castle of Arundel was adjudged to confer an earldom on its possessor. But afterwards, when Alienations grew to be frequent, the dignity of peerage was confined to the lineage of the party ennobled, and instead of territorial became personal. Actual proof of a tenure by barony became no longer necessary to constitute a lord of parliament; but the record of the writ of summons to him or his ancestors was admitted as a sufficient evidence of the tenure.\n\nPeers of Great Britain are now created either by writ or by patent; for those who claim by prescription must suppose either a writ or patent made to their ancestors; though by length of time it is lost. The creation by writ or the king's letter is a summons to attend the house of peers, by the style and title of that barony which the king is pleased to confer: that by patent is a royal grant to a subject of any dignity and degree of peerage. The creation by writ is the more ancient way; but a man is not ennobled thereby, unless he actually take his seat in the house of lords; and some are of opinion that there must be at least two writs of summons, and a fitting in two distinct parliaments, to evidence a hereditary barony; and therefore the most usual, because the surest way, is to grant the dignity by patent, which endures to a man and his heirs according to the limitation thereof, though he never himself makes use of it. Yet it is frequent to call up the eldest son of a peer to the house of lords by writ of summons, in the name of his father's barony, because in that case there is no danger of his children's losing the nobility in case he never takes his seat; for they will succeed to their grandfather. Creation by writ has also one advantage over that by patent; for a person created by writ holds the dignity to him and his heirs, without any words to that purport in the writ; but in letters patent there must be words to direct the inheritance, else the dignity endures only to the grantee for life. For a man or woman may be created noble for their own lives, and the dignity not descend to their heirs at all, or descend only to some particular heirs: as where a peerage is limited to a man and the heirs male of his body by Elizabeth his present lady, and not to such heirs by any former or future wife.\n\n2. Let us next take a view of a few of the principal incidents attending the nobility,\u2014exclusive of their capacity as members of parliament, and as hereditary counsellors of the crown; for both which we refer to the articles Lords and Parliament. And first we must observe, that in criminal cases a nobleman shall be tried by his peers. The great are always obnoxious to popular envy: were they to be judged by the people, they might be in danger from the prejudice of their judges; and would moreover be deprived of the privilege of the meanest subjects, that of being tried by their equals, which is secured to all the realm by magna charta, c. 29. It is said, that this does not extend to bishops, who, though they are lords of parliament, and fit there by virtue of their baronies which they hold jure ecclesiastic, yet are not ennobled in blood, and consequently not peers with the nobility. As to peersesses, no provision was made for their\ntheir trial when accused of treason or felony, till after Eleanor duchess of Gloucester, wife to the lord protector, had been accused of treason, and found guilty of witchcraft, in an ecclesiastical synod, through the intrigues of Cardinal Beaufort. This very extraordinary trial gave occasion to a special statute, 20 Hen. VI. c. 9, which enacts, that peers, either in their own right or by marriage, shall be tried before the same judicature as peers of the realm. If a woman, noble in her own right, marries a commoner, she still remains noble, and shall be tried by her peers; but if she be only noble by marriage, then by a second marriage with a commoner she loses her dignity; for as by marriage it is gained, by marriage it is also lost. Yet if a duchess dowager marries a baron, she continues a duchess till; for all the nobility are peers, and therefore it is no degradation. A peer or peeress (either in her own right or by marriage) cannot be arrested in civil cases; and they have also many peculiar privileges annexed to their peerage in the course of judicial proceedings. A peer fitting in judgement, gives not his verdict upon oath, like an ordinary jurymen, but upon his honour; he answers also to bills in chancery upon his honour, and not upon his oath; but, when he is examined as a witness either in civil or criminal cases, he must be sworn; for the respect which the law shows to the honour of a peer does not extend so far as to overturn a settled maxim, that in judicio non creditur nisi juratus. The honour of peers is however so highly tendered by the law, that it is much more penal to spread false reports of them, and certain other great officers of the realm, than of other men: scandal against them being called by the peculiar name of scandalum magnatum, and subjected to peculiar punishment by divers ancient statutes.\n\nA peer cannot lose his nobility but by death or attainder; though there was an instance, in the reign of Edward IV., of the degradation of George Neville duke of Bedford by act of parliament, on account of his poverty, which rendered him unable to support his dignity. But this is a singular instance, which serves at the same time, by having happened, to show the power of parliament; and, by having happened but once, to show how tender the parliament hath been in exerting so high a power. It hath been said indeed, that if a baron wastes his estate, so that he is not able to support the degree, the king may degrade him; but it is expressly held by later authorities, that a peer cannot be degraded but by act of parliament.\n\nAntonius Matthaeus observes, that nobility, among the Romans, was a quite different thing from what it is among us. The nobles, among the Romans, were either those raised to the magistrature, or descended from magistrates: there was no such thing as nobility by patent.\n\nBartoli says, that doctors, after they have held a professor's chair in an university for 20 years, become noble; and are entitled to all the rights of counts.\n\nBut this claim is not admitted at court, &c. though Bartoli's sentiments be backed with those of several other authors, particularly Chaffanoux in his Confucius-din Burgundicus; Royer for la Coutume de Berry; Faber C. de Dig. Def. 9. &c. which last, however, restrains Bartoli's rule to doctors in law, and princes physicians.\n\nBy an edict of the French king in 1669, it is declared, that trade shall not derogate from nobility, provided the person do not fall by retail.\n\nIn Bretagne, by ancient custom, a nobleman loses nothing by trading even in retail; but he realiurnes all his rights as soon as he ceases traffic, his nobility having slept all the time.\n\nIn Germany, a woman, not noble by birth, doth not become, v. gr. a countess or baroness by marrying a count or baron: a lady of the higher degree indeed becomes a princess by marrying a prince; but this does not hold of a lady of the lower nobility.\n\nOn the coast of Malabar, children are only capable of being noble by the mother's side; it being allowed them to take as many husbands as they please, and to quit them whenever they think proper.","sp":37,"ep":41},{"h":"NOBLE","t":"Nobilitis, a person who has a privilege which raises him above a commoner or peasant, either by birth, by office, or by patent from his prince. The word comes from the Latin nobilitas; formed from the ancient nobilitas, \"distinguihable, remarkable.\"\n\nIn England, the word noble is of a narrower import than in other countries, being confined to persons above the degree of knights; whereas, abroad, it comprehends not only knights, but what we simply call gentlemen. The nobles of England are also called peers regni, as being nobilitatis pares, though gradu impares.\n\nThe Venetian noblesse is famous; it is in this that the sovereignty of the state resides. It is divided into three classes. The first only comprehends 24 families. The second includes the descendants of all those who were entered in the Golden Book, in 1280, and destined to govern the state, which then began to be aristocratic. The third consists of such as have bought the dignity of noble Venetians. This last class is only admitted to the inferior employ; the two former to all indifferently. The title of noble Venetian is sometimes also given to foreign kings, princes, &c.\n\nNobles, among the Romans, were such as had the jus imaginum, or the right of using the pictures or statues of their ancestors; a right which was allowed only to those whose ancestors had borne some curule office, that is, had been curule edile, censor, praetor, or consul. For a long time, none but the patricii were the nobles, because no person but of that superior rank could bear any curule office; hence in Livy, Sallust, &c. nobilitas is used to signify the patrician order, and opposed to plebs. To make the true meaning of nobilitas fill more clear, let it be observed, that the Roman people were divided into nobiles, novi, and ignobiles. Nobiles were they who had the pictures, &c. of their ancestors; novi were such as had only their own; ignobiles were such as had neither. See Jus Imaginis.\n\nThe Roman nobility, by way of distinction, wore a half moon upon their shoes, especially those of patrician rank.\n\nThe Grecian nobility were called Eumegides, as being descended from those old heroic ancestors so famous in history. Such were the Praxiergidae, Etrobutidae, Alexanidae, &c. all which had many privileges annexed to their quality; amongst which was this, that they wore griffon heads in their hair as a badge of nobility.\n\nNoble, a money of account containing six shillings and eight pence.\n\nThe noble was anciently a real coin struck in the reign of Edward III. and then called the penny of gold; but\nbut it was afterwards called a rofe-noble, from its being stamped with a rofe: it was current at 6s. 8d.","sp":41,"ep":42},{"h":"NOCERA","t":"a town in Italy, in the dominions of the king of Naples and Sicily, or, as he is more commonly called, the king of the Two Sicilies. It is an episcopal city, but might with greater propriety be styled a cluster of villages; its several parts being extended along the foot of the mountains, form the Citt\u00e0 Sotana, or low town; and the bishop's palace, together with some convents embowered in cypresses groves, cover the peak of a single hill in a very picturesque manner, and compose the Citt\u00e0 Sopra.\n\nNocera (A), it is reported, contains near 30,000 inhabitants; they are dispersed in forty patches of habitation. Their houses are constructed of two kinds of stone: the common walls are built with yellow tufa dug out of the hills that lie about a mile to the east of the town; which stone seems unquestionably to have been formed by a conglomeration of substances thrown out of Vesuvius, because, on opening these quarries, the workmen have frequently discovered tombs, vases, and coins locked up in the body of the stony stratum. The cases of their doors and windows are made of a black stone drawn from the hill of Fiano, two miles to the north: it lies eight feet below the surface, in a bed or vein 140 feet thick, resting upon a base of sand. This seems evidently to be a stream of lava congealed.\n\nNocera is a place of very considerable antiquity: in the 13th century it was called de Pagani, to distinguish it from a city in Umbria of a similar name; this addition was in allusion to a colony of Saracens which Frederick of Swabia brought from Sicily, and settled here, that they might be out of the way of their dangerous connexions with Africa: hence Nocera has often been confounded with Lucera by the negligent or ignorant chroniclers of the succeeding ages. The most remarkable event that occurs in its history is the siege of its castle, A.D. 1384. E. Long. 12\u00b0 49'. N.

When the disease is moderate, the persons affected with it only repeat the actions of the day on getting out of bed, and go quietly to the places they frequented at other times; but those who have it in the most violent degree, go up to dangerous places, and do things which would terrify them to Noctiluca, think of when they are awake. These are by some called lunatic night-walkers, because fits are observed to return with the most frequency and violence at the changes of the moon.\u2014For the cure some recommend purging and a cooling regimen: others are of opinion that the best method is to place a vessel of water at the patient's bedside in such a manner that he will naturally step into it when he gets out of bed; or if that should fail, a person should fit up to watch and beat him every time it happens.

Those commonly in use among seamen are two; the one adapted to the polar star, and the first of the guards of the Little Bear; the other to the pole star, and the pointers of the Great Bear.\n\nThis instrument consists of two circular plates, applied to each other. The greater, which has a handle to hold the instrument, is about 2\u00bd inches diameter, and is divided into twelve parts, agreeing to the twelve months; and each month subdivided into every fifth day; and so as that the middle of the handle corresponds to that day of the year wherein the star here regarded has the same right ascension with the sun. If the instrument be fitted for two stars, the handle is made moveable. The upper left circle is divided into twenty-four equal parts for the twenty-four hours of the day, and each hour subdivided into quarters. These twenty-four hours are noted by twenty-four teeth to be told in the night. Those at the hour 12 are distinguished by their length. In the centre of the two circular plates is adjusted a long index, moveable upon the upper plate; and the three pieces, viz. the two circles and index, are joined by a rivet which is pierced through the centre with a hole, through which the star is to be observed.\n\nTo use the nocturnal, turn the upper plate till the long tooth, marked 12, be against the day of the month on the under plate; then, bringing the instrument near the eye, suspend it by the handle with the plane nearly parallel to the equinoctial, and viewing the pole star through the hole of the centre, turn the index about, till, by the edge coming from the centre, you see the bright star or guard of the Little Bear, (if the instrument be fitted to that star): then that tooth of the upper circle, under the edge of the index, is at the hour of the night on the edge of the hour circle, which may be known without a light, by counting the teeth from the longest, which is for the hour 12.\n\n(a) Anciently, Nuceria Alphaterna, a word of unknown etymology.

The other node D, where the planet descends to the south, is called the descending node, or the dragon's tail, marked thus \u03a8.\n\nThe line CD, wherein the two circles CEDF and CGDH intersect, is called the line of nodes. It appears from observation, that the line of the nodes of all the planets constantly changes its place, and shifts its situation from east to west, contrary to the order of the signs; and that the line of the moon's nodes, by a retrograde motion, finishes its circulation in the compass of 19 years; after which time, either of the nodes having receded from any point of the ecliptic, returns to the same again; and when the moon is in the node, she is also seen in the ecliptic. If the line of nodes were immovable, that is, if it had no other motion than that whereby it is carried round the sun, it would always look to the same point of the ecliptic, or would keep parallel to itself, as the axis of the earth does.\n\nFrom what hath been said, it is evident, that the moon can never be observed precisely in the ecliptic, but twice in every period; that is, when she enters the nodes. When she is at her greatest distance from the nodes, viz. in the points E, F, she is said to be in her limits.\n\nThe moon must be in or near one of the nodes, when there is an eclipse of the sun or moon.\n\nTo make the foregoing account of the motion of the moon's nodes still clearer, let the plane of fig. 2. represent that of the ecliptic, S the sun, T the centre of the earth, L the moon in her orbit DN dn.

Its effect is twofold: 1. It diminishes its inclination by a motion which we may conceive as performed round the diameter Dd, to which LT is perpendicular. 2.

Sciences at Paris, of the Royal Society of London, of the Institution of Bologna, and of the Academy of Sciences of Erfurt; was born at Pimbr\u00e9, in the diocese of Noyon, on the 17th of November 1700, of respectable but not wealthy parents. To make up the want of riches, they determined to give their son a good education. They sent him to the college of Clermont in Beauvais, and afterwards to Beauvais, there to finish his introductory studies. The progress which he made in the different classes, determined them to send him to study philosophy at Paris. Thenceforward they intended him for the clerical order; and they considered the strictness and purity of his morals, together with his unwearied application to study, as sufficient proofs of his vocation. The young Nollet yielded without reluctance to the wishes of his parents. As soon as he was capable of showing an inclination for any thing, he had discovered a taste for physics; but this was not become his ruling passion; he therefore sacrificed it to the study of scholastic divinity, to which he wholly dedicated himself during his time of probation in 1728. No sooner had he been invested with the deaconship, than he solicited and obtained a license to preach. This new occupation, however, did not make him entirely lose sight of those studies which had first engaged his attention. They insensibly began to occupy a greater portion of his time, which was now more equally divided between theology and the sciences. The latter, however, prevailed; and thenceforth he entered into the study of physics with an ardour which was only increased by that kind of privation to which he had been long subject. He was received into the Society of Arts, established at Paris under the patronage of the late count de Clermont. In 1730, the abbe Nollet was engaged in a work conductedly with Reaumur and du Fay of the Academy of Sciences. In 1734, he went to London in company with M. M. du Fay, du Hamel, and de Juffieu. His merit procured him a place in the Royal Society without any solicitation. Two years after, he went to Holland, where he formed an intimate connection with Desaguliers, Gravefendt, and Mouchenbroeck. On his return to Paris, he resumed the course of experimental physics which he had begun in 1735, and which he continued till 1760. These courses of physics first suggested the idea of particular courses in other branches of science, such as in chemistry, anatomy, natural history, &c. In 1738, the count de Maurepas prevailed on the cardinal Fleury to establish a public class for experimental physics; and the abbe Nollet was appointed the first professor. In the beginning of the year 1739, he was admitted a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences; and in the month of April following, the king of Sardinia intending to establish a professorship of physics at Turin, invited the abbe Nollet into his dominions. From thence he travelled into Italy. In 1744, he was honoured with an invitation to Versailles, to instruct the dauphin in experimental philosophy; the king and royal family were often present at his lectures. The qualities as well of his understanding as of his heart gained him the esteem and confidence of his pupil. Going one day in state to Paris, he caused intimation to be made that he was to dine at the Tuileries. M. Nollet having gone thither to pay his court, the dauphin no sooner perceived him, than he had the goodness to say, \"Binet has the advantage of me, he has been at your house.\" Till the period of his death, this prince showed marks of the strongest attachment and favour for this ingenious philosopher. He would have wished that he had been a little more attentive to the improvement of his fortune. He prevailed upon him to go and pay court to a man in power, whose patronage might have been of service to him. The abbe Nollet accordingly waited upon the placeman, and made him a present of his works. \"I never read any works of that kind,\" said the patron coldly, and casting a look at the volumes before him. \"Sir (replied the abbe), will you allow them to remain in your antechamber? There perhaps there may be found men of genius who will read them with pleasure.\" In the month of April 1749, he made a grand tour into Italy, being sent thither for the purpose of making observations. At Turin, Venice, and Bologna, the abbe Nollet appeared as a deputy from the philosophers of the rest of Europe. During his short stay in Italy, the wonders of electricity were not the only object of his researches; every part of physics, the arts, agriculture, &c. came equally under his notice. Upon his return through Turin, the king of Sardinia, always truly sensible of his merit, offered him the order of Saint Maurice, which he did not think proper to accept without his sovereign's permission. In 1753, the king instituted a class of experimental philosophy in the royal college of Navarre, and appointed the abbe Nollet professor. In 1757, he received from the king a brevet appointing him preceptor in physics and natural history to the Enfans de France. In the month of August, the same year, he was appointed professor of experimental philosophy in the school of artillery, at that time established at la Fere. In the month of November following, he was admitted as a pensionary of the Royal Academy of Sciences. M. de Cremillo, director general of artillery and fortification, having founded a class of experimental philosophy at Mezieres in 1761, the abbe Nollet was appointed professor. This celebrated and laborious philosopher, who has rendered the most important services to physics by the discoveries with which he has enriched every branch of this science, but particularly electricity, died at Paris on the 25th of April 1770, aged 70; much regretted by the literary world, and by his friends, of whom his gentle character and benevolent heart had procured him a great number. He often retired from the gay and splendid societies of Paris, to give affluence to his relations, who were by no means affluent circumstances. His works are, 1.

They were great dealers in words, whence they were vulgarly denominated Word-sellers; but had the denomination of Nominalists, because, in opposition to the Realists, they maintained, that words, and not things, were the object of dialectics.\n\nThis sect had its first rise towards the end of the 11th century, and pretended to follow Porphyry and Aristotle; but it was not till Ocham's time that they bore the name. The chief of this sect, in the 11th century, was a person called John, who, on account of his logical subtlety, was called the sophist; and his principal disciples were Robert of Paris, Roscelin of Compi\u00e8gne, and Arnoul of Laon. At the beginning, the Nominals had the upper hand; but the Realists, though greatly divided among themselves, were supported by men of great abilities; such as Albertus Magnus, T. Aquinas, and Duns Scotus. The nominal sect came hereby into disrepute; till William Occam, in the 14th century, again revived it, and filled France and Germany with the flame of disputation. Having joined the party of the Franciscan monks, who strenuously opposed John XXII., that pope himself, and his successors after him, left no means untried to extirpate the philosophy of the Nominalists, which was deemed highly prejudicial to the interests of the church: and hence it was, that, in the year 1339, the university of Paris, by a public edict, solemnly condemned and prohibited the philosophy of Occam, which was that of the Nominalists. The consequence was, that the Nominalists flourished more than ever. In the 15th century, the controversy was continued with more vigour and animosity than before; and the disputants were not content with using merely the force of eloquence, but had frequently recourse to more hostile and dangerous weapons; and battles were the consequence of a philosophical question, which neither side understood. In most places, however, the Realists maintained a manifest superiority over the Nominalists. While the famous Germon, and the most eminent of his disciples were living, the Nominalists were in high esteem and credit in the university of Paris. But upon the death of these patrons, the face of things was much changed to their disadvantage. In the year 1473, Louis XI., by the instigation of his confessor, the bishop of Avranches, issued out a severe edict against the doctrines of the Nominalists, and ordered all their writings to be seized and secured, that they might not be read by the people; but the same monarch mitigated this edict the year following, and permitted some of the books of that sect to be delivered from their confinement. In the year 1481, he not only granted a full liberty to the Nominalists and their writings, but also restored that philosophical sect to its former authority and lustre in the university.\n\nThe Nominalists were the founders of the university of Leipzig: and there are many yet abroad who pique themselves on being Nominals.\n\nThe Nominals, with the Stoics, admit the formal conceptions or ideas of things, as the subject and foundation of universality: but to this they add names, which represent and signify, after the same univocal manner, and without any distinction, a great variety of single things alike in genus and species.\n\nWhence it is that they are called Nominals; as pretending, that to become learned, it is not enough to have just ideas of things, but it is likewise required to know the proper names of the genera and species of things, and to be able to express them clearly and precisely, without confusion or ambiguity.","sp":45,"ep":45},{"h":"NOMINATIVE","t":"in Grammar, the first case of nouns which are declinable.\n\nThe simple position, or laying down of a noun, or name,\nname, is called the nominative case; yet it is not so properly a case, as the matter or ground whence the other cases are to be formed, by the several changes and inflections given to this first termination.

Nothing is to be seen that indicates the grandeur of the Roman times; neither are there any remains of barbarous magnificence, to put one in mind of the ages in which the kings of the Great Slavi had their residence there. It lies on a small island, surrounded by a harbour, which in former times was capable of receiving large ships; but is now become a field pool by means of a little muddy river that falls into it, after a course of about six miles through the rich abandoned fields of that district. The ancient inhabitants turned this water into another channel, and made it run through the valley of Drausnich into the sea; and the remains of the bank raised by them for that purpose are still to be seen. Notwithstanding, however, the depopulation of this district, and the dreary situation of Nona in particular, the new inhabitants have not lost courage; and animated by the privileges granted to them by the most serene republic, are endeavouring to bring the population and agriculture once more into a flourishing state. Proper drains for the water would not only render that rich territory habitable, but moreover very fertile; and the brackish marsh that surrounds the walls of Nona is well calculated to supply a considerable quantity of fish, especially eels. The government generously granted the inviolability to private persons, who already draw no inconsiderable advantage from the fishing; and did they but adopt better methods, they might every year salt many thousands of eels, which would greatly antiver our internal commerce, and save at least a part of the money that goes out of the country for foreign salt fish.\n\nTo the left of the city of Nona, the walls of some ancient ruinous buildings appear; which probably in ancient times were situated on the main land, though now surrounded by water.

First, Such as absent themselves from divine worship in the established church through total irreligion, and attend the service of no other persuasion. These, by the statute 1 Eliz. c. 2. 23 Eliz. c. 1. and 3 Jac. I. c. 4. forfeit one shilling to the poor every Lord's day they so absent themselves, and 2d. to the king if they continue such default for a month together. And if they keep any innate thus irreligiously disfavored in their houses, they forfeit 10l. per month.\n\nThe second species of nonconformists are those who offend through a mistaken or perverse zeal. Such were esteemed, by the English laws enacted since the time of the Reformation, to be Papists and Protestant dissenters: both of which were supposed to be equally schismatics, in not communicating with the national church; with this difference, that the Papists divided from it upon material, though erroneous, reasons; but many of the dissenters upon matters of indifference, or, in other words, for no reason at all. \"Yet certainly Blackfriars (says Sir William Blackstone) our ancestors were mis-conceived taken in their plans of compulsion and intolerance. The sin of schism, as such, is by no means the object of temporal coercion and punishment. If, through weakness of intellect, through midedirected piety, through prejudices and acerbity of temper, or (which is often the case) through a prospect of secular advantage in herding with a party, men quarrel with the ecclesiastical establishment, the civil magistrate has nothing to do with it; unless their tenets and practice are such as threaten ruin or disturbance to the state. He is bound indeed to protect the established church: and if this can be better effected by admitting none but its genuine members to offices of trust and emolument, he is certainly at liberty to do; the disfranchisal of offices being matter of favour and discretion. But this point being once secured, all persecution for diversity of opinions, however ridiculous or absurd they may be, is contrary to every principle of sound policy and civil freedom. The names and subordination of the clergy, the posture of devotion, the materials and colour of the minister's garment, the joining in a known or unknown form of prayer, and other matters of the same kind, must be left to the option of every man's private judgement.\n\n\"With regard therefore to Protestant dissenters, although the experience of their turbulent disposition in former times occasioned several disabilities and restrictions (which I shall not undertake to justify) to be laid upon them by abundance of statutes; yet at length the legislature, with a true spirit of magnanimity, extended that indulgence to these sectaries, which they themselves, when in power, had held to be countenancing schism, and denied to the church of England. The penalties are conditionally suspended by the statute 1 W. & M. ii. c. 18. \"for exempting their majesties Protestant subjects, dissenting from the church of England, from the penalties of certain laws,\" commonly called\ncalled the toleration act; which declares, that neither the laws above mentioned, nor the statutes 1 Eliz. c. 2. \u00a7 14. 3 Jac. I. c. 4. and 5, nor any other penal laws made against Popish recusants (except the test acts), shall extend to any dissenters, other than Papists and such as deny the Trinity: provided, 1. That they take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, (or make a similar affirmation, being Quakers), and subscribe the declaration against Popery. 2. That they repair to some congregation certified to and registered in the court of the bishop or archdeacon, or at the county sessions. 3. That the doors of such meeting-house shall be unlocked, unbarred, and unbolted; in default of which, the persons meeting there are still liable to all the penalties of the former acts. Dissenting teachers, in order to be exempted from the penalties of the statutes 13 and 14 Car. II. c. 4. 17 Car. II. c. 2. and 22 Car. II. c. 1., are also to subscribe the articles of religion mentioned in the statute 13 Eliz. c. 12. (viz. those which only concern the confession of the true Christian faith, and the doctrine of the sacraments), with an express exception of those relating to the government and powers of the church, and to infant baptism. And by stat. 10 Ann. c. 2. this toleration is ratified and confirmed; and it is declared, that the said act shall at all times be inviolably observed for the exempting such Protestant dissenters as are thereby intended from the pains and penalties therein mentioned. Thus, though the offence of non-conformity is by no means universally abrogated, it is suspended, and ceases to exist with regard to these Protestant dissenters, during their compliance with the conditions imposed by the act of toleration: and, under these conditions, all persons, who will approve themselves no Papists or oppugners of the Trinity, are left at full liberty to act as their consciences shall direct them in the matter of religious worship. And if any person shall wilfully, maliciously, or contemptuously disturb any congregation assembled in any church or permitted meeting-house, or shall mischievously preach or teach there, he shall (by virtue of the same statute) be bound over to the sessions of the peace, and forfeit 20l. But by statute 5 Geo. I. c. 4., no mayor or principal magistrate must appear at any dissenting meeting with the ensigns of his office, on pain of disfavour to hold that or any other office: the legislature judging it a matter of propriety, that a mode of worship, set up in opposition to the national, when allowed to be exercised in peace, should be exercised also with decency, gratitude, and humility. Neither doth the act of toleration extend to enervate those clauses of the statutes 13 & 14 Car. II. c. 4. and 17 Car. II. c. 2. which prohibit (upon pain of fine and imprisonment) all persons from teaching school, unless they be licensed by the ordinary, and subscribe a declaration of conformity to the liturgy of the church, and reverently frequent divine service established by the laws of this kingdom.\n\n\"As to Papists what has been said of the Protestant dissenters would hold equally strong for a general toleration of them; provided their separation was founded only upon difference of opinion in religion, and their principles did not also extend to a subversion of the civil government. If once they could be brought to renounce the supremacy of the Pope, they might quietly enjoy their seven sacraments; their purgatory, and auricular confession; their worship of relics and images; nay, even their transubstantiation. But while they acknowledge a foreign power, superior to the sovereignty of the kingdom, they cannot complain, if the laws of that kingdom will not treat them upon the footing of good subjects.\n\n\"The following are the laws that have been enacted against the Papists; who may be divided into three classes, persons professing Popery, Popish recusants convict, and Popish priests. 1. Persons professing the Popish religion, besides the former penalties for not frequenting their parish church, are disfavored from taking any lands either by descent or purchase, after 18 years of age, until they renounce their errors; they must at the age of 21 register their estates before acquired, and all future conveyances and wills relating to them; they are incapable of presenting to any advowson, or granting to any person any avoidance of the same; they may not keep or teach any school, under pain of perpetual imprisonment; and, if they willingly say or hear mass, they forfeit the one 200l., the other 100 marks, and each shall suffer a year's imprisonment. Thus much for persons, who, from the misfortune of family prejudices, or otherwise, have conceived an unhappy attachment to the Romish church from their infancy, and publicly profess its errors. But if any evil industry is used to rivet these errors upon them; if any person lends another abroad to be educated in the Popish religion, or to reside in any religious house abroad for that purpose, or contributes to their maintenance when there; both the lender, the lent, and the contributor, are disfavored to sue in law or equity, to be executor or administrator to any person, to take any legacy or deed of gift, and to bear any office in the realm; and shall forfeit all their goods and chattels, and likewise all their real estate for life. And where these errors are also aggravated by apostasy or perversion; where a person is reconciled to the see of Rome, or procures others to be reconciled, the offence amounts to high treason. 2. Popish recusants, convicted in a court of law of not attending the service of the church of England, are subject to the following disabilities, penalties, and forfeitures, over and above those before mentioned. They are considered as persons excommunicated; they can hold no office or employment; they must not keep arms in their houses, but the same may be seized by the justices of the peace; they may not come within 10 miles of London, on pain of 100l.; they can bring no action at law or suit in equity; they are not permitted to travel above five miles from home, unless by license, upon pain of forfeiting all their goods; and they may not come to court, under pain of 100l. No marriage or burial of such recusant, or baptism of his child, shall be had otherwise than by the ministers of the church of England, under other severe penalties. A married woman, when recusant, shall forfeit two-thirds of her dower or jointure, may not be executrix or administratrix to her husband, or have any part of his goods; and during the coverture may be kept in prison, unless her husband redeems her, at the rate of 10l. a month, or the third part of all his lands. And lastly, as a female covert recusant may be imprisoned, so all others must, within three months after conviction, either submit and renounce their errors, or, if required to do by four justices, must abjure and renounce the realm: and if they do not depart, or if they re-\nturn without the king's licence, they shall be guilty of felony, and suffer death as felons, without benefit of clergy. There is also an inferior species of recusancy, (refusing to make the declaration against Popery enjoined by statute 30 Car. II. c. 2. when tendered by the proper magistrate;) which, if the party resides within ten miles of London, makes him an absolute recusant convict; or, if at a greater distance, suspends him from having any seat in parliament, keeping arms in his house, or any horse above the value of \u00a31. 3. Popish priests are in a still more dangerous condition. By statute 11 & 12 W. III. c. 4. Popish priests, or bishops, celebrating mass or exercising any part of their functions in England, except in the houses of ambassadors, are liable to perpetual imprisonment. And by the statute 27 Eliz. c. 2. any Popish priest, born in the dominions of the crown of England, who shall come over hither from beyond sea (unless driven by storms of weather and tarrying only a reasonable time), or shall be in England three days without conforming and taking the oaths, is guilty of high treason: and all persons harbouring him are guilty of felony without the benefit of clergy.\n\n\"This is a short summary of the laws against the Papists; of which the president Montesquieu observes, that they are so rigorous, though not professedly of the sanguinary kind, that they do all the hurt that can possibly be done in cold blood. But in answer to this, it may be observed (what foreigners who only judge from our statute book are not fully apprized of), that these laws are seldom exerted to their utmost rigour: and indeed, if they were, it would be very difficult to excuse them. For they are rather to be accounted for from their history, and the urgency of the times which produced them, than to be approved (upon a cool review) as a standing system of law. The nefarious machinations of the Jesuits during the reign of Elizabeth, the turbulence and uneasiness of the Papists under the new religious establishment, and the boldness of their hopes and wishes for the succession of the queen of Scots, obliged the parliament to counteract so dangerous a spirit by laws of a great, and then perhaps necessary, severity. The powder-treason, in the succeeding reign, struck a panic into James I. which operated in different ways: it occasioned the enacting of new laws against the Papists; but deterred him from putting them in execution. The intrigues of Queen Henrietta in the reign of Charles I., the protest of a Popish successor in that of Charles II., the allusion-plot in the reign of King William, and the avowed claim of a Popish pretender to the crown in subsequent reigns, will account for the extension of these penalties at those several periods of our history.\"\n\nBut now that all just fears of a pretender may be said to have vanished, and the power and influence of the pope has become feeble, ridiculous, and despicable, not only in Britain, but in almost every kingdom of Europe: and as in fact the British Catholics solemnly disclaim the dangerous principles ascribed to them; the British legislature, giving way to that liberality of sentiment becoming Protestants, have lately repealed the most rigorous of the above edicts, viz. The punishment of Popish priests or Jesuits who should be found to teach or officiate in the services of that church; which acts were felony in foreigners, and high treason in the natives of this kingdom:\u2014The forfeitures of Nonconformists heirs, who had received their education abroad; and whose estates went to the next Protestant heir:\u2014The power given to the son, or other relation, being a Protestant, to take possession of the father's or other relation's estate, during the life of the real proprietor:\u2014And the debarring Papists from the power of acquiring any legal property by purchase.\u2014In proposing the repeal of these penalties, it was observed, That, besides that some of them had now ceased to be necessary, others were at all times a disgrace to humanity. The imprisonment of a Popish priest for life, only for officiating in the services of his religion, was horrible in its nature: And although the mildness of government had hitherto softened the rigour of the law in the practice, it was to be remembered that the Roman Catholic priests constantly lay at the mercy of the basest and most abandoned of mankind\u2014of common informers; for on the evidence of any of these wretches, the magisterial and judicial powers were of necessity bound to enforce all the shameful penalties of the act. Others of these penalties held out the most powerful temptations for the commission of acts of depravity, at the very thought of which our nature recoils with horror: They seemed calculated to loosen all the bands of society: to dissolve all civil, moral, and religious obligations and duties, to poison the sources of domestic felicity, and to annihilate every principle of honour. The encouragement given to children to lay their hands upon the estates of their parents, and the restriction which bars any man from the honest acquisition of property, need only to be mentioned to excite indignation in an enlightened age.\n\nIn order the better to secure the English established church against perils from nonconformists of all denominations, Infidels, Turks, Jews, Heretics, Papists, and Sectaries, there are, however, two bulwarks erected; called the corporation and test acts: By the former of which, no person can be legally elected to any office relating to the government of any city or corporation, unless, within a twelvemonth before, he has received the sacrament of the Lord's supper according to the rites of the church of England; and he is also enjoined to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy at the same time that he takes the oath of office: or, in default of either of these requisites, such election shall be void. The other, called the test act, directs all officers civil and military to take the oaths and make the declaration against transubstantiation, in any of the king's courts at Westminster, or at the quarter sessions, within six calendar months after their admission; and also within the same time to receive the sacrament of the Lord's supper, according to the usage of the church of England, in some public church immediately after divine service and sermon, and to deliver into court a certificate thereof signed by the minister and church warden, and also to prove the same by two credible witnesses; upon forfeiture of \u00a3500l. and disqualification to hold the said office. And of much the same nature with these is the statute 7 Jac. I. c. 2. which permits no persons to be naturalized or restored in blood, but such as undergo a like test: which test having been removed in 1753, in favour of the Jews, was the next session of parliament restored again with some precipitation.\nNon-naturals, in Medicine, so called, because by their abuse they become the causes of diseases.\n\nPhysicians have divided the non-naturals into six classes, viz. the air, meats and drinks, sleep and watching, motion and rest, the passions of the mind, the retentions and excretions. See Medicine, passim.\n\nNon-obstante (notwithstanding) a clause frequent in statutes and letters patent, importing a license from the king to do a thing, which at common law might be lawfully done, but being restrained by act of parliament cannot be done without such license.\n\nNon-Pro.

March, May, July, and October, had six days in their nones; because these alone, in the ancient constitution of the year by Numa, had 31 days apiece, the rest having only 29, and February 30: but when Caesar reformed the year, and made other months contain 31 days, he did not allot them five days of nones.\n\nNonjurors, those who refused to take the oaths to government, and who were in consequence under certain incapacities, and liable to certain severe penalties. It can scarcely be said that there are any nonjurors now in the kingdom; and it is well known that all penalties have been removed both from Papists and Protestants, formerly of that denomination, as well in Scotland as in England. The members of the Episcopal church of Scotland have long been denominated Nonjurors; but perhaps they are now called so improperly, as the ground of their difference from the establishment is more on account of ecclesiastical than political principles.\n\nNonius, Peter, in Spanish Nunez, a learned Portuguese, and one of the ablest mathematicians of the 16th century, was born at Alcacer. He was preceptor to Don Henry, King Emmanuel's son, and taught the mathematics in the university of Coimbra. He published the following works, by which he gained great reputation: 1. De arte Navigandi. 2. Annotations in theorias planetarum Purbachii; which are greatly esteemed. 3. A treatise De Crepulculis. 4. A treatise on Algebra. It is observed in Furetiere's dictionary, that Peter Nonius, in 1530, first invented the angles of 45 degrees made in every meridian, and that he called them rhumbs in his language, and calculated them by spherical triangles. Nonius died in 1577, aged 80.\n\nNonius, the name which was not many years ago given to the common device for subdividing the arcs of quadrants and other astronomical instruments, from the persuasion that it was invented by Nonius or Nunez, of whom some account has been given in the preceding article. The generality of astronomers of the present age transferring the honour of the invention from Nunez to Peter Vernier, a native of Franche Comte, have called this method of division by his name. (See Vernier.) Mr Adams, however, in his Geometrical and Geographical Essays, has lately shown that Clevis the Jesuit may dispute the invention with them both. The truth seems to be, that Nunez started the idea, Clevis improved it, and Vernier carried it to its present state of perfection. The method of Nunez, described in his treatise De Crepulculis, printed at Lisbon 1542, consists in describing within the same quadrant 45 concentric circles, dividing the outermost into 90 equal parts, the next within into 80, the next into 88, &c. till the innermost was divided into 46 only. On a quadrant thus divided the plumb line or index must cross one or other of the circles very near a point of division; whence, by computation, the degrees and minutes of the arch might be easily ascertained. This method is also described by Nunez in his treatise De arte atque ratione Navigandi, where he would fain persuade himself, that it was not unknown to Ptolemy. But as the degrees are thus divided very unequally, and as it is very difficult to attain exactness in the division, especially when the numbers into which the arches are to be divided are incomposite (of which there are no less than nine), the method of diagonals, first published by Thomas Digges, Esq. in a treatise entitled Ayle seu facie mathematicae, printed at London in 1573, and said to be invented by one Richard Chenefler, was substituted in its room. Nonius's method was, however, improved at different times and by different persons; and it must be acknowledged, that if Vernier saw either the original or any of the improvements (and there can be little doubt of his having seen them all), his merit is only that of having applied to an useful practical purpose the speculative invention of another person.\n\nNonnus, a Greek poet of the 5th century, and native of Panopolis in Egypt, was the author of an heroic poem in 48 books, entitled Dionysiaca, and a paraphrase in verse of St John's Gospel, which may serve as a commentary upon it.\n\nNonupla, in the Italian music, denotes a quick time, peculiar to jigs. This species of time is otherwise called the measure of nine times, which requires two falls of the hand, and one rise. There are three sorts of nonupla. 1. Nonupla di semi minim\u00e6, or dupla semifiquarta, thus marked \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), where nine crotchets are to be in the bar, of which four make a semibreve in common time, i.e. in the down stroke fix, and but three up: it is usually beat adagio. 2. Nonupla di crone, or semifiquarta, marked thus \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), wherein nine quavers make a bar instead of eight in common time, i.e. fix down and three up: it is beat presto. 3. Nonupla di semifiorcione or super feti parte nona, thus distinguished \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), in which nine semifiorciones are contained in a bar, whereof sixteen are required in common time, fix down, and three up: it is ordinarily beat prestissimo. Besides these, there are two other species of nonupla, for which see Triple.\n\nNootka Sound, or, as it was called by Captain Cook, King George's Sound, lies in N. Lat. 49\u00b0 33' W. Long. 153\u00b0 12'. It is an entrance or strait to a vast inland sea on the west coast of North America, and is said to resemble the Baltic or Mediterranean in Europe. Upon the sea-coast the land is tolerably high and level; but within the sound it rises into steep hills, which have an uniform appearance. The trees of which the woods are composed, are the Canadian pine, white cypress,\nNootka Sound.\n\nCypress, and two or three other sorts of pine. In general, the trees grow here with great vigour, and are of a large size. About the rocks and borders of the woods were seen some strawberry plants, and raspberry, currant, and gooseberry bushes, all in a flourishing state. The principal animals seen here were raccoons, martens, and squirrels. Birds are far from being numerous, and those that are to be seen are remarkably shy, owing perhaps to their being continually harried by the natives, either to eat them, or to become possessed of their feathers to be worn as ornaments. The quercuslactucifera, thongs, and gulls, were seen off the coast; and the two last were also frequent in the sound. Though the variety of fish is not very great, yet they are in greater quantities than birds. The principal sorts are the common herring, a river coloured bream, and another of a brown colour. Captain Cook and Mr King, who visited this place, consider it as an excellent shelter for ships: and in the account of A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean, they give some directions for sailing into it. These and other matters of that kind we shall not trouble our readers with; and perhaps the generality of them will be better pleased with the following extract from Meares's Voyages to the North-west Coast of America.\n\n\"The people of the Nootka nation are, in general, robust and well-proportioned:\u2014their faces are large and full, their cheeks high and prominent, with small black eyes\u2014-their noses are broad and flat, their lips thick, and they have generally very fine teeth, and of the most brilliant whiteness.\n\n\"The manner in which the children of Nootka are treated, when young, is not more extraordinary from its strange, and, as it should appear, total insufficiency, as from its agreement with the customs of the Chinese and Tartars, to whom this practice gives these people a considerable resemblance. The head of the infant is bound by the mother with a kind of fillet of several folds, as low down as the eyes, in order to give it a certain form, which, at this tender age, it is capable of receiving. It might be supposed, that such a tight drawn ligature must cause considerable pain to the child; but we never observed that any of the infants, in such a state of preparation for sugar-loaf heads, suffered any visible pain or inconvenience.\n\n\"Though the custom of compressing the head in this manner gives them an unpleasing appearance, by drawing up the eyebrows, and sometimes producing the disagreeable effect of squinting, as well as of flattening the nose and distending the nostrils, they are by no means an ill-looking race of people. They have also the custom, which is known to prevail in so many Indian nations, of plucking out the beard by the roots, on its first appearance; and, as it continues to sprout, to keep it down by the same practice. It is one of the domestic employments assigned to their wives, to watch this appearance of manhood, and to eradicate the hairs as they come forth; which they do in a very dexterous manner with their fingers, and without giving the least pain in the operation.\u2014Some of them, however, though we saw but very few of this disposition, when they advance in years and become infirm, suffer their beards to grow without interruption. But notwithstanding they have to great an aversion to the hair of their chin, that of the head is an object of their attentive vanity: it is strong, black, and glossy; grows to a considerable length; and is either tied in a kind of knot on the top of their heads, or suffered to hang down their backs in flowing negligence.\n\n\"In their exterior form they have not the symmetry or elegance which is found in many other Indian nations.\u2014Their limbs, though stout and athletic, are crooked and ill shaped; their skin, when cleansed of filth and ocre, is white; and we have seen some of the women, when in a state of cleanliness (which, however, was by no means a common sight, and obtained with difficulty), who not only possessed the fair complexion of Europe, but features that would have attracted notice, for their delicacy and beauty, in those parts of the world where the qualities of the human form are best understood. But these examples of beauty are by no means numerous among the women of Nootka, who are calculated rather to disgust than to charm an European beholder. Their hair, like that of the men, is black; their eyes are of the same colour; and, in exterior appearance, they are not to be immediately distinguished from the men. In their characters they are reserved and chaste; and examples of loose and immoral conduct were very rare among them. There were women in St George's Sound, whom no offers could tempt to meretricious submissions.\"\n\nAll reports concerning Nootka Sound agree in characterizing the inhabitants as \"a very motile race of people.\"\u2014Inoffensive, however, as they are, a custom of a very unnatural, and we should imagine cruel, kind prevails among them: for, together with many other articles which they exposed to sale to Captain Cook's ships, they brought human skulls and hands (part of the flesh still remaining on them), which they acknowledged they had been feeding on; and some of them, we are told, had evident marks of the fire.\n\nFrom hence it is too apparent, that the horrid practice of devouring their enemies exists here as well as at New Zealand and other South Sea islands: and hence, too, appears what men of even the best natural dispositions will be, if left entirely to the freedom of their own will, without law to control or religion to instruct them. As there are but two villages of the Sound inhabited, the number of people cannot be many; perhaps they are about 2000 in all. Our limits prevent us from being so minute as we could wish to be, respecting the form of their houses and their manner of building them; of their furniture, decorations, and other things of that kind: we can therefore only refer those who wish for further information on this subject to Cook, and other voyagers and travellers, &c.\n\nThe employment of the men is chiefly fishing, &c., whilst the women manufacture their garments. Their ingenuity in this and in the mechanic arts is far from being inconsiderable; and in the imitative arts their skill is very great. On these subjects, however, we cannot enlarge: we have in general made it our business, and it certainly is our duty, to dwell, where it can be done, on the manners or religion of the inhabitants of the several places which come under our notice; and they who know the utility of this in developing the philosophy of the human mind, the most important of all sciences, will not blame our intentions, even if they should not approve of the execution. In Cook's\nCook's Voyages before referred to, we find the following observations on the religion and language of the inhabitants of Nootka Sound.\n\n\"Little knowledge we can be supposed to have acquired of the political and religious institutions established among these people. We discovered, however, that there were such men as chiefs, distinguished by the title of Acweeke, to whom the others are, in some degree, subordinate. But the authority of each of these great men seems to extend no farther than to his own family, who acknowledge him as their head. As they were not all elderly men, it is possible this title may be hereditary.\n\n\"Nothing that we saw could give us any insight into their notions of religion, except the figures already mentioned, called Kuma. These, perhaps, were idols; but as the word Acweeke was frequently mentioned when they spoke of them, we may suppose them to be the images of some of their ancestors, whose memories they venerate. This, however, is all conjecture; for we could receive no information concerning them; knowing little more of their language than to enable us to ask the names of things, and being incapable of holding any conversation with the natives relative to their traditions or their institutions.\n\n\"Their language is neither harsh nor disagreeable, farther than proceeds from their pronouncing the k and h with less softness than we do. As to the composition of their language, we are enabled to say but little. It may, however, be inferred from their flow and distinct method of speaking, that it has few prepositions or conjunctions, and is destitute of even a single interjection to express surprise or admiration. The affinity it may bear to other languages, we have not been able sufficiently to trace, not having proper specimens to compare it with; but from the few Mexican words we have procured, there is an obvious agreement throughout the language, in the frequent terminations of the words in l, ll or x.\n\n\"The word waka/b was frequently in the mouths of the people of Nootka. It seemed to express approbation, applause, and friendship. Whenever they appeared to be pleased or satisfied at any sight or occurrence, they would call out waka/b! waka/b!\u2014It is worthy of remark, that these people do essentially differ from the natives of the islands in the Pacific ocean, in their persons, customs, and language, we cannot suppose their respective progenitors to have belonged to the same tribe, when they emigrated into those places where we now find their descendants.\"\n\nWe cannot finish this article without taking notice of a circumstance, which at the time made a great noise in Europe, and which it is probable will find a place in the future histories of the contending countries.\n\nA small association of British merchants resident in the East Indies had, early in the year 1786, formed the project of opening a trade to this part of the world, for the purpose of supplying the Chinese market with furs. The principal point towards which these expeditions were directed, was Port Nootka, or King George's Sound; and the adventurers, being in some degree satisfied with their traffic, took measures, in the year 1788, to secure to themselves a permanent settlement; at the same time that the shipping employed in this expedition was generally two, and never exceeded the amount of four, small vessels. The Spaniards conceived some jealousy of the intrusion of the English into a part of the world which they had long been desirous to regard as their exclusive property; and accordingly a Spanish frigate of 26 guns was despatched from the province of Mexico, for the purpose of putting an end to this commerce. The Spanish frigate arrived in May 1789, and captured two English vessels in the following July, at the same time taking possession of the little settlement which had been formed upon the coast. Such, in short, is the circumstance which was likely to involve us in an expensive war. Happily, however, for both countries, and perhaps for Europe, the matter was at length, after great altercation, amicably settled; and it must still be so fresh in the memories of our readers, that we trust they will excuse us from enlarging further upon it\u2014the whole article having extended perhaps to more than a sufficient length.","sp":46,"ep":53},{"h":"NOPAL","t":"RAQUETTE, or Indian fig; plants so named by the Indians, on which the cochineal insect breeds in Mexico.

His character had that cast of severity which is often the consequence of scholastic habits. He was one of those men who discuss every thing without being capable of feeling anything. The Pastor Fido of Guarini made its appearance; and pastoralists became a fashionable species of reading throughout all Italy. Nores, who did not relish works of this kind, attacked the production of Guarini, who entirely confuted him in a little piece printed at Ferrara in 1588. Nores made a reply two years after; and the poet was preparing an answer still more severe than the former, when his antagonist died of grief, occasioned by the banishment of his only son for having killed a Venetian in a duel. He left behind him a great many works, some in Italian, and others in Latin. The chief of his Italian works, are, 1. The Poeticks, Padua, 1588, 4to; this edition is rare. 2.

According to Templeman, it extends in length 57 miles, in breadth 35, and 140 in circumference. It contains an area of 1426 square miles, one city, 32 market towns, 711 villages, according to the book of rates, though some make them 1500, and 273,371 inhabitants. It is divided into 31 hundreds, 164 vicarages, and 660 parishes.\n\nThe air differs in different parts of the county according to the soil, which in some places is marshy, especially on the sea coast, and there the air is foggy and unwholesome; in others it is clayey and chalky, poor, lean, and sandy, and there the air is good. The county is almost all champaign, except in some places, where rye gentle hills. The marsh lands yield rich pasture for cattle; the clay grounds pease, rye, and barley; and the sandy heaths feed vast flocks of large sheep, of which some villages are said to keep 4000 or 5000. These heaths abound also in rabbits of a silver gray colour. Walsingham is noted for producing the best saffron. Great quantities of mackerel and herring are caught upon the coasts of this county, the former in the spring, and the latter in September; especially at Yarmouth, where they are cured in a particular manner, and to great perfection. Wood and honey are also very plentiful in this county; and on the coasts jet and ambergris are sometimes found. The inhabitants are generally strong and active, sagacious and acute. That they are so robust, is the more to be wondered at, because the common people live much on puddings, Norfolk dumplings. They are for the most part in easy circumstances, and were formerly very quarrelsome and litigious. In consequence of this disposition, lawyers swarmed among them to such a degree, that a statute was made so early as the reign of Henry VI. to restrain their number. The manufactures of the county, which is exceedingly populous, are chiefly woollen and worsted stuffs and stockings, for which they are well supplied with wool from the vast flocks of sheep bred in it. It gives title of duke to the elder branch of the family of Howard, lies in the diocese of Norwich, and sends twelve members to parliament, viz. two knights for the shire, two citizens for Norwich, and two burgesses for each of the boroughs of Lynn Regis, Great Yarmouth, Thetford, and Cattle-rifling.\n\nThe county is well watered, and supplied with fish by the rivers Yare, Thurn, Waveney, the Greater and Leffer Ouse, and the Bure, besides rivulets. The Bure abounds in excellent perch, and the Yare has a fish peculiar to it called the ruffe. The latter rises about the middle of the county; and after being joined by the Waveney and Bure, falls into the sea at Yarmouth. At the equinoxes, especially the autumnal, the Ouse is subject to great inundations, being forced back by the sea, that enters it with great fury. This county was famous at a very early period for its fisheries, which were extensive and valuable, and seem to have been carried on with spirit. It has also been remarkable, for at least 400 years past, for the manufacture of fine worsted stuffs.","sp":54,"ep":54},{"h":"NORFOLK","t":"a county of Virginia contiguous to North Carolina.","sp":54,"ep":54},{"h":"NORFOLK ISLAND","t":"a small island of the South sea, lying in 29\u00b0 12' 30\" south latitude, and 168\u00b0 16' east longitude. A colony was lately settled on it: and the following account of it is given in Governor Phillip's Voyage to Botany Bay, &c.\n\n\"Norfolk island is about seven leagues in circumference; and if not originally formed, like many other small islands, by the eruption of volcanic matter from the bed of the sea, must doubtless have contained a volcano. This conclusion is formed from the vast quantity of pumice stone which is scattered in all parts of it, and mixed with the soil. The crater, or at least some traces of its former existence, will probably be found at the summit of a small mountain, which rises...\"\nrises near the middle of the island. To this mountain the commandant has given the name of Mount Pitt. The island is exceedingly well watered. At or near Mount Pitt rises a strong and copious stream, which flowing through a very fine valley, divides itself into several branches, each of which retains sufficient force to be used in turning mills; and in various parts of the island springs have been discovered.\n\n\"The climate is pure, salubrious, and delightful; preserved from oppressive heats by constant breezes from the sea, and of so mild a temperature throughout the winter, that vegetation continues there without interruption, one crop succeeding another. Refreshing showers from time to time maintain perpetual verdure; not indeed of grass, for none has yet been seen upon the island; but of the trees, shrubs, and other vegetables, which in all parts grow abundantly. On the leaves of these, and of some kinds in particular, the sheep, hogs, and goats, not only live, but thrive and fatten very much. To the salubrity of the air every individual in this little colony can bear ample testimony, from the uninterrupted state of good health which has been, in general, enjoyed.\n\n\"When our settlers landed, there was not a single acre clear of wood in the island, and the trees were so bound together by that kind of creeping shrub called supple jack, interwoven in all directions, as to render it very difficult to penetrate far among them. The commandant, small as his numbers were at first, by indefatigable activity soon caused a space to be cleared sufficient for the requisite accommodations, and for the production of excellent vegetables of all kinds in the greatest abundance. When the last accounts arrived, three acres of barley were in a very thriving state, and ground was prepared to receive rice and Indian corn. In the wheat there had been a disappointment, the grain that was sown having been so much injured by the weevil as to be unfit for vegetation. But the people were all at that time in commodious houses; and, according to the declarations of Mr King himself, in his letters to Governor Philip, there was not a doubt that this colony would be in a situation to support itself entirely without assistance in less than four years; and with very little in the intermediate time. Even two years would be more than sufficient for this purpose, could a proper supply of black cattle be sent.\n\n\"Fish are caught in great plenty, and in the proper season very fine turtle. The woods are inhabited by innumerable tribes of birds, many of them very gay in plumage. The most useful are pigeons, which are very numerous; and a bird not unlike the Guinea fowl, except in colour (being chiefly white), both of which were at first so tame as to suffer themselves to be taken by hand. Of plants that afford vegetables for the table, the chief are cabbage palm, the wild plantain, the fern tree, a kind of wild spinach, and a tree which produces a diminutive fruit, bearing some resemblance to a currant. This, it is hoped, by transplanting and care, will be much improved in size and flavour.\n\n\"But the productions which give the greatest importance to Norfolk Island are the pines and the flax plant; the former rising to a size and perfection unknown in other places, and promising the most valuable supply of masts and spars for our navy in the East Indies; the latter not less estimable for the purposes of making sailcloth, cordage, and even the finest manufactures, growing in great plenty, and with such luxuriance as to attain the height of eight feet. The pines measure frequently 160, or even 180 feet in height, and are sometimes 9 or 10 feet in diameter at the bottom of the trunk. They rise to about 80 feet without a branch: the wood is said to be of the best quality, almost as light as that of the best Norway masts; and the turpentine obtained from it is remarkable for purity and whiteness. The fern tree is found also of a great height for its species, measuring from 70 to 80 feet, and affords excellent food for the sheep and other small cattle. A plant producing pepper, and supposed to be the true oriental pepper, has been discovered lately in the island, growing in great plenty; and specimens have been sent to England in order to ascertain this important point.\"\n\nNorfolk Sound, according to the account of Captain George Dixon, is situated in 57\u00b0 3' north latitude, and 135\u00b0 36' west longitude. It is a very extensive place, but how far it stretches to the northward is not known. There may possibly be a passage through to the Bay of Islands, but neither is this certain. The shore, in common with the rest of the coast, abounds with pines; there are also great quantities of the witch hazel. There are various kinds of flowering trees and shrubs, wild gooseberries, currants, and raspberries; wild parsley is found here in great plenty, and it eats excellently either as a salad or boiled amongst soup. The faramee, or wild lily root, grows also in great plenty and perfection. There are a very few wild geese or ducks seen here, but they are shy and difficult of approach.","sp":54,"ep":55},{"h":"NORHAM","t":"a town in England, in the county of Northumberland, on the river Tweed, near the mouth of the Till, under the castle, which was anciently erected on a steep rock moated round, for the better security against the incursions of the Scotch mos troopers.

It consists of a vertical wheel of 20 feet diameter, on the circumference of which are fixed a number of little boxes or square buckets, for the purpose of raising the water out of the well, communicating with the canal below, and to empty it into a reservoir above, placed by the side of the wheel. The buckets have a lateral office to receive and to discharge the water. The axis of this wheel is embraced by four small beams, crossing each other at right angles, tapering at the extremities, and forming eight little arms. This wheel is near the centre of the horse walk, contiguous to the vertical axis, into the top of which the horse beam is fixed; but near the bottom it is embraced by four little beams, forming eight arms similar to those above described, on the axis of the water wheel. As the mule which they use goes round,\nround, these horizontal arms, supplying the place of cogs, take hold, each in succession, of those arms which are fixed on the axis of the water wheel, and keep it in rotation.\n\nThis machine, than which nothing can be cheaper, throws up a great quantity of water; yet undoubtedly it has two defects: the first is, that part of the water runs out of the buckets and falls back into the well after it has been raised nearly to the level of the reservoir; the second is, that a considerable proportion of the water to be discharged is raised higher than the reservoir, and falls into it only at the moment when the bucket is at the highest point of the circle, and ready to descend.\n\nBoth these defects might be remedied with ease, by leaving these square buckets open at one end, making them swing on a pivot fixed a little above their centre of gravity, and placing the trough of the reservoir in such a position as to stop their progress whilst perpendicular; make them turn upon their pivot, and so discharge their contents.\n\nFrom the reservoir the water is conveyed by channels to every part of the garden; these have divisions and subdivisions or beds, some large, others very small, separated from each other by little channels, into which a boy with his shovel or his hoe directs the water, first into the most distant trenches, and successively to all the rest, till all the beds and trenches have been either covered or filled with water.\n\nMr Townsendl, from whom we have taken the above account, thinks, that on account of the extreme simplicity of this machine, it is an invention of the most remote antiquity. By means of it the inhabitants every morning draw as much water from the well as will serve through the day, and in the evening distribute it to every quarter according to the nature of their crops. The reservoirs into which they raise the water are about 20, 30, or even 40 feet square, and three feet high above the surface of the ground, with a stone coping on the wall, declining to the water for the women to wash and beat their clothes upon.\n\nOur limits preclude us from following Mr Townsendl farther in the description of a particular noria used at Barcelona; which he conceives to be the original chain pump, or at least its parent.

He was carefully educated by his father Alexander Noris, originally of Ireland, and well known by his History of Germany. He discovered from his infancy an excellent understanding, great vivacity, and a quick apprehension. His father instructed him in the rudiments of grammar, and procured an able professor of Verona, called Maffoleim, to be his preceptor. At 15 he was admitted a pensioner in the Jesuits college at Rimini, where he studied philosophy; after which he applied himself to the writings of the fathers of the church, particularly those of St Augustine: and taking the habit in the convent of the Augustinian monks of Rimini, he distinguished himself among that fraternity in a short time by his erudition: inasmuch, that as soon as he was out of his novitiate or time of probation, the general of the order sent for him to Rome, in order to give him an opportunity of improving himself in the more solid branches of learning. He did not disappoint his superior's expectations. He gave himself up entirely to his study, and spent whole days, and even nights, in the library of the Angeliques of St Augustine. His constant course was to stick to his books 14 hours a day; and this course he continued till he became a cardinal. By this means he became qualified to instruct others; and on this errand he was sent first to Perugia, and thence to Perugia, where he took his degree of doctor of divinity; after which, proceeding to Padua, he applied himself to finish his History of Pelagianism. He had begun it at Rome at the age of 26; and, having completed his design, the book was printed at Florence, and published in 1673. The great duke of Tuscany invited him the following year to\nNoris, to that city, made him his chaplain, and professor of ecclesiastical history in the university of Pifa, which his highness had founded with that view.\n\nIn his history he set forth and defended the condemnation pronounced, in the eighth general council, against Origen and Mopstetia, the first authors of the Pelagian errors; he also added an account of the Schism of Aquileia, and a Vindication of the Books written by St Augustine against the Pelagians and Semi-Pelagians. The work had procured him a great reputation, but met with several antagonists, to whom he published proper answers; the dispute grew warm, and was carried before the sovereign tribunal of the inquisition. There the history was examined with the utmost rigour, and the author dismissed without the least censure. It was reprinted twice afterwards, and Mr Noris honoured by Pope Clement X. with the title of Qualifier of the Holy Office. Notwithstanding this, the charge was renewed against the Pelagian History, and it was dilated afresh before the inquisition in 1676; but it came out again with the same success as at first. Mr Noris was now suffered to remain in peace for fifteen years, and taught ecclesiastical history at Pifa, without any molestation, till he was called to Rome by Innocent XII. who made him under-librarian of the Vatican in 1692. This post was the way to a cardinal's hat; his accusers, therefore, took fresh fire, and published several new pieces against him. Hence the Pope appointed some learned divines, who had the character of having taken neither side, to re-examine Father Noris's books, and make their report of them. Their testimony was so advantageous to the author, that his holiness made him counsellor of the inquisition. Yet neither did this hinder one of his adversaries, the most formidable on account of his erudition, to rise up against him, and attack him warmly, under the assumed title of a Scrupulous Doctor of the Sorbonne. Noris tried to remove these scruples in a work which appeared in 1695, under the title of An Historical Dissertation concerning one of the Trinity that suffered in the Flesh; wherein, having justified the monks of Scythia, who made use of that expression, he vindicated himself also from the imputation of having attacked the Pope's infallibility, of having abused Vincentius Lirinensis, and other bishops of Gaul, as favourers of Semi-Pelagianism, and of having himself gone into the errors of the bishop of Ypres.\n\nHis answers to all these accusations were so much to the satisfaction of the pope, that at length his holiness honoured him with the purple in 1695. After this, he was in all the congregations, and employed in the most important affairs; so that he had little time to spend in his study, a thing of which he frequently complained to his friends. Upon the death of Cardinal Catanati, he was made chief library keeper of the Vatican in 1700; and two years afterwards nominated, among others, to reform the calendar: but he died at Rome in 1704 of a dropsy. He was one of the most learned men in the last century: his writings abound with erudition, and are very elegantly finished. He was a member of the Academy; whence he assumed the name of Eucrates Agoreto.

Its name signifies \"the northern market\" in Normandy, the Swedish language. It stands on the banks of a large river called Motola, which coming from the lake Vetter, falls a little lower into a gulf called Brawicken. It is the largest and most populous town in Sweden, next to Stockholm, conveniently situated near the sea on a navigable river, which brings large vessels up to the middle of the town. There are some handsome streets, and the houses in general are neatly built. Some of the churches are worth seeing; but the greatest curiosity are the famous copper mines, where there is a vast number of people constantly at work. In this article the town carries on a very good trade; as also in several other manufactures, as leather, steel, and guns, which they make the best in Sweden.\n\nIt covers a large space of ground, being ten miles in circumference; but the houses are small and scattered, and the inhabitants do not exceed 10,000. The river Motola flows through the town, forms a series of cataracts, and is divided into four principal streams, which encircle several rocky islands, covered with houses and manufactories. At the extremity of the town it is navigable for small vessels. Several manufactories are established in the town; 55 factories of cloth, which employ 1,500 men; 3 sugar-houses; 1 of flour; 50 mills for grinding corn, which is exported in large quantities; and a brass foundry.

The late earl succeeded his father August 4, 1790. His lordship succeeded the celebrated Mr Charles Townend as manager of the house of commons and chancellor of the exchequer; and in 1779, on the resignation of the duke of Grafton, was made first lord of the treasury; in which office he continued until the close of the American war, or rather until the formation of the Rockingham ministry, which began the business of peace with the colonies. He was a man of strong mental faculties; and as an orator, at once commanded attention and enforced conviction; but taking the helm at a time when the king's party were unpopular, and when it was supposed that the late earl of Bute was the great machine by which the cabinet was moved, so he continued in that state of unpopularity until he resigned the seals. During the whole of his premiership (and to conduct the helm at that time required uncommonly great abilities) he studiously avoided imposing any taxes that should materially affect the lower class of people. The luxuries, and not the necessaries, of life were repeated objects of his budget. As a financier, he stood high, even in the opinion of opposition; and they were a combination of all the great talents in the kingdom: but, fatally wedded to the destructive plan of subduing the republican spirit of the Americans, his administration will not only stand marked in the page of history with an immense waste of public treasure, but it will appear bejewelled with the kindred blood of thousands of British subjects. To the very last moment he spoke in the senate, however; he defended that war; and said, he was then, as he was formerly, prepared to meet the minutest investigation as to his conduct in that business; which nothing but the unforeseen intervention of France could have prevented from being crowned with success. His lordship was one of the firmest and most strenuous supporters of the constitution in church and state. He died on the 6th of August 1792. His recollection he retained to his last moments: his family, except Lord North, who came within a few minutes afterwards, were assembled round his bed, and he took leave of them individually. Their grief did not suffer them to leave the room for some time after the event;\nNorth Cape event, and Lady Caroline Douglas was at last forced from it. Even Dr Warren, who must be strengthened as far as habit can operate against nature to endure such scenes, ran from this, convulsed with sorrow.

About five o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st, the great bell at St Mary's church at Oxford rang out, which was a signal that the funeral procession had arrived in the environs of that city. The officers of the university, and the whole body of resident students, were previously assembled in Magdalen College, in order to pay some tribute to the memory of their deceased chancellor. They joined the procession at Magdalen Bridge, and paraded on foot before the hero up the high street to Carfax; from thence down the corn market to St Giles's church at the town's end, in a most solemn manner. Here they halted, and opening to the right and left, the hero and other carriages passed through, the whole university being uncovered.

The person who had the honour to conceive this idea was Robert Thorne, a merchant of Bristol, who addressed two papers on the subject, the one to King Henry VIII., the other to Dr Ley, ambassador from that monarch to the emperor Charles V. To remove any objection to the undertaking, which might be drawn from the supposed danger, he insists, in his address to the king, upon the great advantages of constant daylight in the polar seas, and the probability of the climate being in those regions temperate during the summer months. In the paper addressed to Dr Ley, he observes that cosmographers may as probably be mistaken in the opinion which they entertain of the polar regions being impassable from extreme cold, as it has been found they were in supposing the countries under the line to be uninhabitable from excessive heat.\n\nThe possibility of the passage was, in consequence of these addresses, very generally supposed; and in 1557, Sir Martin Frobisher failed to 62\u00b0 north latitude, where he discovered the straits which have since borne his name. In 1577, Barne, in a book entitled the *Regiment of the Sea*, mentions a north-west passage as one of the five ways to Cathay; and dwells on the mildness of the climate, which, from the constant presence of the sun during summer, he imagines must be found near the pole. In 1578, George Best, a gentleman who had been with Sir Martin Frobisher in his voyages of discovery, wrote a very ingenious discourse to prove all parts of the world habitable. It does not, however, appear that any voyage was undertaken, for the express purpose of attempting to fail to India in a north-west direction, till the year 1607, when Henry Hudson was sent, at the expense of some merchants in London to discover a passage by the north pole to Japan and China. He failed from Graveend on the 1st of May, and on the 21st of June fell in with the land to the westward, in latitude 73\u00b0, which he named *Hold-with-hope*. On the 27th he discovered Spitzbergen, and met with much ice. The highest latitude in which he made an observation was 80\u00b0 27'. See HUDSON.\n\nIn March 1609, Jones Poole was sent by Sir Thomas Smith, and the rest of the Muscovy Company, to make further discoveries towards the north pole. After great severity of weather, and much difficulty from ice, he made the fourth part of Spitzbergen on the 16th of May; and failing along and founding the coast, he made many accurate discoveries; but was not in that voyage able to proceed beyond 79\u00b0 50'. He was again employed (1611), in a small vessel called the *Elizabeth*, to attempt the north-west passage; but after surmounting numberless difficulties, and penetrating to 80\u00b0 of latitude, he lost his ship at Spitzbergen. Two voyages, equally unsuccessful, were made in 1614 and 1615, by Baffin and Fotherby; the latter of whom concludes the account of his discoveries and dangers, with exhorting the company which employed him not to adventure more than \u00a350l. or \u00a3200l. at most on yearly voyages to these seas.\n\nHitherto nothing had been done in this great undertaking; but by private adventurers, fitted out for the double purpose of discovery and present advantage; and the polar regions were suffered to remain unexplored in that direction, from the year 1615 till 1773, when the earl of Sandwich, in consequence of an application which had been made to him by the Royal Society, laid before his majesty a proposal for an expedition to try how far navigation is practicable towards the north pole. Upon receiving this proposal, his majesty was pleased to direct that the voyage should be immediately undertaken, with every assistance that could contribute to its success. Accordingly, the Racehorse and Carcass bombs were fitted out for the purpose, and the command of the expedition given to Captain Phipps, now Lord Mulgrave. His Lordship's instructions were to proceed up to the pole, or as far towards it as possible, and as nearly upon a meridian as the ice or other obstructions should admit; and during the course of the voyage, to make such observations...\nNorth-westerns of every kind as might be useful to navigation, or tend to the promotion of natural knowledge. A very accurate account of this voyage was published by his Lordship in 1774. He had, by exerting all the powers of a skilful and intrepid seaman, forced his way, on the 1st of August, to 80\u00b0 37\u2032; but could proceed no farther, as he was there opposed by one continued plain of smooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon.\n\nMany other attempts have been made to discover this passage, by sailing along the western coast of America; but hitherto none of them has been crowned with success. So early as 1579, Sir Francis Drake assured Queen Elizabeth that he had sailed some leagues up the straits of Anian (see ANIAN), and discovered New Albion, to the north of California; but the strait is now known to have no existence; and Drake's real discoveries were not improved. In 1638, King Charles I. sent Captain Luke Fox in one of his pinnaces to attempt the passage; but of his proceedings we know nothing, but that he reached Port Nelson in Hudson's bay, where he found some remains of former navigators. Next year Captain James was fitted out by the merchants of Bristol for the same purpose. James was one of the ablest navigators that ever sailed from England or any other country; and his voyages to the north were printed in 1633. After all the experiments he had made, he concluded that there was no such passage; or if there be, he affirmed that the discovery of it would not be attended with those advantages which are commonly expected. His reasons, however, for these opinions have been answered, and many subsequent attempts have been made to perform what he thought impossible. The arguments for a north-west passage were so plausible, that, in 1744, an act of parliament was passed to encourage the discovery of it. Among many others, Captain Cook attempted the discovery in vain, and thence adopted James's opinion. (See COOKE'S Discoveries, No. 153.) This celebrated navigator, after having proceeded northwards to the western extremity of America, and ascertained the proximity of the two great continents of Asia and America, returned to the Sandwich islands, firmly persuaded of the impracticability of a passage in that hemisphere from the Atlantic into the Pacific ocean, either by an eastern or a western course.\n\nLater voyagers, however, have pretended to detect some errors in Cooke's discoveries; and the author of a small tract, entitled An authentic Statement of all the Facts relative to Nootka Sound, goes a great way to make the discovery not yet hopeless. In his account of the expedition under the direction of Mr. Etches, he says, that \"one of the first discoveries made by these ships was, that what was by the immortal Cook laid down as a continuation of the north-west continent of America, and lying between the northern latitudes of 48\u00b0 and 57\u00b0, is on the contrary an extensive cluster of unexplored islands inhabited by numerous tribes of friendly Indians, with whom a regular connexion was formed.\"\n\nThese islands they discovered, contrary to the assertion of Captain Cook, to conceal the opening of a vast inland sea, or archipelago, in all probability equal to the Mediterranean or Baltic seas, and dividing the great northern continent of America. The Prince's Royal penetrated some hundred leagues among them, in a north-east course, to within 200 leagues of Hudson's house, but had not then an opportunity to explore the North-east extreme termination of that archipelago, their commercial concerns obliging them to return to the China market; but the commanders had the strongest reasons to believe, had the time favoured their survey, that they should have been able to discover the long wished for passage between the Atlantic and South Sea. They conceived, that should neither the inland arm of the sea through which the Prince's Royal penetrated, nor a large strait named Sir Charles Middleton's about three degrees to the southward, be found to reach across the continent, yet that the land barrier must be very inconsiderable; and that at the extremity of this bay a practicable passage, either by rivers or lakes, will, by perseverance, be found terminating towards Hudson's bay.\n\nThe last attempt to discover this passage was made by Vancouver between the years 1790 and 1795; but the result of this voyage renders the existence of such a passage still more doubtful.\n\nUpon the whole, however, it appears to us extremely doubtful whether there be such a passage; but it is much more likely to be discovered, if discovered at all, by the progressive advances of mercantile enterprise than by any immediate expedition undertaken for that purpose.","sp":58,"ep":60},{"h":"NORTH ROCKS","t":"(otherwise called St Patrick's rocks, from a seat of stone amongst them called St Patrick's chair, whence the rocks have taken this second name;) situated in the harbour of Donaghadee, in the county of Down, and province of Ulster, in Ireland.

The first attempt was made in 1553, by Sir Hugh Willoughby, who commanded three ships. He departed from the Thames and sailed to the North Cape, where one of his ships left him, and returned home. The other two ships being separated, Sir Hugh proceeded farther northward, and discovered that part of Greenland which the Dutch have since called Spitzberg; but the severity of the cold obliging him to return to the southward, he was forced, by bad weather, into the river Arzina, in Mulcovite Lapland, where, not being able to come out, he was found the next spring frozen to death, with all his ship's company; having the notes of his voyage and his last will lying before him, whereby it appeared that he lived till January. But Richard Chancellor, in the third ship, with better success, in the meanwhile entered Wardhuys, where he waited some time for his companions to no purpose; uncertain whether they were lost, or driven farther by treas of weather. He held a council on what he should do; whether to return, or pursue his voyage. Whatever danger might be in the last, every one agreed to it, that they might not seem to have less courage than their captain. They therefore set sail, and in a few days found themselves in a sea where they could no longer perceive any night. This ship, wandering about, entered soon after into a large bay or gulf. Here they cast anchor, in sight of land; and while they were examining the coast, they discovered a fishing boat. Chancellor getting into his floop, went towards it; but the fishermen took to flight. He followed, and, overtaking them, showed them such civilities as conciliated their affections to him; and they carried him to the place where now is the famous port of St Michael the Archangel. These people immediately spread through all the coasts an account of the arrival of those strangers; and people came from several parts to see them, and ask them questions. They, in their turn, examined the others, and found\nNorth-east found that the country they were in was Ruffia, governed by the mighty emperor John Bafflowitz. Chancellor from Archangel travelled on sledges to the Czar at Moscow; from whom, overjoyed at the prospect of opening a maritime commerce with Europe, he obtained privileges for the English merchants, and letters to King Edward VI, who was not, however, alive to receive them.\n\nIn 1585, Mr John Davis in two barks discovered Cape Defolation, which is supposed to be part of Greenland; and two years after advanced as far as Lat. 72\u00b0, where he discovered the strait which still bears his name. To enumerate all the attempts which have been made to discover a north-east passage, would swell the article to very little purpose. The English, Dutch, and Danes, have all attempted it without success. The last voyage from England for this purpose was made in 1676, under the patronage of the duke of York. That unfortunate prince, who was on all occasions earnest for the promotion of commerce, and the Lord Berkeley, &c., fitted out a ship, commanded by Captain Wood, for an attempt once more to find a north-east passage to India, accompanied with a ship of the king's. They were encouraged to this attempt, after it had been so long despised of, by several new reports and reasonings: some of which seem not to have been very well grounded\u2014As,\n\n\"1. On the coast of Corea, near Japan, whales had been found with English and Dutch harpoons sticking in them. This is no infallible proof that ships could get thither by a north-east passage, although whales might.\n\n\"2. That, 20 years before, some Dutchmen had sailed within one degree of the north pole, and found it temperate weather there: and that therefore William Barents, the Dutch navigator who wintered at Nova Zembla in the year 1596, should have failed further to the north before turning eastward; in which case, said they, he would not have found to much obstruction from the ice.\n\n\"3. That two Dutch ships had lately sailed 300 leagues to the eastward of Nova Zembla; but their East India Company had stifled that design, as against their interest:\u2014and such like other airy reports. But this attempt proved very unfortunate. They doubled the North Cape, and came among much ice and drift wood, in 76\u00b0 of north latitude, steering to the coast of Nova Zembla, where the king's ship struck upon the rocks, and was soon beat to pieces; and Captain Wood returned home with an opinion, \"that such a passage was utterly impracticable, and that Nova Zembla is a part of the continent of Greenland.\"\n\nThese passages, however, are not yet deemed impracticable by all. The count de Buffon holds it for certain, that there is a passage from Europe to China by the North sea. The reason why it has been so often attempted in vain, he thinks, is, that fear prevented the undertakers from keeping at a sufficient distance from land, and from approaching the pole, which they probably imagined to be an immense rock. Hence he affirms, that if any farther attempts be made to find a passage to China and Japan by the north seas, it will be necessary to keep at a distance from the land and the ice; to steer directly towards the pole; and to explore the most open seas, where unquestionably, says he, there is little or no ice. This opinion has been lately revived by the honourable Daines Barington, who says, that if the passage be attempted by the pole itself, he has very little doubt of its being accomplished.

According to Camden, it was formerly called North-afandon, from its situation to the north of the river Nen, called anciently Auffona, by which and another lesser river it is almost inclosed. Dr Gibbon says, that the ancient Saxon annals called both it and Southampton simply Hamton; and afterwards, to distinguish them, called the one, from its situation, Southampton, and the other Northamton; but never North-afandon. Though it does not appear to be a place of very great antiquity, nor to have emerged from obscurity till after the Conquest, it has sent members to parliament since the reign of Edward I. and being in the heart of the kingdom, several parliaments have been held at it. There was also a castle, and a church dedicated to St Andrew, built by Simon de Sancto Licio, commonly called Senlees, the first earl of Northampton of that name. It is said to have been burnt down during the Danish depredations; but in the reign of St Edward it appears to have been a considerable place. It was besieged by the barons in their war with King John; at which time that military work called Hunhill, is supposed to have been raised. In the time of Henry III. it sided with the barons, when it was besieged and taken by the king. Here the bloody battle was fought in which Henry VII. was taken prisoner. It was entirely consumed by a most dreadful fire in 1675; yet, by the help of liberal contributions from all parts of the country, it hath so recovered itself, that it is now one of the neatest and best built towns of the kingdom. Among the public buildings which are all lofty, the most remarkable are the church called All-hallows (which stands at the meeting of four spacious streets), the feoffees and affize house, and the George inn, which belongs to the poor of the town. A county hospital or infirmary has been lately built here, after the manner of those of Bath, London, Bristol, &c. It has a considerable manufacture of shoes and stockings; and its fairs are noted for horses both for draught and saddle; besides, it is a great thoroughfare for the north and west roads. It was formerly walled, and had seven churches within and two without. The horse market is reckoned to exceed all others in the kingdom, it being deemed the centre of all its horse markets and horse fairs, both for saddle and harness, and the chief rendezvous of the jockeys both from York and London. Its principal manufacture is shoes, of which great numbers are sent beyond sea; and the next to that, stockings and lace, as we have hinted at above. It is the richer and more populous, by being a thoroughfare both in the north and west roads; but, being 80 miles from the sea, it can have no commerce by navigation. The walls of this town were above two miles in compass. It is supposed to contain about 1685 houses, and 5200 inhabitants. It had formerly a nunnery in the neighbouring meadows, with several other monasteries; and of its very old castle on the west side of the town, a small part of the ruins is still to be seen. Some discontented scholars...\nNorthamptonshire scholars came hither from Oxford and Cambridge, about the end of the reign of Henry III., and, with the king's leave, prosecuted their studies here academically for three years; during which there was the face of an university, till it was put a stop to by express prohibition, because it was a damage to both universities. The public horse races are on a neighbouring down, called Pey-Leys. In and about the town are abundance of cherry gardens. Within half a mile of the town is one of the crosses erected by King Edward I. in memory of his queen Eleanor, whose corpse was refted there in its way to Westminster. On the north side of the river, near that cross, many Roman coins have been ploughed up. At Guilfordborough, north-west of Northampton, are to be seen the vestiges of a Roman camp, the situation of which is the more remarkable, as lying between the Nen and the Avon, the only paths from the north to the south parts of England not intercepted by any river. This camp was secured only by a single intrenchment, which was, however, very broad and deep.","sp":61,"ep":62},{"h":"NORTHAMPTON","t":"a county of North America, in Virginia, forming the fourth part of the peninsula on the eastern coast of Virginia.","sp":62,"ep":62},{"h":"NORTHAMPTONSHIRE","t":"a county of England, is situated in the very heart of the kingdom: bounded on the east by the counties of Bedford and Huntingdon; on the south by those of Buckingham and Oxford; on the west by Warwickshire; and on the north by the counties of Leicester, Rutland, and Lincoln, which are separated from it by the Leicestershire, and the Welland. Its greatest length is about 50 miles, its greatest breadth about 20, and its circumference about 130. It contains 330 parishes. There are in it one city, 11 market towns, 25,000 houses, and 131,757 inhabitants. Nine members are returned to parliament for this county, viz. two knights for the shire, two for the city of Peterborough, two for each of the towns of Northampton and Brockley, and one for Higham Ferrers. It lies in the midland circuit, and in the diocese of Peterborough. As this county is dry, well cultivated, free from marshes, except the fens about Peterborough, in the centre of the kingdom, and of course at a distance from the sea, it enjoys a very pure and wholesome air. In consequence of this it is very populous, and so full of towns and churches, that 30 spires or steeples may be seen in many places at one view; and even in the fens, the inhabitants seem to enjoy a good state of health, and to be little affected by the water which frequently overflows their grounds, especially in winter, but is never suffered to remain long upon it. Its soil is exceeding fertile both in corn and pasture; but it labours under a scarcity of fuel, as it doth not produce much wood, and, by lying at a distance from the sea, cannot be easily supplied with coal. Its commodities, besides corn, are sheep, wool, black cattle, and salt-petre; and its manufactures are ferges, tammies, shalloons, boots, and shoes. Besides many lesser brooks and streams, it is well watered by the rivers Nen, Welland, Ouse, and Lerm; the three first of which are large, and for the most part navigable.","sp":62,"ep":62},{"h":"NORTHERN LIGHTS","t":"the same with aurora borealis, under which article we have given a copious account of this phenomenon, and of the supposed causes of it. Natural science, however, does not arrive at perfection at once, and it is well it does so after trials repeated for years with care and accuracy. How far the causes that have been assigned for this appearance will account for it; or whether they will be able to remove all difficulties, it is not for us to determine; but it is the part of philosophers to hear all sides, and to attend with patient fidelity to every hypothesis, rejecting or receiving, as reason, after the strictest investigation, shall seem to favour the one side or the other. We shall here notice a hypothesis which Doctor Stearns, an American, formed, about the year 1788, to account for the appearances called aurora borealis, and aurora australis.\n\nDoctor Stearns supposes that these phenomena originate from aqueous, nitrous, sulphurous, bituminous, and other exhalations, from the fumes of various kinds of earths or other minerals, vegetables, animals, fires, volcanoes, &c. These, he thinks, become rarefied, and being charged with electrical fluid, become specifically lighter than the circumambient air; hence, of course, they ascend; and being elevated to the upper regions of the air, and driven by the winds from warmer to colder climates, the cold makes them combine and stiffen. When they are afterwards agitated by different currents of air, they sparkle and crackle like the hairs of cats and other animals when stiffened with cold. This concretion in quite cold atmospheres, and in those which are more temperate, appears in different positions in the horizon, zenith, or otherwise, according to the situation of the spectator, and the position of the elevated exhalations. The difference of colours the doctor supposes to arise from the different qualities of the articles combined, those of the most inflammable nature shining with the greatest lustre.\n\nThe doctor likewise tries to account for these lights not appearing, or but seldom appearing, in ancient times. The atmosphere, he thinks, was not impregnated with materials proper to produce them. He imagines that the increased consumption of fuel, in America in particular, the burning of volcanoes, and the approach of blazing stars, whose atmospheres have been expanded by the sun's heat that part of them have fallen into the earth's atmosphere, and communicated to it new matter, have so changed and prepared our air, that whenever its confidence is proper, then, if the light of the sun and moon is not too powerful, the aurora borealis will appear.","sp":62,"ep":62},{"h":"NORTHUMBERLAND","t":"the most northerly county of England, and formerly a distinct kingdom, is bounded on the north and west by the river Tweed, which divides it from Scotland, the Cheviot hills, and part of Cumberland; washed on the east by the German ocean; and separated from Durham on the south by the rivers Tyne and Derwent. This county, which gives\ngives the title of duke to a nobleman who married the daughter of Algernon duke of Somerset, whose mother was heiress of the Percy family, extends about 66 miles in length from north to south, and about 47 in breadth from east to west. It is remarkably populous, containing 12 market towns, 280 villages, and 460 parishes. The face of the country, especially towards the west, is roughened with huge mountains, the most remarkable of which are the Cheviot hills, and the high ridge called Redesdale; but the lands are level towards the sea side and the borders of Durham. The climate, like that of every other mountainous country in the neighbourhood of the sea, is moist and disagreeable: the air, however, is pure and healthy, as being well ventilated by breezes and strong gales of wind; and in winter mitigated by the warm vapours from the two seas, the Irish and the German ocean, between which it is situated. The soil varies in different parts of the county. Among the hills it is barren; though it affords good pasture for sheep, which cover those mountains. The low country, when properly cultivated, produces plenty of wheat, and all sorts of grain; and great part of it is laid out in meadow lands and rich enclosures. Northumberland is well watered with many rivers, rivulets, and fountains: its greatest rivers are the Tweed and the Tyne. The Tyne is composed of two streams called South and North Tyne: the first rises on the verge of Cumberland, near Alton moor; enters Northumberland, running north to Haltwhistle; then bends easterly, and receiving the two small rivers East and West Alon, unites above Hexham with the other branch, taking its rise at a mountain called Fane-head in the western part of the county, thence called Tyne-dale; is swollen in its course by the little river Shele; joins the Tees near Billingham; and running in a direct line to the south-east, is united with the southern Tyne, forming a large river that washes Newcastle, and falls into the German ocean near Tynemouth.\n\nIn all probability the mountains of Northumberland contain lead ore, and other mineralized metals in their bowels, as they in all respects resemble those parts of Wales and Scotland where lead mines have been found and prosecuted. Perhaps the inhabitants are diverted from inquiries of this nature, by the certain profits and constant employment they enjoy in working the coal pits, with which this county abounds. The city of London, and the greatest part of England, are supplied with fuel from these stores of Northumberland, which are inexhaustible, enrich the proprietors, and employ an incredible number of hands and shipping. About 658,958 chaldrons are annually shipped for London.\n\nThere are no natural woods of any consequence in this county; but many plantations belonging to the seats of noblemen and gentlemen, of which here is a great number. As for pot herbs, roots, saladings, and every article of the kitchen garden and orchard, they are here raised in great plenty by the usual means of cultivation; as are also the fruits of more delicate flavour, such as the apricot, peach, and nectarine. The spontaneous fruits it produces in common with other parts of Great Britain, are the crab-apple, the sloe or bullace, the hazel nut, the acorn, hips, and haws, with the berries of the bramble, the juniper, wood strawberries, cranberries, and bilberries.\n\nNorthumberland raises a good number of excellent horses and black cattle, and affords pasture for numerous flocks of sheep; both the cattle and sheep are of a large breed, but the wool is coarser than that which the more southern counties produce. The hills and mountains abound with a variety of game, such as red deer, foxes, hares, rabbits, heathcock, grouse, partridge, quail, plover, teal, and woodcock: indeed, this is counted one of the best sporting counties in Great Britain. The sea and rivers are well stocked with fish; especially the Tweed, in which a vast number of salmon is caught and carried to Tynemouth, where being pickled, they are conveyed by sea to London, and sold under the name of Newcastle salmon.\n\nThe Northumbrians were anciently stigmatized as a savage, barbarous people, addicted to cruelty, and inclined to rapine. The truth is, before the union of the two crowns of England and Scotland, the borderers on each side were extremely licentious and ungovernable, trained up to war from their infancy, and habituated to plunder by the mutual incursions made into each kingdom; incursions which neither truce nor treaty could totally prevent. People of a pacific disposition, who professed to earn their livelihood by agriculture, would not on any terms remain in a country exposed to the first violence of a bold and desperate enemy; therefore the lands lay uncultivated, and in a great measure deserted by every body but lawless adventurers, who subsisted by theft and rapine. There was a tract 50 miles in length and six in breadth, between Berwick and Carlisle, known by the name of the debatable land, to which both nations laid claim, though it belonged to neither; and this was occupied by a set of banditti who plundered on each side, and what they stole in one kingdom, they sold openly in the other: nay, they were so dexterous in their occupation, that by means of hot bread applied to the horns of the cattle which they stole, they twisted them in such a manner, that, when the right owners saw them in the market, they did not know their own property. Wardens were appointed to guard the marches or borders in each kingdom; and these offices were always conferred on noblemen of the first character for influence, valour, and integrity. The English border was divided into three marches, called the east, west, and middle marches; the gentlemen of the country were constituted deputy wardens, who held march courts, regulated the watches, disciplined the militia, and took measures for assembling them in arms at the first alarm: but in the time of peace between the two nations, they were chiefly employed in suppressing the insolence and rapine of the borderers. Since the union of the crowns, however, Northumberland is totally changed, both with respect to the improvement of the lands, and the reformation of the inhabitants. The grounds, being now secure from incursion and insult, are settled by creditable farmers, and cultivated like other parts of the kingdom. As hostilities have long ceased, the people have forgotten the use of arms; and exercise themselves in the more eligible avocations of peace, in breeding sheep and cattle, manuring the grounds, working at the coal pits, and in different branches of commerce and manufacture. In their persons they are generally tall, strong, bold, hardy, and fresh coloured; and though less polished than their ancestors, not quite so civilized as their southern\nNorthwick's northern neighbours. The commonalty are well fed, lodged, and clothed; and all of them remarkably distinguished by a kind of shibboleth or whurle, being a particular way of pronouncing the letter R, as if they hawked it up from the windpipe, like the cawing of rooks. In other respects, the language they speak is an uncoast mixture of the English and Scottish dialects. There is no material distinction between the fashionable people of Northumberland and those of the same rank in other parts of the kingdom; the same form of education will produce the same effects in all countries. The gentlemen of Northumberland, however, are distinguished for their industry, knowledge of rural affairs, and hospitality. The number of inhabitants is reckoned 157,101; of houses 22,740.\n\nA great number of Roman monuments have been found in this county; but the most remarkable curiosity of that kind consists in the remains of Hadrian's wall and the wall of Severus. See ADRIAN, note (A), and SEVERUS'S WALL.\n\nThe most noted towns in Northumberland, are Newcastle, Morpeth, Alnwick, Berwick, Hexham, and North Shields.

Its breadth, from the frontiers of Sweden westward to Cape Statt, may amount to about 300 miles; but from thence the country becomes gradually narrower towards the north. On the south it is bounded by the Schagen rock, or Categate, the entrance into the Baltic; on the east it is divided from Sweden by a long ridge of high mountains; and on the west and north it is washed by the northern ocean. In the southern part of Norway, the country is craggy, abrupt, and mountainous, diversified sometimes with fertile and even delightful spots. In these respects it resembles Switzerland: the prospects and the meteorological phenomena seem to be very similar. The range of the thermometer is of great extent; in the summer having risen to 88\u00b0, and in the winter fallen to \u201440\u00b0: in general it is between 80\u00b0 and \u201422\u00b0.\n\nRespecting the population of Norway it is difficult to attain to certainty. An author of some note (Coxe) seems to think it amounts to 750,000; but he appears to have over-rated it considerably.\n\nThe Norwegian peasants are free, well clothed, well lodged, spirited, active, frank, open, and undaunted. They are said to have a very considerable resemblance to the peasants of Switzerland. The soil is too thin for the plough: corn is therefore obtained from the neighbouring flats; and the chief employment of the peasants of Norway is grazing. The following extract from Mr Coxe, being a description of the scene near Christiana, is not beside our purpose, and may not perhaps be disagreeable to our readers.\n\n\"As we approached Christiana, the country was more wild and hilly, but still very fertile and agreeable; and about two miles from the town we came to the top of a mountain, and burst upon as fine a view as ever I beheld. From the point on which we stood in raptures, the grounds laid out in rich enclosures, gradually sloped to the sea; below us appeared Christiana, situated at the extremity of an extensive and fertile valley, forming a semicircular bend along the shore of a most beautiful bay, which, being enclosed by hills, uplands, and forests, had the appearance of a large lake. Behind, before, and around, the inland mountains of Norway rose on mountains covered with dark forests of pines and fir, the inexhaustible riches of the north. The most distant summits were capped with eternal snow. From the glow of the atmosphere, the warmth of the weather, the variety of the productions, and the mild beauties of the adjacent scenery, I could scarcely believe that I was nearly in the 60th degree of northern latitude.\"\n\nThe coast of Norway, extending above 300 leagues, is studded with a multitude of small islands, affording habitation to fishermen and pilots, and pasture to a few cattle. They form an infinite number of narrow channels, and a natural barrier of rocks, which renders Norway inaccessible to the naval power of its enemies.\nAttempts of this kind are the more dangerous, as the shore is generally bold, steep, and impeding; so that close to the rocks the depth of the sea amounts to 100, 200, or 300 fathoms. The perils of the north sea are moreover increased by sudden storms, sunk rocks, violent currents, and dreadful whirlpools. The most remarkable vortex on this coast is called Mofkoe-fjord, from the small island Mofkoe, belonging to the district of Lofoten in the province of Nordland. In time of flood, the stream runs up between Lofoden and Mofkoe with the most boisterous rapidity; but in its ebb to the sea, it roars like a thousand cataracts, so as to be heard at the distance of many leagues. The surface exhibits different vortices; and if in one of these any ship or vessel is absorbed, it is whirled down to the bottom, and dashed in pieces against the rocks. These violent whirlpools continue without intervals, except for a quarter of an hour, at high and low water, in calm weather; for the boiling gradually returns as the flood or ebb advances. When its fury is heightened by a storm, no vessel ought to venture within a league of it. Whales have been frequently absorbed within the vortex, and howled and bellowed hideously in their fruitless endeavours to disengage themselves. A bear, in attempting to swim from Lofoten to Mofkoe, was once hurled into this whirlpool, from whence he struggled in vain for deliverance, roaring so loud as to be heard on shore; but notwithstanding all his efforts, he was borne down and destroyed. Large trees being absorbed by the current are sucked down, and rise again all shattered into splinters. There are three vortices of the same kind near the islands of Ferroe.\n\nNorway is divided into the four governments of Aggerhus, Bergen, Drontheim, and Wardhus, besides that of Bahus, which is now subject to Sweden. The province of Aggerhus comprehends the south-east part of Norway, extending in length about 300 miles. Its chief towns are Christiana, the see of a bishop, suffragan to the metropolitan see of Drontheim, where the sovereign court of justice is held, in presence of the viceroy and the governor of the province; Aggerhus, about 15 miles to the south-west of Christiana; Fredericksthall or Frederikstad, in the siege of which Charles XII. of Sweden lost his life; Saltzberg, Tonberg, Alleen, Hammar, and Hollen.\n\nThe government of Bergen lies in the most southerly and westerly part of Norway, including the city of the same name, which is an episcopal see, and a place of considerable trade; and Staffanger, situated in the bay of Buckenfor, about 80 miles to the southward of Bergen. The third province, called Drontheim or Trondheim, extends about 500 miles along the coast; and is but thinly peopled. The chief town, Drontheim, seated on a little gulf at the mouth of the river Nider, is the only metropolitan see in Norway; and carries on a considerable trade in masts, deals, tar, copper, and iron. Leetfrund, Stronden, Scoerdale, Opdal, Romildal, and Solendael, are likewise places of some traffic. The northern division of Drontheim, called the sub-government of Salten, comprehends the towns Melanger and Scheen. The province of Wardhus, extending to the North Cape, and including the islands, is divided into two parts; namely, Finnmark and Norwegian Lapland. The chief town, which is very insignificant, stands upon an island called Ward, from whence the place and the government derive their name, Norway.\n\nThe province of Bahus, though now yielded to the Swedes, is reckoned part of Norway, being a narrow tract of land, about 90 miles in length, lying on the coast of the Categate.\n\nThe great chain of Norway mountains, running from north to south, called indifferently Rudfield, Snudefield, Skarsfield, and Scoreberg, is known in different parts by other appellations; such as Dofrefield, Lamfied, Sagufield, Filefield, Halnefield, Hardangerfield, Joklefield, Bygglefield, Hicklefield, and Hangfield. The height and breadth of this extensive chain likewise vary in different parts. To pass the mountain Hardanger, a man must travel about 70 English miles, whereas Filefield may be about 50 over. This last rises about two miles and a half in perpendicular height; but Dofrefield is counted the highest mountain of Norway, if not of Europe. The river Drivane winds along the side of it in a fertile course, so as to be met nine times by those who travel the winter road to the other side of the chain. The bridges are thrown over roaring cataracts, and but indifferently fastened to the steep rocks on either side; so that the whole exhibits a very dreadful appearance, sufficient to deter the traveller from hazarding such a dangerous passage; for which reason, people generally choose the road over Filefield, which is much more tedious. This, however, is the post road used by the king's carriages. The way is distinguished by posts fixed at the distance of 200 paces from each other, that, in snowy or dark weather, the traveller may not be bewildered. For the convenience of resting and refreshing, there are two mountain stoves or houses maintained on Filefield, as well as upon other mountains, at the expense of the public, and furnished with fire, light, and kitchen utensils. Nothing can be more dismal and dreary than those mountains covered with eternal snow, where neither house, tree, nor living creature is to be seen, but here and there a solitary rein deer, and perhaps a few wandering Laplanders.\n\nIn travelling from Sweden to Nordenfields, there is only one way of avoiding this chain of mountains; and that is, where it is interrupted by a long deep valley, extending from Romfdale to Guldbranddalen. In the year 1612, a body of 1000 Scots, commanded by Sinclair, and sent over as auxiliaries to the Swedes, were put to the sword in this defile, by the peasants of Guldbrand, who never gave quarter.\n\nBesides this chain, there is a great number of detached mountains over all the country, that form valleys and ridges, inhabited by the peasants. Some of these are of incredible height, and others exhibit very remarkable appearances. In sailing up Joering Creek on the left hand, the sight is astonisbed with a group of mountains, resembling the prospect of a city, with old Gothic towers and edifices. In the parish of Oerfkong is the high mountain Skopfhorn, the top of which represents the figure of a fortification, with regular walls and bastions. In the district of Hilgeland appears a very high range of mountains, with seven pinnacles or crests, known by the appellation of the Seven Sisters, discernible a great way off at sea. To the southward of this range, though in the same district, rises the famous mountain Torghatten, so called because the summit resembles a man's head with a hat on, under which appears a single eye, formed by an aperture through the mountain.\nNorway. mountain, 150 ells high, and 3000 ells in length. The sun may be seen through this surprising cavity, which is passible by the foot of travellers. On the top of the mountain we find a reservoir of water, as large as a moderate fish pond; in the lower part is a cavern, through which a line 400 fathoms in length, being let down, did not reach the bottom. At Herroe in Sundmoer is another cavern called Doffeen, supposed to reach under the sea to Scotland; which, however, is no more than an idle tradition. In the year 1752, two clergymen entered this subterranean cavity, and proceeded a considerable way, until they heard the feet dashing over their heads; the passage was as wide and high as an ordinary church, the sides perpendicular, and the roof vaulted. They descended one flight of natural stairs; but arriving at another, they were afraid to penetrate farther; they had gone so far, however, that two candles were consumed in their progress and return. A cavern of a very curious nature, serving as a conduit to a stream of water, penetrates through the sides of the mountain Limur. In the district of Rake, in the neighbourhood of Frederichshall, are three cavities in a rock; one of which is so deep, that a small stone dropped down, does not reach the bottom in less than two minutes; and then the sound it produces is pleasant and melodious, not unlike the sound of a bell.\n\nThe vast mountains and rugged rocks that deform the face of this country are productive of numberless inconveniences. They admit of little arable ground; they render the country in some parts impassable, and everywhere difficult to travellers; they afford shelter to wild beasts, which come from their lurking holes, and make terrible havoc among the flocks of cattle; they expose the sheep and goats, as well as the peasants, to daily accidents of falling over precipices; they occasion sudden torrents, and falls of snow, which descend with incredible impetuosity, and often sweep away the labours of the husbandman; and they are subject to dreadful disruptions, by which huge rocks are rent from their sides, and, hurling down, overwhelm the plains below with inevitable ruin. The peasants frequently build their houses on the edge of a steep precipice, to which they must climb by ladders, at the hazard of their lives; and when a person dies, the corpse must be let down with ropes, before it can be laid in the coffin. In winter the mail is often drawn up the sides of steep mountains. Even in the king's road, travellers are exposed to the frequent risks of falling over those dreadful rocks; for they are obliged to pass over narrow pathways, without rails or rising on the sides, either thored up with rotten planks, or suspended by iron bolts fastened in the mountains. In the narrow pass of Naeroe is a remarkable way of this kind, which, above 600 years ago, the famous King Sverre caused to be made for the passage of his cavalry; and even this would have been found impassable by any other horses than those of Norway, which are used to climb the rocks like goats. Another very difficult and dangerous road is that between Shogstadt and Vang-in-Volders, along the side of a steep mountain, in some places so narrow, that if two travellers on horseback should meet in the night, they would find it impracticable either to pass each other, or turn back. In such a case their lives could not be saved, unless one of them should alight, and throw his horse headlong into the lake below, and then cling to the rock, until the other could pass. When a sheep or goat makes a false step to the projection of a rock, from whence it can neither ascend nor descend, the owner hazards his own life to preserve that of the animal. He directs himself to be lowered down from the top of the mountain, sitting on a cross stick, tied to the end of a long rope; and when he arrives at the place where the creature stands, he fastens it to the same cord, and it is drawn up with himself. Perhaps the other end of the rope is held by one person only; and there are some instances in which the assistant has been dragged down by the weight of his friend, so that both have perished. When either man or beast has had the misfortune to fall over very high precipices, they have not only been suffocated by the repercussion of the air, but their bodies have been always burst before they reached the ground. Sometimes entire crests of rocks, many fathoms in length and breadth, have fallen down at once, creating such a violent agitation of the air, as seemed a prelude to the world's dissolution. At Steenbroe in Laerdal, a stupendous mass, larger than any castle in the universe, appears to have been fevered and tumbled from the mountain in large, sharp, and ragged fragments, through which the river rears with hideous bellowing. In the year 1731, a promontory on Sundmoer, called Ramsfjeld, that hung over Nordal Creek, suddenly gave way, and plunged into the water; which swelled to such a degree, that the church of Strand, though half a league on the other side of the bank, was overflowed; the creek, however, was not filled up; on the contrary the fishermen declare they find no difference in the depth, which is said to exceed 900 fathoms.\n\nThe remarkable rivers of Norway are these: The Nied, issuing from Tydalmen, on the borders of Sweden, runs westward into the lake Selboe; and afterwards, turning to the northward, passes by the city of Drontheim, to which it anciently gave the name of Nidero; and Nidqo: Sule Ely, that descending from Sulefield, runs with a rapid course through Nordale into the sea; Gulen, which rises near Sifferfeld in the north; and running 20 leagues westward, through Aalen, Hlotaalen, Storen, and Meihus, discharges itself into the sea, about a league to the west of Drontheim. In the year 1344, this river buried itself under ground; from whence it again burst forth with such violence, that the earth and stones thrown up by the eruption filled the valley, and formed a dam; which, however, was soon broken and washed away by the force of the water. Divers churches, 48 farm houses, with 250 persons, were destroyed on this occasion.\u2014Otteren, a large river, taking its rise from the mountain Agde, runs about 30 leagues through Seesterdale and Efde, and discharges itself into the cataract of Wiland. The river Syre rises near the mountain Lang, and winds its course through the vale of Syre into the lake of Lande in the diocese of Christiania; thence it continues its way to the sea, into which it discharges itself through a narrow strait formed by two rocks. This contraction augments its impetuosity, so that it shoots like an arrow into the sea, in which it produces a very great agitation. Nid and Sheen are two considerable rivers, issuing out of Tillemark. Their water-falls have been diverted, with infinite labour, by canals and passages cut through the rocks, for the convenience of floating down the timber. Tyreford or Dramme, is in the neighbourhood of Ho-\nNorway nifosse, joined by two rivers from Osdale and Hadsland, and disembogues itself into the sea near Bragernes. Loven rises in the highest part of Nummedal, and runs through Konnerberg to the sea near Laurvig. Glaamnen is the largest river of Norway, distinguished by the name of Stor Elvin, or the great river. It derives its origin from the mountain Dofre, from whence it winds all along the plains of Oesterdalen and Soloe; then joins the Vorme, another considerable river rising out of Mioss and Guldbranddalen. These being joined, traverse the lake Oeyern; and thence issuing, run on to Sarp near Fredericksfadt.\n\nNorway abounds with fresh-water lakes; the principal of which are Ryfvan in Nordland, Snalen, Selboe, the Greater and Lesser Mioss, Shirevand, Sperdille, Rand, Vefta, Saren, Modum, Lund, Norfoe, Huidfoe, Farifvand, and Oeyevand: all these are well stocked with fish, and navigable for large vessels. Wars have been formerly carried on upon these inland seas; in some of which are small floating islands, or parcels of earth, with trees on them, separated from the main land, and probably preserved in compact masses by the roots of trees, shrubs, and grass, interwoven in the soil. In the year 1722, the family seat of Borge, near Fredericksfadt, being a noble edifice, with lofty towers and battlements, suddenly sunk into an abyss 100 fathoms deep, which was instantaneously filled by a piece of water 300 ells in length and about half as broad. Fourteen persons, with 200 head of cattle, perished in this catastrophe, which was occasioned by the river Glaamnen precipitating itself down a waterfall near Sarp, and undermining the foundation. Of all the waterfalls in Norway this of Sarp is the most dangerous for its height and rapidity. The current drives 17 miles; and roars with such violence, that the water, being dashed and comminuted among the rocks, rises in the form of rain, where a beautiful rainbow may be always seen when the sun shines. In ancient times this cataract was made use of for the execution of traitors and other malefactors: they were thrown down alive, that they might be dashed in pieces on the points of rocks, and die in a dreadful commotion, analogous to those they had endeavoured to excite in the community.\n\nGreat part of Norway is covered with forests of wood, which constitute the principal article of commerce in this country. They chiefly consist of fir and pine, for which great sums are received from foreigners, who export an immense number of masts, beams, planks, and boards. Besides, an incredible quantity is consumed at home in building houses, ships, bridges, piles, moles, and fences; over and above the vast demand for charcoal to the foundries, and fuel for domestic uses.\u2014Nay, in some places, the trees are felled for no other purpose but to clear the ground and to be burned into ashes for manure. A good quantity of timber is yearly exported to Scotland and Spain; but this is inconsiderable when compared to the vast exports from Drammen, Frederickshall or Fredericksfadt, Christiana, Skeen, Arendal, Christiania, Chriffian's Bay, and Drontheim. The masts and large beams are floated down the rivers, and the rest is divided into boards at the saw mills. These works supply a vast number of families with a comfortable subsistence.\u2014A tenth part of all sawed timber belongs to his Danish majesty, and makes a considerable branch of his revenue. The forests in Norway are so vast and thick, that the people seem to think Norway there can never be a scarcity of wood, especially as the soil is peculiarly adapted for the production of timber; they therefore destroy it with a wasteful hand; insomuch that more wood rots in Norway than is burned in the whole kingdom of Denmark. The best timber grows in the provinces of Saltan, Helleland, Komfdale, Guldbranddalen, Oesterdalen, Soloe, Valders, Hallingdale, Sogniford, Telemark, and the lordship of Nedenes.\n\nThe climate of Norway is very different in different parts of the kingdom. At Bergen the winter is so moderate, that the seas are always open and practicable both to mariners and fishermen, except in creeks and bays, that reach far up into the country towards Filefield, when the keen north-east wind blows from the land. On the east side of Norway, from the frontiers of Sweden to Filefield, the cold generally sets in about the middle of October with great severity, and lasts till the middle of April; during which interval the waters are frozen to a very considerable thickness, and the face of the country is covered with snow. In the year 1719, 7500 Swedes, who intended to attack Drontheim, perished in the snow on the mountain of Ruden or Tydel, which separates Jempleteland in Sweden from the diocese of Drontheim. A company of 200 Norwegian fledge-men under Major Emahus, found them all frozen to death on the ridge of the mountain, where they had been surprised by a storm accompanied with snow, hail, and extreme cold. Some of these unhappy victims appeared fitting, some lying, and others kneeling in a posture of praying. They had cut in pieces their muklets, and burned the little wood they afforded.\u2014The generals Labarre and Zoega lost their lives; and of the whole corps, consisting originally of 10,000, no more than 250 survived this dreadful catastrophe.\n\nThe cold is still more intense in that part of Norway called Finnmark, situated in the frigid zone near the polar circle. But if the winter is generally cold, the summer is often excessively hot in Norway. The rays of the sun are reverberated from the sides of the mountains so as to render the weather close and sultry in the valleys; besides, the sun's absence below the horizon is so short, that the atmosphere and mountains have not time to cool. The heat is so great, that vegetation is remarkably quick. Barley is sown, grows, ripens, and is reaped, in the space of six weeks or two months. The longest day at Bergen consists of 19 hours; the sun rising at half an hour after two, and setting at half an hour after nine. The shortest day does not exceed five hours; for the sun rises at nine in the morning, and sets at three in the afternoon.\u2014In the beginning of the year the daylight increases with remarkable celerity; and, at the approach of winter, decreases in the same proportion. In summer one may read and write at midnight by the light of the sky. Christian V., while he resided at Drontheim, used to sup at midnight without candles. In the district of Tromfen, at the extremity of Norway, the sun is continually in view at midsummer. It is seen to circulate day and night round the north pole, contracting its orbit, and then gradually enlarging it, until at length it leaves the horizon. In the depth of winter, therefore, it is for some weeks invisible; and all the light perceived at noon is a faint glimmering for about an hour and a half, proceeding from the reflection of the sun's rays from the highest mountains.\nNorway. mountains. But the inhabitants of these provinces are supplied with other lights that enable them to follow their employments in the open air. The sky being generally serene, the moonlight is remarkably bright, and, being reflected from the mountains, illuminates the valleys. They are also afflicted by the aurora borealis, which is very frequent in the northern parts of Europe.\n\nThe air of Norway is generally pure and salubrious. On the sea coasts, indeed, it is rendered moist by vapours and exhalations; but in the midland parts of the country, towards the mountains, the climate is so dry, that meat may be kept for many years without being worm-eaten or damaged in the least. The inhabitants have no idea of sickness, except what is occasioned by excesses. It is said, that in the vale of Guldbrand the inhabitants live to such extreme old age, that they become weary of life, and cause themselves to be removed to a less salubrious climate, whereby they may have a chance of dying sooner. In consumptions, however, the moist air on the sea side is found to be most agreeable to the lungs in respiration. Norway, being a mountainous country intersected by creeks, abounding with lakes, rivers, and snow, must be subject to frequent rains; and from sudden thaws the inhabitants are sometimes exposed to terrible dilatations. Vast masses of snow falling from precipices overwhelm men, cattle, boats, houses, nay even whole villages. About two centuries ago, a whole parish was covered and destroyed by an immense mass of snow; and several domestic utensils, as teapots, knives, and basins, have been at different times brought to light by a rivulet that runs under the snow, which has been gradually hardened and increased by repeated frosts and annual accretions.\n\nThe winds that chiefly prevail on the western coast are those that blow from the south; whereas, on the other side of Fifefield, the winds that produce and continue the hard frosts are always northerly. In the summer, there is a kind of regular trade-wind on the coast of Bergen. In the forenoon the sea begins to be cooled with a westerly breeze, which continues till midnight. Then the land breeze begins from the east, and blows till about ten in the morning. The coast is likewise subject to sudden squalls and storms. Hurricanes sometimes rise at sea; and in these latitudes the phenomenon called a water-spout is not uncommon. One of these in the neighbourhood of Ferro is said to have sucked up with the water some last of herrings, which were afterwards dropped on Kolter, a mountain 1200 feet high.\n\nThe fresh water of Norway is not very light or pure; but on the contrary, is generally turbid, and deposits a sediment of adventitious matter, being sometimes impregnated with ochre and particles of iron.\u2014Nevertheless it is agreeable to the taste, and remarkably salubrious; as appears from the good health of the common people, who drink little or no other liquor.\n\nThe soil of Norway varies in different places according to the situation of rock or valley. The mountains, here, as in every other country, are bare and barren; but the earth washed down from them by the rains enriches and fertilizes the valleys. In these the soil generally consists of black mould, sand, loam, chalk, and gravel, lying over one another in unequal strata, and sometimes in three or four successions: the mould that lies uppermost is very fine and mellow, and fit to nourish all sorts of vegetables. There is also clay found in different parts of this kingdom, of which the inhabitants begin to make earthen ware; but bricks and tiles are not used in building. The face of the country is in many places deformed by large swamps and marshes, very dangerous to the traveller. Near Leefoe in the diocese of Christiania, a wooden causeway is extended near a mile over a morass; and if a horse or any other animal should make a false step, he will sink at once into the abyss, never to rise again.\n\nIn a cold country like Norway, stony with rocks and mountains, interspersed with bogs, and covered with forests, we cannot expect to find agriculture in perfection. The ploughed lands, in respect to mountains, woods, meadows, and wastes, do not exceed the proportion of 1 to 80; so that the whole country does not produce corn to maintain above half the number of its inhabitants. The peasants are discouraged from the practice of husbandry by the frequency of accidents that seem peculiar to the climate. Even in the fruitful provinces of Guldbrandsfjeld, Oesterdale, and Soloe, as well as in the other places, when the corn appears in the most flourishing condition, the whole hope of the harvest is sometimes destroyed in one night by a sudden frost that nips the blade and extinguishes the vegetation. The kingdom is moreover visited by some unfavourable years, in which the sun seems to have lost his genial power; the vegetables are blighted; the trees bud and bloom, yet bear no fruit; and the grain, though it rises, will yet produce nothing but empty ears and straw. This calamity, however, rarely occurs; and in general the cultivated parts of Norway yield plentiful crops of excellent rye, barley, and oats. The most fruitful provinces are Nordland, Inderbarre, and Numedale, in the diocese of Drontheim; Sognfjord and Vaas, in that of Bergen; Jeddere, Ryefylk, Raabygdalag, the lordship of Nedenes, in the diocese of Christiania; Hedemark in the diocese of Aggerhus; Hadeland, Toten, Romerige, Ringerige, and Guldbrandsfjeld: these territories not only produce grain enough for their own consumption, but likewise support their neighbours, and even supply part of Sweden.\u2014Peat is likewise propagated in this country, together with wheat, buckwheat, hops, hemp, and flax, but not to any considerable advantage. The meadows are well stored with pasturage for sheep and cattle, and the fields are productive of those vegetables which are common in other northern countries. Within these 50 years the people of Norway have bestowed some attention on the culture of gardens, which in former times was so neglected, that the cities and towns were supplied with leeks, cabbage, and roots, from England and Holland. At present, however, the Norwegians raise their own culinary and garden roots and vegetables, which thrive there as well as in any other country. The scarcity being a disease that prevails along the sea coast, Nature has scattered upon it a variety of herbs efficacious in the cure of that distemper; such as angelica, rofe-wort, gentian, cretis, trefoil, forrel, scurvy-grafts, and a plant called erich's grafs, that grows in great plenty on the islands of Nordland: from whence the people of the continent fetch away boat loads of it, to be preserved in barrels as a succedaneum for cabbage. There are also a few noxious vegetables little known in any country but Norway.\nIn Guldbranddalle is a species of grass called *selfnape*, the root of which is so poisonous, that any beast which eats of it dies immediately, the belly bursting; nay, the carnivorous fowls that prey upon the carcals of the beast meet with the same fate: children have been more than once poisoned by this root, which nevertheless is sometimes used externally as an amulet for arthritic disorders. Another vegetable pernicious to the cattle is the *Gramen offfragum Norwegienfe*, which is said to mollify the bones of the cattle which feed upon it. Among the noxious plants of Norway we may also reckon the *gle-glas*, fatal to sheep and goats; the *tour-gras*, which affects horses and cows with a fort of lethargy; and the plant *torboe*, or little-spring, which produces nearly the same effect on horses, but is not at all prejudicial to cows, sheep, or any ruminating animals. The herb *turte*, not unlike angelica, operates nearly in the same manner: yet the bears are said to feed upon it with peculiar relish; and when their hair begins to fall off by feeding upon this plant, they cure themselves by eating the flesh of animals.\n\nThe common fruit trees thrive tolerably well in Norway, the inhabitants of which have plenty of cherries, apples, and pears. Some kinds of plums attain maturity; which is seldom the case with grapes, apricots, and peaches. But even the apples and pears that ripen here are summer fruit; that which grows till the winter seldom coming to perfection. Great variety of agreeable berries is produced in different parts of this kingdom; such as the hagebar, a kind of floes; an infusion of which in wine makes a pleasant cooling liquor; juniper berries, corinths red and white, foelbar or sunberries, raifberries, goofeberries, blackberries, strawberries, &c. with many other species that seem to be natives of Norway and Sweden. Among those are the transebar, the produce of the myrtillus repens, red and auster, found in the spring in perfection under the snow, and much relished by the reindeer; crakebeer, resembling bilberries, deemed a powerful anticoagulant; ager-beer, larger and blacker than bilberries, of a pleasant acid, ripened by cold, and used as cherries for an infusion in wine; and finally tytlebeer, a red pleasant berry growing on a short stem, with leaves like those of box; they are plucked off by handfuls, and sent to Denmark to be preferred for the table, where they are eaten by way of dessert.\n\nOf the trees that grow wild in Norway, the principal are the fir and the pine. The first yield an annual revenue of 1,000,000 of rixdollars, if we include the advantages resulting from the saw mills and the masts; one of which last has been known to sell for 200 rixdollars. The red fir tree, which grows on the mountains, is so rich in turpentine as to be almost incorruptible. Some of the houses belonging to the Norway peasants, built of this timber, are supposed to be above 400 years standing. In Guldbranddalle the house is still to be seen standing in which King Olaf lodged five nights, above 700 years ago, when he travelled round the kingdom to convert the people to the Christian faith. Even 100 years after the trunk of the fir tree has been cut down, the peasants burn the roots for tar, which is a very profitable commodity. In the fens, the resin of the fir tree is by nature transformed into a substance which may be called *Norway frankincense*. The buds or pine apples of this tree, boiled in stale beer, make an excellent medicine for the scurvy; less unpleasant to the taste, though as efficacious, as tar-water. The pine tree is more tall and beautiful than the fir, though inferior to it in strength and quality; for which reason the planks of it are sold at an inferior price, and the peasants waste it without remorse. Norway likewise produces some forests of oak, which is found to be excellent for ship-building. Here also grow plenty of elm trees; the bark of which, being powdered, is boiled up with other food to fatten hogs, and even mixed by the poor among their meal; also the ash, from which the peasants distill a balm used in certain disorders, and which is used both externally and internally. Many other trees flourish in this country, an enumeration of which would prove too tedious. Hazels grow here in such abundance, that 100 tons of the nuts are annually exported from Bergen alone.\n\nA great diversity of stones is found in Norway, some of which are of a surprising figure. Several mountains consist chiefly of a brown pebble, which decays with age; nay, it sometimes dissolves, and drops into the sea, and the cement being thus loosened, a terrible dilution ensues. In some places the gray and black pebbles are intermixed with iron, copper, lead, silver, and gold. The ground in certain districts is covered with the fragments of rocks that have been precipitated from the summits of mountains, and broken by their fall into innumerable shivers. Between 20 and 30 years ago, in the neighbourhood of Bergen, a man was suddenly overwhelmed with such a mass, which formed a kind of vault around him. In this dreadful tomb he remained alive for several weeks. By his loud cries the place of his confinement was discovered: but it was found impossible to remove the huge stones by which he was inclosed. All that his friends could do for him was, to lower down meat and drink through some crevices; but at length the stones fell in, and crushed him to death.\n\nIn Norway are inexhaustible quarries of excellent marble, black, white, blue, gray, and variegated; together with some detached pieces of alabaster, several kinds of spar, chalk-stone, cement-stone, sand-stone, millstone, baking-stone, flate, talc, magnets, and wine-stone, a production natural to Norway and Sweden, of a brown colour, fetid smell, in texture resembling crystal, and deriving its name from a supposed efficacy in curing a distemper incident to swine. Here also is found the amianthus or stone-flax, of which incombustible cloth may be made. Norway, however, affords no flints, but plenty of pyrites or quartz, beautiful crystals, granites, amethysts, agate, thunder-stones, and eagle-stones. Gold has formerly been found in a small quantity in the diocese of Christianland, and coined into ducats. There is at present a very considerable silver mine wrought at Kongsherg on the account and at the risk of his Danish majesty: the ore is surprisingly rich, but interrupted in such a manner, that the vein is often lost. Many masses of pure silver have been found; and, among the rest, one piece weighing 560 pounds, preserved in the royal museum at Copenhagen. Such is the richness of these mines, that the annual produce amounts in value to a ton and a half in gold. About 5000 people are daily employed, and earn their subsistence, in these stupendous works.\nNorway. works (a). Other silver mines are prosecuted at Jarlberg, but not to the same advantage; and here the ore is mixed with lead and copper. In many parts of this country copper mines have been discovered; but the principal, and perhaps the richest in all Europe, is at Rorasaas, about 100 English miles from Drontheim. This work yields annually about 1100 ship pounds of pure copper; the founderies belonging to it consume yearly about 14,000 lasts of coal, and 500 fathoms of wood. The next in importance is the copper work at Lykken, about 20 miles from Drontheim. A third mine is carried on at Indet or Quickne, at the distance of 30 miles from the same place; and here they precipitate the copper from its mercurium, by means of iron. There is a fourth copper work at Silboe, about 30 miles distant from Drontheim, though the least considerable of the four. Other copper mines of less note are worked in different parts of the kingdom. Iron is still in greater plenty, and was the first metal wrought in this country. Many hundred thousand quintals are annually exported, chiefly in bars, and part of it in stoves, pots, kettles, and cannon; the national profit arising from this metal is estimated at 300,000 rixdollars. There is a species called moor-iron, found in large lumps among the morasses: of this the peasants make their own domestic tools and utensils, such as knives, scythes, and axes. The lead found mixed in the silver ore is an article of small importance in Norway; yet some mines of this metal have been lately opened in the district of Soloe by the proprietors of the copper work at Oudal. A vitriol work has been begun near Kongberg: the mines yield great plenty of sulphur; which, however, the Norwegians will not take the trouble to melt and depurate, because immense quantities are found at a cheaper rate in the island of Iceland. Alum is found between the slate flakes near Christiania in such plenty, that works have been set up for refining this mineral, though they have not yet brought it to any degree of transparency. His Danish majesty has established salt works in the peninsula of Valoe, about six English miles from Tonberg, where this mineral is extracted in large quantities from the sea water.\n\nBesides the animals common to other countries, Norway is said to contain many of the uncommon and dubious kind; such as the kraken, mermaid, sea serpent, &c. See these articles.\n\nMany Danish, English, Scotch, Dutch, and German families have now settled in Norway; and indeed form no inconsiderable part of the trading people: but the original inhabitants are the descendants of those ferocious Normanni, who harried almost all the coasts of Europe with piratical armaments in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries.\n\n\"Our first certain knowledge of the inhabitants of this country (says Pennant *) was from the defoliation they brought on the southern nations by their piratical invasions. Their country had before that period the name of Nortmanland, and the inhabitants Normans, a title which included other adjacent people. Great Britain and Ireland were ravaged by them in 845; and they continued their invasion till they effected the conquest of England, under their leader Canute the Great. They went up the Seine as far as Paris, burnt the town, and forced its weak monarch to purchase their absence at the price of fourteen thousand marks. They plundered Spain, and at length carried their excursions through the Mediterranean to Italy, and even into Sicily. They used narrow vessels, like their ancestors the Sitones; and, besides oars, added the improvement of two sails; and victualled them with salted provisions, biscuit, cheese, and beer. Their ships were at first small; but in after times they were large enough to hold 100 or 120 men. But the multitude of vessels was amazing. The fleet of Harold Blageland consisted of 700. A hundred thousand of these savages have at once sailed from Scandinavia, so justly styled Officina gentium, aut certe velut vagina nationum. Probably necessity, more than ambition, caused them to displace their country of its exuberant numbers. Multitudes were destroyed; but multitudes remained, and peopled more favourable climates.\n\n\"Their king, Olaus, was a convert to Christianity in 904; Bernard an Englishman had the honour of baptizing him, when Olaus happened to touch at one of the Scilly islands. He plundered with great spirit during several years; and in 1066 received the crown of martyrdom from his pagan subjects. But religious zeal first gave the rest of Europe a knowledge of their country and the sweets of its commerce. The Hanse towns poured in their missionaries, and reaped a temporal harvest. By the year 1204, the merchants obtained from the wise prince Suer every encouragement to commerce; and by that means introduced wealth and civilization into his barren kingdom. England by every method cherished the advantages resulting from an intercourse with Norway, and Bergen was the emporium. Henry III. in 1217, entered into a league with its monarch Haquin; by which both princes stipulated for free access for their subjects into their respective kingdoms, free trade, and security to their persons. In 1269, Henry entered into another treaty with Magnus; in which it was agreed, that no goods should be exported from either kingdom except they had been paid for; and there is, besides a humane provision on both sides, for the security of the persons and effects of the subjects who should suffer shipwreck on their several coasts.\"\n\nThe inhabitants now speak the same language that is used in Denmark, through their original tongue is the dialect now spoken in Iceland. They profess the Lutheran religion, under an archbishop established at Drontheim.\n\n(a) Mr Coxe tells us, that he visited those mines, but at present yield little more than 50,000l. The expenses generally exceed the profits; and government gains only by the number of miners employed. The mines of cobalt, and the preparation of Prussian blue, are much more productive. The latter goes through 270 hands, and the number of men employed is 365. It is supposed, that, at this period (1793), it may produce to government a profit of 16,000l. a-year.\nDrontheim, with four suffragans; namely, of Bergen, Staffanger, Hammer, and Christiana. By the union of Calmar, the two kingdoms of Norway and Denmark were united under one monarch; and then the people of both nations enjoyed considerable privileges: but the Danish government soon became absolute; and Norway was ruled despotically by a viceroy, who resided in the capital, and presided in the supreme court, to which appeals were made from the subordinate courts of judicature. A great change has, however, taken place since the present amiable and accomplished prince of Denmark had part of the government; and more may be expected from his virtue and affability when the power shall come wholly into his own hands.\n\nThe Norwegians are generally well formed, tall, sturdy, and robust, brave, hardy, honest, hospitable, and ingenious; yet savage, rash, quarrelsome, and litigious. The same character will nearly suit the inhabitants of every mountainous country in the northern climates. Their women are well shaped, tall, comely, remarkably fair, and obliging. The nobility of Norway have been chiefly removed by the kings of Denmark, in order to prevent faction and opposition to the court; or are long ago degenerated into the rank of peasants: some families, however, have been lately raised to that dignity. Every freeholder in Norway enjoys the right of primogeniture and power of redemption; and it is very usual to see a peasant inhabiting the same house which has been possessed 400 years by his ancestors. The adels-gods, or freehold, cannot be alienated by sale or otherwise from the right heir, called adels-mand: if he is not able to redeem the estate, he declares his incapacity every 10th year at the sessions; and if he, or his heirs to the third generation, should acquire wealth enough for that purpose, the possessor pro tempore must resign his possession.\n\nThe mountaineers acquire surprising strength and dexterity by hard living, cold, laborious exercise, climbing rocks, skating on the snow, and handling arms, which they carry from their youth to defend themselves against the wild beasts of the forest. Those who dwell in the maritime parts of Norway exercise the employments of fishing and navigation, and become very expert mariners.\n\nThe peasants of Norway never employ any handicraftsmen for necessaries to themselves and families: they are their own hatters, shoemakers, tailors, tanners, weavers, carpenters, smiths, and joiners: they are even expert at ship-building; and some of them make excellent violins. But their general turn is for carving in wood, which they execute in a surprising manner with a common knife of their own forging. They are taught in their youth to wrestle, ride, swim, skate, climb, shoot, and forge iron. Their amusements consist in making verses, blowing the horn, or playing upon a kind of guitar, and the violin: this last kind of music they perform even at funerals. The Norwegians have evinced their valour and fidelity in a thousand different instances. The country was always disturbed by intestine quarrels, which raged from generation to generation. Even the farmers stand upon their puntillo, and challenge one another to single combat with their knives. On such occasions they hook themselves together by their belts, and fight until one of them is killed or mortally wounded. At weddings and public feasts they drink to intoxication, quarrel, fight, and murder generally ensues. The very common people are likewise passionate, ambitious of glory and independence, and vain of their pedigree. The nobility and merchants of Norway fare sumptuously; but the peasant lives with the utmost temperance and frugality, except at festivals: his common bread is made of oatmeal, rolled into broad thin cakes, like those used in Scotland. In time of scarcity, they boil, dry, and grind the bark of the fir tree into a kind of flour which they mix with oatmeal; the bark of the elm tree is used in the same manner. In those parts where a fishery is carried on, they knead the roes of cod with their oat meal. Of these last, mixed with barley meal, they make hasty pudding and soup, enriched with a pickled herring or salted mackerel. Fresh fish they have in plenty on the sea coast. They hunt and eat grouse, partridge, hare, red deer, and reindeer. They kill cows, sheep, and goats, for their winter stock: these they pickle, or smoke, or dry for use. They make cheese of their milk, and a liquor called syre of their four whey: this they commonly drink mixed with water; but they provide a store of strong ale for Christmas, weddings, christenings, and other entertainments. From their temperance and exercise, joined to the purity and elasticity of their air, they enjoy good health, and often attain to a surprising degree of longevity. Nothing is more common than to see a hearty Norwegian turned of 100. In the year 1733, four couples danced before his Danish majesty at Frederikshald; their ages, when joined, exceeded 800 years. Nevertheless the Norwegians are subject to various diseases; such as the scab, the leprosy, the scurvy, the catarrh, the rheumatism, gout, and epilepsy. The dress of the Norway peasants consists of a wide loose jacket made of coarse cloth, with waistcoat and breeches of the same. Their heads are covered with flapped hats, or caps ornamented with ribbons. They wear shoes without outer soles, and in the winter leather buskins. They have likewise snow shoes and long skates, with which they travel at a great pace, either on the land or ice. There is a corps of soldiers thus accoutred, who can outmatch the swiftest horses. The Norwegian peasant never wears a neckcloth, except on extraordinary occasions: he opens his neck and breast to the weather, and lets the snow beat into his bosom. His body is girt round with a broad leather belt, adorned with brass plates, from which depends a brass chain that sustains a large knife, gimlet, and other tackle. The women are dressed in close laced jackets, having leather girdles decorated with ornaments of silver. They likewise wear silver chains round their necks, to the ends of which are fixed gilt medals. Their caps and handkerchiefs are almost covered with small plates of silver, brass, and tin, large rings, and buttons. A maiden bride appears with her hair plaited, and, together with her clothes, hung full of such jingling trinkets.\n\nThe churches, public edifices, and many private houses in Norway, are built of stone: but the people in general live in wooden houses, made of the trunks of fir and pine tree laid upon each other, and joined by mortises at the corners. These are counted more dry, warm, and healthy, than stone or brick buildings. In the whole diocese of Bergen, one hardly fees a farm house with a chimney or window: they are generally lighted by a square hole in the top of the house, which lets in the light, and lets out the smoke. In summer\nNorway, this hole is left quite open; in the winter, it is covered with what they call a fiau; that is the membrane of some animal, stretched upon a wooden frame that fits the hole, and transmits the rays of light. It is fixed or removed with a long pole occasionally. Every person that enters the house, upon business or courtship, takes hold of this pole, according to ancient custom. The ceiling is about eight feet high in the middle; and, being arched like a cupola, the smoke of the fire underneath rolls about, until it finds a vent at the hole, which is called liur. Under this opening stands a thick table with benches, and a high seat at the upper end for the master of the family: he has likewise a small cupboard for his own use, in which he locks up his most valuable effects. The boards of the roof are coated with the bark of the birch trees, which is counted incorruptible: this again is covered with turf, which yields a good crop of grass for goats and sheep, and is often mowed as hay by the farmer.\n\nThe Norwegians carry on a considerable trade with foreign nations. The duty on the produce of their own country exported, amounts annually to 100,000 rix-dollars. These commodities are, copper wrought and unwrought; iron cast into cannon, floves, and pots, or forged into bars; lead, in small quantity; masts, timber, deal boards, planks, marble, millstones, herring, cod, ling, salmon, lobsters, flounders, cow hides, goat skins, seal skins, the furs of bears, wolves, foxes, beavers, ermines, martens, &c., down, feathers, butter, tallow, train oil, tar, juniper and other sorts of berries, and nuts; salt, alum, glaas, vitriol, and pot ashes. All other commodities and articles of luxury the Norwegians import from different nations. The nature of the ground does not admit of much improvement in agriculture: nevertheless, the farmers are not deficient in industry and skill to drain marshes, and render the ground arable and fit for pasture. Many are employed in grazing and breeding cattle; but a much greater number is engaged in felling wood, floating timber, burning charcoal, and extracting tar from the roots of the trees which have been cut down in the silver, copper, and iron mines; in the navigation and fishery. A considerable number of people earn a comfortable livelihood by hunting, shooting, and bird-catching. Every individual is at liberty to pursue the game, especially in the mountains and commons; therefore every peasant is expert in the use of fire arms; and there are excellent marksmen among the mountains, who make use of the bow to kill those animals, whose skins, being valuable, would be damaged by the shot of fire arms.\n\nNorway can produce above 14,000 excellent seamen.

It is supposed to have had its name, which signifies \"a castle to the north,\" from its situation in respect of C\u00e6sar, the ancient Venta Icenorum, three or four miles to the south of it, out of whose ruins it seems to have risen. In its infancy, in the reign of Etheldred, it was plundered and burnt by Sueno the Dane, when he invaded England with a great army. Afterwards it recovered; and in the reign of Edward the Confessor was a considerable place, having 1320 burgheers. But it suffered again much in the reign of William I. by being the seat of a civil war, which Ralph earl of the East Angles raised against that king. So much was it impaired by the siege it then underwent, that there were scarce 360 burgheers left in it, as appears from Doomsday book. From that time forward it began by little and little to recover, especially after Bishop Herbert translated the episcopal see hither from Thetford in the reign of William Rufus in 1096; and built a beautiful cathedral, of which he himself laid the first stone, with this inscription, Dominus Herbertus posuit primum lapidem, in nomine Patrii, Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen, i.e. \"Lord (Bishop) Herbert laid the first stone, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\" And by a licence from Pope Paschal, declared it the mother church of Norfolk and Suffolk. After this, as Malmesbury has it, it became a town famous for merchandise and the number of inhabitants. Yet it was miserably harassed in the reign of Henry II. by Hugh Bigod earl of Norfolk, who was an adherent of Henry's son, called the junior king. In the time of Edward I. it was walled round by the citizens, who had presented a petition to parliament for liberty to do it. Henry IV. allowed them, instead of bailiffs, which they had before, to elect a mayor yearly, and made the city a county of itself. In the year 1348, near 18,000 persons were carried off by the plague; and in 1505, the city was almost consumed by fire. For the flourishing state to which the city is now arrived, they are much indebted to the Flemings, who fled hither from the tyranny of the duke of Alva and the inquisition, and taught them the manufacture of those striped and flowered damasks, camlets, druggets, black and white crape, for which the place is now so noted, and which have been computed to yield sometimes 200,000l. a-year. In the year 1583, the citizens, by the help of an engine, conveyed water through pipes to the highest parts of the city, which is pleasantly seated along the side of a hill, extending a mile and a half in length from north to south; but the breadth is much less, and it contracts itself by degrees towards the south. It is now one of the most considerable cities in Britain for wealth, populousness, neat buildings, beautiful churches, (of which it had once 38, but now only 36), and the industry and civility of the inhabitants. The cathedral is a very venerable structure, with a curious roof, adorned with the history of the Bible in little images, carved to the life, and a lofty steeple 105 yards high. The wall of flint stone, beautified with 40 towers and 12 gates, finished in 1309, is now much decayed. The city, though there is a great deal of waste ground within the walls, was computed, about 60 years ago, to contain 8000 houses and 50,000 inhabitants. Besides the cathedral already mentioned, the most remarkable buildings are, the duke of Norfolk's house, one of the largest in England; the castle, which is now the county gaol, and stands in the heart of the city, with a deep moat round it, over which is a bridge of one very large arch; the town hall; the guild hall, formerly the church belonging to the monastery of Black Friars; the house of correction; the shire house, where the assizes are held; a lofty market cross, built after the manner of piazza; the bishop's palace; the king's school, founded by Edward VI. the boys of which are nominated by the mayor for the time being, with the consent\nNorwich. consent of the majority of aldermen. There having been formerly many thatched houses, an order was made, that all houses that should hereafter be built should be covered with tiles. The city is interspersed with gardens, orchards, and trees, which make it both pleasant and healthful. It has four hospitals, in which a great number of old men and women, boys and girls, are maintained; and a dozen charity schools. Here are two churches for the Dutch and French Flemings; who have particular privileges, and are very numerous. Some of the churches are thatched, and all of them crafted with flint stone curiously cut; which is the more wonderful, as Norwich stands in a clay country, and has no flint within 20 miles of it. It is now governed by a mayor, recorder, steward, two sheriffs, 24 aldermen, 60 common council, with a town clerk, sword-bearer, and other inferior officers. The mayor is chosen on May-day by the freemen, and sworn in on the Tuesday before Midsummer-eve. The sheriffs are also chosen annually, on the first Tuesday in August, one by the freemen, the other by the aldermen, and sworn in on Michaelmas day. The freemen of the several wards choose each their alderman. The common council is chosen in Mid Lent. The mayor is a justice of the peace and quorum, during his year (as are also the recorder and steward) within the city and liberties; and after his mayoralty, he is a justice during life. The trade and manufactures of the city are very considerable. At Yarmouth they export large quantities of their manufactures, most of which are sent to London; and import a great deal of wine, coal, fish, oil, &c. All the city and country round are employed in the worsted manufacture, brought hither, as already observed, by the Flemings, in which they not only consume the wool of their own county, in spinning, weaving, &c. but use many thousand packs of yarn which they receive from other parts of England, as far as Yorkshire and Westmoreland. There are eight wardens of the weavers chosen annually, and sworn to take care that there be no frauds committed in spinning, weaving, or dying the stuffs. It is computed that there are not less than 120,000 people employed in and about the city in the silk and woollen manufactures. Their markets are thought to be the greatest in England, and furnished with a surprising plenty and variety of goods and provisions. At a small village to the north of the city, called St Faith's, not less than 40,000 head of Scotch cattle are said to be yearly bought up by the Norfolk graziers, and fattened in their meadows and marshes. Its markets are on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. It has a great number of fairs, lends two members to parliament, and gives the title of earl to the duke of Gordon.\n\nFew cities or towns seem to have suffered more than Norwich has done at various periods, and few seem to have felt it less; for though quite burnt down by Sueno as above, it was of considerable consequence in Edward the Confessor's time; nor did it long feel the evils of the insurrection and siege in William the Conqueror's time, for it was rebuilt in Stephen's reign, and made a corporation.\n\nThe city of Norwich has long been famous for its manufactures; which are not, in the opinion of some, at present in so flourishing a state as formerly. In addition to the manufacture of camlets, druggets, and crapes, it is also remarkable for baize, ferges, shalloons, stockings, and woollen cloths.\n\nThe inhabitants of Norwich are generally so employed in their manufactures within doors, that the city has the appearance of being deserted, except on Sundays and holidays, when the streets swarm with people.\n\nCaister, near Norwich, was the Venta Icenorum, or capital city of the Iceni, the broken walls of which contain a square of about 30 acres. In those walls may still be perceived the remains of four gates and a tower. Several Roman urns, coins, and other relics of antiquity, have been found in this place.","sp":72,"ep":73},{"h":"NOSE","t":"the organ of smell. See ANATOMY. The uses of the nose are, its giving us the sense of smelling; its serving in the great office of respiration, and in modelling the voice; in receiving the abundant humours from the eyes, and in adding to the beauty of the face.\n\nThe nose was by the augurs particularly attended to in forming conjectures concerning future good or ill success. The tingling of the right or left side of it, for instance, was thought to have different significations as it happened to different sexes, or persons in different conditions.\n\nIn Tartary, the greatest beauties are those who have the least noses. Ruybrock mentions the wife of the great Jenghiz Khan as a celebrated beauty, because she had only two holes for a nose. The Crim Tartars break the noses of their children while young, as thinking it a great piece of folly to have their noses stand before their eyes. In most other countries, China excepted, great noses are an honour.\n\nIn what the beauty of the nose consists, different nations have different opinions: and the following reflections of Sir Joshua Reynolds on this subject, are perhaps the most philosophical account of the beauty of form that is to be found in any language. \"I suppose (says Sir Joshua) it will be easily granted, that no man can judge whether any animal be beautiful in its kind, or deformed, who has seen only one of that species: that is as conclusive in regard to the human figure; so that if a man born blind was to recover his sight, and the most beautiful woman was brought before him, he could not determine whether she was handsome or not; nor, if the most beautiful and most deformed were produced, could he any better determine to which he should give the preference, having seen only those two. To distinguish beauty, then, implies the having seen many individuals of that species. If it is asked, how is more skill acquired by the observation of greater numbers? I answer, that, in consequence of having seen many, the power is acquired, even without seeking after it, of distinguishing between accidental blemishes and excrescences, which are continually varying the surface of Nature's works, and the invariable general form which Nature most frequently produces, and always seems to intend in her productions.\n\n\"Thus amongst the blades of grass or leaves of the same tree, though no two can be found exactly alike, yet the general form is invariable: a naturalist, before he chose one as a sample, would examine many, since, if he took the first that occurred, it might have, by accident...\"\naccident or otherwise, such a form as that it would scarce be known to belong to that species; he selects, as the painter does, the most beautiful, that is, the most general form of nature.\n\n\"Every species of the animal as well as the vegetable creation may be said to have a fixed or determinate form, towards which nature is continually inclining, like various lines terminating in the centre; or it may be compared to pendulums vibrating in different directions over one central point; and as they all cross the centre, though only one passes through any other point, so it will be found that perfect beauty is oftenest produced by nature than deformity: I do not mean than deformity in general, but than any one kind of deformity. To instance in a particular part of a feature: the line that forms the ridge of the nose is beautiful when it is straight; this then is the central form, which is oftener found than either concave, convex, or any other irregular form that shall be proposed. As we are then more accustomed to beauty than deformity, we may conclude that to be the reason why we approve and admire it, as we approve and admire customs and fashions of dress for no other reason than that we are used to them; so that though habit and custom cannot be said to be the cause of beauty, it is certainly the cause of our liking it: and I have no doubt, but that if we were more used to deformity than beauty, deformity would then lose the idea now annexed to it, and take that of beauty; as if the whole world should agree that yes and no should change their meanings, yes would then deny, and no would affirm.\n\n\"Whoever undertakes to proceed further in this argument, and endeavours to fix a general criterion of beauty respecting different species, or to show why one species is more beautiful than another, it will be required from him first to prove that one species is really more beautiful than another. That we prefer one to the other, and with very good reason, will be readily granted; but it does not follow from thence that we think it a more beautiful form; for we have no criterion of form by which to determine our judgement. He who says a swan is more beautiful than a dove, means little more than that he has more pleasure in seeing a swan than a dove, either from the flatnesses of its motions, or its being a more rare bird; and he who gives the preference to the dove, does it from some association of ideas of innocence that he always annexes to the dove; but if he pretends to defend the preference he gives to one or the other, by endeavouring to prove that this more beautiful form proceeds from a particular gradation of magnitude, undulation of a curve, or direction of a line, or whatever other conceit of his imagination he shall fix on as a criterion of form, he will be continually contradicting himself, and find at last that the great mother Nature will not be subjected to such narrow rules. Among the various reasons why we prefer one part of her works to another, the most general, I believe, is habit and custom: custom makes, in a certain sense, white black, and black white; it is custom alone determines our preference of the colour of the Europeans to the Ethiopians; and they, for the same reason, prefer their own colours to ours. I suppose nobody will doubt, if one of their painters was to paint the goddess of beauty, but that he would represent her black, with thick lips, flat nose, and woolly hair; and it seems to me he would act very unnaturally if he did not; for by what criterion will any one dispute the propriety of his idea? We indeed say, that the form and colour of the European is preferable to that of the Ethiopian; but I know of no other reason we have for it, but that we are more accustomed to it. It is absurd to say, that beauty is possessed of attractive powers, which irresistibly seize the corresponding mind with love and admiration, since that argument is equally conclusive in favour of the white and the black philosopher.\n\n\"The black and white nations must, in respect of beauty, be considered as of different kinds, at least a different species of the same kind; from one of which to the other, as I observed, no inference can be drawn.\n\n\"Novelty is said to be one of the causes of beauty: that novelty is a very sufficient reason why we should admire, is not denied; but because it is uncommon, is it therefore beautiful? The beauty that is produced by colour, as when we prefer one bird to another, though of the same form, on account of its colour, has nothing to do with this argument, which reaches only to form. I have here considered the word beauty as being properly applied to form alone. There is a necessity of fixing this confined sense; for there can be no argument, if the sense of the word is extended to every thing that is approved. A rose may as well be said to be beautiful, because it has a fine smell, as a bird because of its colour. When we apply the word beauty, we do not mean always by it a more beautiful form, but something valuable on account of its rarity, usefulness, colour, or any other property. A horse is said to be a beautiful animal; but had a horse as few good qualities as a tortoise, I do not imagine that he would be then esteemed beautiful.\n\n\"A fitness to the end proposed is said to be another cause of beauty; but supposing we were proper judges of what form is the most proper in an animal to constitute strength or swiftness, we always determine concerning its beauty before we exert our understanding to judge of its fitness.\n\n\"From what has been said, it may be inferred, that the works of nature, if we compare one species with another, are all equally beautiful; and that preference is given from custom, or some association of ideas; and that in creatures of the same species, beauty is the medium or centre of all various forms.

Danica, tab. 885, fig. 1.) tremella intestinalis vel meenterica,\nA writer in the Gentleman's Magazine gives this account of it: \"The substance in question is not unfrequent in England, nor in all other parts of Europe, after rains, both in spring and autumn. Very large spots of it are seen in gravelly soils, and particularly on the tops of hills, and on open downs, and often it is found on gravel walks.\n\n\"It is met with in some of the old authors, under the name of nofoch, as in Paracelsus and others; and the alchemists fancied there was something wonderful in it, and that it would afford a menstruum for gold. Nofoch is said to be a word synonymous to Jaculum aliquicis stellae, vel patris ejus repurgatione dejectum quid in terram; flores aeris; fragmentum nimbis; as this substance was believed to fall from the sky with the meteors that we often see, and call falling-stars. Hence the country people in Sweden have called it sky-fall; and in England it is known by the name of witches butter, in common with some of the gelatinous liverworts.\n\n\"Paracelsus, Helmont, and others, ranked it with the terniabin, or manna, and thought it dropped, as that did, from heaven. It is described, and the chemical analysis thereof given, by M. Geoffroy, in the Paris Memoirs for 1703, and is there said to yield, besides an acid phlegm, a portion of concrete volatile salt and some fixed salt. The distilled water from it was believed by some to possess singular virtues, in allaying pains of the joints; but there is certainly no room to attribute any extraordinary qualities to it.\n\n\"Since the days of Paracelsus it has been considered as a vegetable production; but the botanists have had difficulty to assign its place or genus in their several systems. Our own countryman, Dr Merret, seems to have been among the first authors who ranked it among vegetables, and he calls it Lichen humiditate intumeens, ficcitate evanescens (Pin. page. 71.) Others have retained it among the plants of that genus to this day; as does the celebrated Dr Haller, in his Historia Stirp. Helvetiae, who calls it Lichen gelatinosus, plicatus, undulatus; lacinis crinitis, granulosus; No 2041, as there are several of the liverworts that have a gelatinous texture and appearance; though they differ much from the nofoch, in not being so instantly dried up. It was put into Ray's Synopsis, by Dr Dillenius, under the name of Ulva terrefricta pinguis et fugax, p. 64.; but he afterwards changed that name for tremella, in his Historia Muscorum, where he calls it tremella terrefricta pinguis pinguis et fugax, p. 52. tab. 10. f. 14., and reduces the lavers to the same genus. Michel, an Italian botanist, famous for his attention to the Cryptogamia clasps of plants, makes it a fungus, as Magnol and Dr Morison had done before him, and describes and figures it, in his Nova Plantarum Genera, under the name of Linbia terrefricta gelatinosa, membranacea, vulgarisima, p. 126. t. 67. f. 1. He describes the seeds as lying in the form of little strings of beads, coiled up within the plant, or rather in the folds thereof, and only to be discovered by the microscope. Linnaeus mentions it, first under the name of Byflis gelatinosa fugax terrefricta, in his Flora Lapponica, No 520; but he afterwards adopted Dillenius's term, though he does not make it a layer. Linnaeus has called it, in all his subsequent works, tremella (nofoch) plicata, undulata, under which name it stands in his Species Plantarum, p. 1157, and in Hudson's Flora Anglicana, p. 463, as also in a numerous set of other authors who follow his system.\"\n\nAnother writer in the same work gives this account of it. \"This substance is very rarely seen between the middle of April and the month of October. It is most frequently to be found in the high pasture lands, where the ground is inclined to wet, and on the moors and commons in the north of England. The time we always meet with it is after a very wet night, when the air in the morning suddenly clears up, and a sharp frost ensues. The frogs that then happen to be out are immediately seized by the frost, and turned into this jelly-like substance. For as I have had occasion sometimes to go out very early, I have found several parts of the frog not yet dissolved among the jelly, such as feet, legs, and thighs, yet in a little time afterwards the change was fully completed. The quantity of jelly produced from one single frog is almost beyond belief, even to five or six times its bulk when in its natural state.\n\n\"I communicated this discovery to an acquaintance, who has since had frequent opportunities of observing and examining this production; and we are fully assured, that whatever opinion the learned may have of it, it certainly proceeds from the above-mentioned cause wherever found.\n\n\"Most people that I have conversed with on the subject, are of opinion that this jelly falls from the stars, or out of the higher regions of the air; which notion, however absurd, many are credulous enough to believe.\"\n\nNaturalists had for some years begun to doubt whether these gelatinous substances were of a vegetable or animal nature, when at length Mr J. Pratt of Oxford, in a letter printed in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1776, page 402, threw such light on the subject as to us, at least, is perfectly satisfactory.\n\n\"From a child I remember seeing the meteors shooting in the air, which appearance, by my comrades, was called star-shooting, believing the stars no larger than their apparent magnitude. This jelly-like substance mentioned in your magazine, was believed to be the drops of these meteors, and took the name of star-shot, which passed for certain with me till I had arrived at the age of 24, when I was engaged in business that required me frequently passing over both meadows and pasture-grounds, where in spring and autumn I saw many portions of this supposed alga or nofoch, but never more than one or two contiguous, mostly near the water, when the meadows were or had been just before flooded. My conjectures were various, until I saw a crow pecking at something in a field, which I heard to cry; when turning my horse to the place, I found a frog of the common size, which the crow (of the carrion kind) would soon have killed and gorged, had I not disturbed her, and chafed her away.\n\n\"About this time I found in a meadow the bowels of a frog indigested, and compact as the chitterlings of a calf or pig; but white as the paper I write upon, though not translucid. I took it up, and placed it in a paper exposed to the air; leaving it in some grass where I found it, till my return that way in three days' time,\"\nNOS\n\nNostradamus, when I saw it changed to that tremulous jelly-like substance, the alga or star-shot. I was much pleased with this discovery, and took it home in my pocket wrapped in a paper, where I showed it to a society of young persons of which I was a member, who agreed with my sentiments of its being the indigestible part of a frog digested by some bird of prey.\n\n\"To corroborate my sentiments of this alga being the bowels of a frog, I luckily saw some of it lying by the side of a brook, where I lighted and took it up, and to my great surprise found attached to the jelly the head, heart, liver, and one leg of the frog, which had been (I presume) digested by some carrion crow, who frequented the flooded grounds to pick up worms and other vermin. There was also some of it found on an apple tree at Wyton Magna, near Leicester, where I then lived, which, no doubt, was digested by some owl.\"\n\nDr Darwin, in his Poem on the Loves of the Plants, is of the same opinion with Mr Platt, that these gelatinous substances are of an animal nature, and that the different appearances they put on are owing to various circumstances, viz. the different birds who feed on frogs, the quantity they devour at a time, and the state of digestion before they are voided.","sp":74,"ep":76},{"h":"NOSTRADAMUS","t":"MICHEL, an able physician and a celebrated astrologer, was a Proven\u00e7al, and descended of a noble family, and born Dec. 14, 1503, at St Remy, in the diocese of Avignon. By his grandfather he was initiated in the study of the mathematics. He afterwards completed his course of humanity and philosophy at Avignon; and, going thence to Montpellier, he there applied himself to physic, till being forced away by the plague in 1525, he took his route towards Toulouse, and paffed on till he came to Bordeaux. This course held him five years, during which he undertook the cure of all such patients as were willing to put themselves under his care. After this he returned to Montpellier, and was created doctor of his faculty in 1529, and then revisited the same places where he had practised physic before. At Agen he contracted an acquaintance with Julius Caesar Scaliger, which induced him to make some stay in that town, and there he entered into matrimony; but having buried his wife, and two children which she brought him, he quitted Agen after a residence of about four years. He returned into Provence, and fixed himself first at Marfeilles; but his friends having provided an advantageous match for him at Salon, he transported himself thither in 1544. In 1546, Aix being afflicted with the plague, he went thither at the solicitation of the inhabitants, and was of great service; particularly by a powder of his own invention: so that the town in gratitude gave him a considerable pension for several years after the contagion ceased. Returning afterwards to Salon, he became a recluse, and made use of his leisure to apply himself to his studies. He had a long time followed the trade of a conjurer occasionally; and now he began to think himself inspired, and miraculously illuminated with a prospect into futurity. As fast as these illuminations had discovered to him any future event, he entered it in writing, in simple prose, but by enigmatical sentences, as he declared himself; but reviving them afterwards, he thought the sentences would appear more respectable, and would favour more of a prophetic spirit, if they were expressed in verse. Nostradamus. This opinion determined him to throw them all into quatrains, and he afterwards ranged them into centuries. When this was done, he hesitated about making them public, till reflecting that the time of many events which he had foretold was very near at hand, he determined to print them. This he did with a dedication addressed to his son Caesar, an infant only nine months old, in the form of a letter or preface, dated March 1, 1555. This first edition, which is included in seven centuries, was printed by Rigault at Lyons. He prefixed his name in Latin, but gave to his son Caesar the name as it is pronounced, Notrada-me.\n\nThe public were divided in their sentiments of this work: many looked upon the author as a simple visionary or a fool; while he was accused of the black art, or black magic, by others, and treated as an impious person, who held a commerce with the devil: at the same time there were not wanting such, and those in great numbers, who believed him to be really and truly endowed with the supernatural gift of prophecy. Lastly, some were found who remained in suspense, and refrained from giving any judgment at all upon the point. However, Henry II. and Queen Catharine of Medicis his mother, were resolved to see our prophet; and, receiving orders to that effect, he presently repaired to Paris. He was very graciously received at court; and, besides the extraordinary respect that was paid to him, received a present of 200 crowns. He was sent afterwards to Blois, to make a visit to his majesty's children there, and report what he should be able to discover concerning their destinies. No doubt he exerted himself to the utmost on the occasion; but what his sentence was is not known; however, it is certain, he returned to Salon loaded with honour and presents. Animated with his success, he augmented his work from 300 quatrains to the number of a complete millade, and published it with a dedication to the king in 1558. That prince dying the next year of a wound which he received, as is well known, at a tournament, the book of our prophet was immediately consulted; and in the 37th quatrain of the first century this unfortunate event was found predicted in the following verse:\n\nLe lion jeune le vieux surmontera,\nEn champ bellique par singulier duel,\nDans cage d'or les yeux lui crevera,\nDeux classes une puis mourir, mort cruelle.\n\nSo remarkable a prediction added new wings to his fame; and he was honoured shortly after with a visit from Emanuel duke of Savoy and the princess Margaret of France his consort. From this time Nostradamus found himself even overburdened with visitors, and his fame made every day new acquisitions. Charles IX., coming to Salon, was eager above all things to have a sight of him. Nostradamus, who then was in waiting as one of the retinue of the magistrates, being instantly presented to his majesty, complained of the little esteem his countrymen had for him; whereupon the monarch publicly declared, that he should hold the enemies of Nostradamus to be his enemies, and desired to see his children. Nor did that prince's favour stop here; in passing, not long after, through the city of Arles, he sent for Nostradamus, presented him with a purse of 200 crowns,\ncrown, together with a brevet, constituting him his physician in ordinary, with the same appointment as the reft.\n\nBut our prophet enjoyed these honours only for the space of fifteen months, for he died July 2, 1566, at Salon. Besides his \"Centuries,\" we have the following compositions of his: A Treatise de Fardemens et de Senteurs, 1552.\u2014A Book of singular Receipts, pour Entretenir la Sant\u00e9 du Corps, 1556.\u2014A piece des Confitures, 1557.\u2014A French Translation of the Latin of Galen's Paraphrase, exhorting Menodolas to Study, especially to that of Physic, 1552. Some years before his death, he published a small instruction for husbandmen, flowing the best seasons for their several labours, which he entitled, The Almanack of Notradamus. Lastly, After his death there came out The eleventh and twelfth Centuries of his Quatrains, added to the former ten, which had been printed three times in two separate parts.

By whom the invention was brought into Rome is not precisely ascertained; but the most general opinion is, that in matters of importance Tully first made use of notes or shorthand writing, when Cato made an oration in order to oppose Julius Caesar relative to the conspiracy of Catiline. Cicero, who was at that time consul, placed notarii, or expert shorthand writers, in different parts of the senate house, to take down the speech; and this was the first public occasion which we find recorded of employing shorthand writers among the Romans. It is unnecessary to observe, that hence proceeded the name of notary still in use.\n\nThere were three kinds of notes for shorthand writing used by the ancients, either for dispatch or secrecy. The first and most ancient was that of hieroglyphics, which are rather images or representations of things than of words. (See Hieroglyphics.) The Chinese characters are of this kind, and may with greater propriety be called nota than liter\u00e6, as appears from what hath been already advanced.\n\nThe second species of notes were called singulares, from their expressing words by single letters. Servius Ursatus has compiled a very copious collection of such abbreviations, of which work there are several editions.\n\nThe third kind of notes were called nota Tironian\u00e6, from Tiro the freed man of Cicero, who was excellently skilled in this art; and it is to him that we are indebted for the preservation of Cicero's letters, of which a great part still remain, and one entire book of them written to Tiro himself.\n\nFrom books it appears, that notes were very frequent among the Romans, and continued in use to the 10th and 11th centuries. We have indeed but few books remaining that are written in shorthand; but this is not surprising, when such was the unhappy situation of early ages, that either superstition condemned them to the flames as the works of impious magicians or necromancers, or they were left to be devoured by vermin, through ignorance and stupidity, which was so very great, that some people, as Trithemius affirms, looked upon notes in those days as the elements of the Armenian language. It is probable, however, that there are writings of this sort still extant, which might contribute to enrich the republic of letters.\n\nThere are several MSS. and instruments written in these kind of nota, in the royal library at Paris. In the year 1747, the learned and ingenious Monf. Charpentier, engraved and published at Paris a capitulary, and 54 charters of Louis the Pious, emperor and king of France, written in these nota Tironian\u00e6. To this work the learned editor hath prefixed an Alphabetum Tironianum, together with a great number and variety of notes or marks for the different parts of speech, and rules for acquiring the art of writing in these kind of notes. Valerius Probus, in his book De Literis Antiquis, explains many of the characters used by the shorthand writers; and there is a dictionary of them set forth by Janus Gruterus. See Stenography.","sp":77,"ep":77},{"h":"NOTARI","t":"persons employed by the Romans to take, by nota, trials and pleadings in their courts of judicature, or to write as amanuenses from the mouth of an author. These notarii were of servile condition. Under the reign of Justinian, they were formed into a college or corporate body. Notarii were also appointed to attend the prefects, to transcribe for them. There were likewise notarii domici, who were employed in keeping...\nkeeping the accounts of the Roman nobility; and when the empire became Christian, there were notaries for ecclesiastical affairs, who attested the acts of archbishops, bishops, and other spiritual dignitaries. We find ecclesiastical notaries at Rome, under Pope Julius IV. and in the church of Antioch, about the year 370. From these notaries is derived the office of chancellor to the bishops; afterwards almost every advocate was admitted a notary.\n\n**NOTARY (Notarius),** signifies a person, usually some scrivener, who takes notes, or frames short draughts of contracts, obligations, charter parties, or other writings. At present we call him a notary public, who publicly attests deeds or writings, in order to make them authentic in another nation: but he is principally employed in business concerning merchants; as making protests of bills of exchange, &c. And noting a bill, is where he goes to take notice of a merchant's refusal to accept or pay the same.\n\n**NOTATION,** in Arithmetic and Algebra, the method of expressing numbers or quantities by signs or characters appropriated for that purpose.

He is worthy of being mentioned only as he was progenitor to that sovereign whose overthrow conferred upon Alexander the title of Great.\n\n**NOTION,** a word which in common language is considered as of the same import with idea. This, however, is improper. Notion comprehends the meaning of idea, but it denotes much more. We have a notion of spirit, of power, of solidity; but of these things we can have no ideas. Ideas are relics of sensation; but there are objects of knowledge which fall under the cognizance of no sense; of these objects, however, we may have very distinct notions either direct or relative.

It extends in length 48 miles, 25 in breadth, and 110 in compass; containing 560,000 acres, 8 hundreds, 9 market towns, 168 parishes, 450 villages, about 25,611 houses, and 140,350 inhabitants. No county in England enjoys a pleasanter and healthier air. As for the soil, it differs widely in different parts of the county. Towards the west, where lies the forest of Sherwood, it is sandy; and therefore that part of the county is called by the inhabitants the Sand; but the south and east parts, watered by the Trent and the rivulets that fall into it, are clayey; and for that reason are called by the inhabitants the Clay. The latter is fruitful both in corn and pasture; but the former produces little besides wood, coal, and some lead. The county has a variety of commodities and manufactures, as wool, leather, tallow, butter, cheese, coal, marl, cattle, malt, liquorice, stockings, glass, earthen wares, and strong ale. The principal rivers are the Trent and Idle. The Trent, whose name is supposed to be derived from the French or Latin word signifying thirty, either because it receives thirty smaller rivers, or has thirty different sorts of fish in it, is inferior to no river in England, but the Severn, Thames, and Humber. It enters the county on the south-west, and passes through it to the north-east, where it enters Lincolnshire, and after a long course falls at last into the Humber. The Idle rises in Sherwood forest, and after traversing the northern part of the county, falls into the Trent upon the borders of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.\n\nThe spacious forest of Sherwood lies in the west part of the county, and indeed takes up the greatest part of it. It was formerly so thick, that it was hardly passable; but now it is much thinner. It feeds an infinite number of deer and stags; and has some towns in it, of which Mansfield is the chief. It abounds in coal, and a road lies through it for thirty miles together. Since the reign of King Edward I., the nobility and gentry have had grants of it. It was governed by a great number of officers under the late earl of Chesterfield, chief forester; whose ancestor, Sir John Stanhope, had a grant of it, with liberty to destroy and kill at pleasure, reserving only a hundred deer in the whole walk. The duke of Newcastle is now steward and keeper. The principal town is\n\n**NOTTINGHAM,** which gives name to the county. It is a handsome town, and a county of itself by charter. The name is derived from the Saxon word Snottengham, which signifies cavern, from the caves and apartments anciently dug in the rocks on which the town stands. These, being soft, easily yield to the spade and pickaxe;\nwhence the townsmen have excellent cellars for the vast quantities of malt liquors made here, and sent, as well as their malt, to most parts of England. The situation of the town is very pleasant, having meadows on one hand, and hills of a gentle easy ascent, on the other. It is well supplied with fuel, both wood and coal, from the forest; and with fish by the Trent, which runs about a mile to the south of it, and has been made navigable for barges; so that they receive by it not only great quantities of cheese from Warwickshire and Staffordshire; but all their heavy goods from the Humber, and even from Hull. Over the Trent is a stately stone bridge of 19 arches, where the river is very large and deep, having received the addition of the Dove, the Derwent, the Irwell, and the Soar, three of them great rivers of themselves, which fall into it after its passing by Burton in Staffordshire.\n\nThe town is of great antiquity, and it had formerly a strong castle, in which the Danes, in the time of the heptarchy, held out a siege against Buthred king of Mercia, Alfred, and Ethelred his brother, king of the West Saxons.\n\nSoon after the Conquest, William either repaired this fortress, or built a new one on the same spot, in the second year of his reign, probably to secure a retreat on his expedition against Edwin earl of Chester and Morcar earl of Northumberland, who had revolted. He committed the custody of it to William Peverell, his natural son, who has some been considered as the founder. It stands on a steep rock, at the foot of which runs the river Leen.\n\nDeering, in his history of Nottingham, seems very justly to explode the story of the place called Mortimer's Hole, having been made as a hiding place for him; and from his description of it, shows that it was meant as a private passage to the castle, to relieve it with men or provisions in a siege. He says that it is one continued aircafe, without any room, or even a place to sit down on. It was by this passage that Edward III. got into the castle and surprised Mortimer and the queen; and from hence, and his being carried away through it, it has its name.\n\nEdward IV. greatly enlarged the castle, but did not live to complete the buildings he began. Richard III. finished them.\n\nIt was granted by James I. to Francis earl of Rutland, who pulled down many of the buildings; but it was still of so much strength, that Charles I. in 1642, pitched on it as the place for beginning his operations of war. He set up his standard, first on the walls of the castle, but in two or three days removed it to a close on the north side of the castle, without the wall, on a round spot; after which it was for many years called Standard close, and since, from the name of one who rented it, Nevil's close. Where the standard was fixed, there stood a post for a considerable time. It is a common error that it was erected on a place called Derrymount, a little further north than the close just mentioned; this is an artificial hill, raised on purpose for a wind-mill, which formerly was there. The castle was afterwards sequestrated by the parliament, and the trees in the park cut down.\n\nThis castle was so strong that it was never taken by storm. After the civil war, Cromwell ordered it to be demolished. On the Restoration, the duke of Buckingham, whose mother was daughter and heir of this Nottingham earl of Rutland, had it restored to him, and sold it to William Cavendish, marquis and afterwards duke of Newcastle. In 1674, he began the present building, but died in 1676, when the work was not far advanced. However, he had the building of it so much at heart, that he left the revenue of a considerable estate to be applied to that purpose, and it was finished by Henry his son. The expense was about \u00a34,000. It is one of the seats of the present duke of Newcastle.\n\nIn the park, west of the castle, and facing the river Leen, are some remains of an ancient building (if it may be so called) cut and framed in the rock. Dr Stukeley gives it, as he does most things, to the Britons. Many other ancient excavations have been found in other parts of the rocks.\n\nThe frames for knitting stockings were invented by one William Lea of this county, about the beginning of the 17th century; but not meeting with the encouragement he expected (a case too common with the first inventors of the most useful arts) he went with several of his workmen to France, on the invitation of Henry IV. The death of that king, and the troubles which ensued, prevented attention being given to the work. Lea died there, and most of his men returned to England. Other attempts were made to steal the trade, without better success, and it has flourished here ever since, and is now carried on to a very considerable extent. It is noted for its horse-races on a fine course on the north side of the town. The corporation is governed by a mayor, recorder, six aldermen, two coroners, two sheriffs, two chamberlains, and twenty-four common-council men, eighteen of the senior council, and six of the junior; a bell-bearer, and two pinders, one for the fields and the other for the meadows. The town being within the jurisdiction of the forest, the former of these pinders is town-woodward, and attends the forest courts. It has three neat churches, the chief of which is St Mary's; and an almshouse, endowed with \u00a3100 a-year, for twelve poor people; with a noble townhouse, surrounded with piazzas. A considerable trade is carried on in glats and earthen wares, and frame stockings, besides the malt, and malt liquors, mentioned above.\n\nMarshal Tallard, when a prisoner in England, was confined to this town and county. In the duke of Newcastle's park there is a ledge of rocks hewn into a church, houses, chambers, dove-houses, &c. The altar of the church is natural rock; and between that and the castle there is a hermitage of the like workmanship. Upon the side of a hill there is a very extraordinary fort of a house, where you enter at the garret, and ascend to the cellar, which is at the top of the house. Here is a noted hospital founded by John Plumtree Esq. in the reign of Richard II. for thirteen poor old widows. There are four handsome bridges over the Trent and Lind. To keep these in repair, and for other public purposes, the corporation has good estates. This town and Winchelsea both give title of earl to the noble family of Finch. Here David king of Scots, when a prisoner in England, resided; and under ground is a vault, called Mortimer's hole because Roger Mortimer, earl of March is said to have concealed himself in it, when he was taken and hanged by order of Edward III.

He was baptized in bed when dangerously ill; recovering, however, he was afterwards ordained priest of the church of Rome, his bishop having obtained this favour for him, which the clergy and people were far from being disposed to grant. He does not appear to have had the good of the church much at heart; for with his wit, knowledge, and eloquence, he might have been peculiarly serviceable to her, had he not with cowardice shrunk from his duty when he dreaded persecution. His ambition to be made a bishop likewise misled him; and what occasioned the apostasy of most of the first heretics, also occasioned his. On the death of Fabian bishop of Rome, after writing a letter to St Cyprian, he remained quiet whilst the see was vacant; but the promotion of Cornelius to that dignity excited his envy and jealousy to no common pitch. The consequence was a separation from the new bishop, and from those who professed to believe, what Novatian strenuously denied, that the church could receive those again who had been guilty of idolatry. He soon got a number of followers among the laity, and some even among the clergy. Novatus, a priest of Carthage, was one of his party, and having been a party-man himself against St Cyprian, brought his adherents with him. He got himself consecrated bishop of Rome in a most infamous and clandestine manner, by three weak men whom he had most grossly imposed upon, and one of whom did penance for having been concerned in what was so contrary to order, decency, and the rules of the church.\n\nHis designs, however, in this disgraceful affair did not succeed, for he was not acknowledged as bishop of that diocese; Cornelius being confirmed in it, whilst he was condemned and excommunicated. He still however, taught his doctrine, and at length became the head of the party which bears his name. Besides the letter mentioned above, St Jerome says he wrote on the Passover, on the Sabbath, on Circumcision, on the High Priests, on Prayer, on Jewish meals, and on Firmness of mind, &c., with a large treatise on the Trinity.

(See Romance.) That the greater part of those absurd things, which, under this title, are daily issuing from the press, deserve all the contempt with which they can be treated, is a position which we feel not ourselves inclined to controvert; but we cannot admit that any species of writing is in itself infidel, merely because numbers have attempted it without success. The heroic poems of Blackmore are universally\nNovel, verfally known to be contemptible performances; and if we had before us all the heroic poetry that has ever been written, how many thousands of volumes should we have as mean as either Prince Arthur, King Arthur, Elize, or Alfred? Yet no critic has hitherto dared to maintain, that heroic poetry is an infipid species of writing.\n\nBut to the novel objections have been urged of more importance than its infipidity. It has been often affirmed, with learned solemnity, that the perusal of novels tends to corrupt the youth of both sexes; to produce effeminacy in men and extravagant notions of the happiness of love in women; that it diverts the minds of the former from more serious and useful studies, and exposes the latter to the arts of seduction. That there are too many novels to which this objection is applicable in its full force, is a fact which we are afraid cannot be denied: but when it is admitted, let not these performances be again accused of infipidity; for were they infipid, they could have no such consequences. It is by laying fast hold of the heart that they lead it astray. That a novel might be written so as to interest the heart in behalf of virtue, as much as any one has ever warped it to the side of vice, is a truth which no man will ever venture to call in question who has any knowledge of human nature; and therefore we are decidedly of opinion, that there may be novels worthy at once of the perusal of inexperienced youth and hoary wisdom. A critic*, by no means too indulgent to works of fancy, and among whose failings laxity of morals has never been numbered, thus expresses himself on the subject of novel-writing:\n\n\"Their familiar histories may perhaps be made of greater use than the solemnities of professed morality, and convey the knowledge of vice and virtue with more efficacy than axioms and definitions. But if the power of example is so great, as to take possession of the memory by a kind of violence, and produce effects almost without the intervention of the will, care ought to be taken, that, when the choice is unrestrained, the best examples only should be exhibited; and that what is likely to operate so strongly, should not be mischievous or uncertain in its effects.\"\n\nWe have said, that the novel professes above all things to exhibit the nature of love and its consequences. Whether this be essential to such performances may perhaps be reasonably questioned: but it has been made an important part of the drama in most novels, and, we think, with great propriety. It is the object of the novelist to give a true picture of life, diversified only by accidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by passions and qualities which are really to be found in conversing with mankind. To accomplish this object, he conceives a hero or heroine, whom he places in a certain rank of life, endues with certain qualities of body and mind, and conducts, through many vicissitudes of fortune, either to the summit of happiness or to the abyss of misery, according to the passion which he wishes to excite in his readers. In the modern novel, this hero or heroine is never placed on a throne, or buried in a cottage; because to the monarch and the cottager no difficulties occur which can deeply interest the majority of readers. But among the virtuous part of the intermediate orders of society, that affection which we call love seldom fails, at some period of life, to take possession of the hearts of both sexes; and wherever it has place, it must be productive of happiness or of misery. In the proper management of this passion consists much of the difficulty of the novel-writer. He must exhibit his hero as feeling all the pangs and pleasures of love, as sometimes animated with hope, and sometimes ready to sink into despair, but always exerting himself to obtain the gratification of his wishes. In doing this, care should be taken, either that he never transgresses the laws of virtue, or at least that he never transgresses them with impunity.\n\n\"It is justly considered as the greatest excellency of art to imitate nature; but it is necessary to distinguish those parts of nature which are most proper for imitation: greater care is still required in representing life, which is so often discoloured by passion or deformed by wickedness. If the world be promiscuously described, I cannot perceive (says the great critic already quoted) of what use it can be to read the account; or why it may not be as safe to turn the eye immediately upon mankind, as upon a mirror which shows all that presents itself without discrimination. It is therefore not a sufficient vindication of a character, that it is drawn as it appears; for many characters ought never to be drawn: nor of a narrative, that the train of events is agreeable to observation; for that observation which is called knowledge of the world will be found much more frequently to make men cunning than good. The purpose of these writings is surely not only to show mankind, but to provide that they may be seen hereafter with less hazard; to teach the means of avoiding the snares which are laid by Treachery for Innocence, without ensuring any with for that superiority with which the betrayer flatters his vanity; to give the power of counteracting fraud, without the temptation to practice it; to initiate youth by mock encounters in the art of necessary defence; and to increase prudence without impairing virtue.\n\n\"Many writers, for the sake of following nature, mingle good and bad qualities in their principal personages, that they are both equally conspicuous; and as we accompany them through their adventures with delight, and are led by degrees to interest ourselves in their favour, we lose the abhorrence of their faults, because they do not hinder our pleasures, or perhaps regard them with some kindness for being united with so much merit.\u2014There have been men indeed splendidly wicked, whose endowments threw a brightness on their crimes, and whom scarce any villany made perfectly detestable, because they never could be wholly divested of their excellencies: but such have been in all ages the great corrupters of the world; and their resemblance ought no more to be preserved than the art of murdering without pain.\n\n\"In narratives, where historical veracity has no place, there should be exhibited the most perfect idea of virtue; of virtue not angelical, nor above probability (for what we cannot credit we shall never imitate), but the highest and purest that humanity can reach, which, exercised in such trials as the various revolutions of things shall bring upon it, may, by conquering some calamities and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform. Vice (for vice is neces-\nNovel. ceflary to be shown) should always disfigure; nor should the graces of gaiety, or the dignity of courage, be so united with it, as to reconcile it to the mind. Wherever it appears, it should raise hatred by the malignity of its practices, and contempt by the meanness of its stratagems; for while it is supported by either parts or spirit, it will seldom be heartily abhorred.\"\n\nIf these observations be just, and to us they appear unanswerable, Richardson's Lovelace is a character which ought never to have been drawn. In the graces of gaiety and the dignity of courage, in liberality without profusion, in perseverance and address, he everywhere appears as the first of men; and that honour with which he protects the virtue of his Rosebud, if any intrusion is to be drawn from it, can only lead the admirers of Richardson to believe that another Clarissa might be in perfect safety were she to throw herself upon the honour of another Lovelace. Yet in the composition of this splendid character there is not one principle upon which confidence can securely rest; and Lovelace, whilst he is admired by the youth of both sexes, and escapes the contempt of all mankind, must excite in the breast of the cool moralist sentiments of abhorrence and detestation.\n\nA French critic, speaking of this character, says, \"By turns I could embrace and fight with Lovelace. His pride, his gaiety, his drollery, charm and amuse me; his genius confounds me and makes me smile; his wickedness astonishes and enrages me; but at the same time I admire as much as I detest him.\" Surely this is not the character which ought to be presented to the inexperienced and ardent mind.\n\nThe most perfect characters which we at present recollect in any novel are Richardson's Graslinson and Fielding's Allworthy. The virtues of the former are perhaps tinged with moral pedantry, if we may use the expression; and the latter suffered himself to be long imposed upon by the arts of the hypocrite and the philosophical coxcomb; but without some defects they would not be human virtues, and therefore no objects of human imitation. Clarissa is an excellent character: she has as much perfection as can be expected in woman, whilst the exhibits, at the same time, some obvious defects.\n\nAs it is the object of the novelist to interest the heart, and to communicate instruction through the medium of pleasure, his work, like a tragedy or comedy, should be one, exhibiting a hero or heroine, whose success every incident should contribute to forward or to retard. In this respect no work of fancy has ever surpassed the Tom Jones of Fielding. It is constructed upon principles of the soundest criticism, and contains not a single event which does not in some way contribute towards the winding up of the piece. A living author, deeply read in Grecian literature, and far from being prejudiced in behalf of any modern, has been heard to say, that had Aristotle seen Tom Jones, he would have pronounced it a poem perfect in its kind.\n\nAgainst this sentence another critic of name has entered his protest, and strenuously maintained that nothing can be a poem which is not written in verse. We shall judge of the truth of this conclusion by comparing it with the principles from which it is deduced. Having laid down as a maxim incontrovertible, that \"the end of poetry is pleasure, to which use itself must be subservient,\" he very justly infers from this idea, that poetry should neglect no advantage that fairly offers itself, of appearing in such a dress or mode of language as is most taking and agreeable to us. It follows (he says), from the same idea of the end which poetry would accomplish, that not only rhythm, but numbers properly so called, is essential to it, and that it cannot obtain its own purpose unless it be clothed in verse.\"\n\nHe then proceeds to ask, \"What, from this conclusion, are we to think of those novels or romances, as they are called, which have been so current of late through all Europe? As they propose pleasure for their end, and prosecute it, besides, in the way of fiction, though without metrical numbers, and generally indeed in harsh and rugged prose, one easily sees what their pretensions are, and under what idea they are ambitious to be received. Yet as they are wholly destitute of measured sounds (to say nothing of their other numberless defects), they can at most be considered but as hasty, imperfect, and abortive poems; whether spawned from the dramatic or narrative species, it may be hard to say.\n\nUnsmiling things one knows not what to call,\nTheir generation's so equivocal.\n\nHowever, such as they are, those novelties have been generally well received: Some for the real merit of their execution; others, for their amusing subjects; all of them for the gratification they afford, or at least promise, to a vitiated, pallid, and sickly imagination, that lack disease of learned minds, and sure prognostic of expiring letters. But whatever may be the temporary success of these things (for they vanish as fast as they are produced), good sense will acknowledge no work of art but such as is composed according to the law of its kind.\"\n\nOf this severe criticism the author himself has given us, what amounts to a complete confutation. He tells us, that the ancients looked for so much force and spirit of expression in whatever they dignified with the name of poem, as sometimes to make a question \"whether comedy were rightly referred to this class, because it differed only in measure from mere prose?\" Their doubt (he justly adds) might have been spared or at least resolved, if they had considered that comedy adopts as much of this force and spirit of words as is consistent with the nature and dignity of that pleasure which it pretends to give: For the name of poem will belong to every composition whose primary end is to please, provided it be so constructed as to afford all the pleasure which its kind or fort will permit.\"\n\nIf this decision be just, and we readily admit it, a well composed novel is entitled to the appellation of a poem, though it be written in prose and in a style not remarkable for elevation. The business of the novelist is to interest the heart by a display of the incidents of common life. In doing this, he must exhibit scenes that are probable, and record speeches that are natural. He is not at liberty to invent, but only to select, objects, and to cull from the mass of mankind those individuals upon which the attention ought most to be employed. The more closely he adheres to this rule, the more deeply does he interest us in his narrative; because every reader feels at once that it is possible he may at some time or other be in circumstances nearly resembling those of the hero of the tale. But the business of life\nLife is not transacted in pompous language, nor the speeches of real lovers made in verse either rhymed or blank. Were Tom Jones or Clarissa Harlowe to be translated into verse, we shall venture to assert that they would quickly lose their hold of the public mind; because the hero and heroine would then appear in a light which every heart must feel to be unnatural.\n\nIt is well observed by Johnson, that the task of the novel writer \"requires, together with that learning which is to be gained from books, that experience which can never be attained by solitary diligence, but must arise from general converse and accurate observation of the living world. Their performances have, as Horace expresses it, plus oneris variae minus, little indulgence, and therefore more difficulty. They are engaged in portraits of which every one knows the original, and can detect any deviation from exactness of resemblance. Other writings are safe, except from the malice of learning, but these are in danger from every common reader; as the flipper ill executed was censured by a shoemaker who happened to flop in his way at the Venus of Apelles.\" It is in thus faithfully copying nature that the excellence of Fielding consists. No man was ever better acquainted with the shades which diversify characters, and none ever made his personages act and speak more like real men and women in the particular circumstances which he describes.\n\n\"But the fear of not being approved as a just copier of human manners, is not the most important concern that an author of this class ought to have before him. Novels are written chiefly to the young, the ignorant, and the idle, to whom they serve as lectures of conduct and introduction into life. In every such work, it should therefore be carefully inculcated, that virtue is the highest proof of understanding, and the only solid basis of greatness; and that vice is the natural consequence of narrow thoughts; that it begins in mistake and ends in ignominy; and since love must be introduced, it should be represented as leading to wretchedness, whenever it is separated from duty or from prudence.\"\n\nNovel, in the civil law, a term used for the constitutions of several emperors, more particularly those of Justinian.

Of all the circumstances that raise emotions, not excepting beauty, nor even Elements of greatness, says Lord Kames*, novelty hath the most powerful influence. A new object produces instantaneously an emotion termed wonder, which totally occupies the mind, and for a time excludes all other objects. Conversation among the vulgar never is more interesting than when it turns upon strange objects and extraordinary events. Men tear themselves from their native country in search of things rare and new; and novelty converts into a pleasure the fatigues and even perils of travelling. To what cause shall we ascribe these singular appearances? To curiosity undoubtedly; a principle implanted in human nature for a purpose extremely beneficial, that of acquiring knowledge; and the emotion of wonder raised by new and strange objects, inflames our curiosity to know more of such objects. This emotion is different from admiration: novelty, wherever found, whether in a quality or action, is the cause of wonder; admiration is directed to the person who performs anything wonderful.\n\nDuring infancy, every new object is probably the occasion of wonder, in some degree; because, during infancy, every object at first sight is strange as well as new: but as objects are rendered familiar by custom, we cease by degrees to wonder at new appearances, if they have any resemblance to what we are acquainted with; for a thing must be singular as well as new, to raise our wonder. To save multiplying words, we would be understood to comprehend both circumstances when we hereafter talk of novelty.\n\nIn an ordinary train of perceptions, where one thing introduces another, not a single object makes its appearance unexpectedly: the mind thus prepared for the reception of its objects, admits them one after another without perturbation. But when a thing breaks in unexpectedly, and without the preparation of any connection, it raises an emotion, known by the name of surprisal. That emotion may be produced by the most familiar object, as when one unexpectedly meets a friend who was reported to be dead; or a man in high life, lately a beggar. On the other hand, a new object, however strange, will not produce the emotion, if the spectator be prepared for the sight: an elephant in India will not surprisal a traveller who goes to see one; and yet its novelty will raise his wonder: an Indian in Britain would be much surprisal to stumble upon an elephant feeding at large in the open fields; but the creature itself, to which he was accustomed, would not raise his wonder.\n\nSurprisal thus in several respects differs from wonder: unexpectedness is the cause of the former emotion; novelty is the cause of the latter. Nor differ they less in their nature and circumstances, as will be explained by and by. With relation to one circumstance they perfectly agree; which is, the shortness of their duration: the instantaneous production of these emotions in perfection, may contribute to that effect, in conformity to a general law, That things soon decay which soon come to perfection: the violence of the emotions may also contribute; for an ardent emotion, which is not susceptible of increase, cannot have a long course. But their short duration is occasioned chiefly by that of their causes: we are soon reconciled to an object, however unexpected; and novelty soon degenerates into familiarity.\n\nWhether these emotions be pleasant or painful, is not a clear point. It may appear strange, that our own feelings and their capital qualities should afford any matter for a doubt: but when we are engrossed by any emotion, there is no place for speculation; and when sufficiently calm for speculation, it is not easy to recall the emotion with accuracy. New objects are sometimes terrible, sometimes delightful: the terror which a tiger inspires is greatest at first, and wears off gradually by familiarity: on the other hand, even women will acknowledge that it is novelty which pleases the most in a new fashion. It would be rash, however, to conclude, that wonder is in itself neither pleasant nor painful, but that it assumes either quality according to circumstances. An object, it is true, that hath a threatening appearance, adds to our terror by its novelty; but from that experiment it doth not follow, that novelty is in itself disagreeable;\ndifagreeable; for it is perfectly consistent, that we be delighted with an object in one view, and terrified with it in another. A river in flood swelling over its banks, is a grand and delightful object; and yet it may produce no small degree of fear when we attempt to cross it: courage and magnanimity are agreeable; and yet, when we view these qualities in an enemy, they serve to increase our terror. In the same manner, novelty may produce two effects clearly distinguishable from each other: it may, directly and in itself, be agreeable; and it may have an opposite effect indirectly, which is, to inspire terror; for when a new object appears in any degree dangerous, our ignorance of its powers and faculties affords ample scope for the imagination to dress it in the most frightful colours. The first sight of a lion, for example, may at the same instant produce two opposite feelings, the pleasant emotion of wonder, and the painful passion of terror: the novelty of the object produces the former directly, and contributes to the latter indirectly. Thus, when the subject is analyzed, we find that the power which novelty hath indirectly to inflame terror, is perfectly consistent with its being in every circumstance agreeable. The matter may be put in the clearest light, by adding the following circumstance. If a lion be first seen from a place of safety, the spectacle is altogether agreeable without the least mixture of terror. If, again, the first sight puts us within reach of that dangerous animal, our terror may be so great as quite to exclude any sense of novelty. But this fact proves not that wonder is painful: it proves only, that wonder may be excluded by a more powerful passion. Every man may be made certain from his own experience, that wonder raised by a new object that is inoffensive, is always pleasant; and with respect to offensive objects, it appears, from the foregoing deduction, that the same must hold as long as the spectator can attend to the novelty.\n\nWhether surprise be in itself pleasant or painful, is a question not less intricate than the former. It is certain that surprise inflames our joy when unexpectedly we meet with an old friend; and not less our terror when we stumble upon anything noxious. To clear that question, the first thing to be remarked is, that in some instances an unexpected object overpowers the mind, so as to produce a momentary stupification: where the object is dangerous, or appears so, the sudden alarm it gives, without preparation, is apt totally to unhinge the mind, and for a moment to suspend all its faculties, even thought itself; in which state a man is quite helpless: and if he move at all, is as like to run upon the danger as from it. Surprise carried to such a height, cannot be either pleasant or painful; because the mind, during such momentary stupification, is in a good measure, if not totally, inensible.\n\nIf we then inquire for the character of this emotion, it must be where the unexpected object or event produceth least violent effects. And while the mind remains sensible of pleasure and pain, is it not natural to suppose, that surprise, like wonder, should have an invariable character? It would appear, however, that surprise has no invariable character, but affirms that of the object which raises it. Wonder being an emotion invariably raised by novelty; and being distinguishable from all other emotions, ought naturally to possess one constant character. The unexpected appearance of an object, seems not equally entitled to produce an emotion distinguishable from the emotion, pleasant or painful, that is produced by the object in its ordinary appearance: the effect it ought naturally to have, is only to swell that emotion, by making it more pleasant or more painful than it commonly is. And that conjecture is confirmed by experience, as well as by language which is built upon experience: when a man meets a friend unexpectedly, he is said to be agreeably surprised; and when he meets an enemy unexpectedly, he is said to be disagreeably surprised. It appears, then, that the sole effect of surprise is to swell the emotion raised by the object. And that effect can be clearly explained: a tide of connected perceptions glide gently into the mind, and produce no perturbation; but an object breaking in unexpectedly, founds an alarm, rouses the mind out of its calm state, and directs its whole attention to the object, which, if agreeable, becomes doubly so. Several circumstances concur to produce that effect: on the one hand, the agitation of the mind and its keen attention prepare it in the most effectual manner for receiving a deep impression: on the other hand, the object, by its sudden and unforeseen appearance, makes an impression, not gradually as expected objects do, but as at one stroke with its whole force. The circumstances are precisely similar where the object is in itself disagreeable (A).\n\nThe pleasure of novelty is easily distinguished from that of variety: to produce the latter, a plurality of objects is necessary; the former arises from a circumstance found in a single object. Again, where objects, whether co-existent or in succession, are sufficiently diversified, the pleasure of variety is complete, though every single object of the train be familiar; but the pleasure of novelty, directly opposite to familiarity, requires no diversification.\n\nThere are different degrees of novelty, and its effects are\n\n---\n\n(A) What Marshal Saxe terms le c\u0153ur humain, is no other than fear occasioned by surprise. It is owing to that cause that an ambush is generally so destructive: intelligence of it beforehand renders it perfectly harmless. The Marshal gives from Caesar's Commentaries two examples of what he calls le c\u0153ur humain. At the siege of Amiens by the Gauls, Caesar came up with his army, which did not exceed 7000 men; and began to entrench himself in such hurry, that the barbarians judging him to be afraid, attacked his entrenchments with great spirit. During the time they were filling up the ditch, he issued out with his cohorts, and by attacking them unexpectedly struck a panic that made them fly with precipitation, not a single man offered to make a stand. At the siege of Alesia, the Gauls infinitely superior in number, attacked the Roman lines of circumvallation, in order to raise the siege. Caesar ordered a body of his men to march out silently, and to attack them on the one flank, while he with another body did the same on the other flank. The surprise of being attacked when they expected a defence only, put the Gauls into disorder, and gave an easy victory to Caesar.\nNovelty.\n\nThe lowest degree is found in objects surveyed a second time after a long interval; and that in this case an object takes on some appearance of novelty, is certain from experience: a large building of many parts variously adorned, or an extensive field embellished with trees, lakes, temples, statues, and other ornaments, will appear new oftener than once: the memory of an object so complex is soon lost, of its parts at least, or of their arrangement. But experience teaches, that, even without any decay of remembrance, absence alone will give an air of novelty to a once familiar object; which is not surprising, because familiarity wears off gradually by absence: thus a person with whom we have been intimate, returning after a long interval, appears like a new acquaintance. And distance of place contributes to this appearance, not less than distance of time: a friend, for example, after a short absence in a remote country, has the same air of novelty as if he had returned after a longer interval from a place nearer home: the mind forms a connexion between him and the remote country, and befalls upon him the singularity of the objects he has seen. For the same reason, when two things equally new and singular are presented, the spectator balances between them; but when told that one of them is the product of a distant quarter of the world, he no longer hesitates, but clings to it as the more singular: hence the preference given to foreign luxuries, and to foreign curiosities, which appear rare in proportion to their original distance.\n\nThe next degree of novelty, mounting upward, is found in objects of which we have some information at second hand; for description, though it contribute to familiarity, cannot altogether remove the appearance of novelty when the object itself is presented: the first sight of a lion occasions some wonder, after a thorough acquaintance with the correctness pictures and flatness of that animal.\n\nA new object that bears some distant resemblance to a known species, is an instance of a third degree of novelty: a strong resemblance among individuals of the same species, prevents almost entirely the effect of novelty, unless distance of place or some other circumstance concur; but where the resemblance is faint, some degree of wonder is felt, and the emotion rises in proportion to the faintness of the resemblance.\n\nThe highest degree of wonder arises from unknown objects that have no analogy to any species we are acquainted with. Shakespeare in a simile introduces that species of novelty:\n\nAs glorious to the sight\nAs is a winged messenger from heaven\nUnto the white up-turned wond'ring eye\n\nOf mortals, that fall back to gaze on him,\nWhen he belrides the lazy pacing clouds,\nAnd fails upon the bosom of the air.\n\nRomeo and Juliet.\n\nOne example of that species of novelty deserves peculiar attention; and that is, when an object altogether new is seen by one person only, and but once. These circumstances heighten remarkably the emotion: the singularity of the spectator concurs with the singularity of the object, to inflame wonder to its highest pitch.\n\nIn explaining the effects of novelty, the place a being occupies in the scale of existence, is a circumstance that must not be omitted. Novelty in the individuals of a low class is perceived with indifference, or with a very slight emotion: thus a pebble, however singular in its appearance, scarcely moves our wonder. The emotion rises with the rank of the object; and, other circumstances being equal, is strongest in the highest order of existence; a strange insect affects us more than a strange vegetable; and a strange quadruped more than a strange insect.\n\nHowever natural novelty may be, it is a matter of experience, that those who relish it the most are careful to conceal its influence. Love of novelty, it is true, prevails in children, in idlers, and in men of shallow understanding: and yet, after all, why should one be ashamed of indulging a natural propensity? A distillation will afford a satisfactory answer. No man is ashamed of curiosity when it is indulged to acquire knowledge. But to prefer anything merely because it is new, shows a mean taste which one ought to be ashamed of: vanity is commonly at the bottom, which leads those who are deficient in taste to prefer things odd, rare, or singular, in order to distinguish themselves from others. And in fact, that appetite, as above mentioned, reigns chiefly among persons of a mean taste, who are ignorant of refined and elegant pleasures.\n\nOf this taste we have some memorable instances in men of the highest and the best education. Lucian tells the following story of Ptolemy I, which is as disgraceful to him, as honourable to his subjects. This prince had ramfacked the world for two curiosities; one was a camel from Bactria all over black; the other a man, half black half white. These he presented to the people in a public theatre, thinking they would give them as much satisfaction as they did him; but the black monster, instead of delighting them, affrighted them; and the party-coloured man raised the contempt of some and the abhorrence of others. Ptolemy, finding the Egyptians preferred symmetry and beauty to\n\nA third may be added not less memorable. In the year 846, an obstinate battle was fought between Xamire king of Leon and Abdoulrahman the Moorish king of Spain. After a very long conflict the night only prevented the Arabians from obtaining a complete victory. The king of Leon, taking advantage of the darkness, retreated to a neighbouring hill, leaving the Arabians masters of the field of battle. Next morning, perceiving that he could not maintain his place for want of provisions, nor be able to draw off his men in the face of a victorious army, he ranged his men in order of battle, and, without losing a moment, marched to attack the enemy, resolving to conquer or die. The Arabians, astonished to be attacked by those who were conquered the night before, lost all heart: fear succeeded to astonishment, the panic was universal, and they all turned their backs without almost drawing a sword.\nNovelty to the most astonishing productions of art or nature without them, wisely removed his two enormous titles out of sight; the neglected camel died in a little time, and the man he gave for a song to the musician Thespis.\n\nOne final cause of wonder, hinted above, is, that this emotion is intended to stimulate our curiosity. Another, somewhat different, is, to prepare the mind for receiving deep impressions of new objects. An acquaintance with the various things that may affect us, and with their properties, is essential to our well-being: nor will a slight or superficial acquaintance be sufficient; they ought to be so deeply engraved on the mind, as to be ready for use upon every occasion. Now, in order to a deep impression, it is wisely contrived, that things should be introduced to our acquaintance with a certain pomp and solemnity productive of a vivid emotion. When the impression is once fairly made, the emotion of novelty being no longer necessary, vanishes almost instantaneously; never to return, unless where the impression happens to be obliterated by length of time or other means; in which case the second introduction hath nearly the same solemnity with the first.\n\nDesigning wisdom is nowhere more eligible than in this part of the human frame. If new objects did not affect us in a very peculiar manner, their impressions would be so slight as scarce to be of any use in life: on the other hand, did objects continue to affect us as deeply as at first, the mind would be totally engrossed with them, and have no room left either for action or reflection.\n\nThe final cause of surprize is still more evident than of novelty. Self-love makes us vigilantly attentive to self-preservation; but self-love, which operates by means of reason and reflection, and impels not the mind to any particular object or from it, is a principle too cool for a sudden emergency; an object breaking in unexpectedly, affords no time for deliberation; and in that case, the agitation of surprize comes in seasonably to rouse self-love into action: surprize gives the alarm; and if there be any appearance of danger, our whole force is instantly summoned to shun or to prevent it.","sp":83,"ep":86},{"h":"NOVEMVIRI","t":"nine magistrates of Athens, whose government lasted but for one year.

It was formerly called Great Novgorod, to distinguish it from other Russian towns of a similar appellation; and now presents to the attentive and intelligent traveller a striking instance of fallen grandeur. According to Nestor, the earliest of the Russian historians, it was built at the same time with Kiev, namely, in the middle of the 5th century, by a Slavonian horde, who, according to Procopius, issued from the banks of the Volga. Its antiquity is clearly proved.\nNovgorod proved by a passage in the Gothic historian Jornandes, in which it is called Civitas Nova, or new town. We have little insight into its history before the ninth century, when Ruric the first great duke of Rusia reduced it, and made it the metropolis of his vast dominion. The year subsequent to his death, which happened in 879, the seat of government was removed, under his son Igor, then an infant, to Kiof; and Novgorod continued, for above a century, under the jurisdiction of governors nominated by the great dukes, until 979, when Svatolaf, the son of Igor, created his third son Vladimir duke of Novgorod: the latter, succeeding his father in the throne of Rusia, ceded the town to his son Yaroslav, who in 1036 granted to the inhabitants very considerable privileges, that laid the foundation of that extraordinary degree of liberty which they afterwards gradually obtained. From this period Novgorod was for a long time governed by its own dukes: these sovereigns were at first subordinate to the great dukes, who resided at Kiof and Volodimir; but afterwards, as the town increased in population and wealth, they gradually usurped an absolute independency. Its independency, however, was not perpetual. It continued, indeed, in a flourishing state until the middle of the 15th century: but the great dukes of Rusia, whose ancestors had reigned over this town, and who still retained the title of dukes of Novgorod, having transferred their residence from Kiof to Volodimir, and afterwards to Moscow, laid claim to its feudal sovereignty; a demand which the inhabitants sometimes put off by composition, sometimes by resistance, but were sometimes compelled to acknowledge. At length, however, the great duke became absolute sovereign of Novgorod, though the ostensible forms of government were still preserved. It even then, however, continued to be the largest and most commercial city of Rusia; a proof of which we have as late as the year 1554, from the following description of Richard Chancellor, who passed through it in 1554 in his way to Moscow. \"Next unto Moscow, the city of Novgorod is reputed the chiefest of Rusia; for although it be in majesty inferior to it, yet in greatness it goeth beyond it. It is the chiefest and greatest mart town of all Muscovy; and albeit the emperor's seat is not there, but at Moscow, yet the commodiousness of the river, falling into that gulf which is called Sinus Finicus, whereby it is well frequented by merchants, makes it more famous than Moscow itself.\" An idea of its population during this period, when compared with its present declined state, is manifest from the fact, that in 1568 above 15,000 persons died of an epidemical disorder; more than double the number of its present inhabitants. In its most flourishing condition it contained at least 400,000 souls. Its ruin was brought on by Ivan Vasilievitch II. and completed by the foundation of Peterburgh. The present town is surrounded by a rampart of earth, with a range of old towers at regular distances, forming a circumference of scarcely a mile and a half; and even this inconsiderable circle includes much open space, and many houses which are not inhabited. As Novgorod was built after the manner of the ancient towns in this country, in the Asiatic style, this rampart, like that of the Slavonogorod at Moscow, probably enclosed several interior circles. Without it was a vast extensive suburb, which reached to the distance of six miles, and included within its circuit all the convents and churches, the ancient ducal palace and other structures, that now make a splendid but solitary appearance, as they lie scattered in the adjacent plain.\n\nNovgorod stretches on both sides of the Volkof, a beautiful river of considerable depth and rapidity, and somewhat broader than the Thames at Windsor.

Long. 3\u00b0. N. Lat. 49\u00b0 38' about 66 miles north-east of Paris. It is an ancient place, being the Noviodunum Belgarum of the Latins. It is a pretty large city, and is well situated for inland trade, which consists here in wheat and oats, which they send to Paris.\nParis. They have also manufactories of linen cloths, lawns, and tanned leather. There are eight parishes in it, two abbeys, and several monasteries of both sexes. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the metropolitan of Rheims; he has the title of count and peer of France, and his income is said to amount to about 15,000 livres per annum. The principal buildings are the episcopal palace, a cloister where the canons of the cathedral dwell, and the town-house. The latter is regularly built in a large square, in the middle of which there is a fountain, where the water conveyed to it from a neighbouring mountain runs continually through three conduits, and is received in a large basin built of very hard stone. They have also many other fountains, several market places, and two public gardens. Noyon is particularly remarkable for the birth of the famous John Calvin, who was born here on the 10th of July 1502, and died at Geneva the 27th of May 1564.","sp":87,"ep":88},{"h":"NUAYHAS","t":"the Ague tree; a name given by the Indians to a sort of bamboo cane, the leaves of which falling into the water, are said to regenerate it with such virtue, that the bathing in it afterwards cures the ague.

It is said that this plant bears its flowers only once in its life; that it lives 60 years before those make their appearance; but that when they begin to show themselves, it withers away in about a month afterwards; that is, as soon as it has ripened the seed. There seems to be something of fiction in the account of many other particulars relating to this tree in the Hortus Malabaricus; but it seems certain, that the length of the stalks, or trunk, must be very great; for, in the gallery of Leyden, there is preserved a cane of it 28 feet long; and another not much shorter in the Ashmolean museum at Oxford, and which is more than eight inches in diameter: yet both these appear to be only parts of the whole trunk, they being nearly as large at one end as at the other.","sp":88,"ep":88},{"h":"NUBA","t":"a race of black Pagans, in the neighbourhood of Sennaar, of whom we know nothing but what we have learned from Mr Bruce. That celebrated traveller passed a day or two among them, in his way from Abyssinia; and he tells us, that they are all soldiers of the Mek or king of Sennaar, cantoned in villages, which to the distance of four or five miles surround the capital. They are not the aborigines of that part of Africa; but \"are either purchased or taken by force from Fanuelo, and the provinces to the south upon the mountains Dyre and Tegla.\" Though the slaves of a cruel and treacherous master, Mr Bruce represents them as a gentle, honest, and hospitable people; and he says expressly, that on a journey he had seldom passed a more comfortable night, than one in which he took refuge from a storm in a village of those Nuba. He had a good supper, and a clean neat hut to sleep in, while some of the Nuba watched for him all night, and took care of his beasts and his baggage. \"Having settlements and provisions given them by the government of Sennaar, as also arms put into their hands, they never wish to desert, but live a very domestic and sober life, and are a much gentler sort of negro than their masters.\" (See Sennaar.) Though the established religion of Sennaar is that of Mahomet, the government has never attempted to convert the Nuba. On the contrary, a certain number of Pagan priests is maintained for them in every village, who have soldiers in pay to assist them in the affairs of their religion. This is a very singular instance of toleration among Mahometans, and what we should little have expected from such barbarous and languid wretches as those who have the supreme power in Sennaar, had not our observing traveller informed us, that these men themselves knew almost nothing of the religion which they profess, and are in their hearts rather Pagans than Mahometans.\n\nThe idolatry of the Nuba is described as a mixture of Sabism and statue worship: but what is very uncommon, their worship is chiefly paid to the moon, while they pay no attention to the sun either rising or setting, advancing to the meridian or receding from it. It is an old observation, that the worship of every people is tinged by their natural dispositions; and this is verified in the Nuba. \"That their worship is performed with pleasure and satisfaction, is obvious (says our author) every night that the moon shines. Coming out from the darkness of their huts, they say a few words upon seeing her brightness, and testify great joy, by motions of their feet and hands, at the first appearance of the new moon.\" This is just what we should have expected from their gentleness and hospitality. They worship likewise a tree and a stone; but our author could never discover what tree or stone; only he learned that neither of them exists in Sennaar, but in the country where the Nuba are born. Such of them as are natives of the villages where he saw them, become, like their masters, nominal Mahometans.\u2014The rest practice the idolatrous worship of their ancestors, and are much under the influence of their priests, from fear rather than from affection. They are immoderately fond of swine's flesh, and maintain great herds of small hogs, marked with black and white spots. Few of the Nuba advance higher than to be soldiers and officers in their own corps; and the Mek maintains about 12,000 of them near Sennaar to keep the Arabs in subjection. In a climate so violent as that which they inhabit, there is very little need of fuel; and it is happy for them that such is the case, for in the whole country there is not a single tree, or turf, or any thing resembling it. They do not, however, \"eat their meat raw like the Abyssinians; but with the stalk of the dora or millet, and the dung of camels, they make ovens under ground, in which they roast their hogs whole, in a very cleanly manner, keeping their skins on till they are perfectly baked. They have neither flint nor steel with which to light their fire at first; but do it in a manner still more expeditious, by means of two sticks, brought, we are led to think, from Sennaar, and there picked out of the river when flooded. They make a small hole in one of these sticks, and point the other: then laying the former in a horizontal position, they apply the point of the latter to the hole; and, turning the perpendicular stick between their hands, as we do a chocolate mill, both sticks take fire and flame in a moment; so perfectly dry and prepared to take fire is everything there on the surface of the earth.\"","sp":88,"ep":88},{"h":"NUBECULA","t":"NUBECULA, LITTLE CLOUD, in Medicine, a term sometimes used for a disease in the eye, wherein objects appear as through a cloud or mist.\n\nThe nubecula seems to arise from certain gross particles detained in the pores of the cornea, or swimming in the aqueous humour, and thus intercepting the rays of light.","sp":88,"ep":89},{"h":"NUBECULA","t":"or Nubea, is also used for what is otherwise called albigo.

The river Nile runs through it; on the banks of which, and those of the other rivers, it is pretty fruitful, but in other places barren, sandy, and in want of water. To the west of the Nile is the desert of Bahouda, which is five days journey over, being the usual road from Egypt to Abyssinia. Money is of no use in this country in the way of trade, it being all carried on by way of exchange. Their bread and drink is made of a small round seed, called doca or jeff, which is very ill tasted. Their houses have mud walls, being very low, and covered with reeds. The habit of the better sort is a vest without sleeves; and they have no coverings for their heads, legs, and feet. The common people wrap a piece of linen cloth about them, and the children go quite naked. They are a stupid debauched sort of people, having neither modesty, civility, nor religion, though they profess to be Mahometans.\u2014The productions of this country are gold, elephants teeth, civet, and sandal wood; and they send a great many slaves into Egypt. The principal towns known to the Europeans are Dangola and Sennar.\n\nIt is famous for a race of horses the most powerful and docile in the world. These animals are generally about fifteen hands high; and by Mr Bruce, who has given the most scientific account of them, they are said to be the breed which was introduced into Nubia at the Saracen conquest, and has been preserved unmixed to this day. Our author represents this as a much nobler animal than the Arabian horse. \"What figure (says he) the Nubian horse would make in point of fleetness is very doubtful, his make being so entirely different from that of the Arabian; but if beautiful symmetry of parts, great size and strength, the most agile, nervous, and elastic movements, great endurance of fatigue, docility of temper, and seeming attachment to men beyond that of any other domestic animal, can promise anything for a stallion, the Nubian is above all comparison the most eligible in the world.\" He thinks, and justly thinks, that an attempt should at least be made to import them into this kingdom. \"The expense (he says) would not be great, though there might be some trouble and application necessary: but if adroitly managed, there would not be much even of that. The Nubiens are very jealous in keeping up the pedigree of their horses, which are black or white, but a vast proportion of the former to the latter.\" Our author never saw the colour which we call gray, i.e., dappled; but he has seen some bright bays, and some inclined to roan. All noble horses in Nubia are said to be descended of one of the five upon which Mahomet and his four immediate successors, Abu Bekr, Omar, Atmen, and Ali, fled from Mecca to Medina the night of the Hegira. No one will pay much regard to this legendary tale, or believe that the strength and beauty of this breed of horses is owing to any virtue communicated to the first of them by the prophet and his apostles. Mr Bruce accounts for their excellence upon rational principles. \"The best horses of the Arabian breed are found (he says) in the tribe of Mowelli and Annecy, which is about 36\u00b0 north latitude. Dangola, which is in 20\u00b0 latitude, seemed to him to be the centre of excellence for this noble animal.\" Hence he infers, that the bounds in which the horse is in greatest perfection, are between the 20th and 36th degrees of latitude, and between 30 degrees of longitude east from Greenwich and the banks of the Euphrates. If to the effects of climate we add the manner of feeding the Nubian horses, we shall perhaps have the true cause of their superiority over all others. \"They are kept fat upon dora, and suffered to eat nothing green but the short roots of grass that are to be found by the side of the Nile, after the sun has withered it. This is dug out where it is covered with earth, and appears blanched, and laid in small heaps once a day on the ground before them.\"","sp":89,"ep":89},{"h":"NUBIAN DESERT","t":"a vast tract of barren rocks and burning sands, extending from Syene in Upper Egypt to Geon the capital of Berber in Nubia. As Syene is in latitude 24\u00b0 0' 45\" north, and Geon in latitude 17\u00b0 57' 22\", the length of this desert from north to south is 6\u00b0 3' 23\", or upwards of 420 English miles. Its breadth from east to west has not, as far as we know, been precisely ascertained. Through this horrid region, where nothing is to be seen which has the breath of life, mult all travellers pass from Sennar to Egypt; in danger every moment of perishing by thirst, being overwhelmed by moving columns of land, suffocated by a hot and poisonous wind, or cut in pieces by troops of wandering Arabs. The last European of whom we have heard that made the journey and lived to give an account of it, is Mr Bruce; and the person must have neither taste nor sensibility who can read unmoved his manly narrative.\n\nNo single traveller, nor even a caravan, can enter with safety into this desert, but under the protection of a Hybear; whose title and office are thus explained by Mr Bruce: \"A Hybear is a guide, from the Arabic word Hubbar, which signifies to inform, instruct, or direct, because they are used to do this office to the caravans travelling through the desert in all directions. They are men of great consideration, knowing perfectly the situation and properties of all kinds of water to be met with on the route, the distance of wells, whether occupied by enemies or not; and if so, the way to avoid them with the least inconvenience. It is also necessary that they should know the places occupied by the Siroom, and the seasons of its blowing (see Siroom), as well as those occupied by moving sands.\"\u2014Under the conduct of one of these men, Mr Bruce, with infinite fortitude and address, passed through the desert in the year 1772, surmounting dangers at which one shudders in his closet. Of these, the following, which we shall give in the nervous language of the author, may serve as an instance.\n\n\"We were here (at a place called Wezhi al Helleb)\nNUC\n\nat once surprized and terrified by a sight surely one of the most magnificent in the world. In that vast expanse of desert, from W. and to NW. of us, we saw a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances, at times moving with great celerity, at others stalking on with a majestic slowness. At intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us; and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight; their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the tops often separated from the bodies; and these once disjointed, dispersed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken in the middle as if struck with a large cannon shot. About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven, of them ranged alongside of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would measure 10 feet. They retired from us with a wind at SE. leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name; though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a considerable degree of wonder and astonishment.\n\nIf it be true, as the author of A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful affirms, that \"the passion raised by the sublime is astonishment, and that astonishment is that state of the soul in which all its motions are suspended with some degree of horror,\" surely a more sublime spectacle was never presented to mortal eyes, than that which was on this occasion presented to Mr Bruce. It must have been awfully majestic; but few, we believe, would choose the pleasure of contemplating such a scene of magnificence at the hazard of that dreadful death with which at every moment it threatened our traveller and his attendants. He, indeed, had firmness of mind to stand still and admire it; but his companions shrieked out; while some of them exclaimed that it was the day of judgement, and others that it was hell or the world set on fire. But for a more particular account of this phenomenon, as well as of the nature of the desert and the proper way of passing it, we must refer to the work from which this short sketch is taken.","sp":89,"ep":90},{"h":"NUCLEUS","t":"in general, denotes the kernel of a nut, or even any seed enclosed within a husk.

Its effects are indeed so beneficial, that this belief is little surprising among a people so totally ignorant of natural causes as the modern Egyptians, for it is acknowledged, by the most enlightened travellers, to stop the plague, and announce a speedy and plentiful inundation of the country. These effects are thus rationally accounted for by Mr Bruce.\n\n\"In February and March, the sun is on its approach to the zenith of one extremity of Egypt, and of course has a very considerable influence upon the other. The Nile having now fallen low, the water in certain old cisterns, which, though they still exist, are suffered to accumulate all the filth of the river, becomes putrid, and the river itself has lost all its finer and volatile parts by the continued action of a vertical fun; so that instead of being subject to evaporation, it grows daily more and more inclined to putrefaction. About St John's day it receives a plentiful mixture of the fresh and fallen rain from Ethiopia, which dilutes and refreshes the almost corrupted river; and the fun near at hand exerts its influence upon the water, which is now become light enough to be exhaled, though it has still with it a mixture of the corrupted fluid. It is in February, March, or April only, that the plague begins in Egypt.\" Our philosophical traveller does not believe it an endemic disease; but affirms very sufficient reasons for thinking that it comes from Constantinople with merchandise or with passengers at the very time of the year when the air, by the long absence of dews, has attained a degree of putridity proper to receive it. In this state of the atmosphere, the infection continues to rage till the period of St John's day, when it is suddenly checked by the dews occasioned by a refreshing mixture of rain water, which is poured into the Nile at the beginning of the inundation. The first and most remarkable sign of the change effected in the air, is the sudden stopping of the plague. Every person, though shut up from society for months before, buys, sells, and communicates with his neighbour without any sort of apprehension; and as far as our author could learn upon fair inquiry, it was never known that one fell sick of the plague after the anniversary of St John. He admits that some have died of it after that period; but of them the disease had got such hold, under the most putrid influence of the air, that they could not recover. To corroborate this theory, which attributes so much to the benign influence of the falling dew, he observes, that immediately after St John's day, the clothes of the many thousands who have died during the late continuance of the plague are publicly exposed in the market place; and that all these, though consisting of furs, cotton, silk, and woollen cloths, which are the stuffs most retentive of infection, imbibing the moist air of the evening and the morning, are handled, bought, put on and worn, without any apprehension of danger, and without a single accident being known to have happened to any one professed of this happy confidence.","sp":90,"ep":90},{"h":"NUDITIES","t":"in painting and sculpture, those parts of an human figure which are not covered with any drapery; or those parts where the carnation appears.","sp":90,"ep":90},{"h":"NULLITY","t":"in Law, signifies any thing that is null or void; thus there is a nullity of marriage, where persons marry within the degrees, or where infants marry without consent of their parents or guardians.","sp":90,"ep":90},{"h":"NUMA POMPILIUS","t":"the fourth son of Pompilius Pompo, an illustrious Sabine. He had married Tatia, the daughter of King Tatius, and together with her remained in his native country, preferring the tranquillity of a private life to the splendour of a court. Upon the death of his wife, with whom he had lived thirteen years, he gave himself up entirely to the study of wisdom; and, leaving the city of Cures, confined himself to the country, wandering from solitude to solitude, in search only of those woods and fountains which religion had made sacred. His recluse life gave rise to the fable, which was very early received among the Sabines, that Numa lived in familiarity with the nymph Egeria. Upon the death of Romulus, both the senate...\nNuma senate and people strongly solicited him to be their king. They despatched Julius Proculus and Valerius Volefus, two senators of distinction, to acquaint Numa with their resolution, and make him an offer of the kingdom. The Sabine philosopher rejected at first their proposal; but being at last prevailed upon by the arguments and entreaties of the deputies, joined with those of his father and of Martius his near relation, he yielded; and having offered sacrifices to the gods, set out for Rome, where he was received by all ranks of people with loud shouts of joy. Spurius Vettius, the interrex for the day, having assembled the curiae, he was elected in due form, and the election was unanimously confirmed by the senate.\n\nThe beginning of his reign was popular; and he dismissed the 300 bodyguards which his predecessor had kept around his person, and observed, that he did not distrust a people who had compelled him to reign over them. He was not, like Romulus, fond of war and military expeditions, but he applied himself to tame the ferocity of his subjects, to inculcate in their minds a reverence for the Deity, and to quell their dissensions by dividing all the citizens into different classes. He established different orders of priests, and taught the Romans not to worship the Deity by images; and from his example no graven or painted statues appeared in the temples or sanctuaries of Rome for the space of 160 years. He encouraged the report that was spread of his paying regular visits to the nymph Egeria, and made use of her name to give sanction to the laws and institutions which he had introduced. He established the college of the vestals, and told the Romans that the safety of the empire depended upon the preservation of the sacred ancyle or shield, which, as was generally believed, had dropped from heaven. He dedicated a temple to Janus, which, during his whole reign, remained shut as a mark of peace and tranquillity at Rome. After a reign of 42 years, in which he had given every possible encouragement to the useful arts, and in which he had cultivated peace, Numa died in the year of Rome 82. Not only the Romans, but also the neighbouring nations, were eager to pay their last offices to a monarch whom they revered for his abilities, moderation, and humanity. He forbade his body to be burnt according to the custom of the Romans; but he ordered it to be buried near Mount Janiculum, with many of the books which he had written. These books were accidentally found by one of the Romans, about 400 years after his death; and as they contained nothing new or interesting, but merely the reasons why he had made innovations in the form of worship and in the religion of the Romans, they were burnt by order of the senate. He left behind him one daughter called Pomponia, who married Numa Marcius, and became the mother of Ancus Marcius the fourth king of Rome. Some say that he had also four sons; but this opinion is ill founded. The principal laws of King Numa, mentioned by different authors, are, 1. That the gods should be worshipped with corn and a salted cake. 2. That whoever knowingly killed a free man, should be held as a parricide. 3. That no harlot should touch the altar of Juno; and if she did, that she should sacrifice a ewe-lamb to that goddes, with dishvelled hair. 4. That whoever removed a land-mark should be put to death. 5.

The baseness and injustice of the Romans during this war were truly disgraceful to them, and altogether unworthy of a great and powerful people. The inhabitants obtained some advantages over the Roman forces, till Scipio Africanus was empowered to finish the war and to see the destruction of Numantia. He began the siege, with an army of 60,000 men, and was bravely opposed by the beleaguered, who were no more than 4000 men able to bear arms. Both armies behaved with uncommon valour, and the courage of the Numantines was soon changed into despair and fury. Their provisions began to fail, and they fed upon the flesh of their horses, and afterwards on that of their dead companions, and at last they were obliged to draw lots to kill and devour one another. The melancholy situation of their affairs obliged them to surrender to the Roman general. Scipio demanded them to deliver themselves up on the morrow; they refused, and when a longer time had been granted to their petitions, they retired and set fire to their houses and destroyed themselves, so that not even one remained to adorn the triumph of the conqueror. Some historians, however, deny that; and assert, that a number of Numantines delivered themselves into Scipio's hands, and that 50 of them were drawn in triumph at Rome, and the rest sold as slaves. The fall of Numantia was more glorious than that of Carthage or Corinth, though the place was much inferior to them. It was taken by the Romans, A.U.C. 629; and the conqueror obtained the surname of Numanicus.","sp":91,"ep":91},{"h":"NUMBER","t":"an assemblage of several units, or things of the same kind. See Arithmetic, and Metaphysics, No 205\u2014208.\n\nNumber, says Malcolm, is either abstract or applicate: Abstract, when referred to things in general, without attending to their particular properties; and applicate, when considered as the number of a particular sort of things, as yards, trees, or the like.\n\nWhen particular things are mentioned, there is always something more considered than barely their numbers; so that what is true of numbers in the abstract, or when nothing but the number of things is considered, will not be true when the question is limited to particular things: for instance, the number two is less than three; yet two yards is a greater quantity than three inches: and the reason is, because regard must be had to their different natures as well as number, whenever things of a different species are considered; for though we can compare the number of such things abstractedly, yet we cannot compare them in any applicate sense. And this difference is necessary to be considered, because upon it the true sense, and the possibility or impossibility, of some questions depend.\n\nNumber is unlimited in respect of increase; because we can never conceive a number so great but still there is a greater. However, in respect of decrease, it is limited; unity being the first and least number, below which therefore it cannot descend.\nKinds and distinctions of Numbers. Mathematicians, considering number under a great many relations, have established the following distinctions.\n\nBroken numbers are the same with fractions.\n\nCardinal numbers are those which express the quantity of units, as 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., whereas ordinal numbers are those which express order, as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, &c.\n\nCompound number, one divisible by some other number besides unity; as 12, which is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6. Numbers, as 12 and 15, which have some common measure besides unity, are said to be compound numbers among themselves.\n\nCubic number is the product of a square number by its root; such is 27, as being the product of the square number 9 by its root 3. All cubic numbers, whose root is less than 6, being divided by 6, the remainder is the root itself; thus 27 \u00f7 6 leaves the remainder 3, its root; 215, the cube of 6, being divided by 6, leaves no remainder; 343, the cube of 7, leaves a remainder 1, which added to 6, is the cube root; and 512, the cube of 8, divided by 6, leaves a remainder 2, which added to 6, is the cube root.\n\nHence the remainders of the divisions of the cubes above 216, divided by 6, being added to 6, always give the root of the cube so divided till that remainder be 5, and consequently 11, the cube root of the number divided. But the cubic numbers above this being divided by 6, there remains nothing, the cube root being 12. Thus the remainders of the higher cubes are to be added to 12 and not to 6, till you come to 18, when the remainder of the division must be added to 18; and so on ad infinitum.\n\nDeterminate number is that referred to some given unit, as a ternary or three: whereas an indeterminate one is that referred to unity in general, and is called quantity.\n\nHomogeneous numbers are those referred to the same unit; as those referred to different units are termed heterogeneous.\n\nWhole numbers are otherwise called integers.\n\nRational number is one commensurable with unity; as a number, incommensurable with unity, is termed irrational, or a surd.\n\nIn the same manner, a rational whole number is that whereof unity is an aliquot part; a rational broken number, that equal to some aliquot part of unity; and a rational mixed number, that consisting of a whole number and a broken one.\n\nEven number, that which may be divided into two equal parts without any fraction, as 6, 12, &c. The sum, difference, and product, of any number of even numbers, is always an even number.\n\nAn evenly even number, is that which may be measured, or divided, without any remainder, by another even number, as 4 by 2.\n\nAn unevenly even number, when a number may be equally divided by an uneven number, as 20 by 5.\n\nUneven number, that which exceeds an even number, at least by unity, or which cannot be divided into two equal parts, as 3, 5, &c.\n\nThe sum or difference of two uneven numbers makes an even number; but the factum of two uneven ones makes an uneven number.\n\nIf an even number be added to an uneven one; or if the one be subtracted from the other, in the former case the sum, in the latter the difference, is an uneven number; but the factum of an even and uneven number is even.\n\nThe sum of any even number of uneven numbers is an even number; and the sum of any uneven number of uneven numbers is an uneven number.\n\nPrimitive or prime numbers are those divisible only by unity, as 5, 7, &c. And prime numbers among themselves, are those which have no common measure besides unity, as 12 and 19.\n\nPerfect number, that whose aliquot parts added together make the whole number, as 6, 28; the aliquot parts of 6 being 3, 2, and 1, = 6; and those of 28, being 14, 7, 4, 2, 1, = 28.\n\nImperfect numbers, those whose aliquot parts added together make either more or less than the whole. And these are distinguished into abundant and defective: an instance in the former case is 12, whose aliquot parts 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, make 16; and in the latter case 16, whose aliquot parts 8, 4, 2, and 1, make but 15.\n\nPlane number, that arising from the multiplication of two numbers, as 6, which is the product of 3 by 2; and these numbers are called the sides of the plane.\n\nSquare number is the product of any number multiplied by itself; thus 4, which is the factum of 2 by 2, is a square number.\n\nEven square number added to its root makes an even number.\n\nFigurate numbers, are such as represent some geometrical figure, in relation to which they are always considered; as triangular, pentagonal, pyramidal, &c. numbers.\n\nFigurate numbers are distinguished into orders, according to their place in the scale of their generation, being all produced one from another, viz. by adding continually the terms of any one, the successeive sums are the terms of the next order, beginning from the first order which is that of equal units 1, 1, 1, 1, &c.; then the 2d order consists of the successeive sums of those of the 1st order, forming the arithmetical progression 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.; those of the third order are the successeive sums of those of the 2d, and are the triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, &c.; those of the 4th order are the successeive sums of those of the 3d, and are the pyramidal numbers 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, &c.; and so on as below:\n\n| Order | Names          | Numbers |\n|-------|----------------|---------|\n| 1     | Equals         | 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, &c. |\n| 2     | Arithmeticals  | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. |\n| 3     | Triangulars    | 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, &c. |\n| 4     | Pyramidal     | 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, &c. |\n| 5     | 2d Pyramidal  | 1, 5, 15, 35, 70, &c. |\n| 6     | 3d Pyramidal  | 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, &c. |\n| 7     | 4th Pyramidal | 1, 7, 28, 84, 210, &c. |\n\nThe above are all considered as different sorts of triangular numbers, being formed from an arithmetical progression whose common difference is 1. But if that common difference be 2, the successeive sums will be the series of square numbers; if it be 3, the series will be pentagonal numbers, or pentagons; if it be 4, the series will be hexagonal numbers, or hexagons; and so on. Thus:\n\nArithmeticals.\nAnd the reason of the names triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, &c. is, that those numbers may be placed in the form of these regular figures or polygons.\n\nBut the figurate numbers of any order may also be found without computing those of the preceding orders; which is done by taking the successive products of as many of the terms of the arithmeticals, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. in their natural order, as there are units in the number which denominates the order of figurates required, and dividing those products always by the first product: thus, the triangular numbers are found by dividing the products \\(1 \\times 2\\), \\(2 \\times 3\\), \\(3 \\times 4\\), \\(4 \\times 5\\), &c. each by the first product \\(1 \\times 2\\); the first pyramids by dividing the products \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3\\), \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 4\\), \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 5\\), &c. by the first \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3\\). And, in general, the figurate numbers of any order \\(n\\) are found by substituting successively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. instead of \\(x\\) in this general expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x(x+1)}{2} + \\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{6}\n\\]\n\nwhere the factors in the numerator and denominator are supposed to be multiplied together, and to be continued till the number in each be less by 1 than that which expresses the order of the figurates required. See MacLaurin's Fluxions, art. 351, in the notes; also Simpson's Algebra, p. 213; or Malcolm's Arithmetic, p. 396, where the subject of figurates is treated in a very extensive and perspicuous manner. Hutton's Mathematical Dictionary.\n\nPolygonal or polygonous numbers, the sums of arithmetical progressions beginning with unity: where the common difference is 1, are called triangular numbers; where 2, square numbers; where 3, pentagonal numbers; where 4, hexagonal numbers; where 5, heptagonal numbers, &c.\n\nPyramidal numbers, the sums of polygonous numbers, collected after the same manner as the polygons themselves, and not gathered out of arithmetical progressions, are called first pyramidal numbers; the sums of the first pyramidal are called second pyramidal, &c.\n\nIf they arise out of triangular numbers, they are called triangular pyramidal numbers; if out of pentagons, first pentagonal pyramidal.\n\nFrom the manner of summing up polygonal numbers, it is easy to conceive how the prime pyramidal numbers are found, viz.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a-2)n^3 + 3n^2 - (a-5)n}{6}\n\\]\n\nexpresses all the prime pyramidal.\n\nThe number nine has a very curious property, its products always composing either 9 or some lesser product of it. We have already given an account of this, with the examples from Hume, under the article Nine; and we need not repeat them. Did our limits permit us, we could instance in a variety of other properties numbers both curious and surprising. Such speculations are indeed by some men considered as trifling and useless; but perhaps they judge too hastily; for few employments are more innocent, none more ingenious, nor, to those who have a taste for them, more amusing.\n\nNumbers were by the Jews, as well as the ancient Greeks and Romans, expressed by letters of the alphabet: hence we may conceive how imperfect and limited their arithmetic was, because the letters could not be arranged in a series, or in different lines, conveniently enough for the purposes of ready calculation. The invention of the cipher, or arithmetical figures, which we now make use of, has given us a very great advantage over the ancients in this respect.\n\nMankind, we may reasonably suppose, first reckoned by their fingers, which they might indeed do in a variety of ways. From this digital arithmetic, very probably, is owing the number 10, which constitutes the whole set of arithmetical figures.\n\nThe letters chiefly employed by the Romans to express numbers were, M, for 1000; D, for 500; C, for 100; L, for 50; V, for five; X, for 10; and I, for one.\u2014M, probably signified 1000, because it is the initial of mille; D stands for 500, because it is the diminution of mille; C signifies 100, as being the first letter of the word centum; L stands for 50, because it is the half of C, having formerly been wrote thus L; V signifies 5, because V is the fifth vowel; X stands for 10, because it contains twice X or V in a double form; I stands for one, because it is the first letter of initium. These however are fanciful derivations. See NUMERAL LETTERS.\n\nThe Jewish cabalists, the Grecian conjurors, and the Roman augurs, had a great veneration for particular numbers, and the result of particular combinations of them. Thus three, four, six, seven, nine, ten, are full of divine mysteries, and of great efficacy.\n\nGolden NUMBER. See CHRONOLOGY, No. 27.","sp":91,"ep":93},{"h":"NUMBERS","t":"in Poetry, Oratory, &c., are certain measures, proportions, or cadences, which render a verse, period, or song, agreeable to the ear.\n\nPoetical numbers consist in a certain harmony in the order, quantities, &c. of the feet and syllables, which make the piece musical to the ear, and fit for singing, for which all the verses of the ancients were intended. See POETRY.\u2014It is of these numbers Virgil speaks in his ninth Eclogue, when he makes Lycidas say, Numeros memini, si verba tenerem; meaning, that although he had forgot the words of the verses, yet he remembered the feet and measure of which they were composed.\n\nRhetorical or profane numbers are a sort of simple unaffected harmony, less glaring than that of verse, but such as is perceived and affects the mind with pleasure.\n\nThe numbers are that by which the style is said to be easy, free, round, flowing, &c. Numbers are things absolutely necessary in all writing, and even in all speech. Hence Aristotle, Tully, Quintilian, &c. lay down abundance of rules as to the best manner of intermixing dactyls, spondees, anaepeta, &c. in order to have the numbers perfect. The substance of what they have said, is reducible to what follows: 1. The style becomes numerous by the alternate disposition and temperature of long and short syllables, so as that the multitude of short ones neither render it too halting, nor that of long ones too...\nNumbers too slow and languid; sometimes, indeed, long and short syllables are thrown together designedly without any such mixture, to paint the flowness or celerity of anything by that of the numbers; as in these verses of Virgil:\n\n\"Illi inter se se magna vi brachia tollunt;\nand\nRadit iter liquidum, celere neque commovet alas.\"\n\n2. The style becomes numerous, by the intermixing words of one, two, or more syllables; whereas the too frequent repetition of monosyllables renders the style pitiful and grating. 3. It contributes greatly to the numerousness of a period, to have it cloathed by magnificent and well-founded words. 4. The numbers depend not only on the nobleness of the words in the close, but of those in the whole tenor of the period. 5. To have the period flow easily and equally, the harsh concurrence of letters and words is to be studiously avoided, particularly the frequent meeting of rough consonants; the beginning the first syllable of a word with the last of the preceding; the frequent repetition of the same letter or syllable; and the frequent use of the like ending words. Lastly, The utmost care is to be taken, lest, in aiming at oratorical numbers, you should fall into poetical ones; and instead of prose, write verse.\n\nBook of NUMBERS, the fourth book of the Pentateuch, taking its denomination from its numbering the families of Israel.\n\nA great part of this book is historical, relating to several remarkable passages in the Israelites' march through the wilderness. It contains a distinct relation of their several movements from one place to another, or their flags through the wilderness, and many other things, whereby we are instructed and confirmed in some of the weightiest truths that have immediate reference to God and his providence in the world.\u2014But the greatest part of this book is spent in enumerating those laws and ordinances, whether civil or ceremonial, which were given by God, but not mentioned before in the preceding books.","sp":93,"ep":94},{"h":"NUMERAL LETTERS","t":"those letters of the alphabet which are generally used for figures; as I, one; V, five; X, ten; L, fifty; C, a hundred; D, five hundred; M, a thousand, &c.\n\nIt is not agreed how the Roman numerals originally received their value. It has been supposed, as we have observed in the end of the article NUMBER, that the Romans used M to denote 1000, because it is the first letter of mille, which is Latin for 1000; and C to denote 100, because it is the first letter of centum, which is Latin for 100. It has also been supposed, that D, being formed by dividing the old M in the middle, was therefore appointed to stand for 500, that is, half as much as the M stood for when it was whole; and that L being half a C, was, for the same reason, used to denote 50. But what reason is there to suppose, that 1000 and 100 were the numbers which letters were first used to express? And what reason can be assigned why D, the first letter in the Latin word decem, ten, should not rather have been chosen to stand for that number, than for 500, because it had a rude resemblance to half an M?\u2014But if these questions could be satisfactorily answered, there are other numeral letters which have never yet been accounted for at all. These considera-\n\ntions render it probable that the Romans, did not, in their original intention, use letters to express numbers at all; the most natural account of the matter seems to be this:\n\nThe Romans probably put down a single stroke, I, for one, as is still the practice of those who score on slate or with chalk: this stroke, I, they doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, to express 2, 3, and 4: thus, II. III. IIII. So far they could easily number the strokes with a glance of the eye. But they presently found, that if more were added, it would soon be necessary to tell the strokes one by one: for this reason, then, when they came to 5, they expressed it by joining two strokes together in an acute angle thus, V; which will appear the more probable, if it be considered that the progression of the Roman numbers is from 5 to 5, i.e., from the fingers on one hand to the fingers on the other.\u2014Ovid has touched upon the original of this in his Fastorum, lib. iii. and Vitruvius has made the same remark.\n\nAfter they had made this acute angle V. for five, they added the single stroke to it to the number of 4, thus, VI. VII. VIII. VIII. and then as the strokes could not be further multiplied without confusion, they doubled their acute angle by prolonging the two lines beyond their intersection thus, X., to denote two fives, or ten. After this they doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, this double acute angle thus, XX. XXX. XXXX. they then, for the same reason which induced them first to make a single and then to double it, joined two single strokes in another form, and instead of an acute angle, made a right angle L, to denote fifty. When this 50 was doubled, they then doubled the right angle thus R, to denote 100, and having numbered this double right angle four times, thus LLL, LLLL, LLLLL, when they came to the fifth number, as before, they reverted it, and put a single stroke before it thus IX, to denote 900; and when this 900 was doubled, they also doubled their double right angle, setting two double right angles opposite to each other, with a single stroke between them, thus XIX to denote 1000: when this note for 1000 had been four times repeated, then they put down XXX for 3000, XXXX for 4000, XXXIX for 5000, and LXXXIX for 100,000, XXXL for 500,000, and LXXXIX for 1 million.\n\nThat the Romans did not originally write M for 1000, and C for 100, but square characters, as they are written above, we are expressly informed by Paulus Manutius; but the corners of the angles being cut off by the transcribers for dispatch, these figures were gradually brought into what are now numeral letters.\u2014When the corners of LXX were made round, it stood thus CXX, which is so near the Gothic m, that it soon deviated into that letter; so IX having the corner made round, it stood thus IX, and then easily deviated into D. It also became a plain C by the same means; the single rectangle which denoted 50, was, without alteration, a capital L; the double acute angle was an X; the single acute angle a V consonant; and a plain single stroke, the letter I; and thus these seven letters, M, D, C, L, X, V, I, became numerals.\n\nNUMERAL Characters of the Arabs, are those figures which are now used in all the operations of arithmetic in every nation of Europe. We have elsewhere shown that the Arabs derived the use of them most probably from\nNUMERAL from India, (See Arithmetic, No. 5.) This opinion, however, though very generally received, has been controverted with some ingenuity. A writer in the Gentleman's Magazine, at a period when that miscellany was in its highest reputation, thus endeavours to prove that the Arabs derived their notations from the Greeks. \"I maintain (says he) that the Indians received their numeral characters from the Arabians, and the Arabians from the Greeks, as from them they derived all their learning, which in some things they improved, but for the most part have altered. The numerical figures which they received from the Greeks are proofs of this alteration; which is so great, that without particular attention one can scarce discover in them the vestiges of their origin. But when we compare them carefully and without prejudice, we find in them manifest traces of the Greek figures. The Greek numerical figures were no other than the letters of their alphabet. A small stroke was the mark of unity. The B, being abridged of its two extremities, produced the 2. If you incline the \u03b3 a little on its left side, and cut off its foot, and make the left horn round towards the left side, you will produce a 3; the \u0394 makes the 4, by raising the right leg perpendicularly, and lengthening it a little below the base, and lengthening the base on the left side. The \u03a3 forms the 5; by turning the lowest semicircle towards the right, which before was turned towards the left side. The number 6 forms the 6 by having its head taken off, and its body rounded. \u0396, by taking away the base, makes the 7. If we make the top and bottom of H round, we shall form an 8. The \u0398 is the 9 with very little alteration. The cypher \u03c9 was only a point, to which one of the figures was added to make it stand for ten times as much. It was necessary to mark this point very strongly; and in order to form it better, a circle was made, which was filled up in the middle; but that circumstance was afterwards neglected. Theophanes, an historian of Constantinople, who lived in the ninth century, says expressly, that the Arabians retained the Greek figures, having no characters in their language to represent all the numbers. The Greeks observed in their numbers the decuple progression, which the Arabians have retained. Certain characters are found in the Greek alphabet, which are not used in reading, but only in calculation, and for this reason they are styled Epiphanes, that is to say, notes, marks, in order to distinguish them from letters. The number 6 derives its form from one of these epiphanes, which was called \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. This epiphane forms the letter F among the \u00c6olians and among the Latins. This was called the Digamma, so styled from its figure, which seems to have been one \u0393 placed upon another.\n\nThat this reasoning is plausible will hardly be questioned; but whether it be conclusive our readers must determine. It has not convinced ourselves; but through the whole of this work we wish to state candidly the different opinions held on every subject of curiosity and usefulness.","sp":94,"ep":95},{"h":"NUMERATION","t":"or Notation, in Arithmetic, the art of expressing in characters any number proposed in words, or of expressing in words any number proposed in characters.

Dr Shaw has rendered it probable, that the river which formerly went under the denominations of Malwa, Malgana, Mulucha, and Molochah, is the same with that now called Mulloolah by the Algerines; in which case, the kingdom of Numidia must have extended upwards of 500 miles in length; its breadth, however, cannot be so well ascertained; but supposing it to have been the same with that of the present kingdom of Algiers, in the narrowest part it must have been at least 40 miles broad, and in the widest upwards of 100.\n\nThis country included two districts; one inhabited by the Maffyli, and the other by the Massiflyli; the latter being also called in after times, Mauritania Caesariensis, and the former Numidia Propria. The country of the Maffyli, or, as some call it, Terra Metagoria, was separated from the proper territory of Carthage by its eastern boundary the river Tufca, and from the kingdom of the Massiflyli, or Mauritania Caesariensis, by the river Ampfla. It seems to correspond with that part of the province of Constantine lying between the Zaine and the Med al Kheer, which is above 130 miles long, and more than 100 broad. The sea coast of this province is for the most part mountainous and rocky, answering to the appellation given to it by Abulfeda, viz. El Edwaa, the high or lofty. It is far from being equal in extent to the ancient country of the Maffyli, which, Strabo informs us, was yet inferior to the country of the Maffyli. Its capital was Cirta, a place of very considerable note among the ancients.\n\nThe most celebrated antiquarians agree, that the tract, Peopled by extending from the isthmus of Suez to the lake Triton, the defendants, was chiefly peopled by the descendants of Mizraim, and that the posterity of his brother Put, or Phut, spread themselves all over the country between that lake and the Atlantic ocean. To this notion Herodotus gives great countenance: for he tells us, that the Libyan Nomades, whose territories to the west were bounded by the Triton, agreed in their customs and manners with the Egyptians; but that the Africans, from that river to the Atlantic ocean, differed in almost all points from them. Ptolemy mentions a city called Putea near Adrametum; and Pliny, a river of Mauritania Tingitana, known by the name of Fu, or Phut; and the district adjacent to this river was called Regio Phutenis, which plainly alludes to the name of Phut. That word signifies scattered, or dispersed, which very well agrees with what Mela and Strabo relate of the ancient Numidians; so that we may, without any scruple, admit the aborigines of this country to have been the descendants of Phut.\n\nThe history of Numidia, during many of the early ages, is buried in oblivion. It is probable, however, that as the Phoenicians were masters of a great part of known...\nNamibia, the country, these transactions had been recorded, and generally known to the Carthaginians. King Juba probably reigned here as well as in Africa Propria, if not in Mauritania, and other parts of Libya, when Dido began to build Byrsa. It appears from Justin, that about the age of Herodotus, the people of this country were called both Africans or Libyans and Numidians. Justin likewise intimates, that about this time the Carthaginians vanquished both the Moors or Mauritians and the Numidians; in consequence of which they were excused from paying the tribute which had hitherto been demanded of them.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first Punic war, the African troops carried on a bloody contest against their masters the Carthaginians; and the most active in this rebellion, according to Diodorus Siculus, were a part of the Numidian nation named Mactanians. This so incensed the Carthaginians, that after Hannibal had either killed or taken prisoners all the mercenaries, he sent a large detachment to ravage the country of those Numidians. The commandant of that detachment executed his orders with the utmost cruelty, plundering the district in a terrible manner, and crucifying all the prisoners without distinction that fell into his hands. This filled the rest with such indignation and resentment, that both they and their posterity ever afterwards bore an implacable hatred to the Carthaginians.\n\nIn the time of the second Punic war, Syphax king of the Massylii entered into an alliance with the Romans, and gave the Carthaginians a considerable defeat. This induced Gala, king of the Massylii, to conclude a treaty with the Carthaginians, in consequence of which his son Massinissa marched at the head of a powerful army to give Syphax battle. The contest ended in favour of Massinissa; 30,000 of the Massylii were put to the sword, and Syphax driven into Mauritania; and the like bad success attended Syphax in another engagement, where his troops were entirely defeated and dispersed.\n\nGala dying whilst his son Massinissa was acting at the head of the Numidian troops sent to the assistance of the Carthaginians in Spain, his brother Defalces, according to the established rules of succession in Numidia, took possession of the Massylian throne. That prince dying soon after his accession, Caputa his eldest son succeeded him. But he did not long enjoy his high dignity; for one Mezetulus, a person of the royal blood, but an enemy to the family of Gala, found means to excite a great part of his subjects to revolt. A battle soon took place between him and Caputa; in which the latter was slain with many of the nobility, and his army entirely defeated. But though Mezetulus thus became possessed of the sovereignty, he did not think proper to assume the title of king, but styled himself guardian to Lacumaces, the surviving son of Defalces, whom he graced with the royal title. To support himself in his usurpation, he married the dowager of Defalces, who was Hannibal's niece, and consequently of the most powerful family in Carthage. In order to attain the same end, he sent ambassadors to Syphax, to conclude a treaty of alliance with him. In the mean time Massinissa, receiving advice of his uncle's death, of his cousin's slaughter, and of Mezetulus's usurpation, immediately passed over to Africa, and went to the court of Bocchar king of Mauritania to solicit succours. Bocchar, sensible of the great injustice done Massinissa, gave him a body of 4000 Moors to escort him to his dominions. His subjects, having been apprised of his approach, joined him upon the frontiers with a party of 500 men. The Moors, in pursuance of their orders, returned home, as soon as Massinissa reached the confines of his kingdom. Notwithstanding which, and the small body that declared for him having accidentally met Lacumaces at Thapsus with an escort going to implore Syphax's affluence, he drove him into the town, which he carried by assault after a faint resistance. However, Lacumaces, with many of his men, found means to escape to Syphax. The fame of this exploit gained Massinissa great credit, insomuch that the Numidians flocked to him from all parts, and amongst the rest, many of his father Gala's veterans, who pressed him to make a speedy and vigorous push for his hereditary dominions. Lacumaces having joined Mezetulus with a reinforcement of Massylians, which he had prevailed upon Syphax to send to the assistance of his ally, the usurper advanced at the head of a numerous army to offer Massinissa battle; which that prince, though much inferior in numbers, did not decline. Hereupon an engagement ensued; which notwithstanding the inequality of numbers, ended in the defeat of Lacumaces. The immediate consequence of this victory of Massinissa was a quiet and peaceable possession of his kingdom; Mezetulus and Lacumaces, with a few that attended them, flying into the territories of Carthage. However, being apprehensive that he should be obliged to sustain a war against Syphax, he offered to treat Lacumaces with as many marks of distinction as his father Gala had Defalces, provided that prince would put himself under his protection. He also promised Mezetulus pardon, and restitution of all the effects forfeited by his treasonable conduct, if he would make his submission to him. Both of them readily complied with the proposal, and immediately returned home; so that the tranquillity and repose of Numidia would have been settled upon a solid and lasting foundation, had not this been prevented by Adrribal, who was then at Syphax's court. He intimated to that prince, who was disposed to live amicably with his neighbours, \"That he was greatly mistaken, if he imagined Massinissa would be satisfied with his hereditary dominions. That he was a prince of much greater capacity and ambition, than either his father Gala, his uncle Defalces, or any of his family. That he had discovered in Spain marks of a most rare and uncommon merit. And that, in fine, unless his rising flame was extinguished before it came to too great a head, both the Massylian and Carthaginian states would be infallibly consumed by it.\" Syphax, alarmed by these suggestions, advanced with a numerous body of forces into a district which had long been in dispute between him and Gala, but was then in possession of Massinissa. This brought on a general action between these two princes; wherein the latter was totally defeated, his army dispersed, and he himself obliged to fly to the top of Mount Balbus, attended only by a few of his horse. Such a decisive battle at the present juncture, before Massinissa was fixed in his throne, could not but put Syphax into possession of the kingdom of the Massylii. Massinissa in the mean time made nocturnal incursions from his post upon Mount Balbus, and plundered all the adjacent country, particularly that part of the Carthaginian territory contiguous to Numidia. This district he not only thoroughly pillaged, but likewise laid waste with fire and sword, carrying off from thence\nNumidia, an immense booty, which was bought by some merchants, who had put into one of the Carthaginian ports for that purpose. In fine, he did the Carthaginians more damage, not only by committing such dreadful devastations, but by massacring and carrying into captivity vast numbers of their subjects on this occasion, than they could have sustained in a pitched battle, or one campaign of a regular war. Syphax, at the preluding and reiterated instances of the Carthaginians, sent Bocchar, one of his most active commanders, with a detachment of 4000 foot, and 2000 horse, to reduce this pestilent gang of robbers, promising him a great reward if he could bring Massinissa either alive or dead. Bocchar, watching an opportunity, surprised the Massylians, as they were straggling about the country without any order or discipline; so that he took many prisoners, dispersed the rest, and pursued Massinissa himself, with a few of his men, to the top of the mountain where he had before taken post. Considering the expedition as ended, he not only felled many head of cattle, and the other booty that had fallen into his hands, to Syphax, but likewise all the force, except 500 foot and 200 horse. With this detachment he drove Massinissa from the summit of the hill, and pursued him through several narrow passes and defiles, as far as the plains of Clupea. Here he surrounded him, that all the Massylians, except four, were put to the sword, and Massinissa himself, after having received a dangerous wound, escaped with the utmost difficulty. As this was effected by crossing a rapid river, in which attempt two of his four attendants perished in the fight of the detachment that pursued him, it was rumoured all over Africa, that Massinissa also was drowned; which gave inexplicable pleasure to Syphax and the Carthaginians. For some time he lived undiscovered in a cave, where he was supported by the robberies of the two horsemen that had made their escape with him. But having cured his wound by the application of some medicinal herbs, he boldly began to advance towards his own frontiers, giving out publicly that he intended once more to take possession of his kingdom. In his march he was joined by about 40 horse, and, soon after his arrival amongst the Massylii, so many people flocked to him from all parts, that out of them he formed an army of 6000 foot and 4000 horse. With these forces, he not only reinstated himself in the possession of his dominions, but likewise laid waste the borders of the Massylii. This so irritated Syphax, that he immediately assembled a body of troops, and encamped very commodiously upon a ridge of mountains between Cirta and Hippo. His army he commanded in person; and detached his son Vermina, with a considerable force, to take a compass, and attack the enemy in the rear. In pursuance of his orders, Vermina set out in the beginning of the night, and took post in the place appointed him, without being discovered by the enemy. In the mean time Syphax decamped, and advanced towards the Massylii, in order to give them battle. When he had posted himself on a rising ground that led to their camp, and concluded that his son Vermina must have formed the ambuscade behind them, he began the fight. Massinissa being advantageously posted, and his soldiers distinguishing themselves in an extraordinary manner, the dispute was long and bloody. But Vermina unexpectedly falling upon their rear, and by this means obliging them to divide their forces, which were scarce able before to oppose the main body under Syphax, they were soon thrown into confusion, and forced to betake themselves to a precipitate flight. All the avenues being blocked up, partly by Syphax and partly by his son, such a dreadful slaughter was made of the unhappy Massylii, that only Massinissa himself, with 60 horse, escaped to the Lesser Syrtis. Here he remained, betwixt the confines of the Carthaginians and Garamantes, till the arrival of Laelius and the Roman fleet on the coast of Africa. What happened immediately after this junction with the Romans, belongs to the article ROME.\n\nIt will be sufficient therefore in this place to observe, that, by the affluence of Laelius, Massinissa at last reduced Syphax's kingdom. According to Zonaras, Massinissa and Scipio, before the memorable battle of Zama, by a stratagem deprived Hannibal of some advantageous posts; which, with a solar eclipse happening during the heat of the action, and not a little intimidating the Carthaginian troops, greatly contributed to the victory the Romans obtained. At the conclusion therefore of the second Punic war, he was amply rewarded by the Romans for the important services he had done them. As for Syphax, after the loss of his dominions, he was kept in confinement for some time at Alba; from whence being removed in order to grace Scipio's triumph, he died at Tibur in his way to Rome. Zonaras adds, that his corpse was decently interred; that all the Numidian priors were released; and that Vermina, by the affluence of the Romans, took peaceable possession of his father's throne. However, part of the Massylian kingdom had been before annexed to Massinissa's dominions, in order to reward that prince for his singular fidelity and close attachment to the Romans.\n\nThis seems to be countenanced by the epitomizer of Livy, who gives us sufficiently to understand, that Syphax's family, for a considerable time after the conclusion of the second Punic war, reigned in one part of Numidia. For he intimates, that Archobarzanes, Syphax's grandson, and probably Vermina's son, hovered with a powerful army of Numidians upon the Carthaginian frontiers a few years before the beginning of the third Punic war. This he seems to have done, either in order to cover them, or to enable the Carthaginians to make an irruption into Massinissa's territories. Cato, however, pretended that these forces, in conjunction with those of Carthage, had a design to invade the Roman dominions, which he urged as a reason to induce the conscript fathers to destroy the African republic.\n\nNothing is further requisite, in order to complete the history of this famous prince, than to exhibit to our readers view some points of his conduct towards the decline, and at the close, of life; the wise dispositions made after his death by Emilianus, in order to the regulation of his domestic affairs; and some particulars relating to his character, genius, and habit of body, drawn from the most celebrated Greek and Roman authors.\n\nBy drawing a line of circumvallation around the Carthaginian army under Adruba, posted upon an eminence, Massinissa cut off all manner of supplies from them; which introduced both the plague and famine into their camp. As the body of Numidian troops employed\nNumidia. ployed in this blockade was not near so numerous as the Carthaginian forces, it is evident, that the line here mentioned must have been extremely strong, and consequently the effect of great labour and art. The Carthaginians, finding themselves reduced to the last extremity, concluded a peace upon the following terms, which Massinissa dictated to them: 1. That they should deliver up all deserters. 2. That they should recall their exiles, who had taken refuge in his dominions. 3. That they should pay him 5000 talents of silver within the space of 50 years. 4. That their soldiers should pass under the jugum, each of them carrying off only a single garment. As Massinissa himself, though between 80 and 90 years of age, conducted the whole enterprise, he must have been extremely well versed in fortification, and other branches of the military art. His understanding likewise he must have retained to the last. This happened a short time before the beginning of the third Punic war. See CARTHAGE.\n\nSoon after, the consuls landed an army in Africa, in order to lay siege to Carthage, without impairing to Massinissa their design. This not a little chagrined him, as it was contrary to the former practice of the Romans; who, in the preceding war, had communicated their intentions to him, and consulted him on all occasions. When, therefore, the consuls applied to him for a body of his troops to act in concert with their forces, he made answer, \"That they should have a reinforcement from him when they stood in need of it.\" It could not but be provoking to him to consider, that after he had extremely weakened the Carthaginians, and even brought them to the brink of ruin, his pretended imperious friends should come to reap the fruits of his victory, without giving him the least intelligence of it.\n\nHowever, his mind soon returned to its natural bias, which was in favour of the Romans. Finding his end approaching, he sent to \u00c6milianus, then a tribune in the Roman army, to desire a visit from him. What he proposed by this visit, was to invest him with full powers to dispose of his kingdom and estate as he should think proper, for the benefit of his children. The high idea he had entertained of that young hero's abilities and integrity, together with his gratitude and affection for the family into which he was adopted, induced him to take this step. But, believing that death would not permit him to have a personal conference with \u00c6milianus upon this subject, he informed his wife and children in his last moments, that he had empowered him to dispose in an absolute manner of all his possessions, and divide his kingdom amongst his sons. To which he subjoined, \"I require, that whatever \u00c6milianus may decree, shall be executed as punctually as if I myself had appointed it by my will.\" Having uttered these words, he expired, at about 90 years of age.\n\nThis prince, during his youth, had met with strange reverses of fortune. However, says Appian, being supported by the Divine protection, he enjoyed an uninterrupted course of prosperity for a long series of years. His kingdom extended from Mauritania to the western confines of Cyrenaica; from whence it appears, that he was one of the most powerful princes of Africa. Many of the inhabitants of this vast tract he civilized in a wonderful manner, teaching them to cultivate their soil, and to reap those natural advantages Numidia, which the fertility of some parts of their country offered them. He was of a more robust habit of body than any of his contemporaries, being blest with the greatest health and vigour; which was doubtless owing to his extreme temperance, and the toils he incessantly sustained. We are informed by Polybius, that sometimes he stood upon the same spot of ground from morning till evening, without the least motion, and at others continued as long in a fitting posture. He would remain on horseback for several days and nights together, without being sensible of the least fatigue. Nothing can better evince the strength of his constitution, than his youngest son, named Sembabal, Silenba, or Stembanus, who was but four years old at his decease. Though 93 years of age, he performed all the exercises used by young men, and always rode without a saddle. Pliny tells us, that he reigned above 60 years. He was an able commander, and much facilitated the reduction of Carthage. Plutarch from Polybius observes, that the day after a great victory won over the Carthaginians, Massinissa was seen sitting at the door of his tent, eating a piece of brown bread. Suidas relates, that to the last he could mount his horse without any assistance. According to Appian he left a numerous well disciplined army, and an immense quantity of wealth, behind him.\n\nMassinissa, before his death, gave his ring to his eldest son Micipha; but left the distribution of all his other effects and possessions amongst his children entirely to \u00c6milianus. Of 54 sons that survived him, only three were legitimate, to wit, Micipha, Gulufa, and Maftanabal. \u00c6milianus, arrived at Cirta after he had expired, divided his kingdom, or rather the government of it, amongst these three, though to the others he gave considerable possessions. To Micipha, who was a prince of a pacific disposition, and the eldest son, he assigned Cirta, the metropolis, for the place of his residence, in exclusion of the others. Gulufa, the next to him, being a prince of military genius, had the command of the army, and the transacting of all affairs relating to peace or war committed to his care. And Maftanabal, the youngest, had the administration of justice, an employment suitable to his education, allotted him. They enjoyed in common the immense treasures Massinissa had amassed, and were all of them dignified by \u00c6milianus with the royal title. After he had made these wise dispositions, that young nobleman departed from Cirta, taking with him a body of Numidian troops, under the conduct of Gulufa, to reinforce the Roman army that was then acting against the Carthaginians.\n\nMaftanabal and Gulufa died soon after their father, as appears from the express testimony of Sallust. We find nothing more remarkable of these princes, besides what has been already related, than that the latter continued to assist the Romans in the third Punic war, and that the former was pretty well versed in the Greek language. Micipha therefore became sole possessor of the kingdom of Numidia. In his reign, and under the consulship of M. Plautius Hypsaeus and M. Fulvius Flaccus, according to Orofus, a great part of Africa was covered with locusts, which destroyed all the produce of the earth, and even devoured dry wood. But at last they were all carried by the wind into the African sea, out of which being thrown in vast heaps upon the shore, a plague ensued which swept away an infinite number\nNumidia, number of animals of all kinds. In Numidia only 800,000 men perished, and in Africa Propria 200,000; amongst the rest, 30,000 Roman soldiers quartered in and about Utica for the defence of the latter province. At Utica, in particular, the mortality raged to such a degree, that 1500 dead bodies were carried out of one gate in a day. Micipha had two sons, Adherbal and Hiempfal, whom he educated in his palace, together with his nephew Jugurtha. That young prince was the son of Maftanabal; but his mother having been only a concubine, Maftanifa had taken no great notice of him. However, Micipha considering him as a prince of the blood, took as much care of him as he did of his own children.\n\nJugurtha possessed several eminent qualities, which gained him universal esteem. He was very handsome, endued with great strength of body, and adorned with the finest intellectual endowments. He did not devote himself, as young men commonly do, to a life of luxury and pleasure. He used to exercise himself, with persons of his age, in running, riding, hurling the javelin, and other manly exercises, suited to the martial genius of the Numidians; and though he surpassed all his fellow sportsmen, there was not one of them but loved him. The chase was his only delight; but it was that of lions and other savage beasts. Sallust, to finish his character, tells us, that he excelled in all things, and spoke very little of himself.\n\nSo conspicuous an assemblage of fine talents and perfections, at first charmed Micipha, who thought them an ornament to his kingdom. However, he soon began to reflect, that he was considerably advanced in years, and his children in their infancy; so mankind naturally thirsted after power, and that nothing was capable of making men run greater lengths than a vicious and unlimited ambition. These reflections soon excited his jealousy, and determined him to expose Jugurtha to a variety of dangers, some of which, he entertained hopes, might prove fatal to him. In order to this, he gave him the command of a body of forces which he sent to assist the Romans, who were at that time besieging Numantia in Spain. But Jugurtha, by his admirable conduct, not only escaped all those dangers, but likewise won the esteem of the whole army, and the friendship of Scipio, who sent a high character of him to his uncle Micipha. However, that general gave him some prudent advice in relation to his future conduct; observing, no doubt, in him certain sparks of ambition, which, if lighted into a flame, he apprehended might one day be productive of the most fatal consequences.\n\nBefore this last expedition, Micipha had endeavoured to find out some method of taking him off privately; but his popularity amongst the Numidians obliged that prince to lay aside all thoughts of this nature. After his return from Spain the whole nation almost adored him. The heroic bravery he had shown there, his undaunted courage, joined to the utmost calmness of mind, which enabled him to preserve a just medium between a timorous foresight and an impetuous rashness, a circumstance rarely to be met with in persons of his age, and above all the advantageous testimonials of his conduct given by Scipio, attracted an universal esteem. Nay, Micipha himself, charmed with the high opinion the Roman general had entertained of his merit, changed his behaviour towards him; resolving, if possible, to win his affection by kindness. He therefore adopted him, and declared him joint heir with his two sons to the crown. Finding, some few years afterwards, that his end approached, he sent for all three to his bed side; where, in the presence of the whole court, he desired Jugurtha to recollect with what extreme tenderness he had treated him, and consequently to consider how well he had deserved at his hands. He then entreated him to protect his children on all occasions; who, being before related to him by the ties of blood, were now by their father's bounty become his brethren. In order to fix him the more firmly in their interest, he likewise complimented him upon his bravery, address, and consummate prudence. He further intimated, that neither arms nor treasures constitute the strength of a kingdom; but friends, who are neither won by arms nor gold, but by real services and an inviolable fidelity. \"Now, where (continued he) can we find better friends than in brothers? And how can that man who becomes an enemy to his relations, repose any confidence in, or depend upon strangers?\" Then addressing himself to Adherbal and Hiempfal, \"And you (said he) I enjoin always to pay the highest reverence to Jugurtha. Endeavour to imitate, and if possible surpass, his exalted merit, that the world may not hereafter observe Micipha's adopted son to have reflected greater glory upon his memory than his own children.\" Soon after, Micipha, who, according to Diodorus, was a prince of an amiable character, expired. Though Jugurtha did not believe the king to speak his real sentiments with regard to him, yet he seemed extremely pleased with so gracious a speech, and made him an answer suitable to the occasion. However, that prince at the same time was determined within himself to put in execution the scheme he had formed at the siege of Numantia, which was faggoted to him by some factious and abandoned Roman officers, with whom he there contracted an acquaintance. The purport of this scheme was, that he should extort the crown by force from his two cousins, as soon as their father's eyes were closed; which they insinuated might easily be effected by his own valour, and the venality of the Romans. Accordingly, a short time after the old king's death, he found means to affliliate Hiempfal in the city of Thirnida where his treasures were deposited, and drive Adherbal out of his dominions. That unhappy prince found himself obliged to fly to Rome, where he endeavoured to engage the conscript fathers to espouse his quarrel; but, notwithstanding the justice of his cause, they had not virtue enough effectually to support him. Jugurtha's ambassadors, by distributing vast sums of money amongst the senators, brought them so far over, that a majority palliated his inhuman proceedings. This encouraged those ministers to declare, that Hiempfal had been killed by the Numidians on account of his excessive cruelty; that Adherbal was the aggressor in the late troubles; and that he was only chagrined because he could not make that havoc among his countrymen he would willingly have done. They therefore entreated the senate to form a judgement of Jugurtha's behaviour in Africa from his conduct at Numantia, rather than from the suggestions of his enemies. Upon which, by far the greatest part of the senate discovered themselves prejudiced.\nprejudiced in his favour. A few, however, that were not lost to honour, nor abandoned to corruption, inflicted upon bringing him to condign punishment. But as they could not prevail, he had the best part of Numidia allotted him, and Adherbal was forced to rest satisfied with the other.\n\nJugurtha finding now by experience that everything was venal at Rome, as his friends at Numantia had before informed him, thought he might pursue his towering projects without any obstruction from that quarter. He therefore, immediately after the last division of Micipha's dominions, threw off the mask, and attacked his cousin by open force. As Adherbal was a prince of a pacific disposition, and almost in all respects the reverse of Jugurtha, he was by no means a match for him. The latter therefore pillaged the former's territories, stormed several of his fortresses, and overran a good part of his kingdom without opposition. Adherbal, depending on the friendship of the Romans, which his father in his last moments assured him would be a stronger support to him than all the troops and treasures in the universe, despatched deputies to Rome to complain of these hostilities. But whilst he lost his time in sending thither fruitless deputations, Jugurtha overthrew him in a pitched battle, and soon after shut him up in Cirta. During the siege of this city, a Roman commission arrived there, in order to persuade both parties to an accommodation; but finding Jugurtha untractable, the commissioners returned home without so much as conferring with Adherbal. A second deputation, composed of senators of the highest distinction, with \u00c6milius Scaurus, president of the senate, at their head, landed some time after at Utica, and summoned Jugurtha to appear before them. That prince at first seemed to be under dreadful apprehensions, especially as Scaurus reproached him with his enormous crimes, and threatened him with the resentment of the Romans if he did not immediately raise the siege of Cirta. However, the Numidian, by his address, and the irresistible power of gold, as was afterwards suspected at Rome, to mollify Scaurus, that he left Adherbal at his mercy. In fine, Jugurtha had at last Cirta surrendered to him, upon condition only that he should spare the life of Adherbal. But the merciless tyrant, in violation of the laws of nature and humanity as well as the capitulation, when he had got possession of the town, ordered him to be put to a most cruel death. The merchants likewise, and all the Numidians in the place capable of bearing arms, he cauled without distinction to be put to the sword.\n\nEvery person at Rome inspired with any sentiments of humanity, was struck with horror at the news of this tragic event. However, all the venal senators still concurred with Jugurtha's ministers in palliating his enormous crimes. Notwithstanding which, the people, excited thereto by Caius Memmius their tribune, who bitterly inveighed against the venality of the senate, resolved not to let so flagrant an instance of villany go unpunished. This disposition in them induced the conscript fathers likewise to declare their intention to chastise Jugurtha. In order to this, an army was levied to invade Numidia, and the command of it given to the consul Calpurnius Belfia, a person of good abilities, but rendered unfit for the expedition he was to go upon by his insatiable avarice. Jugurtha being informed of the great preparations making at Numidia, Rome to attack his dominions, sent his son thither to avert the impending storm. The young prince was plentifully supplied with money, which he had orders to distribute liberally amongst the leading men. But Belfia, proposing to himself great advantages from an invasion of Numidia, defeated all his intrigues, and got a decree passed, ordering him and his attendants to depart Italy in ten days, unless they were come to deliver up the king himself, and all his territories, to the republic by way of dedition. Which decree being notified to them, they returned without so much as having entered the gates of Rome; and the consul soon after landed with a powerful army in Africa. For some time he carried on the war there very briskly, reduced several strong holds, and took many Numidians prisoners. But upon the arrival of Scaurus, a peace was granted Jugurtha upon advantageous terms. That prince coming from Vezza, the place of his residence, to the Roman camp, in order to confer with Belfia and Scaurus, and the preliminaries of the treaty being immediately after settled between them in private conferences, every body at Rome was convinced that the prince of the senate and the consul had to their avarice sacrificed the republic. The indignation therefore of the people in general displayed itself in the strongest manner. Memmius also fired them with his speeches. It was therefore resolved to despatch the praetor Caecilius, a person they could confide in, to Numidia, to prevail upon Jugurtha to come to Rome, that they might learn from the king himself which of their generals and senators had been seduced by the pestilent influence of corruption. Upon his arrival there, he found means to bribe one Bebius Salca, a man of great authority amongst the plebeians, but of insatiable avarice, by whose assistance he escaped with impunity. Nay, by the efficacy of gold, he not only eluded all the endeavours of the people of Rome to bring him to justice, but likewise enabled Bomilcar, one of his attendants, to get Malissa, an illegitimate son of Micipha, assassinated in the streets of Rome. That young prince was advised by many Romans of probity, wellwishers to the family of Mafinissa, to apply for the kingdom of Numidia; which coming to Jugurtha's ears, he prevented the application by this execrable flattery. However, he was obliged to leave Italy immediately.\n\nJugurtha had scarce set foot in Africa, when he received advice that the senate had annulled the shameful peace concluded with him by Belfia and Scaurus. Soon after, the consul Albinus transported a Roman army into Numidia, flattering himself with the hopes of reducing Jugurtha to reason before the expiration of his consulship. In this, however, he found himself deceived; for that crafty prince, by various artifices so annulled and imposed upon Albinus, that nothing of moment happened that campaign. This rendered him strongly suspected of having betrayed his country, after the example of his predecessors. His brother Aulus, who succeeded him in the command of the army, was still more unsuccessful; for after rising from before Suthul, where the king's treasuries were depolished, he marched his forces into a desile, out of which he found it impossible to extricate himself. He therefore was obliged to submit to the ignominious ceremony of passing under the jugum, with all his men, and to quit Numidia entirely in ten days' time,\nNumidia, time, in order to deliver his troops from immediate destruction. The avaricious disposition of the Roman commander had prompted him to besiege Suthul, the possession of which place he imagined would make him master of all the wealth of Jugurtha, and consequently paved the way to such a scandalous treaty. However, this was declared void as soon as known at Rome, as being concluded without the authority of the people. The Roman troops retired into Africa Propria, which they had now reduced into the form of a Roman province, and there took up their winter quarters.\n\nIn the mean time Caius Marius Limetanus, tribune of the people, excited the plebeians to inquire into the conduct of those persons by whose affluence Jugurtha had found means to elude all the decrees of the senate. This put the body of the people into a great ferment; which occasioned a prosecution of the guilty senators, that was carried on, for some time, with the utmost heat and violence. Lucius Metellus the consul, during these transactions, had Numidia assigned him for his province, and consequently was appointed general of the army destined to act against Jugurtha. As he perfectly disdained wealth, the Numidian found him superior to all his temptations; which was a great mortification to him. To this he joined all the other virtues which constitute the great captain; so that Jugurtha found him in all respects inaccessible. That prince therefore was now forced to regulate his conduct according to the motions of Metellus, with the greatest caution; and to exert his utmost bravery, in order to compensate for that hitherto so favourable expedient which now began to fail him. Marius, Metellus's lieutenant, being likewise a person of uncommon merit, the Romans reduced Vacca, a large opulent city, and the most celebrated mart in Numidia. They also defeated Jugurtha in a pitched battle; overthrew Bomilcar, one of his generals, upon the banks of the Muthullus; and, in fine, forced the Numidian monarch to take shelter in a place rendered almost inaccessible by the rocks and woods with which it was covered. However, Jugurtha signalized himself in a surprising manner, exhibiting all that could be expected from the courage, abilities, and attention of a consummate general, to whom despair administers fresh strength, and suggests new lights. But his troops could not make head against the Romans; they were again worsted by Marius, though they obliged Metellus to raise the siege of Zama. Jugurtha therefore, finding his country everywhere ravaged, his most opulent cities plundered, his fortresses reduced, his towns burnt, vast numbers of his subjects put to the sword and taken prisoners, began to think seriously of coming to an accommodation with the Romans. His favourite Bomilcar, in whom he reposed the highest confidence, but who had been gained over to the enemy by Metellus, observing this disposition, found it no difficult matter to persuade him to deliver up his elephants, money, arms, horses, and deserters, in whom the main strength of his army consisted, into the hands of the Romans. Some of these last, in order to avoid the punishment due to their crime, retired to Bocchus king of Mauritania, and fitted in his service. But Metellus ordering him to repair to Thalala, a city of Numidia, there to receive farther directions, and he refusing a compliance with that order, hostilities were renewed with greater fury than ever. Fortune now seemed to declare in favour of Jugurtha: he retook Vacca, and massacred all the Roman garrison, except Turpilius the commandant. However, soon after, a Roman legion seized again upon it, and treated the inhabitants with the utmost severity. About this time, one of Matanabal's sons, named Gauda, whom Micipha in his will had appointed to succeed to the crown in case his two legitimate sons and Jugurtha died without issue, wrote to the senate in favour of Marius, who was then endeavouring to supplant Metellus. That prince having his understanding impaired by a declining state of health, fell a more easy prey to the base and infamous adulation of Marius. The Roman, soothing his vanity, assured him, that as he was the next heir to the crown, he might depend upon being fixed upon the Numidian throne, as soon as Jugurtha was either killed or taken; and that this must in a short time happen, when once he appeared at the head of the Roman army with an unlimited commission. Soon after, Bomilcar and Nabdaifa formed a design to assassinate Jugurtha, at the instigation of Metellus; but this being detected, Bomilcar and most of his accomplices suffered death. The plot however had such an effect upon Jugurtha, that he enjoyed afterwards no tranquillity or repose. He suspected persons of all denominations, Numidians as well as foreigners, of some black designs against him. Perpetual terrors sat brooding over his mind; insomuch that he never got a wink of sleep but by stealth, and often changed his bed in a low plebeian manner. Starting from his sleep, he would frequently snatch his sword, and break out into the most doleful cries: So strongly was he haunted by a spirit of fear, jealousy, and distraction!\n\nJugurtha having destroyed great numbers of his friends on suspicion of their having been concerned in the late conspiracy, and many more of them deserting to the Romans and Bocchus king of Mauritania, he found himself, in a manner, destitute of counsellors, generals, and all persons capable of assailing him in carrying on the war. This threw him into a deep melancholy, which rendered him dissatisfied with every thing, and made him fatigue his troops with a variety of contradictory motions. Sometimes he would advance with great celerity against the enemy, and at others retreat with no small advantages from them. Then he resumed his former courage; but soon after despaired either of the valour or fidelity of the forces under his command. All his movements therefore proved unsuccessful, and at last he was forced by Metellus to a battle. That part of the Numidian army which Jugurtha commanded, behaved with some resolution; but the other fled at the first onset. The Romans therefore entirely defeated them, took all their standards, and made a few of them prisoners. But few of them were slain in the action; since, as Sallust observes, the Numidians trifled more to their heels than to their arms for safety in this engagement.\n\nMetellus pursued Jugurtha and his fugitives to Thala. His march to this place being through vast deserts, was extremely tedious and difficult. But being supplied with leatheren bottles and wooden vessels of all sizes taken from the huts of the Numidians, which were filled with water brought by the natives, who had submitted to him, he advanced towards that city.\ncity. He had no sooner begun his march, than a most copious shower of rain, a thing very uncommon in those deserts, proved a great and seasonable refreshment to his troops. This so animated them, that upon their arrival before Thala, they attacked the town with such vigour, that Jugurtha with his family, and treasures deposited therein, thought proper to abandon it. After a brave defence, it was reduced; the garrison, consisting of Roman deserters, setting fire to the king's palace, and consuming themselves, together with every thing valuable to them, in the flames. Jugurtha, being now reduced to great extremities, retired into Gaetulia, where he formed a considerable corps. From thence he advanced to the confines of Mauritania; and engaged Bocchus king of that country, who had married his daughter, to enter into an alliance with him. In consequence of which, having reinforced his Gaetulian troops with a powerful body of Mauritanians, he turned the tables upon Metellus, and obliged him to keep close within his entrenchments. Sallust informs us, that Jugurtha bribed Bocchus's ministers to influence that prince in his favour; and that having obtained an audience, he infamously, that should Numidia be subdued, Mauritania must be involved in its ruin, especially as the Romans seemed to have vowed the destruction of all the thrones in the universe. In support of what he advanced, he produced several instances very apposite to the point in view. However, the same author seems to intimate, that Bocchus was determined to assist Jugurtha against his enemies by the flight the Romans had formerly shown him. That prince, at the first breaking out of the war, had sent ambassadors to Rome, to propose an offensive and defensive alliance to the republic; which, though of the utmost consequence to it at the juncture, a few of the most venal and infamous senators, who were abandoned to corruption, prevented from taking effect. This undoubtedly wrought more powerfully upon Bocchus in favour of Jugurtha, than the relation he stood in to him: For both the Moors and Numidians adapted the number of their wives to their circumstances, so that some had 10, 20, &c. to their share; their kings therefore were unlimited in this particular, and of course all degrees of affinity resulting to them from marriage had little force. It is observable, that the posterity of those ancient nations have the same custom prevailing amongst them at this day.\n\nSuch was the situation of affairs in Numidia, when Metellus received advice of the promotion of Marius to the consulship. But, notwithstanding this injurious treatment, he generously endeavoured to draw off Bocchus from Jugurtha, though this would facilitate the reduction of Numidia for his rival. To this end ambassadors were despatched to the Mauritanian court, who intimated to Bocchus, \"That it would be highly imprudent to come to a rupture with the Romans without any cause at all; and that he had now a fine opportunity of concluding a most advantageous treaty with them, which was much preferable to a war.\" To which they added, that whatever dependence he might place upon his riches, he ought not to run the hazard of losing his dominions by embroiling himself with other states, when he could easily avoid this; that it was much easier to begin a war than to end it, which it was in the power of the victor alone to do; that, in fine, he would by no means consult the interest of his subjects if he followed the desperate fortunes of Jugurtha.\" To which Bocchus replied, \"That for his part there was nothing he wished for more than peace; but that he could not help pitying the deplorable condition of Jugurtha; that if the Romans, therefore, would grant that unfortunate prince the same terms they had offered him, he would bring about an accommodation.\" Metellus, let the Mauritanian monarch know, that it was not in his power to comply with what he desired. However, he took care to keep up a private negotiation with him till the new consul Marius's arrival. By this conduct he served two wise ends. First, He prevented Bocchus from coming to a general action with his troops; which was the very thing Jugurtha desired, as hoping that this, whatever the event might be, would render a reconciliation between him and the Romans impracticable. Secondly, This inaction enabled him to discover something of the genius and disposition of the Moors; a nation of whom the Romans, till then, had scarcely formed any idea; which, he imagined, might be of no small service, either to himself or his successors, in the future prosecution of the war.\n\nJugurtha, being informed that Marius, with a numerous army, was landed at Utica, advised Bocchus to retire, with part of the troops, to some place of difficult access, whilst he himself took post upon another inaccessible spot with the remaining corps. By this measure, he hoped the Romans would be obliged to divide their forces, and consequently be more exposed to his efforts and attacks. He likewise imagined, that seeing no formidable body appear, they would believe the enemy in no condition to make head against them; which might occasion a relaxation of discipline, the usual attendant of a too great security, and consequently produce some good effect. However, he was disappointed in both these views. For Marius, far from suffering a relaxation of discipline to take place, trained up his troops, which consisted chiefly of new levies, in perfect manner, that they were soon equal in goodness to any consular army that ever appeared in the field. He also cut off great numbers of the Getulian marauders, defeated many of Jugurtha's parties, and had like to have taken that prince himself near the city of Cirta. These advantages, though not of any great importance, he gains intimidated Bocchus, who now made overtures for an accommodation; but the Romans, not being sufficiently satisfied of his sincerity, paid no great attention to them. In the meantime Marius pushed on his conquests, reducing several places of less note, and at last resolved to besiege Capfa. That this enterprise might be conducted with the greater secrecy, he suffered not the least hint of his design to transpire, even amongst any of his officers. On the contrary, in order to blind them, he detached A. Manlius, one of his lieutenants, with some light-armed cohorts, to the city of Lares, where he had fixed his principal magazine, and deposited the military chest. Before Manlius left the camp, that he might the more effectually amuse him, he intimated, that himself with the army should take the same route in a few days: but instead of that, he bent his march towards the Tana\u00efs, and in six days time arrived upon the banks of that river. Here he pitched his tents for a short time, in order to refresh his troops; which having done, he advanced to Capfa, and made himself master of it.\nAs the situation of this city rendered it extremely commodious to Jugurtha, whose plan of operations, ever since the commencement of the war, it had exceedingly favoured, he levelled it with the ground after it had been delivered up to the soldiery to be plundered. The citizens likewise, being more strongly attached to that prince than any of the other Numidians, on account of the extraordinary privileges he indulged them with, and of course bearing a more implacable hatred to the Romans, he put to the sword or sold for slaves. The true motive of the consul's conduct on this occasion seems here to be aligned; though we are told by Sallust, in conformity to the Roman genius, that neither avarice nor resentment prompted him to so barbarous an action, but only a desire to strike a terror into the Numidians.\n\nThe Numidians, ever after this exploit, dreaded the very name of Marius; who now, in his own opinion, had eclipsed the glory of all his predecessor's great achievements, particularly the reduction of Thala, a city, in strength and situation, nearly resembling Capta. Following his blow, he gradually presented himself before most of the places of strength in the enemy's country; many of which either opened their gates, or were abandoned, at his approach, being terrified with what had happened to the unfortunate citizens of Capta. Others taken by force, he laid in ashes; and in short, filled the greatest part of Numidia with blood, horror, and confusion. Then, after an obstinate defence, he reduced a castle that seemed impregnable, seated not far from Mulucha, where Jugurtha kept part of his treasures. In the mean time, Jugurtha not being able to prevail upon Bocchus, by his repeated solicitations, to advance into Numidia, where he found himself greatly perplexed, was obliged to have recourse to his usual method of bribing the Mauritanian ministers, in order to put that prince in motion. He also promised him a third part of his kingdom, provided they could either drive the Romans out of Africa, or get all the Numidian dominions confirmed to him by treaty.\n\nSo considerable a cession could not fail of engaging Bocchus to support Jugurtha with his whole power. The two African monarchs therefore, having joined their forces, surprized Marius near Cirta as he was going into winter quarters. The Roman general was so pusillanimous on this occasion, that the barbarians thought themselves certain of victory, and doubted not but they should be able to extinguish the Roman name in Numidia. But their incursion and too great security enabled Marius to give them a total defeat; which was followed four days after by so complete an overthrow, that their numerous army, consisting of 90,000 men, by the accession of a powerful corps of Moors, commanded by Bocchus's son Volux, was entirely ruined. Sylla, Marius's lieutenant, most eminently distinguished himself in the last action, which laid the foundation of his future greatness. Bocchus, now looking upon Jugurtha's condition as desperate, and not being willing to run the risk of losing his dominions, showed a disposition to clap up a peace with Rome. However, the republic gave him to understand, that he must not expect to be ranked amongst its friends, till he had delivered up into the consul's hands Jugurtha, the inveterate enemy of the Roman name. The Mauritanian monarch, having entertained a high idea of an alliance with that state, resolved to satisfy it in this particular; and was confirmed in his resolution by one Dabir, a Numidian prince, the son of Maflugrada, and defended by his mother's side from Masinissa. Being closely attached to the Romans, and extremely agreeable to Bocchus on account of his noble disposition, he defeated all the intrigues of Aspar, Jugurtha's minister. Upon Sylla's arrival at the Mauritanian court, the affair there seemed to be entirely settled. However, Bocchus, who was for ever projecting new designs, and, like the rest of his countrymen, in the highest degree perfidious, debated within himself, whether he should sacrifice Sylla or Jugurtha, who were both then in his power. He was a long time fluctuating with uncertainty, and combated by a contrariety of sentiments. The sudden changes which displayed themselves in his countenance, his air, and his whole person, evidently shewed how strongly his mind was agitated. But at last he returned to his first design, to which the bias of his mind seemed naturally to lead him. He therefore delivered up Jugurtha into the hands of Sylla, to be conducted to Marius; who, by that successful event, happily terminated this dangerous war. The kingdom of Numidia was now reduced to a new form: Bocchus, for his important services, had the country of the Maflafyli, contiguous to Mauritania, assigned him: which, from this time, took the name of New Mauritania. Numidia Propria, or the country of the Maflyli, was divided into three parts; one of which was given to Hiempfal, another to Mandrefal, both descendants of Masinissa; and the third the Romans annexed to Africa Propria, or the Roman province adjacent to it. What became of Jugurtha after he had graced Marius's triumph, at which ceremony he was led in chains, together with his two sons, through the streets of Rome, we have already laid before our readers. See JUGURTHA.\n\nJugurtha's two sons survived him, but spent their lives in captivity at Venufa. However, one of them, named Oxyntas, was, for a short time, released from Jugurtha's confinement by Aponius, who besieged Accerri in the war between the Romans and the Italian allies. That general brought this prince to his army, where he treated him as king, in order to draw the Numidian forces off from the Roman service. Accordingly those Numidians no sooner heard that the son of their old king was fighting for the allies, than they began to desert by companies; which obliged Julius Caesar the consul to part with all his Numidian cavalry, and send them back into Africa. Some few years after this event, Pompey defeated C\u00e6lius Domitius Ahenobarbus, and Hiarbas one of the kings of Numidia, killing 17,000 of their men upon the spot. Not satisfied with this victory, that general pursued the fugitives to their camp, which he soon forced, put Domitius to the sword, and took Hiarbas prisoner. He then reduced that part of Numidia which belonged to Hiarbas, who seems to have succeeded Mandrefal above-mentioned; and gave it to Hiempfal, a neighbouring Numidian prince, descended from Masinissa, who had always opposed the Marian faction.\n\nSuetonius informs us, that a dispute happened between Hiempfal and one Mafintha, a noble Numidian, whom, it is probable, he had in some respect injured, when Julius Caesar first began to make a figure in the world. The same author adds, that Caesar warmly espoused\nespoused the cause of Massintha, and even grossly insulted Juba, Hiempsal's son, when he attempted to vindicate his father's conduct on this occasion. He pulled him by the beard, than which a more unpardonable affront could not be offered to an African. In short, he screened Massintha from the insults and violence of his enemies; from whence a reason may be assigned for Juba's adhering so closely afterwards to the Pompeian faction.\n\nIn consequence of the indignity Caesar had offered Juba, and the disposition it had occasioned, that prince did Caesar great damage in the civil wars betwixt him and Pompey. By a stratagem he drew Curio, one of his lieutenants, into a general action, which it was his interest at that time to have avoided. He caused it to be given out all over Africa Propria and Numidia, that he was retired into some remote country at a great distance from the Roman territories. This coming to Curio's ears, who was then besieging Utica, it hindered him from taking the necessary precautions against a surprise. Soon after, the Roman general receiving intelligence that a small body of Numidians was approaching his camp, he put himself at the head of his forces in order to attack them, and, for fear they should escape, began his march in the night, looking upon himself as sure of victory. Some of their advanced posts he surprised asleep, and cut them to pieces; which still farther animated him. In short, about daybreak he came up with the Numidians, whom he attacked with great bravery, though his men were then failing, and vastly fatigued by their forced and precipitate march. In the mean time, Juba, who immediately after the propagation of the rumour above mentioned, had taken care to march privately, with the main body of the Numidian army, to support the detachment sent before to decoy Curio, advanced to the relief of his men. The Romans had met with a great resistance before he appeared; so that he easily broke them, killed Curio, with a great part of his troops, upon the spot, pursued the rest to their camp, which he plundered, and took many of them prisoners. Most of the fugitives, who endeavoured to make their escape on board the ships in the port of Utica, were either slain by the pursuers, or drowned. The remainder fell into the hands of Varus, who would have saved them; but Juba, who arrogated to himself the honour of this victory, ordered most of them to be put to the sword.\n\nThis victory infused new life and vigour into the Pompeian faction, who thereupon conferred great honours upon Juba, and gave him the title of king of all Numidia. But Caesar and his adherents declared him an enemy to the state of Rome, adjudging to Bocchus and Bogud, two African princes entirely in their interest, the sovereignty of his dominions. Juba afterwards, uniting his forces with those of Scipio, reduced Caesar to great extremities, and would in all probability have totally ruined him, had he not been relieved by Publius Sittius. That general, having formed a considerable corps, consisting of Roman exiles, and Mauritanian troops sent him by Bocchus, according to Dio, or, as Caesar will have it, Bogud, made an irruption into Gaetulia and Numidia, whilst Juba was employed in Africa Propria. As he ravaged these countries in a dreadful manner, Juba immediately returned with the best part of his army, to preserve them from utter destruction. However, Caesar knowing his horse to be Numidia, afraid of the enemy's elephants, did not think proper to attack Scipio in the absence of the Numidian, till his own elephants, and a fresh reinforcement of troops, hourly expected, arrived from Italy. With this accession of strength, he imagined himself able to give a good account, both of the Roman forces with which he was to cope, and the barbarians. In the mean time Scipio despatched reiterated expostles to Juba to hasten to his assistance; but could not prevail upon him to move out of Numidia, till he had promised him the possession of all the Roman dominions in Africa, if they could from thence expel Caesar. This immediately put him in motion; so that, having sent a large detachment to make head against Sittius, he marched with the rest of his troops to assist Scipio. However, Caesar at last overthrew Scipio, Juba, and Labienus, near the town of Thapsus, and forced all their camps. As Scipio was the first furnished and defeated, Juba fled into Numidia without waiting for Caesar's approach; but the body of the Numidians detached against Sittius, having been broken and dispersed by that general, none of his subjects there would receive him. Abandoned therefore to despair, he fought death in a single combat with Petreius, and, having killed him, caused himself to be dispatched by one of his slaves.\n\nAfter this decisive action, and the reduction of Africa Propria, Caesar made himself master of Numidia; reduced to which he reduced to a Roman province, appointing the form of Crispus Sallustius to govern it in quality of proconsul, with private instructions to pillage and plunder the inhabitants, and, by that means, put it out of their power ever to shake off the Roman yoke. However, Bocchus and Bogud still preferred a sort of sovereignty in the country of the Massiflyi and Mauritania, since the former of those princes, having deserted Caesar, sent an army into Spain, to assist the Pompeians; and the latter, with his forces, determined victory to declare for Caesar at the ever memorable battle of Munda. Bogud, afterwards siding with Antony against Octavius, sent a body of forces to assist him in Spain; at which time the Tingitanians revolting from him, Bocchus, with an army composed of Romans in the interest of Octavius, who palled over from Spain into Africa, and his own subjects, confessed himself of Mauritania Tingitana. Bogud fled to Antony; and Octavius, after the conclusion of the war, honoured the inhabitants of Tingi with all the privileges of Roman citizens. He likewise confirmed Bocchus king of Mauritania Caesariensis, or the country of the Massiflyi, in the possession of Tingitana, which he had conquered, as a reward for his important services. In this he imitated the example of his great predecessor Julius Caesar, who divided some of the fruitful plains of Numidia among the soldiers of P. Sittius, who had conquered great part of that country, and appointed Sittius himself sovereign of that district. Sittius, as has been intimated above, having taken Cirta, killed Sabura, Juba's general, entirely dispersed his forces, and either cut off or taken prisoners most of the Pompeian fugitives that escaped from the battle of Thapsus, highly deserved to be distinguished in so eminent a manner. After Bocchus's death, Mauritania and the Massiflyi Numidia were in all respects considered as Roman provinces.","sp":95,"ep":104},{"h":"NUMISMATOGRAPHIA","t":"a term used for the description\nNUN\n\ndescription and knowledge of ancient coins and medals, whether of gold, silver, or brass.

See the article Monk.\n\nThere were women, in the ancient Christian church, who made public profession of virginity, before the monastic life was known in the world, as appears from the writings of Cyprian and Tertullian. These, for distinction's sake, are sometimes called ecclesiastical virgins, and were commonly enrolled in the canon or matricula of the church. They differed from the monastic virgins chiefly in this, that they lived privately in their fathers' houses, whereas the others lived in communities; but their profession of virginity was not so strict as to make it criminal for them to marry afterwards, if they thought fit. As to the consecration of virgins, it had some things peculiar in it; it was usually performed publicly in the church by the bishop. The virgin made a public profession of her resolution, and then the bishop put upon her the accustomed habit of sacred virgins. One part of this habit was a veil, called the sacrum velamen; another was a kind of mitre or coronet worn upon the head. At present, when a woman is to be made a nun, the habit, veil, and ring of the candidate are carried to the altar; and the herself, accompanied by her nearest relations, is conducted to the bishop, who, after mass and an anthem, (the subject of which is, \"that she ought to have her lamp lighted, because the bridegroom is coming to meet her\"), pronounces the benediction; then she rises up, and the bishop consecrates the new habit, sprinkling it with holy water. When the candidate has put on her religious habit, she presents herself before the bishop, and rings, on her knees, Ancilla Christi fam., &c.; then she receives the veil, and afterwards the ring, by which she is married to Christ; and lastly, the crown of virginity. When she is crowned, an anathema is denounced against all who shall attempt to make her break her vows. In some few instances, perhaps, it may have happened that numeraries, monasteries, &c. may have been useful as well to morality and religion as to literature; in the gross, however, they have been highly prejudicial; and however well they might be supposed to do when viewed in theory, in fact they are unnatural and impious.

They there preserve, as precious relics, the crown, sceptre, clothes, buckles, and other ornaments of Charlemagne (A), which served also the emperor Leopold, when he went thither after his election, to receive the homage of the city. The small river Regnitz, which runs through it, and those of Rednitz and Schwarzack, which pass by its walls, furnish the inhabitants, besides other advantages, with the means of making all sorts of stuffs, dyes, and other manufactures (B), and toys, which are carried and sold even in the Indies.\n\nIt is a large and well-built town, but not very populous. Its fortifications are a double wall, flanked with towers mounting cannon, and a deep ditch. The magistrates, and most of the inhabitants, are Lutherans. There are a great many churches and chapels in it. In that of St Sebald is a brass monument of the saint; and a picture, representing the creation of the world, by the celebrated Albert Durer, who was a native of the town; but the finest church in the town is that of St Giles. In that of the Holy Ghost are kept most of the jewels of the empire, together with the pretended spear with which our Saviour's side was pierced, a thorn of his crown, and a piece of the manger wherein he was laid. Here are also a great many hospitals, one in particular for foundlings, and another for pilgrims; with a gymnasium, an anatomical theatre, a granary, a fine public library, the old imperial forts or castles, some remains of the old citadel of the burggraves of Nuremberg, several Latin schools, an academy of painting, a well furnished arsenal, a Teutonic house in which the Roman Catholic service is tolerated, and a mint. Mr Keyser says, there are upwards of 500 streets in it, about 140 fountains, 16 churches, 44 religious houses, 12 bridges, 10 market places, and 25,000 inhabitants; and that its territories, besides the capital and four other towns, contain above 500 villages, and about 160 mills on the Regnitz. The trade of this city, though upon the decline, is still very great, many of its manufactures being still exported to all parts of the world; among which may be reckoned a great variety of curious toys in ivory, wood, and metal, already mentioned. The city has also distinguished itself in the arts of painting and engraving. When the emperor Henry VI. assisted at a tournament in Nuremberg, he raised 38 burghers to the degree of nobility, the defendants of whom are called patricians, and have the government of the city entirely in their hands; the whole council, except eight masters of companies, who are summoned only on extraordinary occasions, consisting of them. Among the fine brass cannon in the arsenal, is one that is charged at the breech, and may be fired eight times in a minute; and two that carry balls of eighty pounds. The city keeps, in constant pay, seven companies, consisting each, in time of peace, of 100 men, but, in time of war, of 185; two troops of cuirassiers, each consisting of 85 men; and two companies of invalids. There are also 24 companies of burghers, well armed and disciplined. On the new bridge, which is said to have cost 100,000 guilders, are two pyramids, on the top of one of which is a dove with an olive branch in her bill, and on the other an imperial black eagle.

See LACTATIO.\n\nThe following observations and directions are said to be the result of long experience. The child should be laid (the first month) upon a thin mattress, rather longer than itself, which the nurse will keep upon her lap, that the child may always lie straight, and only sit up as the nurse flants the mattress. To set a child quite upright before the end of the first month, hurts the eyes, by making the white part of the eye appear below the upper eyelid. Afterwards the nurse will begin to set it up and dance it by degrees. The child must be kept as dry as possible.\n\nThe clothing should be very light, and not much longer than the child, that the legs may be got at with ease, in order to have them often rubbed in the day with a warm hand or flannel, and in particular the inside of them.\n\nRubbing a child all over takes off scurf, and makes the blood circulate. The one breast should be rubbed with the hands one way, and the other the other way, night and morning at least.\n\nThe ankle bones and inside of the knees should be rubbed twice a day; this will strengthen those parts, and make the child stretch its knees and keep them flat, which is the foundation of an erect and graceful person.\n\nA nurse ought to keep a child as little in her arms as possible, lest the legs should be cramped, and the toes turned inwards. Let her always keep the child's legs loose. The oftener the posture is changed, the better.\n\nTossing a child about, and exercising it in the open air in fine weather, is of the greatest service. In cities, children are not to be kept in hot rooms, but to have as much air as possible.\n\nWant of exercise is the cause of large heads, weak and knotted joints, a contracted breast, which occasions coughs and stuffed lungs, an ill shaped person, and waddling gait, besides a numerous train of other ills.\n\nThe child's flesh is to be kept perfectly clean, by constantly washing its limbs and likewise its neck and ears; beginning with warm water, till by degrees it will not only bear, but like to be washed with cold water.\n\nRising early in the morning is good for all children, provided they awake of themselves, which they generally do; but they are never to be waked out of their sleep, and as soon as possible to be brought to regular sleeps in the day.\n\nWhen laid in bed or cradle, their legs are always to be laid straight.\n\nChildren, till they are two or three years old, must never be suffered to walk long enough at a time to be weary.\n\nGirls might be trained to the proper management of children, if a premium were given in free schools, workhouses, &c. to those that brought up the finest child to one year old.\n\nIf the mother cannot suckle the child, get a wholesome cheerful woman, with young milk, who has been used to tend young children.

What power is it that communicates to this matter the activity and motion necessary to penetrate this mould? and, if such a force exist, would it not be by a similar force that the internal mould itself might be reproduced?\n\nAs to the first question, he supposes that there exists in nature an infinite number of living organic parts, and that all organized bodies consist of such organic parts; that their production costs nature nothing, since their existence is constant and invariable; so that the Nut No. matter which the animal or vegetable assimilates to its substance, is an organic matter of the same nature with that of the animal or vegetable, which consequently may augment its volume without changing its form or altering the quality of the substance in the mould.\n\nAs to the second question: There exist (says he) in nature certain powers, as that of gravity, that have no affinity with the external qualities of the body, but act upon the most intimate parts, and penetrate them throughout, and which can never fall under the observation of our senses.\n\nAnd as to the third question, he answers, that the internal mould itself is reproduced, not only by a similar power, but it is plain that it is the very same power that causes the unfolding and reproduction thereof: for it is sufficient (proceeds he), that in an organized body that unfolds itself, there be some part similar to the whole, in order that this part may one day become itself an organized body, altogether like that of which it is actually a part.\n\n**NUX MOSCHATA.** See MYRISTICA.\n\n**NUX PISTACHIA.** See PISTACHIA, BOTANY Index.","sp":108,"ep":108},{"h":"NUX VOMICA","t":"a flat, compressed, round fruit, about the breadth of a shilling, brought from the East Indies.

All the universe was represented as full of these nymphs, who are distinguished into several ranks or classes. The general division of them is into celestial and terrestrial; the former of them were called uraniae, and were supposed to be intelligences that governed the heavenly bodies or spheres. The terrestrial nymphs, called epigeiae, presided over the several parts of the inferior world; and were divided into those of the water, and those of the earth. The nymphs of the water were the oceanitides, or nymphs of the ocean; the nereids, the nymphs of the sea; the naiads and ophrygiades, the nymphs of the fountains; and the limnades, the nymphs of the lakes. The nymphs of the earth were the oreades, or nymphs of the mountains; the napaeae, nymphs of the meadows; and the dryads and hamadryades, who were nymphs of the forests and groves. Besides these, we meet with nymphs who took their names from particular countries, rivers, &c., as the citheroniades, so called from Mount Citheron in Boeotia; the dodonides, from Dodona; tiberiades, from the Tiber, &c.\u2014Goats were sometimes sacrificed to the nymphs; but their constant offerings were milk, oil, honey, and wine.\n\nWe have the following account of nymphs in Chandler's Greece. \"They were supposed to enjoy longevity, but not to be immortal. They were believed to delight in springs and fountains. They are described as sleepless, and as dreaded by the country people. They were susceptible of passion. The Argonauts, it is related, landing on the shore of the Propontis to dine in their way to Colchos, sent Hylas, a boy, for water, who discovered a lonely fountain, in which the nymphs Eunice, Malis, and Nycheia, were preparing to dance; and these feeling him were enamoured, and, seizing him by the hand,\nhand as he was filling his vase, pulled him in. The del-\nties, their copartners in the cave, are such as prefiged\nwith them over rural and pastoral affairs.\n\n\"The old Athenians were ever ready to cry out,\nA god! or a goddes! The tyrant Pifitratrus entered\nthe city in a chariot with a tall woman drested in ar-\nmour to resemble Minerva, and regained the Acropolis,\nwhich he had been forced to abandon, by this stratagem;\nthe people worshipping, and believing her to be the dei-\nty whom they represented. The nymphs, it was the po-\npular persuasion, occasionally appeared; and nympho-\nlepsy is characterized as a frenzy, which arose from ha-\nving beheld them. Superstition disposed the mind to\nadopt delusion for reality, and gave to a fancied vision\nthe efficacy of full conviction. The foundation was per-\nhaps no more than an indirect, partial, or obscure view\nof some harmless girl, who had approached the foun-\ntain on a like errand with Hylas, or was retiring after she\nhad filled her earthen pitcher.\n\n\"Among the sacred caves on record, one on Mount\nIda in Crete was the property of Jupiter, and one by\nLebadea in Boeotia of Trophonius. Both these were\noracular, and the latter bore some resemblance to that\nwe have described. It was formed by art, and the mouth\nsurrounded with a wall. The descent to the landing\nplace was by a light and narrow ladder, occasionally\napplied and removed. It was situated on a mountain\nabove a grove; and they related, that a swarm of bees\nconducted the person by whom it was first discovered.\nBut the common owners of caves were the nymphs,\nand these were sometimes local. On Citheron in Boeo-\ntia, many of the inhabitants were possessed by nymphs\ncalled Sphragitides, whose cave, once also oracular, was\non a summit of the mountain. Their dwellings had ge-\nnerally a well or spring of water; the former often a\ncollection of moisture condensed or exuding from the roof\nand sides; and this, in many instances, being pregnant\nwith flaky particles, concreted, and marked its passage\nby incrustation, the groundwork in all ages and coun-\ntries of idle tales framed or adopted by superstitious and\ncredulous people.\n\n\"A cave in Paphlagonia was sacred to the nymphs\nwho inhabited the mountains about Heraclia. It was\nlong and wide, and pervaded by cold water, clear as\ncrystal. There also were seen bowls of stone, and\nnymphs and their webs and distaffs, and curious work,\nexciting admiration. The poet who has described this\ngrotto, deserves not to be regarded, as fervently copying\nHomer; he may justly lay claim to rank as an original\ntopographer.\n\n\"The pity of Archidamus furnished a retreat for the\nnymphs, where they might find shelter and provision, if\ndistressed; whether the sun parched up their trees, or\nJupiter enthroned in clouds upon the mountain top feared\nthem with his red lightning and terrible thunder, pour-\ning down a deluge of rain, or brightening the summits\nwith his snow.\"\n\nNymph, among naturalists, that state of winged in-\nsects between their living in the form of a worm and their\nappearing in the winged or moth perfect state.\n\nThe eggs of insects are first hatched into a kind of\nworms or maggots; which afterwards pass into the\nnymph state, surrounded with shells or cases of their\nown skins; so that, in reality, these nymphs are only\nthe embryo insects, wrapped up in this covering; from\nwhence they at last get loose, though not without great\ndifficulty.\n\nDuring this nymph state the creature loses its motion.\nSwammerdam calls it nympha aurelia, or simply aurelia;\nand others give it the name of chrysalis, a term of the\nlike import.

In an inscription, the term is\nwritten nymphium. None of all these nymph\u00e6a has\nlasted down to our time. Some years since, indeed, a\nsquare building of marble was discovered between\nNaples and Vesuvius, with only one entrance, and\nsome steps that went down to it. On the right hand as\nyou enter, towards the head, there is a fountain of the\npurest water; along which, by way of guard as it were,\nis laid a naked Arethusa of the whitest marble; the bot-\ntom or ground is of variegated marble, and encompassed\nwith a canal fed by the water from the fountain: the\nwalls are set round with shells and pebbles of various\ncolours; by the setting of which, as by so many strokes in\na picture, are expressed the 12 months of the year, and\nthe four political virtues; also the rape of Proserpine;\nPan playing on his reed, and soothing his flock; besides\nthe representations of nymphs swimming, failing, and\nwanton on fishes, &c.\n\nIt seems pretty evident that the nymph\u00e6a were public\nbaths; for at the same time that they were furnished\nwith pleasing grottoes, they were also supplied with\ncooling streams, by which they were rendered exceed-\ningly delightful, and drew great numbers of people to\nfrequent them. Silence seems to have been a particu-\nlar requisite there, as appears by this inscription, Nympha,\nloci, libri, lata, tace.

However, he did not immediately declare his ambitious views; but pretending to espouse the cause of Galba, assured the guards that Nero was fled, and promised them such sums as neither Galba nor any other was able to discharge. This promise secured for the present the empire to Galba, occasioned afterwards the loss of it, and, finally, produced the destruction of Nymphidius and the guards themselves. After Nero's death, however, and on the acknowledgement of Galba as emperor, he renewed his ambition; and having, by his immense largesses, gained the affections of the praetorian guards, and persuading himself that Galba, by reason of his infirmities and old age, would never reach the capital, usurped all the authority at Rome. Presuming upon his interest, he obliged Tigellinus, who commanded, jointly with him, the praetorian guards, to resign his commission. He made several magnificent and extensive entertainments, inviting such as had been consuls or had commanded armies, distributed large sums among the people, and with shows and other diversions, which he daily exhibited, gained so great an interest with all ranks, that he already looked upon himself as sovereign. The senate, dreading his power, conferred extraordinary honours upon him, styled him their protector, attended him when he appeared in public, and had recourse to him for the confirmation of their decrees, as if he had been already invested with the sovereign power. This base compliance elated him to such a degree, that he usurped, not leisurely and by degrees, but all at once, an absolute authority. He acted as sovereign indeed, but he had not as yet openly declared his design of seizing the empire; his power however was great, and he used it in undermining Galba's power; he was, however, unsuccessful, and the disclosure of his designs was much against him.

In 1627 Nyuts arrived in Batavia from Holland, and was in the same year appointed ambassador to the emperor of Japan by the governor and council of Batavia.\n\nHe repaired to that empire in 1628; and being a man of a haughty disposition, and extremely vain, he believed it practicable to pass upon the natives for an ambassador from the king of Holland. Upon his affuming this title he was much more honourably received, cared for, and respected, than former ministers had been. But he was soon detected, reprimanded, and reproached in the severest manner, sent back to the port, and ordered to return to Batavia with all the circumstances of disgrace imaginable; notwithstanding which, his interest was so great, that, instead of being punished as he deserved, he was immediately afterwards promoted to the government of the island of Formosa, of which he took possession the year following.\n\nHe entered upon the administration of affairs in that island with the same disposition that he had shown while ambassador, and with the most implacable resentment against\nagainst the Japanese; neither was it long before an opportunity offered, as he thought, of revenging himself to the full. Two large Japanese ships, with upwards of 500 men on board, came into the port; upon which he took it into his head to disarm and unite them, in the same manner as the Dutch vessels are treated at Japan. The Japanese did all they could to defend themselves from this ill usage; but at last, for want of water, they were forced to submit. Governor Nuyts went still farther. When they had finished their affairs at Formosa, and were desirous of proceeding, according to their instructions, to China, he put them off with fair words and fine promises till the monsoon was over. They began then to be very impatient, and desired to have their cannon and sails restored, that they might return home; but the governor had recourse to new artifices, and, by a series of false promises, endeavoured to hinder them from making use of the season proper for that voyage.\n\nThe Japanese, however, soon perceived his design; and at length, by a bold attempt, accomplished what by fair means and humble entreaty they could not obtain; for, by a daring and well concerted effort, they took him prisoner, and made him and one of the council sign a treaty for securing their liberty, free departure, and indemnity, which was afterwards ratified by the whole council. Nuyts was first confined in Batavia, and afterwards delivered up to the Japanese, notwithstanding the most earnest entreaties on his part to be tried, and even to suffer any kind of death where he was, rather than to be sent to Japan. He was sent there, however, in 1634. He was submitted to the mercy or discretion of the emperor; and the consequence was, that, though imprisoned, he was well used, and could go anywhere, provided his guards were with him, which was more than he could possibly have expected. He now looked for nothing but the continuance of his confinement for life. On a particular occasion, however, i.e., at the funeral of the emperor's father, at the request of the Dutch he was set free, and returned again to Batavia, to the surprize of that people, who, however, adopted ever after a very different conduct with respect to the Japanese.","sp":108,"ep":109},{"h":"OAK","t":"in Botany.

See AVENA, BOTANY Index.\n\nMr Bruce gives the following account of the oats which he found growing wild in Arooifi, a small territory in Abyssinia, not far from the source of the Nile:\n\n\"Wild oats (says he) grow up here spontaneously to a prodigious height and size, capable often of concealing both the horse and his rider, and some of the stalks being little else than an inch in circumference.

Indeed no serious and reflecting soul, whether he admits the truth of revelation or not, can look upon swearing on trivial occasions as anything else than a sin of a very heinous nature. To call upon that infinite and omnipresent Being, who created and sustains the universe, to witness all the impertinence of idle conversation, of which great part is commonly uttered at random, betrays a spirit so profane, that nothing short of experience could make us believe it possible for a creature endowed with reason and reflection to be habitually guilty of a practice so impious. No man can plead in extenuation of this crime, that he is tempted to swear by the importunity of any appetite or passion implanted in the human breast: for the utterance of a profane oath communicates no pleasure and removes no uneasiness: it neither elevates the speaker nor depresses the hearer.\n\nQuakers and Moravians, swayed by these considerations, and by the sense which they put upon certain texts of Scripture, refuse to swear upon any occasion, even at the requisition of a magistrate, and in a court of justice. These scruples are groundless; and seem to proceed from an incapacity to distinguish between the proper use and abuse of swearing. It is unquestionably impious to call upon God to witness impieties, or to use his tremendous name as a mere expletive in conversation; but it by no means follows, that we may not piously call upon him to witness truths of importance, or invoke his name with reverence and solemnity. No individual could, without gross profaneness, pray for a thousand times more wealth than he may ever have occasion to use; but it was never thought profane to pray \"day by day for our daily bread, for rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons.\" If it be lawful to ask of God these earthly blessings, because he alone can bestow them; it cannot surely be unlawful, where the lives or properties of our\n\n(A) The word oath is a corruption of the Saxon eoth. It is often in England called a corporal oath, because, in the days of popery, the person was sworn over the host or corpus Christi.\n\n(B) The various oaths required by different nations at different times, and the various forms, &c., of imposing them, is a subject of very considerable extent and curiosity: An account of them does not fall within the plan of the present article; it would indeed extend it to an undue length; we cannot, however, omit observing, what is doubtless very remarkable, that the grand impostor Mahomet taught the Moors, that their oaths might be dissolved. This wonderful doctrine is contained in the 66th chapter of the Koran; which, to free himself from his promise and oath to Hafsa his spouse, he pretended was revealed. What the use of oaths is in such circumstances, or what security they afford for performance, it is difficult to ascertain.\n\nIt is also very remarkable, that an oath respecting marriages was the cause of the first divorce at Rome. The circumstance happened about the year of the city 525, Posthumius Albinus and Spurius Carvilius being consuls. The censors of this year observing the population declining, and imagining it proceeded from interested marriages and promiscuous cohabitation, obliged all the citizens to swear, that they would not marry with any other view than that of peopling the republic. It raised, however, many scruples, and occasioned many domestic ruptures. Among the rest, one Carvilius Ruga, a man of distinction, imagined that he was bound by his oath to divorce his wife, whom he passionately loved, because she was barren, which was the first instance of a divorce at Rome from its foundation, though the marriage laws of the kings allowed it; it afterwards, however, became shamefully frequent. This is also a striking instance of the great attention paid to oaths among the Romans; it is remarked indeed by all writers, that they paid a most profound respect to them; and on that we know they founded their hopes of success in war.\nOath.\n\nOur neighbours, or the security of government is concerned, to invoke him with reverence to witness the truth of our assertions, or the sincerity of our intentions; because of our truth in many cases, and of our sincerity in all, none but he can be the witness.\n\nThe text of Scripture upon which the Quakers chiefly rest their argument for the unlawfulness of all swearing under the gospel, is our Saviour's prohibition (Mat. v. 34): \"I say unto you, swear not at all.\" But whoever shall take the trouble of turning over his Bible, and looking at the context, will perceive, that it is only in ordinary conversation, and by no means in courts of justice, that our Lord prohibits his followers from swearing at all. There is no evidence whatever, that swearing by heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, or by their own heads, was the form of a judicial oath in use among the Jews. On the contrary, we are told by Maimonides*, that \"if any man swear by heaven, or by earth, yet this is not an oath;\" which surely he could not have said, had such been the forms of judicial swearing. Indeed they could not have admitted such forms into their courts without expressly violating the law of Moses, who commands them to \"Fear the Lord (Jehovah) their God, to serve him, and to swear by his name.\" But the Jews, as everyone knows, had such a reverence for the name Jehovah, that they would not pronounce it on flight occasions, and therefore could not swear by that name in common conversation. Hence, to gratify their propensity to common swearing, they invented such oaths as, by heaven, by earth, by Jerusalem, by the life of thy head, &c. and by this contrivance they thought to avoid the guilt of profaning the name Jehovah. These, however, being appeals to intangible objects, either had no meaning, or were in fact, as our Saviour justly argues, oaths by that God whose creatures they were; so that the Jew who swore them was still guilty of profaneness towards the very Jehovah whose name his superstition would not permit him to pronounce. But what puts it beyond all doubt that the use of judicial oaths is not wholly prohibited in the gospel, is the conduct of our Saviour himself as well as of his apostle St Paul. When Jesus was simply asked by the high priest, what it was which certain false witnesses testified against him? we are told by the evangelists, that \"he held his peace:\" but being adjured by the living God to declare whether he was the Christ, the Son of God, or not, he immediately answered the high priest, without objecting to the oath (for such it was) upon which he was examined. \"St Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans +, Moral Philosophy.\n\nPaley says, 'God is my witness,' that, without ceasing, I make mention of you in my prayers;\" and to the Corinthians, still more strongly, \"I call God for a record upon my soul, that, to spare you, I came not as yet to Corinth.\" Both these expressions are of the nature of oaths; and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the custom of swearing judicially without any mark of censure or disapprobation: \"Men verily swear by the greater; and an oath, for confirmation, is to them an end of all strife.\"\n\nBut though a nation has an undoubted right to require the security of an oath upon occasions of real importance, we do not hesitate to say, that, in our opinion, it is something worse than bad policy to multiply oaths, and to hold out to the people temptations to perjure themselves. The security which an oath affords, depends entirely upon the reverence which attaches to it in the mind of him by whom it is given; but that reverence is much weakened by the frequency of oaths, and by the careless manner in which they are too often administered. An excellent moralist + observes, with Mr Paley, truth, that \"the levity and frequency with which oaths are administered, has brought about a general inadversity to the obligation of them, which both in a religious and political view is much to be lamented; and it merits (continues he) public consideration, whether the requiring of oaths on so many frivolous occasions, especially in the customs, and in the qualification for petty offices, has any other effect than to make them cheap in the minds of the people. A pound of tea cannot travel regularly from the ship to the consumer without coining half a dozen oaths at least; and the same facility for the due discharge of his office, namely that of an oath, is required from a church warden and an archbishop, from a petty constable and the chief justice of England. Let the law continue its own functions, if they be thought requisite; but let it spare the solemnity of an oath: and where it is necessary, from the want of something better to depend upon, to accept a man's own word or own account, let it annex to prevarication penalties proportioned to the public consequence of the offence.\"\n\nThat these pernicious consequences of frequent oaths are not felt only in England, we have the evidence of another respectable writer, whose acuteness well qualified him to observe, whilst his station in society furnished him with the best opportunities of observing, the effects of repeated swearing upon the morals of Scotchmen. \"Cuffonhouse oaths (says Lord Kames)* Sketcher have become so familiar among us, as to be swallowed of the Hi without a wry face; and is it certain that bribery and forgery of perjury in electing parliament members are not approaching to the same cool state? Men creep on to vice by degrees. Perjury, in order to support a friend, has become customary of late years; witness fictitious qualifications in the electors of parliament-men, which are made effectual by perjury: yet such is the degeneracy of the present times, that no man is the worse thought of upon that account. We must not flatter ourselves, that the poison will reach no farther: a man who boggles not at perjury to serve a friend, will in time become such an adept, as to commit perjury in order to ruin a friend when he becomes an enemy.\"\n\nBesides the frequency of oaths, we have mentioned the irreverent manner in which they are too often administered as one of the causes which make them cheap in the estimation of the people. In this view, the form of the oath, and the ceremonies with which it is required to be taken, are of considerable importance. \"The forms of oaths in Christian countries (says Mr Paley) are very different; but in none I believe worse contrived either to convey the meaning, or to impress the obligation of an oath, than in England. In that country the juror, after repeating the promise or affirmation which the oath is intended to confirm, adds, 'to help me God;' or more frequently the substance of the oath is repeated to the juror by the officer or magistrate who administers it; adding in the conclusion, 'to help you God.' The energy of the sentence resides in the particle...\"\nparticle fo; fo, i.e. hac lege, 'upon condition of my speaking the truth, or performing this promise, may God help me, and not otherwise.' The juror, whilst he hears or repeats the words of the oath, holds his right hand upon a Bible, or other book containing the four gospels. The conclusion of the oath sometimes runs, 'ita me Deus adjuvet, et hoc sancta evangelia,' or 'to help me God, and the contents of this book;' which last clause forms a connexion between the words and action of the juror, which before was wanting. The juror then kisses the book.\"\n\nThis obscure and elliptical form, the excellent author justly observes, is ill calculated to impress the juror with reverence; and he seems to think great preference due to the form of judicial oaths in Scotland. In that country the juror holds up his right hand towards heaven, and swears by Almighty God, and as he shall answer to God at the great day of judgement, \"that he will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so far as he knows, or it shall be asked of him.\" This, if administered with dignity and reverence, is an oath sufficiently solemn and well calculated to have the proper effect upon the mind of the juror, as it brings immediately into his view the Author of his being, and the awful day of final retribution when every man shall receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil. But when the magistrate, as is too often the case, repeats this solemn invocation without rising from his seat at the name of the Supreme Being, and in a tone of carelessness which may convey to the ignorant juror an opinion that he has himself no serious belief that there ever will be a great day of judgement, the form, however excellent, makes not its full impression.\n\nBut let us suppose the oath to be administered with the greatest dignity and reverence, the words of the promise itself appear to us by no means unexceptionable. In a trial on life and death, we should be glad to know what this oath binds the witness to declare. Is he to tell all that he knows touching the matter in question? or only all that shall be asked of him? If he be obliged, in virtue of his oath, to tell all that he knows, the clause\u2014\"or it shall be asked of you\" is superfluous, and calculated to mislead. If he be bound to tell nothing more of the truth than what shall be asked of him, the word or should be changed into and; he should swear \"to tell the truth, &c. so far as he knows, and it shall be asked of him.\" The court, we believe, considers the witness as bound to declare everything which he knows touching the matter in question. The greater part of witnesses, on the other hand, consider themselves as bound no farther by their oath than to give true answers to such questions as shall be asked of them. They would do well, however, to remember that as oaths are designed for the security of the public, they must be interpreted in the sense in which the public intends them, otherwise they afford no security. But the sense of the public is the law; and as it belongs to the court to declare what the mind of the law is, the witness, who has any doubt concerning the extent of the obligation imposed on him by the words of this oath, should apply to the court for a solution of that doubt, which will be a safe guide to him respecting the evidence which he is to give. Should the court, in resolving the doubts of a witness, give an opinion concerning the sense of any other part of the oath contrary to what he apprehends to be the design of the law in imposing it, he is bound to disregard such opinion; because it is only where he himself is doubtful that the court has a right to interfere, and because in all moral questions men must be finally determined by their own judgement and conscience.\n\nThere is one case, and but one, in which, whatever sense be put upon the words of the oath, no witness is obliged to declare the whole truth. It is when such declaration would tend to accuse himself of some legal crime; for as the laws of Scotland and England constrain no man to become his own accuser, they must be considered as imposing the oath of testimony with this tacit reservation. The exception, however, must be confined to legal crimes. A point of honour, Moral Pride of delicacy, or of reputation, may make a witness back-lost, ward to disclose some circumstance with which he is acquainted; but is no excuse for concealment, unless it could be shown, that the law which imposes the oath, intended to allow this indulgence to such motives. The exception is also withdrawn by compact between the magistrate and the witness, when an accomplice is admitted to give evidence against the partners of his crime.\" But these are a fort of witnesses to whom a sensible jury will always listen with a very cautious ear.\n\nOaths are either affirmary or promissory. Affirmatory oaths are required both to confirm our veracity in evidence, and to give security to the public that we believe certain propositions conceived to be of public importance. An oath in evidence binds the juror to declare what he knows to be true, and nothing but what he knows to be true. An oath required to assure the public of our belief in the truth of any proposition, cannot, without the guilt of perjury, be taken by any man, who, at the time of swearing, has the slightest doubt whether the proposition be really true. Such an oath, however, though it unquestionably requires the sincerity of the juror's belief at the time when it is given, cannot oblige him to continue in that belief as long as he may live; for belief is not in any man's power: it is the necessary consequence of evidence, which compels the assent of the mind according as it appears to preponderate on the one side or on the other. No man, therefore, can be justly accused of perjury for holding opinions contrary to those which he may formerly have sworn to believe; because his belief at the time of emitting his oath may have been the necessary result of the evidence which then appeared before him; and his change of opinion may have resulted with the same necessity from superior evidence which had been since thrown into the opposite scale, and made it preponderate. On this account, we cannot help thinking, that all affirmatory oaths, except such as are necessary to confirm testimony respecting facts, ought either to be abolished or expressed with great caution. Of truths intuitively certain or capable of rigid demonstration, no man of common sense can entertain a doubt; and therefore the public never requires from individuals the solemnity of an oath as an assurance of their believing such truths. But with respect to the truth of propositions which admit of nothing superior to moral evidence on either side, a man of the most\nsteady virtue may think differently at different periods of his life; and in such cases, the effect of an oath, if it have any effect, can only be either, to shut the man's eyes against the light, or to make his integrity be carelessly questioned by those who shall observe his change of belief.\n\nPromissory oaths cannot, without the guilt of perjury, be given by him, who, at the time of swearing, knows that it will not be in his power to fulfil the promise, or who does not seriously intend to fulfil it. A promissory oath cannot, without great guilt, be given by any man, who at the time of swearing believes the object of the promise to be in itself unlawful; for if he seriously mean to fulfil his oath, he calls upon Almighty God to witness his intention to commit a crime. Promissory oaths give to the public greater security than a simple promise; because the juror having the thoughts of God and of religion more upon his mind at the same time than at the other, offends with a higher hand, and in more open contempt of the divine power, knowledge, and justice, when he violates an oath, than when he breaks a promise. Yet it is certain that promissory oaths, though more solemn and sacred, cannot be binding, when the promise without an oath would not be so in an inferior degree; for the several cases of which, see Promise and Allegiance.\n\nCoronation Oath.

But the presence of the ark not only created no temporal misfortune to the family of this Levite, but, on the contrary, the Lord heaped upon him all sorts of blessings; which encouraged David some months after to remove it to the place he had appointed for it.

The chief are,\n\nAn armillary zodiacal sphere of six feet diameter; an equinoctial sphere of six feet diameter; an azimuthal horizon of six feet diameter; a large quadrant five feet radius; a sextant eight feet radius; and a celestial globe five feet diameter.\n\nObservatories, as they are very useful, and indeed absolutely necessary for astronomers, so they have become far more common than they were. There is a very excellent one now at Oxford, built by the trustees of Dr Radcliffe, at the expense of nearly 30,000l. At Cambridge there is as yet no public observatory. Over the great gate of Trinity college, indeed, there is one which is called Sir Isaac Newton's, because this great philosopher had used it; but it is gone to decay. It were well if the university would repair and preserve it in memory of that truly great man. In St John's, too, there is a small one. The late ingenious Mr Cotes had used to give lectures in Sir Isaac Newton's on experimental philosophy. In Scotland there is an observatory at Glasgow belonging to the university: there is one erected on the Calton hill at Edinburgh; but it is in very bad repair, (see Edinburgh); and there is an excellent one at Dublin.\n\n5. Bramins observatory at Benares. Of this Sir Robert Barker gives the following account, (Phil. Trans. CCCLXX. vol. lxvii. p. 598.). \"Benares in the East Indies, one of the principal seminaries of the Bramins or priests of the original Gentooos of Hindostan, continues still to be the place of resort of that sect of people; and there are many public charities, hospitals, and pagodas, where some thousands of them now reside. Having frequently heard that the ancient Bramins had a knowledge of astronomy, and being confirmed in this by their information of an approaching eclipse both of the sun and moon, I made inquiry, when at that place in the year 1772, among the principal Bramins, to endeavour to get some information relative to the manner in which they were acquainted of an approaching eclipse. The most intelligent that I could meet with, however, gave me but little satisfaction. I was told, that these matters were confined to a few, who were in possession of certain books and records; some containing the mysteries of their religion; and others the tables of astronomical observations, written in the Sanscrit language, which few understood but themselves: that they would take me to a place which had been constructed for the purpose of making such observations as I was inquiring after, and from whence they supposed the learned Bramins made theirs. I was then conducted to an ancient building of stone, the lower part of which, in its present situation, was converted into a stable for horses, and a receptacle for lumber; but by the number of court-yards and apartments, it appeared that it must once have been an edifice for the use of some public body of people. We entered this building, and went up a staircase to the top of a part of it, near to the river Ganges, that led to a large terrace, where, to my surprise and satisfaction, I saw a number of instruments yet remaining, in the greatest preservation, stupendously large, immovable from the spot, and built of stone, some of them being upwards of 20 feet in height; and although they are said to have been erected 200 years ago, the graduations and divisions on the several arcs appeared as well cut, and as accurately divided, as if they had been the performance of a modern artist. The execution in the construction of these instruments exhibited a mathematical exactness in the fixing, bearing, fitting of the several parts, in the necessary and sufficient supports to the very large stones that composed them, and in the joining and fastening each into the other by means of lead and iron.\n\n\"The situation of the two large quadrants of the instrument marked A in the plate, whose radius is nine feet two inches, by their being at right angles with the gnomon...\"\ngnomons at twenty-five degrees elevation, are thrown into such an oblique situation as to render them the most difficult, not only to construct of such a magnitude, but to secure in their position for so long a period, and affords a striking instance of the ability of the architect in their construction: for by the shadow of the gnomon thrown on the quadrants, they do not appear to have altered in the least from their original position; and so true is the line of the gnomon, that, by applying the eye to a small iron ring of an inch diameter at one end, the sight is carried through three others of the same dimension, to the extremity at the other end, distant 38 feet 8 inches, without obstruction; such is the firmness and art with which this instrument has been executed. This performance is the more wonderful and extraordinary, when compared with the works of the artificers of Hindoostan at this day, who are not under the immediate direction of an European mechanic; but arts appear to have declined equally with science in the east.\n\n\" Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell, at that time chief engineer in the East India Company's service at Bengal, made a perspective drawing of the whole of the apparatus that could be brought within his eye at one view; but I lament he could not represent some very large quadrants, whose radii were about 20 feet, they being on the side from whence he took his drawing. Their description, however, is, that they are exact quarters of circles of different radii, the largest of which I judged to be 20 feet, constructed very exactly on the sides of stone walls, built perpendicular, and situated, I suppose, in the meridian of the place: a brass pin is fixed at the centre or angle of the quadrant, from whence, the Bramin informed me, they stretched a wire to the circumference when an observation was to be made; from which, it occurred to me, the observer must have moved his eye up or down the circumference, by means of a ladder or some such contrivance, to raise and lower himself, until he had discovered the altitude of any of the heavenly bodies in their passage over the meridian, so expressed on the arcs of these quadrants: these arcs were very exactly divided into nine large sections; each of which again into ten, making ninety lesser divisions or degrees; and those also into twenty, expressing three minutes each, of about two-tenths of an inch at sundown; so that it is probable they had some method of dividing even these into more minute divisions at the time of observation.\n\n\"My time would only permit me to take down the particular dimensions of the most capital instrument, or the greater equinoctial sun dial, represented by figure A, which appears to be an instrument to express solar time by the shadow of a gnomon upon two quadrants, one situated to the east, and the other to the west of it; and indeed the chief part of their instruments at this place appear to be constructed for the same purpose, except the quadrants, and a brass instrument that will be described hereafter.\n\n\"Figure B is another instrument for the purpose of determining the exact hour of the day by the shadow of a gnomon, which stands perpendicular to, and in the centre of, a flat circular stone, supported in an oblique situation by means of four upright stones and a cross piece; so that the shadow of the gnomon, which is a perpendicular iron rod, is thrown upon the division of the circle described on the face of the flat circular stone.\n\n\"Figure C is a brass circle, about two feet diameter, moving vertically upon two pivots between two stone pillars, having an index or hand turning round horizontally on the centre of this circle, which is divided into 360 parts; but there are no counter divisions on the index to subdivide those on the circle. This instrument appears to be made for taking the angle of a star at setting or rising, or for taking the azimuth or amplitude of the sun at rising or setting.\n\n\"The use of the instrument, figure D, I was at a loss to account for. It consists of two circular walls; the outer of which is about forty feet diameter, and eight feet high; the wall within about half that height, and appears intended for a place to stand on to observe the divisions on the upper circle of the outer wall, rather than for any other purpose; and yet both circles are divided into 360 degrees, each degree being subdivided into twenty lesser divisions, the same as the quadrants. There is a door-way to pass into the inner circle, and a pillar in the centre, of the same height with the lower circle, having a hole in it, being the centre of both circles, and seems to be a socket for an iron rod to be placed perpendicular into it. The divisions on these, as well as all the other instruments, will bear a nice examination with a pair of compasses.\n\n\"Figure E is a smaller equinoctial sun dial, constructed upon the same principle as the large one A.\n\n\"I cannot quit this subject without observing, that the Bramins, without the assistance of optical glasses, had nevertheless an advantage unexperienced by the observers of the more northern climates. The serenity and clearness of the atmosphere in the nighttime in the East Indies, except at the seasons of the monsoons or periodical winds changing, is difficult to express to those who have not seen it, because we have nothing in comparison to form our ideas upon: it is clear to perfection, a total quietude subsists, scarcely a cloud to be seen, and the light of the heavens, by the numerous appearance of the stars, affords a prospect both of wonder and contemplation.\n\n\"This observatory at Benares is said to have been built by the order of the emperor Akbar: for as this wise prince endeavoured to improve the arts, so he wished also to recover the sciences of Hindoostan, and therefore directed that three such places should be erected; one at Delhi, another at Agra, and the third at Benares.\"\n\nOBSIDIANUS Lapis, or Obsidian, a mineral substance.

This is the true ground and foundation of all Property, or of holding those things in sevralty, which by the law of nature, unqualified by that of society, were common to all mankind. But, when once it was agreed that every thing capable of ownership should have an owner, natural reason suggested, that he who could first declare his intention of appropriating anything to his use, and, in consequence of such his intention, actually took it into possession, should thereby gain the absolute property of it; according to that rule of the law of nations, recognized by the laws of Rome, Quod nullius est, id ratione naturali occupanti conceditur.\n\nThis right of occupancy, so far as it concerns real property, hath been confined by the laws of England within a very narrow compass; and was extended only to a single instance; namely, where a man was tenant pour autre vie, or had an estate granted to himself only (without mentioning his heirs) for the life of another man, and died during the life of celui que vive, or him by whose life it was holden: in this case he that could first enter on the land, might lawfully retain the possession so long as celui que vive lived, by right of occupancy.\n\nThis seems to have been recurring to first principles, and calling in the law of nature to ascertain the property of the land, when left without a legal owner. For it did not revert to the grantor, who had parted with all his interest, so long as celui que vive lived; it did not descend to the lord of the fee; for all estates must be of the absolute entire fee, and not of any particular estate carved out of it, much less of so minute a remnant as this: it did not belong to the grantee; for he was dead; it did not descend to his heirs; for there were no words of inheritance in the grant: nor could it vest in his executors; for no executors could succeed to a freehold. Belonging therefore to nobody, like the hereditas jacea of the Romans, the law left it open to be seized and appropriated by the first person that could enter upon it, during the life of celui que vive, under the name of an occupant. But there was no right of occupancy allowed, where the king had the reversion of the lands; for the reversee hath an equal right with any other man to enter upon the vacant possession; and where the king's title and a subject's interfere, the king's shall always be preferred. Against the king therefore there could be no prior occupant, because nullum tempus occurrit regi. And, even in the case of a subject, had the estate pour autre vie granted to a man and his heirs during the life of celui que vive, there the heir might, and still may, enter and hold possession, and is called in law a special occupant; as having a special exclusive right, by the terms of the original grant, to enter upon and occupy this hereditas jacea, during the residue of the estate granted; though some have thought him so called with no very great propriety; and that such estate is rather a defeasible freehold. But the title of common occupancy is now reduced almost to nothing by two statutes; the one, 29 Car. II. c. 3. which enacts, that where there is no special occupant, in whom the estate may vest, the tenant pour autre vie may devise it by will, or it shall go to the executors, and be affects in their hands for payment of debts: the other that of 14 Geo. II. c. 20. which enacts, that it shall vest not only in the executors, but, in case the tenant dies intestate, in the administrators also; and go in course of a distribution like a chattel interest.\n\nBy these two statutes the title of common occupancy is utterly extinct and abolished: though that of special occupancy, by the heir at law, continues to this day; such heir\nOccupancy heir being held to succeed to the ancestor's estate, not by descent, for then he must take an estate of inheritance, but as an occupant, specially marked out and appointed by the original grant. The doctrine of common occupancy may, however, be usefully remembered on the following account, amongst others: That, as by the common law no occupancy could be of incorporeal hereditaments, as of rents, tithes, advowsons, commons, or the like, (because, with respect to them, there could be no actual entry made, or corporal seisin had;) and therefore by the death of the grantee pour autre vie a grant of such hereditaments was entirely determined): to now, it is apprehended, notwithstanding those statutes, such grant would be determined likewise; and the hereditaments could not be devisable, nor vest in the executors, nor go in a course of distribution. For the statutes must not be construed so as to create any new estate, or to keep that alive which by the common law was determined, and thereby to defeat the grantor's reversion; but merely to dispose of an interest in being, to which by law there was no owner, and which therefore was left open to the first occupant. When there is a residue left, the statutes give it to the executors, &c. instead of the first occupant; but they will not create a residue on purpose to give it to the executors. They only mean to provide an appointed instead of a casual, a certain instead of an uncertain, owner, of lands which before were nobody's; and thereby to supply this defectum universus, and render the disposition of the law in all respects entirely uniform; this being the only instance wherein a title to a real estate could ever be acquired by occupancy.\n\nFor there can be no other case devised, wherein there is not some owner of the land appointed by the law. In the case of a sole corporation, as a parson of a church, when he dies or resigns, though there be no actual owner of the land till a successor be appointed, yet there is a legal, potential, ownership, subsisting in contemplation of law; and when the successor is appointed, his appointment shall have a retrospect and relation backwards, so as to entitle him to all the profits from the instant that the vacancy commenced. And, in all other instances, when the tenant dies intestate, and no other owner of the lands is to be found in the common course of descents, there the law vests an ownership in the king, or in the subordinate lord of the fee, by escheat.\n\nSo also, in some cases, where the laws of other nations give a right by occupancy, as in lands newly created, by the rising of an island in a river, or by the alluvion or dereliction of the sea; in these instances, the law of England affirms them an immediate owner. For Bracken tells us, that if an island arise in the middle of a river, it belongs in common to those who have lands on each side thereof; but if it be nearer to one bank than the other, it belongs only to him who is proprietor of the nearest shore: which is agreeable to, and probably copied from, the civil law. Yet this seems only to be reasonable, where the soil of the river is equally divided between the owners of the opposite shores: for if the whole soil is the freehold of any one man, as it must be whenever a several fishery is claimed, there it seems just (and so is the usual practice) that the islets, or little islands, arising in any part of the river, shall be the property of him who oweth the pircary and the soil. However, in case a new island rise in the sea, though the civil law gives it to the first occupant, yet our's gives it occupancy to the king. And as to lands gained from the sea; either by alluvion, by the washing up of sand and earth, so as in time to make terra firma; or by dereliction, as when the sea shrinks back below the usual water mark; in these cases the law is held to be, that if this gain be by little and little, by small and imperceptible degrees, it shall go to the owner of the land adjoining.\n\nFor de minimis non curat lex: and besides, these owners being often losers by the breaking in of the sea, or at charges to keep it out, this possible gain is therefore a reciprocal consideration for such possible charge or loss. But if the alluvion or dereliction be sudden and considerable, in this case it belongs to the king: for, as the king is lord of the sea, and so owner of the soil while it is covered with water, it is but reasonable he should have the soil when the water has left it dry. So that the quantity of ground gained, and the time during which it is gained, are what make it either the king's or the subject's property. In the same manner, if a river, running between two lordships, by degrees gains upon the one, and thereby leaves the other dry; the owner who loses his ground thus imperceptibly has no remedy: but if the course of the river be changed by a sudden and violent flood, or other hasty means, and thereby a man loses his grounds, he shall have what the river has left in any other place as recompense for this sudden loss. And this law of alluvions and derelictions, with regard to rivers, is nearly the same in the imperial law; from whence indeed those our determinations seem to have been drawn and adopted: but we ourselves, as islanders, have applied them to marine increases; and have given our sovereign the prerogative he enjoys, as well upon the particular reasons before mentioned, as upon this other general ground of prerogative, which was formerly remarked, that whatever hath no other owner is vested by law in the king.

When the sacrifice was made on the sea shore, the blood of the victim was received in a vessel; but when it was in open sea, they permitted the blood to run down into the waters.

This affront was highly resented by her brother; and though Octavia endeavoured to pacify him by palliating Antony's behaviour, yet he resolved to revenge her cause by arms. After the battle of Actium and the death of Antony, Octavia, forgetful of her own injuries, took into her house all the children of her husband, and treated them with extraordinary tenderness. Marcellus, her son by her first husband, was married to a niece of Augustus, and openly intended as a successor to his uncle. His sudden death plunged all the family into the greatest grief. Virgil, whom Augustus patronized, undertook of himself to pay a melancholy tribute to the memory of a young man whom Rome had looked upon as her future father and patron. He was desired to repeat his composition in the presence of the emperor and his sister. Octavia burst into tears even when the poet began; but when he mentioned Tu Marcellus eris, she swooned away. This tender and pathetic encomium upon the merit and the virtues of young Marcellus she liberally rewarded; and Virgil received 10,000 sesterces, according to some 78L. 2s. 6d. for every one of the verses. Octavia had two daughters by Antony, Antonia Major and Antonia Minor.\u2014The elder married L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, by whom she had Cn. Domitius, who was the father of the emperor Nero by Agrippina the daughter of Germanicus. Antonia Minor, who was as virtuous and as beautiful as her mother, married Drusus the son of Tiberius, by whom she had Germanicus, and Claudius who reigned before Nero.\n\nThe death of Marcellus constantly preyed upon the mind of Octavia, who died of grief or melancholy, about 11 years before the Christian era. Her brother paid great regard to her memory, and pronounced her funeral oration himself. The Roman people also showed their regard to her virtues, by willing to pay her divine honours.\u2014A daughter of the emperor Claudius by Messalina. She was betrothed to Silanus, but by the intrigues of Agrippina, she was married to the emperor Nero in the 16th year of her age. She was soon after divorced under pretence of barrenness; and the emperor married Poppea, who exercised her enmity upon Octavia by procuring her to be banished into Campania. She was afterwards recalled by the people; but Poppea, who was determined on her ruin, caused her again to be banished to an island, where she was ordered to kill herself by opening her veins. Her head was cut off and carried to Poppea.\n\nOctavianus, or Octavius Caesar, was nephew of Julius Caesar the dictator, being the son of Accia his sister by Octavius a senator, and afterwards became the second emperor of Rome. He was born in the year of the city 691, during the consulship of Cicero. His uncle Julius Caesar adopted him, and left him the greatest part of his fortune. When he was but 20 years of age, he was raised to the consulship. His youth and inexperience were ridiculed by his enemies; notwithstanding which obstacle, his prudence and valour raised his consequence. He made war against his opponents on pretence of avenging the assassination of his uncle. He engaged in five civil wars with great success, viz. The wars of Mutina, Perusia, Philippi, Sicily, and Actium; the first and last of which were against M. Antony; the second against L. Antony, brother of the triumvir; the third was against Brutus and Cassius; and the fourth against Sext. Pompey, son of Pompey the Great. He united his forces with Antony's at the battle of Philippi; and had he not been supported by the activity and bravery of his colleague, he would doubtless have been totally ruined in that engagement. In this triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus, he obtained the western parts of the Roman empire; and, like his other colleagues, more firmly to establish his power, he proscribed his enemies and cut them off. The triumvirate lasted for 10 years. He had given his sister Octavia in marriage to Antony, to make their alliance more lasting; but when Cleopatra had charmed this unfortunate man, Octavia was repudiated. Augustus immediately took up arms to avenge the wrongs of his sister; but perhaps more eager to remove a man whose power and existence kept him in continual fear and constant dependence. Both parties met at Actium to decide the fate of Rome. Antony was supported by all the power of the east, and Augustus by Italy. Cleopatra fled from the battle with 60 ships; and her flight ruined the interest of Antony, who followed her into Egypt. The conqueror soon after went into Egypt likewise, besieged Alexandria, and honoured with a magnificent funeral his unfortunate colleague and the celebrated queen, whom the fear of being led in the victor's triumph at Rome had driven to commit suicide. After he had established peace all over the world, he shut the gates of the temple of Janus, A.U.C. 753. He was twice determined to lay down the supreme power and\nOctavianus immediately after the victory obtained over Antony, and on account of his ill health; but his two faithful friends Mecenas and Agrippa dissuaded him, and contended, that if he did he would leave it to be the prey of the most powerful, and expose himself to the greatest dangers. He died at Nola in the 76th year of his age, after he had held the sovereign power for 57 years.\u2014He was an active emperor, and consulted the good of the Romans with the greatest anxiety and care. He visited all the provinces except Africa and Sardinia, and his consummate prudence and experience occasioned many salutary laws. He is, however, accused of licentiousness and adultery; but the goodness of his heart, the fidelity of his friendship, and the many good qualities which the poets whom he patronized have perhaps truly celebrated, made some, though in the eye of strict religion and true morality but little, amends for his natural foibles. He was ambitious of being esteemed handsome; and as he was publicly reported to be the son of Apollo according to his mother's declaration, he wished his flatterers to represent him with the figure and attributes of that god. Like Apollo, his eyes were clear, and he affected to have it thought that they possessed some divine irradiation, and was well pleased if, when he fixed his eyes upon any body, they held down their eyes as if overcome by the glaring brightness of the sun. He distinguished himself by his learning; he was a complete master of the Greek language, and wrote some tragedies, besides memoirs of his life and other works, which are now lost. He married four times; but he was unhappy in all these connexions; and his only daughter Julia disgraced herself and her father by the debauchery and licentiousness of her manners. He recommended at his death his adopted son Tiberius as his successor. He left his fortune partly to him and to Drusus, and made donations to the army and Roman people. The title of Augustus was conferred upon him by the senate after the battle of Actium and the final destruction of the Roman republic. The title continued afterwards, being given to his successors in the empire. Virgil is said to have written his \u00c6neid at the desire of Augustus, whom he represents under the amiable and perfect character of \u00c6neas.

However, it was taken by the Ruffians in 1737, and all those that resisted were put to the sword. The Ruffians themselves lost 18,000 men in the assault. The Turks returned the same year with 70,000 men to retake it; but were obliged to retire, after the loss of 20,000. In 1738, the Ruffians withdrew their garrison, and demolished the fortifications. It is seated on the river Bog, to the west of the Nieper, or rather where they both unite and fall into the Black sea. It is 42 miles south-west of Bialagrod, and 190 north by east of Constantinople. It has been lately a subject of great contest between the Ruffians and Turks. The affair is fresh in our readers memories; but the following more particular account of the place, will not, we trust, be unacceptable to our readers.\u2014It is called by the Turks Dzaim Crimenda, is seated at the influx of the Nieper into the Black sea, 120 miles from Bender, to the south-east.

Here is no port, but good anchorage. It is defended by a castle, surrounded with walls 25 feet high; those of the town are much lower. There are about 2,000 people at Oczakow. Below the castle are two towns or suburbs, situated on the declivity of a hill, which on the other side has nothing but precipices. To the south of these towns is another small castle, where is some artillery to prevent vessels from coming up the river. Here is also a tower, in which are always some Turks upon the watch to discover from afar any of the Cossacks at sea, and give notice of them to the galleys by a signal.

The king of Persia was offended at this liberty of Odenatus, he tore the letter, and ordered the presents that were offered to be thrown into a river, and in order to punish Odenatus, who had the impudence, as he called it, to pay homage to so great a monarch as himself, he commanded him to appear before him, on pain of being devoted to instant destruction with all his family, if he dared to refuse. Odenatus despised this haughty summons of Sapor, and opposed force by force. He obtained some considerable advantages over the troops of the Persian king, and took his wife prisoner, with a great and rich booty. These services were observed with gratitude by the Romans; and Gallienus, the then emperor, named Odenatus as his colleague on the throne, and gave the title of Auguslus to his children, and to his wife the celebrated Zenobia. Odenatus invested with new power, resolved to signalize himself more conspicuously by conquering the barbarians of the north; but his exulting was of short duration: he perished by the dagger of one of his own relations, whom he had slightly offended at a domestic entertainment.

Here the musical prizes were contended for; and here also, according to Aritophanes was a tribunal.\n\nODIN (see Frea), in Mythology, called also in the dialect of the Anglo-Saxons, Woden or Wodan, a name given by the ancient Scythians to their supreme god, and assumed, about 70 years before the Christian era, by Sigge, a Scythian prince, who conquered the northern nations, made great changes in their government, manners, religion, and enjoyed great honours, and had even divine honours paid him. According to the account given of this conqueror by Snorro, the ancient historian of Norway, and his commentator Torlaus, Odin was a Scythian, who withdrew himself, with many others in his train, by flight, from the vengeance of the Romans, under the conduct of Pompey; and having officiated as a priest in his own country, he assumed the direction of the religious worship, as well as the civil government, of the nations which he conquered. Having subdued Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, he retired to Sweden, where he died. There is nothing certain in this account; but it is probable, that the god, whose prophet or priest this Scythian pretended to be, was named Odin, and that the ignorance of succeeding ages confounded the deity with his priest, composing out of the attributes of the one, and the history of the other, the character of the northern conqueror. He deluded the people by his enchantments and skill in magic: having cut off the head of one Mimer, who in his lifetime was in great reputation for wisdom, he caused it to be embalmed, and persuaded the Scandinavians that he had restored it to the use of speech; and he caused it to pronounce whatever oracles he wanted. The Icelandic chronicles represent Odin as the most eloquent and persuasive of men; they ascribe to him the introduction of the art of poetry among the Scandinavians, and likewise the invention of the Runic characters. He had also the address to persuade his followers, that he could run over the world in the twinkling of an eye; that he had the direction of the air and tempests; that he could transform himself into all sorts of shapes, could raise the dead, could foretell things to come, deprive his enemies, by enchantment, of health and vigour, and discover all the treasures concealed in the earth. They add, that by his tender and melodious airs, he could make the plains and mountains open and expand with delight; and that the ghosts, thus attracted, would leave their infernal caverns, and stand motionless about him. Nor was he less dreadful and furious in battle; changing himself into the shape of a bear, a wild bull, or a lion, and amidst ranks of enemies committing the most horrible devastation, without receiving any wound himself.\n\nDr Henry gives this account of him: \"Odin is believed to have been the name of the one true God among the first colonists who came from the east and peopled Germany and Scandinavia, and among their posterity for several ages. But at length a mighty conqueror, the leader of a new army of adventurers from the east, overrun the north of Europe, erected a great empire, assumed the name of Odin, and claimed the honours which had been formerly paid to that deity. From thenceforward this deified mortal, under the name of Odin or Wodin, became the chief object of the idolatrous worship of the Saxons and Danes in this island, as well as of many other nations. Having been a mighty and successful warrior, he was believed to be the god of war, who gave victory, and revived courage in the conflict. Having civilized, in some measure, the countries which he conquered, and introduced arts formerly unknown, he was also worshipped as the god of arts and artists. In a word, to this Odin his deluded worshippers impiously ascribed all the attributes which belong only to the true God: to him they built magnificent temples, offered many sacrifices, and consecrated the fourth day of the week, which is still called by his name in England and in all the other countries where he was formerly worshipped. Notwithstanding all this, the founders of all the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy pretended to be descended from Wodin, and some of them at the distance only of a few generations.\"\n\nODIN'S FIRE.

He assembled his friends, and with the sharp point of a lance he made in his body nine different wounds in the form of a circle; and when expiring he declared that he was going to Scythia, where he should become an immortal god. He added, that he would prepare bliss and felicity for those of his countrymen who lived a virtuous life, who fought with bravery, and who died like heroes in the field of battle. These injunctions had the wished-for effect: his countrymen superstitiously believed him, and constantly recommended themselves to his protection when they engaged in battle; and they entreated him to receive the souls of such as fell in war.\nDe Odio et Atia.

In these dangers his companions, not strictly obeying his orders, perish through their own fault. In the mean time the grandees of his country abuse the freedom which his absence gave them; consume his estate; conspire to destroy his son; endeavour to compel his queen to accept one of them for her husband; and indulge themselves in every species of violence, from a persuasion that he would never return.

It is said he was given by his father to a shepherd, who was ordered to put him to death, in order to prevent the misfortunes with which he was threatened by an oracle. But the shepherd, being unwilling to kill him with his own hands, tied him by the feet to a tree, that he might be devoured by wild beasts. The infant was however found in this situation by another shepherd named Phorbas, who carried him to Polybus, king of Corinth; where the queen, having no children, educated him with as much care as if he had been her own son. When he was grown up, he was informed that he was not the son of Polybus; on which, by order of the oracle, he went to seek for his father in Phocis; but scarce was he arrived in that country, when he met his father on the road, and killed him without knowing him. A short time after, having delivered the country from the monster called the Sphinx, he married Jocasta, without knowing that she was his mother, and had four children by her; but afterwards, being informed of his incest, he quitted the throne, and, thinking himself unworthy of the light, put out his eyes.

Des Marchias reduces the number of houses to 200, in the centre of which stands a large square building, the repository of their gold dust and other commodities. The houses are built of earth and clay, but convenient, and well furnished with chairs, stools, mats, carpets, earthen pots, and even looking glasses, which they purchase from the Europeans. No part of the coast is better provided with all kinds of eatables, which are sent in from the adjacent cantons, and sold in public markets. Everything is bought and sold with gold dust, which is the standard of all other commodities, and brought hither in great abundance from all quarters of Feitu, Abrambo, Affeito, and Mandingo. The gold is sold by weight, and the quantity determined by nice scales, made in the country before it was frequented by the Europeans: a proof that those negroes are not wholly ignorant of the more refined principles of mechanics. Next to gold, the chief commerce of the place consists in the sale of fish, of which they catch prodigious quantities on the coast. Although the natives are brave and warlike, yet in time of peace no people are more industrious, their whole time being employed in catching fish or cultivating the fruits of the earth. They are extremely expert in throwing the line, and fishing by the hook; nor is their intrepidity in combating the elements, and pursuing their employments in all kinds of weather, less astonishing. Every day in the week, except Wednesday, which is sacred to the Fetiches, they employ in their several occupations, and no season of the year is exempted from fishing.

The Hebrews had several kinds of offerings, which they presented at the temple. Some were free-will offerings, and others were of obligation. The first fruits, the tithes, the sin offerings, were of obligation; the peace offerings, vows, offerings of wine, oil, bread, salt, and other things, which were made to the temple or to the ministers of the Lord, were offerings of devotion. The Hebrews called all offerings in general corban. But the offerings of bread, salt, fruits, and liquors, as wine and oil, which were presented to the temple, they called mincha. The sacrifices are not properly offerings, and are not commonly included under that name. See CORBAN and SACRIFICE.\n\nThe offerings of grain, meal, bread, cakes, fruits, wine, salt, and oil, were common in the temple. Sometimes these offerings were alone, and sometimes they accompanied the sacrifices. Honey was never offered with the sacrifices; but it might be offered alone in the quality of first fruits. Now these were the rules that were observed in the presenting of those offerings, called in Hebrew mincha, or kerbon mincha; in the Septuagint, offerings of sacrifice; and the same by St Jerome, oblationem sacrificii; but by our translators, meat offerings (Lev. ii. i., &c.). There were five sorts of these offerings: 1. Fine flour or meal. 2. Cakes of several sorts, baked in an oven. 3. Cakes baked upon a plate. 4. Another sort of cakes, baked upon a gridiron, or plate with holes in it. 5. The first fruits of the new corn, which were offered either pure and without mixture, or roasted or parched in the ear or out of the ear.\n\nThe cakes were kneaded with oil olive, or fried with oil in a pan, or only dipped in oil after they were baked. The bread offered to be presented upon the altar, was to be without leaven; for leaven was never offered upon the altar, nor with the sacrifices. But they might make presents of common bread to the priests and ministers of the temple. See CAKE, &c.\n\nThe offerings now mentioned were appointed on ac-\nOfferings. count of the poorer sort, who could not go to the charge of sacrificing animals. And even those that offered living victims were not excused from giving meal, wine, and salt, which was to go along with the greater sacrifices. And also those that offered only oblations of bread or of meal, offered also oil, incense, salt, and wine, which were in a manner the feasting of it. The priest in waiting received the offerings from the hand of him that offered them; laid a part of them upon the altar, and reserved the rest for his own subsistence: that was his right as a minister of the Lord. Nothing was burnt quite up but the incense, of which the priest kept back nothing for his own share.\n\nWhen an Israelite offered a loaf to the priest, or a whole cake, the priest broke the loaf or the cake into two parts, setting that part aside that he referred to himself, and broke the other into crumbs; poured oil upon it, salt, wine, and incense; and spread the whole upon the fire of the altar. If these offerings be accompanied by an animal for a sacrifice, it was all thrown upon the victim, to be consumed along with it.\n\nIf these offerings were the ears of new corn, either of wheat or barley, these ears were parched at the fire or in the flame, and rubbed in the hand, and then offered to the priest in a vessel; over which he put oil, incense, wine, and salt, and then burnt it upon the altar, first having taken as much of it as of right belonged to himself.\n\nThe greatest part of these offerings were voluntary, and of pure devotion. But when an animal was offered in sacrifice, they were not at liberty to omit these offerings. Everything was to be supplied that was to accompany the sacrifice, and which served as a feasting to the victim. There are some cases in which the law requires only offerings of corn, or bread: for example, when they offered the first fruits of their harvest, whether they were offered solemnly by the whole nation, or by the devotion of private persons.\n\nAs to the quantity of meal, oil, wine, or salt, which was to go along with the sacrifices, we cannot easily see that the law had determined it. Generally the priest threw an handful of meal or crumbs upon the fire of the altar, with wine, oil, and salt in proportion, and all the incense. All the rest belonged to him, the quantity depended upon the liberality of the offerer. We observe in more places than one, that Moses appoints an affaron, or the tenth part of an ephah of meal, for those that had not wherewithal to offer the appointed sin offerings (Lev. v. 11, xiv. 21.). In the solemn offerings of the first fruits for the whole nation, they offered an entire sheaf of corn, a lamb of a year old, two tenths or two affarons of fine meal mixed with oil, and a quarter of an hin of wine for the libation. (Lev. xxiii. 10, 11, 12, &c.).\n\nIn the sacrifice of jealousy (Numb. v. 15.), when a jealous husband accused his wife of infidelity, the husband offered the tenth part of a fatum of barley-meal, without oil or incense, because, it was a sacrifice of jealousy, to discover whether his wife was guilty or not.\n\nThe offerings of the fruits of the earth, of bread, of wine, oil, and salt, are the most ancient of any that have come to our knowledge. Cain offered to the Lord of the fruits of the earth, the first fruits of his labour (Gen. iv. 3, 4.). Abel offered the firstlings of his flocks, and of their fat. The heathen have nothing more ancient in their religion, than these sorts of offerings made to their gods. They offered clean wheat, flour, and bread.\n\nOffice, a particular charge or trust, or a dignity attended with a public function.

Cornaro's Treatise on this subject is known to every body, and needs not be quoted. To some of our readers the following set of resolutions will perhaps be new, and may certainly be useful.\n\nThe old men should resolve, except the reasons for a change be invincible, to live and die in the public profession of the religion in which they were born and bred. To avoid all profane talk and intricate debates on sacred topics. To endeavour to get the better of the intrusions of indolence of mind and body, those certain harbingers of enfeebling age. Rather to wear out, than to rust out. To rise early, and as often as possible to go to bed before midnight. Not to nod in company, nor to indulge repose too frequently on the couch in the day. To waste as little of life in sleep as may be, for we shall have enough in the grave. Not to give up walking; nor to ride on horseback to fatigue. Experience, and a late medical opinion, determine to ride five miles every day: Nothing contributes more to the preservation of appetite, and the prolongation of life. Cheyne's direction to the valetudinary, \"to make exercise a part of their religion,\" to be religiously observed. To continue the practice of reading, pursued for more than fifty years, in books on all subjects; for variety is the salt of the mind as well as of life. Other people's thoughts, like the best conversation of one's companions, are generally better and more agreeable than one's own. Frequently to think over the virtues of one's acquaintance, old and new. To admit every cheerful ray of sunshine on the imagination. To avoid retrospection on a past friendship, which had much of love in it; for memory often comes when she is not invited. To try to think more of the living and less of the dead; for the dead belong to a world of their own. To live within one's income, be it large or little. Not to let passion of any sort run away with the understanding. Not to encourage romantic hopes nor fears. Not to drive away hope, the sovereign balm of life, though he is the greatest of all flatterers. Not to be under the dominion of superstition or enthusiasm. Not willingly to undertake any thing for which the nerves of the mind or the body are not strong enough. Not to run the race of competition, or to be in another's way. To avoid being jostled too much in the street, being overcome by the noise of the carriages, and not to be carried even by curiosity itself into a large crowd. To strive to embody that dignified sentiment, \"to write injuries in dust, but kindliness in marble.\" Not to give the reins to constitutional impatience, for it is apt to hurry on the first expressions into the indecency of swearing. To recollect, that he who can keep his own temper may be master of another's. If one cannot be a stoic, in bearing and forbearing, on every trying occasion, yet it may not be impossible to pull the check-string against the moroseness of spleen or the impetuosity of peevishness. Anger is a short madness. Not to fall in love, now on the precipice of three score, nor expect to be fallen in love with. A connexion between summer and winter is an improper one. Love, like fire, is a good servant, but a bad master. Love is death, when the animal spirits are gone. To contrive to have as few vacant hours upon one's hands as possible, that idleness, the mother of crimes and vices, may not pay its visit. To be always doing of something, and to have something to do. To fill up one's time, and to have a good deal to fill up: for time is the materials that life is made of. If one is not able by situation, or through the necessity of raising the supplies within the year, or by habit (for virtue itself is but habit), to do much ostentatious good, yet do as little harm as possible. To make the best and the most of everything. Not to indulge too much in the luxury of the table, nor yet to undermine the constitution. The gout, rheumatism, and dropsy, in the language of the Spectator, seem to be hovering over the dishes. Wine, the great purveyor of pleasure, and the second in rank among the senses, offers his service, when love takes his leave. It is natural to catch hold of every help, when the spirits begin to droop. Love and wine are good cordials, but are not proper for the beverage of common use. Resolve not to go to bed on a full meal. A light supper and a good conscience are the best receipts for a good night's rest, and the parents of undisturbing dreams. Not to be enervated by the flatulence of tea. Let the second or third morning's thought be to consider of the employment for the day; and one of the last at night to inquire what has been done in the course of it. Not to let one's tongue run at the expense of truth. Not to be too communicative nor unrevealed. A close tongue, with an open countenance, are the safest passports through the journey of the world. To correct the error of too much talking, and refrain the narrativeness of the approaching climacteric. To take the good-natured side in conversation. However, not to praise everybody, for that is to praise nobody. Not to be inquisitive, and eager to know secrets, nor be thought to have a head full of other people's affairs. Not to make an enemy, nor to lose a friend. To aim at the esteem of the public, and to leave a good name behind. Not to be singular in dress, in behaviour, in notions, or expressions of one's thoughts. Never to give bad advice, and to strive not to let a bad example. Seldom to give advice till asked, for it appears like giving something that is superfluous to one's self. Not to like or dislike too much at first sight. Not to wonder, for all wonder is ignorance that possession falls short of expectation. The longing of twenty years may be disappointed in the unanticipated gratification of a single hour.\nhour. Whilst we are willing, we see the best side; after we have taken possession, the worst. Refuse to attend to the arguments on both sides, and to hear every body against everybody. The mind ought not to be made up, but upon the best evidence. To be affectionate to relations, which is a kind of self-love, in preference to all other acquaintance. But not to omit paying the commanding respect to merit, which is superior to all the accidental chain of kindred. Not to debilitate the mind by new and future compositions. Like the spider, it may spin itself to death. The mind, like the field, must have its fallow season. The leisure of the pen has created honourable acquaintance, and pleased all it has wished to please. To resolve not to be too free of promises, for performances are sometimes very difficult things. Not to be too much alone, nor to read, nor meditate, or talk too much on points that may awaken tender sensations, and be too pathetic for the soul. To enjoy the present, not to be made too unhappy by reflection on the past, not to be oppressed by invisible gloom on the future. To give and receive comfort, those necessary alms to a distrested mind. To be constantly thankful to providence for the plenty hitherto possessed, which has preserved one from the dependence on party, persons, and opinions, and kept one out of debt. The appearance of a happy situation, and opportunities of taking many worldly felicities (for content has seldom perverted itself into discontent), has induced many to conclude, that one must be pleased with one's lot in life; and it occasions many to look with the eye of innocent envy. To resolve more than ever to shun every public station and responsibility of conduct. To be satisfied with being master of one's self, one's habits, now a second nature, and one's time. Determined not to solicit, unless trampled upon by fortune, to live and die in the harness of trade, or a profession. To take care that pity (humanity is not here meant) does not find out one in the endurance of any calamity. When pity is within call, contempt is not far off. Not to wish to have a greater hold of life, nor to quit that hold. The possible tenure of existence is of too short a possession for the long night that is to succeed: therefore not a moment to be lost. Not to lose sight even for a single day, of these good and proverbial daughters\u2014diet\u2014merryman\u2014and quiet. Resolved to remember and to recommend, towards tranquillity and longevity, the three oral maxims of Sir Hans Sloane\u2014\"Never to quarrel with one's self\u2014one's wife\u2014or one's prince.\" Lastly, Not to put one's self too much in the power of the elements, those great enemies to the human frame; namely, the sun\u2014the wind\u2014the rain\u2014and the night air.\n\nOld Man of the Mountain. See Assassins.\n\nOldcastle, Sir John, called the Good Lord Cobham, was born in the reign of Edward III. and was the first author as well as the first martyr among the English nobility: he obtained his peerage by marrying the heiress of that Lord Cobham who with so much virtue and patriotism opposed the tyranny of Richard II. By his means the famous statute against profaners was revived, and guarded against by severer penalties; he was one of the leaders of the reforming party; was at great expense in procuring and dispersing copies of Wickliffe's writings among the people, as well as by maintaining a number of his disciples as itinerant preachers. In the reign of Henry V. he was accused of heresy; the growth of which was attributed to his influence. Being a domestic in the king's court, the king delayed his prosecution that he might reason with him himself; but not being able to reclaim him to the church of Rome, he in great displeasure resigned him to its censure. He was apprehended and condemned for heresy; but escaping from the Tower, lay concealed for four years in Wales, until the rumour of a pretended conspiracy was raised against him, and a price set upon his head: he was at last seized and executed in St Giles's Fields; being hung alive in chains upon a gallows, and burned by a fire placed underneath. He wrote \"Twelve Conclusions, addressed to the Parliament of England.\"\n\nOldenburg, a title of the royal house of Denmark. The origin of this illustrious family, we are told, is this:\n\nOn the death of Christopher king of Denmark, &c., in 1443, without issue, there was a great contest about the succession; and a variety of factions were raised, particularly in Sweden and Norway, for the promotion of different persons; and various animosities and numerous discords were excited by the several parties, in order each to obtain their own ends.\n\nAs soon as these intrigues were known in Denmark, the senate resolved to proceed to the election of a king; for it did not appear expedient to commit the government of affairs to the queen dowager, at a time when they had every thing to fear from the two neighbouring crowns. At this time a lord of great weight, property, and ambition, sought the queen in marriage, the more easily to pave his way to the throne. This is a fact mentioned by Pontanus and Meurinus, though neither takes notice of his name. But as for a great number of years there was no precedent for electing a king out of the body of nobility, though agreeable to law, the queen entered into the views of the senate, and declared she would give her hand to no prince who should not be judged deserving of the crown by the supreme council of the nation.\n\nThe advantages which would have accrued from annexing the duchy of Sleswick and Holstein to the crown, made the senate first cast their eyes on Adolphus. This matter required no long deliberation; all saw the conveniences resulting from such an union, and gave their assent. Immediately an embassy was despatched with the offer to Adolphus; but that prince consulting the good of his subjects, whose interest would have been absorbed in the superior weight of Denmark, declined it, with a moderation and disinterestedness, altogether uncommon among princes. However, that he might not be wanting in respect to the senate, he proposed to them his nephew Christian, second son to Theodoric, count of Oldenburg, a prince bred up at the court of Adolphus from his infancy. The proposition was so agreeable to the senate, that, without loss of time, the ambassadors were sent to Theodoric, to demand either of his sons he should pitch upon for their king. Theodoric's answer to the ambassadors was remarkable: \"I have three sons, says he, of very opposite qualities. One is passionately fond of pleasure and women; another breathes nothing but war, without regarding the justice of the cause; but the third is moderate in his disposition, prefers\nOldenburg prefers peace to the din of arms, yet stands unrivalled in valour, generosity, and magnanimity.\" He said he painted these characters for the senate's information, desiring they would choose which of the young princes they believed would render the kingdom happiest. It was a matter which would admit of no hesitation; with one voice the senate declared for that prince whose panegyric the father had so warmly drawn; and under these happy auspices commenced the origin of the grandeur of the house of Oldenburg, at this day seated on the throne of Denmark.","sp":133,"ep":136},{"h":"OLD-WIFE","t":"or Wrangle.

He was afterwards tutor to William lord Cavendish, and was acquainted with Milton the poet. During his residence at Oxford, he became also acquainted with the members of that body there, which gave birth to the Royal Society; and upon the foundation of this latter, he was elected fellow; and when the society found it necessary to have two secretaries, he was chosen assistant secretary to Dr Wilkins. He applied himself with extraordinary diligence to the business of his office, and began the publication of the Philosophical Transactions with No. I. in 1664. In order to discharge this task with greater credit to himself and the society, he held a correspondence with more than seventy learned persons, and others, upon a vast variety of subjects, in different parts of the world. This fatigue would have been insupportable, had not he, as he told Dr Lister, managed it so as to make one letter answer another; and that to be always fresh, he never read a letter before he had pen, ink, and paper, ready to answer it forthwith; so that the multitude of his letters cloyed him not, nor ever lay upon his hands. Among others, he was a constant correspondent of Mr Robert Boyle, with whom he had a very intimate friendship; and he translated several of that ingenious gentleman's works into Latin.\n\nMr Oldenburg continued to publish the Transactions, as before, to No. xxxvi.

Philip no sooner became king, than he became the subject of this his favourite. The king had abilities, it is true, but they lay dormant; and whilst he spent his time in little inactivity, the whole government was under the direction of Olivarez. The count's management, indeed, was sufficiently dexterous in accomplishing his own designs; for by the best framed excuses, and on the most plausible pretexts, he removed all such as he thought stood in his way; nor did he stop there, but sometimes persecuted his rivals even to death, of which Don Rodrigo Calderona was a melancholy instance, an instance which at that time excited universal compassion. This minister, in short, had a genius of no common kind; added to which, he had a disposition which spurned all controul.\n\nHe had persecuted the late ministry for their pusillanimity in the management of affairs; he therefore thought it necessary, and it was certainly prudent, to pursue new measures. His self-sufficiency, though unbounded, was concealed under the veil of assumed meekness, and he was careful to make it appear that he was wholly taken up with the things of his own province. His politics were of a refined perhaps, but not of a very useful tendency; for his imprudence, or his wrong notions on the subject, made him renew a war with Holland, contrary to the universal opinion of the council and the people. By the same imprudence, or by something worse, he provoked England, and obliged her to endeavour to humble the pride and lessen the authority of the house of Austria. Thus far he had been of little service.\nservice to his country, having only provoked the resentment of the most powerful states, particularly England, France, Holland, &c., to conspire for its ruin. It is remarkable that Olivarez, notwithstanding this, never lost his credit; and indeed things so turned about in the end, that though Spain for a whole year was put to the severest trials, it acquired a degree of fame which sufficiently, in the general opinion, overbalanced some little losfs. Olivarez too was particularly fortunate in making the peace; in which transaction he gained a very considerable advantage over Richelieu, so that things appeared to be still in a very favourable train. Fortune, however, was not always quite so indulgent to the schemes of this minister: he again drew Spain into a war with Mantua, contrary to the sentiments of the wisest men; from which is justly dated its declension, if not its ruin.\n\nOn the whole, Olivarez seems to have been always averse to peace; and with such a restless disposition, it is undoubtedly wonderful that he held his place so long and with so few complaints as he did.\n\nIt was certainly owing to his ambition and obstinacy, that an almost general war was excited about the year 1627, and which, as we have said, proved so fatal to Spain. So averse, indeed, does he appear to have been to peace, that he used every means in his power to prevent the restoration of it in Italy; and for this very purpose he sent Feria into Milan, whom he knew to be a man of such a temper and abilities as suited his purposes; for he was naturally averse to quiet. He endeavoured to break the alliances of the duke of Mantua by various stratagems; but they did not succeed: the schemes of Olivarez and the intrigues of Feria being totally defeated. Our minister had soon after this another cause of mortification, on Richelieu's being created a duke and peer of France, and unanimously admitted among the Venetian nobility; which could not fail to be a severe stroke on Olivarez, who considered him as his implacable enemy.\n\nThe people at length began to see and be displeased with his conduct; and with reason, had they known it all, for it was in many instances cruel and detestable. Indeed the differences which at that time had so long subsisted between France and Spain were the effect of the private animosity between him and Richelieu. Things, however, so turned about, and Spain was so unusually successful, that the faults of the minister were overlooked for the time; but this unexpected good fortune had no other effect than that of making him far more insolent than ever. He was, in every instance, one of the most headstrong and obstinate men in the world: he had set his heart on the reduction of Cafal in Italy, and he was determined on it at whatever hazard; this foolish enterprise was, however, unaccountably defeated, and the Spanish army experienced a total defeat.\n\nThe revolt of the Catalans, whom he wished to deprive of their privileges, was the next consequence of his folly: he had privately employed the marquis de los Velez to extinguish this rebellion; but the cruelty of the measures used for this purpose only inflamed it more. The revolution of Portugal, another disastrous event, was also the result of his obstinacy and rigour.\n\nThis series of ill fortune, which ought to have opened the eyes of the Catholic king and his ministers, seemed to infatuate both. The great secret by which Olivarez had governed his matters was being the companion, or at least the confidant, of his pleasures. While he affected to deceive the world with a specious appearance of religion and piety, he was not only immersed in vice himself, but encouraged and promoted it in his prince, to the scandal of his subjects, and the prejudice of his affairs. At this time, of all others the most improper, Olivarez produced a bastard of his, hitherto called Julian; he had taken to little care of this son, that, not able to subsist in Spain, he had passed over to the Indies, where, in very mean stations, he had scarcely got bread. On him he now bestowed the name of Don Henrico de Guzman; and bringing him with great pomp and splendour to court, either flattered or forced the constable of Castile to give him his daughter; in consideration of which alliance he was to devolve upon him his duchy of St Lucar. In the beginning of his administration, by some accident or other, he presented to the king a memorial, in relation to an affair upon which his majesty had already received one from Don Balthasar de Zuniga: upon comparing them, they contradicted each other flatly. The king ordered a person of great quality to inquire thoroughly into this business; in consequence of which Don Balthasar's memorial appeared to be the truth, and that of Olivarez the reverse of it. The king was very angry; but the count regained his favour, by procuring for him the fair actress Calderone. By this woman he had a son, of whom no great notice was taken; but now, to obscure the folly of the count duke, this youth, scarce in the 14th year of his age, was produced, with the title of Don Juan of Austria, and declared generalissimo of the army against Portugal; while the heir apparent to the crown, Don Balthasar, was left under the tuition, or rather in the custody of the counsellors of Olivarez; at which conduct the queen was chagrined, the people enraged, and the world in general affronted.\n\nHis schemes now began to be entirely broken and defeated everywhere and in every kind; he fell under the displeasure of the queen, the emperor, the grandees, and the people all at once, and experienced the disgrace he had long merited. His ill fortune, which came upon him with the force of a torrent, did not, however, wholly overpower him; he was indeed obliged to conceal himself, in order to avoid the rage of the populace: but he had still confidence enough to offer an apology for his conduct, which possessed no inconsiderable share of wit and humour, well tempered with spirit and masterly reasoning. It was not, however, of any consequence to him; for he was banished to Toro, where, worn out by infirmities, or overcome by despair, he ended his days about the year 1645.","sp":137,"ep":138},{"h":"OLIVE","t":"the fruit of the olive tree.

Hence it is that the mount of Olives is called the mountain of corruption (2 Kings xxiii. 13.). Josephus says, that this mountain is at the distance of five stadia, or furlongs, from Jerusalem, which make 625 geometrical paces, or the length of a Sabbath-day's journey, says St Luke (Acts i. 12.). The mount of Olives had three summits, or was composed of three several mountains, ranged one after another from north to south. The middle summit is that from whence our Saviour ascended into heaven. It was upon that towards the south that Solomon built temples to his idols. The summit which is most to the north is distant two furlongs from the middlemost.

Sometimes, however, we find in it passages full of fire and beauty, and turns of expression truly original. A disease of the brain, with which he was attacked, and under which he laboured several years, prevented him from putting his last hand to the work. 2.

She was sister-in-law to Pope Innocent X. and had the address to acquire an unlimited power over this vain, weak, and injudicious ecclesiastic. Her son Camillo was promoted to the cardinalate, under the title of Pamphilio; but falling in love with the princess Rosiana, a beautiful young widow, he laid aside his hat, and married. The crime, if it was one, was esteemed by the Romans in general at least venial. The pope, however, was displeased; and Olympia procured their banishment, being afraid lest her daughter-in-law should lessen her authority in the sacred court. This authority, equally unnatural and uncommon, reflected neither honour on her who held it, nor on the man who allowed her to hold it. Such elevated situations,\nOlympia's situations, however, whether they are the reward of merit, the effect of chance, or acquired by cunning, are seldom very secure. Olympia, who had procured the disgrace of many who did not deserve it, and who had herself long merited such a fate, at length experienced both disgrace and banishment. This was obtained by means of Cardinal Panzirollo, a great favourite of the pope's. The immediate cause of it was this: The pope had determined, in order to lessen his own trouble, to adopt a nephew, and to make him a Cardinal Patron, in order to give audience to ambassadors and ministers, and in his absence to preside at the council. For this purpose, at the recommendation of his favourite, his holiness made choice of Affalli, brother of the marquis Affalli, who had married a niece of Olympia. Olympia indeed was slightly consulted on the affair, and showed no disapprobation of the appointment. The pope, however, no sooner got him fixed in his new office, than he showed his own weakness by repenting of it. Olympia too was displeased, and by her solicitations procured the disgrace of Affalli, before had enjoyed either the honours or emoluments of his office. Panzirollo, however, soon managed matters so as to turn the scales: he prevailed on the pope again to countenance and honour Affalli; and, what was more, had influence sufficient to persuade him to disgrace Olympia, and to banish her court. She had indeed abused her authority in a most scandalous manner, and had gained such an absolute ascendant over the pope, that in everything his will had been subservient to her dictates.\u2014Her avarice and ambition were unbounded: she disposed of all benefices, which were kept vacant till she fully informed herself of their value: she rated an office of 1000 crowns for three years, at one year's revenue, and if for life, at 12 years purchase, one half of which sum she required to be paid in advance: she gave audience upon public affairs, enacted new laws, abrogated those of former popes, and sat in council with Innocent, with bundles of memorials in her hands. It was generally said that they lived together in a criminal correspondence, and that she had charmed him by some secret incantation. In the Protestant countries the loves and intrigues of Innocent and Donna Olympia were represented upon the stage; and fevere sarcasms were daily put into the hands of Pasquin at Rome.\u2014As she had usurped such an absolute authority, the new cardinal nephew saw the necessity of ruining her credit; he therefore seconded the endeavours of Panzirollo.\u2014He intimated to the pope, that his reputation had suffered greatly among the Catholics by her scandalous proceedings, and that his nuncios were treated with disrespect and contempt at the courts of the emperor, France, and Spain. Upon these representations, Innocent at length, but with great reluctance, banished Olympia, and was reconciled to Prince Camillo and the princess Roffano; though some authors affirm that her banishment was no more than a political retreat, and that she still in private directed the affairs of the pope. A woman of Olympia's character, however, with such unbounded ambition, such an extravagant lust for power, and such an ambitious desire of wealth, and who had once possessed so great an ascendancy over such a man as Innocent, was not to be so easily put off. She was banished in 1650; but in 1653, she again assumed the supreme direction of affairs just as before her disgrace. She again accomplished the disgrace of Affalli, and procured the promotion of Azzolini to the office of secretary of the briefs. In 1654, his holiness resigned himself entirely into the hands of this affuming woman; who, observing his infirmities daily increasing, redoubled her rapacity, disposing of benefices to the highest bidders in all parts of Italy. She was again, however, in hazard of being displaced by a new favourite, viz. the cardinal de Retz; and had not the pope's dissolution prevented it, it would in all probability quickly have taken place. During his last illness he received nothing but from the hands of Donna Olympia, who was at great pains to prolong his life, watched continually at his bed side, and prevented the ambassadors or others from disturbing him with discourses upon business. She is said, during the last ten days of his life, when he continued without the use of reason, to have amassed about half a million of crowns. She did not find the succeeding pope (Alexander VII.) so easy to be played upon as his weak predecessor: a number of memorials were sent in against her, and his holiness was well disposed to attend to them: he ordered her to retire from Rome, and at the same time began to examine witnesses reflecting her conduct. She was cut off, however, before the trial was finished, by the plague, which, in 1656, afflicted Rome and its neighbourhood. Her estate was not confiscated as was generally expected; and the prince Pamphilio was allowed to succeed her. The pope only referred for his own relations about a million of crowns.\n\nOlympia, in Ancient Geography, with the surname Pifatius (Strabo); so called from the territory of Pisa in Elis; described by Strabo, \"as the temple of Jupiter Olympus, before which stands a grove of wild olive trees, in which is the stadium, or foot-course, so called because the eighth part of a mile; and by which the Alpheus, coming down from Arcadia, runs.\" Olympia, however, was famous not merely for the temple of Jupiter, but also for a temple of Juno, 63 feet long, with columns round it of the Doric order; and a Metroum or temple of the mother of the gods, a large Doric edifice; with holy treasuries. There, and the porticoes, a gymnastum, prytaneum, and many more buildings, chiefly in the enclosure, with the houses of the priests and other inhabitants, made Olympia no inconsiderable place. The stadium was in the grove of wild olive trees, before the great temple; and near it was the hippodrome or course for the races of horses and chariots. The Alpheus flowed by from Arcadia with a copious and very pleasant stream, which was received on the coast by the Sicilian sea.\n\nThe temple of Jupiter was of the Doric order, 68 feet high to the pediment, 95 wide, and 230 long; the cell encompassed with columns. It was erected with the country stone; the roof not of earth baked, but of Pentelic marble; the slabs disposed as tiles; the way to it up a winding staircase. The two pediments were enriched with sculpture; and one had over the centre a statue of Victory gilded; and underneath a votive buckler of gold. At each corner was a gilded vase. Above the columns were fixed 21 gilded bucklers, offered at the conclusion of the Achaean war by the Roman general Mummius. The gates in the two fronts were\nOlympia, were of brafs, and over them were carved the labours of Hercules. Within the cell were double colonnades, between which was the approach to the image.\n\nThe Jupiter of Olympia was accounted alone sufficient to immortalize its maker, Phidias. It was of ivory and gold, the head crowned with olive. In the right hand was a statue of Victory; in the left a flowered sceptre, composed of various metals, on which was an eagle. The sandals were of gold, as also the vestment, which was curiously embossed with lilies and animals. The throne was gold inlaid with ebony and ivory, and studded with jewels, intermixed with paintings and exquisite figures in relievo. The pillars between the feet contributed to its support. Before it were walls, serving as a fence, decorated principally with the exploits of Hercules; the portion opposite to the door of a blue colour. It was the office of a family descended from Phidias, called ph\u0153druntres or the polibiers, to keep the work bright and clean. The veil or curtain was cloth rich with the purple dye of Phoenicia and with Assyrian embroidery, an offering of King Antiochus, and was let down from above by looening the strings. The image impressed on the spectator an opinion that it was higher and wider than it measured. Its magnitude is such, that though the temple was very large, the artist seemed to have erred in the proportions. The god, fitting, nearly touched the ceiling with his head; suggesting an idea, that if he were to rise up, he would destroy the roof. A part of the pavement before it was of black marble, enclosed in a rim of Parian or white, where they poured oil to preserve the ivory.\n\nThe altar of Jupiter Olympius was of great antiquity, and composed of ashes from the thighs of the victims, which were carried up and confused in the soil with wood of the white poplar tree. The ashes also of the prytaneum, in which a perpetual fire was kept on a hearth, were removed annually on a fixed day, and spread on it, being first mingled with water from the Alpheus. The cement, it was affirmed, could be made with that fluid only; and therefore this river was much respected, and esteemed the most friendly of any to the god. On each side of the altar were stone steps. Its height was 22 feet. Girls and women, when allowed to be at Olympian, were suffered to ascend the bafe- ment, which was 125 feet in circumference. The people of Elis sacrificed daily, and private persons as often as they chose.\n\nReligion flourished at Olympia, and many deities were worshipped besides Jupiter. Paulanias has enumerated above 60 altars of various shapes and kinds. One of the unknown gods stood by the great altar. The people of Elis offered on all these monthly; laying on them boughs of olive; burning incense, and wheat mixed with honey; and pouring libations of such liquors as the ritual prescribed. At the latter ceremony sometimes a form of prayer was used, and they sung hymns composed in the Doric dialect.\n\nOlympia was situated on an eminence, between two mountains called Offa and Olympus. Though its ancient splendour is gone, the place reminds the traveller of what it once was. It is in the Morea, being now a small place called Longinico, 50 miles south of Lepanto, in E.

The games were exhibited at the time of the full moon next after the summer solstice; therefore the Olympiads were of unequal length, because the time of the full moon differs 11 days every year, and for that reason they sometimes began the next day after the solstice, and at other times four weeks after. The computation by Olympiads ceased, at some supposal, after the 304th, in the year 440 of the Christian era. It was universally adopted not only by the Greeks, but by many of the neighbouring countries; though still the Pythian games served as an epoch to the people of Delphi and to the Boeotians; the Nemean games to the Argives and Arcadians; and the Isthmian to the Corinthians and the inhabitants of the Peloponnesian isthmus. To the Olympiads history is much indebted. They have served to fix the time of many momentous events; and indeed before this method of computing time was observed, every page of history is mostly fabulous, and filled with obscurity and contradiction, and no true chronological account can be properly established and maintained with certainty.","sp":141,"ep":141},{"h":"OLYMPIAS","t":"a celebrated woman, who was daughter of a king of Epirus, and who married Philip king of Macedonia, by whom she had Alexander the Great. Her haughtiness, and more probably her infidelity, obliged Philip to repudiate her, and to marry Cleopatra, the niece of King Attalus. Olympias was sensible of this injury, and Alexander showed his disapprobation of his father's measures, by retiring from the court to his mother. The murder of Philip, which soon followed this disgrace, and which some have attributed to the intrigues of Olympias, was productive of the greatest extravagancies. The queen paid the greatest honour to her husband's murderer. She gathered his mangled limbs, placed a crown of gold on his head, and laid his ashes near those of Philip. The administration of Alexander, who had succeeded his father, was in some instances offensive to Olympias; but when the ambition of her son was concerned, she did not scruple to declare publicly that Alexander was not the son of Philip, but that he was the offspring of an enormous serpent who had supernaturally introduced himself into her bed. When Alexander was dead, Olympias seized the government of Macedonia; and, to establish her usurpation, she cruelly put to death Arrideus, with his wife Eurydice, as also Nicanor the brother of Cassander, with 100 leading men of Macedon, who were inimical to her interest. Such barbarities did not long remain unpunished: Cassander besieged her in Pydna, where she had retired with the remains of her family, and she was obliged to surrender after an obstinate siege. The conqueror ordered her to be accused, and to be put to death. A body of 200 soldiers were ordered to put the bloody commands into execution, but the splendour and majesty of the queen disarmed their courage; and she was at last massacred by those whom she had cruelly deprived of their children, about 316 years before the Christian era.","sp":141,"ep":141},{"h":"OLYMPIC GAMES","t":"were solemn games among the ancient Greeks, so called from Olympian Jupiter, to whom they were dedicated; and by some said to be\nfirst instituted by him, after his victory over the sons of Titan; others ascribe their institution to Hercules, not the son of Alcmena, but one of much greater antiquity; others to Pelops; and others to Hercules the son of Alcmena. By whomsoever they were instituted, we know that, at a period rather early, they had fallen into disuse. The wars which prevailed among the Greeks, for a while, totally interrupted the religious ceremonies and exhibitions with which they had been accustomed to honour the common gods and heroes; but the Olympic games were restored on the following occasion. Amidst the calamities which afflicted or threatened Peloponnesus, Iphitus, a descendant of Oxylos, to whom the province of Eleia had fallen in the general partition of the peninsula, applied to the Delphic oracle. The priests of Apollo, ever disposed to favour the views of kings and legislators, answered agreeably to his wish, that the festivals anciently celebrated at Olympia, on the Alpheus, must be renewed, and an armistice proclaimed for all the states willing to partake of them, and desirous to avert the vengeance of heaven. Fortified by this authority, and assisted by the advice of Lycurgus, Iphitus took measures, not only for restoring the Olympic solemnity, but for rendering it perpetual. The injunction of the oracle was speedily diffused through the remotest parts of Greece by the numerous votaries who frequented the sacred shrine. The armistice was proclaimed in Eleia for exhibiting shows and performing sacrifices. In the heroic ages, feats of bodily strength and address were destined to the honour of deceased warriors; hymns and sacrifices were offered for the gods; but the flexible texture of Grecian superstition, easily confounding the expressions of respectful gratitude and pious veneration, enabled Iphitus to unite both in his new institution.\n\nThe festival, which lasted five days, began and ended with a sacrifice to Olympian Jove. The intermediate time was chiefly filled up by the gymnastic exercises, in which all freemen of Grecian extraction were invited to contend, provided they had been born in lawful wedlock, and had lived untainted by any infamous immoral stain. The preparation for this part of the entertainment was made in the gymnasium of Elis, a spacious edifice, surrounded by a double range of pillars, with an open area in the middle. Adjoining were various apartments, containing baths, and other conveniences for the combatants. The neighbouring country was gradually adorned with porticoes, shady walks and groves, interfering with feats and benches; the whole originally destined to relieve the fatigues and anxiety of the candidates for Olympic fame; and frequented in later times, by sophists and philosophers, who were fond to contemplate wisdom, and communicate knowledge, in those delightful retreats. The order of the athletic exercises, or combats, was established by Lycurgus, and corresponded almost exactly to that described by Homer, in the 23rd book of the Iliad, and eighth of the Odyssey. Iphitus, we are told, appointed the other ceremonies and entertainments; settled the regular return of the festival at the end of every fourth year, in the month of July; and gave to the whole solemnity that form and arrangement, which it preserved with little variation above a thousand years; a period exceeding the duration of the most famous kingdoms and republics of antiquity. Among the benefactors of Olympia, at a much later period, was reckoned Herod, who was afterwards king of Judea. Seeing, on his way to Rome, the games neglected or dwindling into insignificance from the poverty of the Eleans, he displayed vast munificence as president, and provided an ample revenue for their future support and dignity.\n\nThe care and management of the Olympics belonged for the most part to the Eleans; who on that account enjoyed their possessions without molestation, or fear of war or violence. They appointed a certain number of judges, who were to take care that those who offered themselves as competitors should perform their preparatory exercises; and these judges, during the solemnity, sat naked, having before them a crown of victory, formed of wild olive, which was presented to whomsoever they adjudged it. Those who were conquerors were called Olympionikes, and were loaded with honours by their countrymen. At these games women were not allowed to be present; and if any woman was found, during the solemnity, to have passed the river Alpheus, she was to be thrown headlong from a rock. This, however, was sometimes neglected; for we find not only women present at the celebration, but also some among the combatants, and some rewarded with the crown. The preparations for these festivals were great. No person was permitted to enter the lists, if he had not regularly exercised himself ten months before the celebration at the public gymnasium of Elis. No unfair dealings were allowed; whoever attempted to bribe his adversary was subjected to a severe fine; and even the father and relations were obliged to swear that they would have recourse to no artifice which might decide the victory in favour of their friends. No criminals, nor such as were connected with impious and guilty persons, were suffered to present themselves as combatants. The wrestlers were appointed by lot. Some little balls inscribed with a letter were thrown into a silver urn, and such as drew the same letter were obliged to contend one with the other. He who had an odd letter remained the last; and he often had the advantage, as he was to encounter the last who had obtained the superiority over his adversary. In these games were exhibited running, leaping, wrestling, boxing, and the throwing of the quoit, which was called altogether \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1, or quinquarium. Besides these, there were horse and chariot races, and also contentions in poetry, eloquence, and the fine arts. The only reward that the conqueror obtained was a crown of olive. This, as some suppose, was in memory of the labours of Hercules, which were accomplished for the universal good of mankind, and for which the hero claimed no other reward but the consciousness of having been the friend of mankind. So small and trifling a reward stimulated courage and virtue, and was the source of greater honours than the most unbounded treasures. The statues of the conquerors, called Olympionikes, were erected at Olympia in the sacred wood of Jupiter.\n\nTheir return home was that of a warlike conqueror; they were drawn in a chariot by four horses, and everywhere received with the greatest acclamations. Their entrance into their native city was not through the gates; to make it more grand and more solemn, a breach was made in the walls. Painters and poets were employed in celebrating their names; and indeed the victories\nOlympus, victories severally obtained at Olympia are the subjects of the most beautiful odes of Pindar. The combatants were naked. A scarf was originally tied round their waist; but when it had entangled one of the adversaries, and been the cause that he lost the victory, it was laid aside, and no regard was paid to decency. The Olympic games were observed every fifth year, or, to speak with greater exactness, after a revolution of four years, and in the first month of the fifth year, and they continued for five successive days. As they were the most ancient and most solemn of all the festivals of the Greeks, it will not appear wonderful, that they drew so many people, not only inhabitants of Greece, but of the neighbouring islands and countries.\n\nSuch is the account of Grecian writers, who have, doubtless, often ascribed to positive institution many inventions and usages naturally resulting from the progressive manners of society. When we come to examine the Eleusinian games in their more improved state, together with the innumerable imitations of them in other provinces of Greece, there will occur reasons for believing, that many regulations, referred by an easy solution to the legislative wisdom of Iphitus or Lycurgus, were introduced by time or accident, continued through custom, improved by repeated trials, and confirmed by a sense of their utility. Yet such an institution as the Olympiad, even in its least perfect form, must have been attended with manifest advantages to society. It is sufficient barely to mention the suspension of hostilities which took place, not only during the celebration of the festival, but a considerable time both before and after it. Considered as a religious ceremony, at which the whole Grecian name was invited, and even enjoined, to assist, it was well adapted to facilitate intercourse, to promote knowledge, to soften prejudice, and to hasten the progress of civilization and humanity. Greece, and particularly Peloponnesus, was the centre from which the adventurous spirit of its inhabitants had diffused innumerable colonies through the surrounding nations. To these widely separated communities, which, notwithstanding their common origin, seemed to have lost all connexion and correspondence, the Olympiad served as a common bond of alliance and point of reunion. The celebrity of this festival continually attracted to it the characters most distinguished for genius and enterprise, whose fame would have otherwise been unknown and lost in the boundless extent of Grecian territory. The remote inhabitants, not only of European Greece, but of Asia and Africa, being assembled to the worship of common gods, were formed to the sense of a general interest, and excited to the pursuit of national honour and prosperity. Strangers of similar dispositions might confirm in Elis the sacred and indissoluble ties of hospitality. If their communities were endangered by any barbarous power, they might here solicit assistance from their Grecian brethren. On other occasions they might explain the benefits which, in peace or war, their respective countries were best qualified to communicate. And the Olympic festival might thus serve the purpose of resident ambassadors, and other institutions alike unknown to antiquity.","sp":141,"ep":143},{"h":"OLYMPUS","t":"the name of several mountains.\u2014One bounding Bithynia on the south.\u2014Another in the island of Cyprus, on whose top was a temple of Venus, which women were not permitted either to enter or to\n\nfee (Strabo).\u2014A third, Olympus of Galatia (Livy).\u2014A fourth, of Lycia, with a noble cognominal town, near the sea coast (Strabo, Cicero), extinct in Pliny's time, there remaining only a citadel: the town was destroyed by P.

Few systems of faith are more absurd than Mohammed's; yet, though he disclaimed miracles, it was supported, as we are told by latter writers, by a variety of them, which, however, unfortunately for the creed they were contrived to support, are too trifling, absurd, and contradictory, to deserve the smallest attention.\n\nThey tell us, but upon grounds too vague and indeterminate to command belief, that Omar was miraculously converted to this faith: a man he is reported to have been, before this event, truly respectable, and in particular a violent opponent of the Arabian prophet. Mohammed, it seems, felt this opposition, and regretted it; he therefore, with the fervour, and as it happened, with the success of a true prophet, according to his followers' account, prayed for the conversion of this his dangerous antagonist. Omar, it is said, had no sooner read the 20th chapter of the Koran than he was convinced: upon which he instantly repaired to Mohammed and his followers, and declared his conversion. It is said, that at one time he intended to murder the prophet; and various causes are assigned for the prevention of this shocking piece of sacrilege. After his wonderful conversion, the Mohammedan writers inform us that he was named Al Faruk, or the \"divider;\" because, say they, when a certain Moflem was condemned by Mohammed for his iniquitous treatment of a Jew, and appealed afterwards from the sentence of the prophet to Omar, he cut him in two with his scimitar, for not acquiescing in the decision of so upright a judge: which circumstance when Mohammed heard, he gave him the surname of Al Faruk, or \"the divider;\" because, by this action, he had shown himself capable of perfectly distinguishing between truth and falsehood. Al Kodai affirms, that 39 of Omar's adherents followed his example the same day he professed himself a votary of Mohammed.\nThe conversion of Hamza and Omar Ebn Al Khattab happened in the year preceding the first flight of the Moles into Ethiopia, or the fourth year of Mohammed's mission, according to Abulfeda. He was unquestionably a great acquisition to the prophet, and enabled him to carry on his schemes to far more purpose than he could possibly have done without him, or if he had continued his enemy. Omar at length found his services in the cause he had undertaken sufficiently honoured and amply rewarded; for on the death of Abu Beir, who had succeeded the impostor himself, he was promoted to the regal and pontifical dignity. The title first assigned him was the caliph of the caliph of the apostle of God; or in other words the successor of the successor of Mohammed: but the Arabs considering that this title, by the addition to be annexed to it at the accession of every future caliph, would be too long, they, by universal consent, saluted him the emperor of the believers; which illustrious title, at this juncture conferred on Omar, descended afterwards to all the successors of that prince. Our readers will not expect us to follow the caliph with minute exactness through the transactions of his reign. This would indeed swell our article beyond all proportion. We shall therefore confine ourselves to some of the leading facts.\n\nHis arms appear to have been particularly successful; the Persians he conquered, and Jerusalem submitted to his power; nor does he appear to have been checked in a single instance. In consequence, however, of his success, an attempt was made to assassinate him. The fact is thus related: Wathak Ebn Mofafer, a resolute young Arab, was procured by the king of Ghafsan, and sent to Medina for this very purpose. Some time after his arrival, observing Omar to fall asleep under a tree on which he had placed himself, so as not to be discovered by any person, he drew his dagger, and was upon the point of stabbing him, when, lifting up his eyes, he saw a lion walking round about him, and licking his feet. Nor did the lion cease to guard the caliph till he awoke; but then instantly went away. This phenomenon struck Wathak with a profound reverence for Omar, whom he now revered as the peculiar care of heaven. He therefore came down from the tree, on which the lion had forced him to remain, kissed the caliph's hand, confessed his crime, and embraced the Mohammedan religion; being so strongly affected with the wonderful deliverance he had been an eye witness of. His life, however, was at length ended by assassination; for about two years after the conclusion of the Nohawandian war, in which the Arabs probably still farther extended their conquests, though no account of their military operations during that period has reached us, that is, in the 23rd year of the Hegira, according to Abu Jaafar Al Tabari, the caliph Omar Ebn Al Khattab was assassinated by a Persian slave; of which horrid fact the Arab writers have handed down the following particulars: Abu Luluah, a Persian of the Magian sect, whose name was Firuz, one of Al Mogheira Ebn Al Shabab's slaves, was obliged by his master to pay daily two dirhems, in conformity to the Mohammedan custom, for the free exercise of this religion. Firuz resenting this treatment, complained of it to the caliph, and desired that some part at least of the tribute exacted of him might be remitted; but this favour being refused by Omar, the Persian threatened his destruction; which he soon after effected, by stabbing him thrice in the belly with a dagger, while he was in the mosque at Medina performing his morning devotions. The Arabs then present perceiving that the villain had imbrued his hands in the blood of their sovereign, immediately rushed upon him; but he made so desperate a defence, that he wounded 13 of the assailants, and seven of them mortally. At last one of the caliph's attendants threw his vest over him, and seized him; upon which he stabbed himself and soon after expired.\n\nAccording to Theophanes, this Firuz was an apostate or renegade, and consequently had before embraced the Mohammedan religion; but this assertion is by no means probable; because on his becoming a convert to Islamism, he must have been unmindful of his master, and on his relapsing into Magism, he would have been put to death by the caliph's order: neither of which particulars are consistent with what we find related by the Arab historians, and even by our Greek chronicographer himself. Omar languished three days and then died, in the month of Dhul'Hajja, and the 23rd year of the Hegira, which began in the year of our Lord 643. Authors are not agreed with regard to the duration of his caliphate. The Arab historians, whom we are inclined to follow, say that he reigned between 10 and 11 years. Theophanes affirms, that he was murdered in the 12th year of his caliphate, and Dionysius Telmarchus extends the length of his reign to 12 complete years. Only one of the wounds given him by Firuz was mortal, and that he received under his navel. At his death he was 63 years old; which, as we are told by an Arab author, was the age of Mohammed himself, Abu Beir, and Ayesha, one of the prophet's wives, when they died. When Omar fell in the mosque, Abd'alrahman Ebn Awf, one of Mohammed's first converts, supplied his place during the remainder of the service; and three days before his death, Sahib Ebn Tarif, at his command, officiated for him.

The Jews and Christians were indeed persecuted by the Romans, not however for worshipping the true God, but because, together with him, they would not worship Jupiter, Juno, and all the rabble of heathen divinities.\n\nThe reason of the almost universal tolerance of ideologues to one another, and of the intolerance of all to\nthe Jews and Christians, is very obvious. Not a single Pagan, a very few philosophers perhaps excepted, ever thought of paying his adoration to the Supreme and self-existent Being, but to inferior divinities, to whom it was supposed that the care of particular persons, families, cities, and nations was configned by the God of the universe. The consequence was, that, as no person denied the divinity of his neighbour's object of worship, an intercommunity of gods was everywhere admitted, and all joined occasionally in adoring the gods of the various nations. By the Jews and Christians this communion was rejected as in the highest degree impious; and it could not well be maintained between the citizens of Ombi and those of Tentyra.\n\nThat brutes were worshipped in Egypt is universally known (See Polytheism); and Diodorus the Sicilian informs us, in a passage quoted by Eul\u00e6us*, that \"the cities and nomes of Egypt being at one time prone to rebellion, and to enter into conspiracies against monarchical government, one of their most politic kings contrived to introduce into the neighbouring nomes the worship of different animals; so that while each reverenced the deity which itself held sacred, and despised that which its neighbours had consecrated, they could hardly be brought to join cordially in one common design to the disturbance of the government.\"\n\nIn this distribution of gods he conferred upon Ombi the crocodile, and upon Tentyra, the mortal enemy of that monster, the ichneumon. The consequence of which was, that while the Ombites worshipped the crocodile, the Tentyrites took every opportunity of slaughtering him, insomuch that, according to Strabo, the very voice of an inhabitant of Tentyra put the crocodile to flight. This, we confess, is a very improbable fact; but it is certain that the mutual hatred of those cities, on account of their hostile gods, rose to such a height, that whenever the inhabitants of the one were engaged in the more solemn rites of their religion, those of the other were sure to embrace the opportunity of setting fire to their houses, and rendering them every injury in their power to inflict. And what may, to a superficial thinker, appear extraordinary, though it will excite no wonder in the breast of him who has studied mankind, this animosity continued between the inhabitants of the two cities long after the crocodile and ichneumon had lost their divinity.\n\nThe conduct of the Egyptian monarch was admirably calculated for preventing the nation from combining against the government; and it extended its influence over the whole kingdom. Diodorus informs us, that he assigned to each nome an animal to worship, which was hated, killed, and sometimes fed upon by the inhabitants of the neighbouring nome; and we know upon higher authority than his, that the Israelites could not offer sacrifices in Egypt, because the bullock was deemed sacred over the whole country.","sp":144,"ep":145},{"h":"OMBRE","t":"a celebrated game at cards, borrowed from the Spaniards, and played by two, by three, or by five persons, but generally by three. When three play at this game, nine cards are dealt to each party; the whole ombre pack being only 40: because the eights, nines, and tens, are thrown out of the pack. There are two sorts of counters for stakes, the greater and the lesser; the last having the same proportion to the other as a penny to a threepenny: of the greater counters each man stakes one for the game; and one of the lesser for passing for the hand, when eldest, and for every card taken in. As to the order and value of the cards, the ace of spades, called *joadillo*, is always the highest trump, in whatever suit the trump be; the manille, or black duce, is the second; and the bello, or ace of clubs, is always the third: the next in order is the king, the queen, the knave, the seven, the six, the five, four, and three. Of the black there are 11 trumps; of the red, 12. The least small cards of the red are always the belt, and the most of the black; except the duce and red seven, both of which are called the maniller, and are always second when the red is a trump. The red ace, when a trump, enters into the fourth place, and is called *punto*; otherwise it is only called an ace. The three principal cards are called *matadores*; which have this privilege, that they are not obliged to attend an inferior trump when it leads; but for want of a small trump, the person may renounce trumps, and play any other card; and when these are all in the same hand, the others pay three of the greater counters a-piece; and with these three for a foundation, he may count as many matadores as he has cards in an uninterrupted series of trumps; for all which the others are to pay one counter a-piece. He who hath the first hand is called *ombre*, and has his choice of playing the game, of naming the trump, and of taking in as many and as few cards as he pleases; and after him the second, &c. But if he does not name the trump before he looks on the cards he has taken in, any other may prevent him, by naming what trump he pleases. He that has the first hand should neither take in, nor play, unless he has at least three sure tricks in his hand; for, as he wins the game who wins most tricks, he that can win five of the nine has a sure game: which is also the case if he wins four, and can so divide the tricks as that one person may win two, and the other three.\n\nIf a person plays without discarding or changing any cards, this is called *playing sans prendre*; and if another win more tricks than he, he is said to *win codille*. The over-fights in the course of the game are called *beats*. And if the ombre wins all the nine tricks, it is called *winning the vote*.\n\nIn ombre by five, which many, on account of its not requiring to close an attention, prefer to that by three, only eight cards a-piece are dealt; and five tricks must be won, otherwise the ombre is beatified. Here the person who undertakes the game, after naming the trump, calls a king to his assistance; upon which the person in whose hand the king is, without discovering himself, is to assist him as a partner, and to share his fate. If, between both, they can make five tricks, the ombre wins two counters, and the auxiliary king only one; but when the counters are even, they divide them equally. If the ombre venture the game without calling in any king, this too is called *playing sans prendre*; in which case the other four are all against him, and he must win five tricks alone, or be beatified. The rest is much the same as by three.\n\n**OMBRE de soleil**, \"Shadow of the sun,\" in Heraldry, is when the sun is borne in armor, so as that the eyes,\neyes, nose, and mouth, which at other times are represented, do not appear; and the colouring is thin, so that the field can appear through it.","sp":145,"ep":146},{"h":"OMBRIA","t":"the ancient name of a province of Italy, in the territory of the pope, now called Spoleto and Perugia.","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"OMBRO","t":"or LOMBRO, a town of Italy, in the duchy of Tuscany, and territory of the Sienoises, situated near the Tuscan sea, a little south of the lake of Caffignione, 45 miles south-west of Sienna.","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"OMBROMETER","t":"an instrument to measure the quantity of rain that falls.

Hence Tully says, \"Pythagorei non solum voces deorum observantur,\" sed etiam hominum, quae vocent omnia,\" \"the Pythagoreans attend to the discourse not only of gods, but also of men, which they call omens.\" This sort of omen was supposed to depend much upon the will of the person concerned in the event; whence the phrases accept omen, arripiat omen. Such were the original omens; but they were afterwards derived from things as well as from words. Thus Paternus, speaking of the head of Sulpicius on the rostrum, says it was velut omen imminentis proscriptio, \"the omen of an impending proscription.\" Suetonius says of Augustus, that he believed implicitly in certain omens; and that, si mane fisci calcus perpetram, ac sinistris pro dextero induceretur, ut dirum, \"If his shoes were improperly put on in the morning, especially if the left shoe was put upon his right foot, he held it for a bad omen.\" Omen was used in a still larger sense, to signify an augury; as in the following line of Tully: \"Sic aquilae clarum fix-\n\nmavit Jupiter omen?\" \"thus Jove confirmed the bright omen of the eagle?\" It was lastly used, in the most generic sense of all, for a portent or prodigy; as in the third book of the Aeneid, where a myrtle torn up by \u00c6neas dropped blood. Upon this appearance, says the hero,\n\nMihi frigidus horror\nMembra quatit, gelidique coit formidine sanguis.\nAnd the same thing being repeated upon his breaking a branch from another tree, he prayed to the gods to avert the omen.\n\nMulta movens animo Nymphas venerabat agrestes,\nGradivumque patrem, Getici qui praedit feris,\nIste fecundantem vitum, omneque levaret (A).\n\nThe portentous or supernatural omens were either external or internal. Of the former sort were those flowers of blood so frequently occurring in the Roman history, which were much of the same nature with this adventure of \u00c6neas, which he calls monstra deum. Of the second sort were those sudden confusions, which, seizing upon men without any visible cause, were imputed to the agency of the god Pan, and hence called panic fears. But indeed there was hardly anything, however trivial, from which the ancients did not draw omens. That it should have been thought a direful omen when any thing befell the temples, altars, or statues of the gods, need excite no wonder; but that the meeting of a eunuch, a negro, a bitch with whelps, or a snake lying in the road, should have been looked upon as portending bad fortune, is a deplorable influence of human weakness, and of the pernicious influence of superstition on the mind.\n\nIt is more than probable that this practice of making ordinary events ominous of good or bad fortune took its rise in Egypt, the parent country of almost every superstition of paganism; but wherever it may have arisen, it spread itself over the whole inhabited globe, and at this day prevails in a greater or less degree among the vulgar of all nations.\n\nIn England, it is reckoned a good omen, or a sign of future happiness, if the sun shines on a couple coming out of the church after having been married. It is also esteemed a good sign if it rains whilst a corpse is burying:\n\nHappy is the bride that the sun shines on;\nHappy is the corpse that the rain rains on.\n\nTo\n\n(A) Instead of translating these short quotations, we shall here give Dryden's version of the whole of this English reader, who alone can wish for a translation, together with its effects on the mind of the hero. It is as follows:\n\nNot far, a rising hillock stood in view;\nSharp myrtles on the sides and corners grew.\nThere, while I went to crop the Sylvan scenes,\nAnd shade our altar with their leafy greens,\nI pull'd a plant (with horror I relate)\nA prodigy so strange, and full of fate:\nThe rooted fibres rose; and from the wound\nBlack bloody drops distill'd upon the ground.\nMute and amaz'd, my hair with terror flood;\n\nFear shrunk my finews, and congeal'd my blood.\nMann'd once again, another plant I try;\nThat other gush'd with the same fanguine dye.\nThen, fearing guilt for some offence unknown,\nWith prayers and vows the Dryads I atone,\nWith all the fetters of the woods, and most\nThe god of arms, who rules the Thracian coast:\nThat they, or he, these omens would avert,\nRelease our fears, and better signs impart.\nTo break a looking glass is extremely unlucky; the party to whom it belongs will lose his best friend.\n\nIf, going a journey on business, a sow crosses the road, you will probably meet with a disappointment, if not a bodily accident, before you return home. To avert this, you must endeavour to prevent her crossing you; and if that cannot be done, you must ride round on fresh ground. If the sow is attended with her litter of pigs, it is lucky, and denotes a successful journey.\n\nIt is unlucky to see first one magpie, and then more; but to see two, denotes marriage or merriment; three, a successful journey; four an unexpected piece of good news; five, you will shortly be in a great company. To kill a magpie, will certainly be punished with some terrible misfortune.\n\nIf, in a family, the youngest daughter should be married before her elder sisters, they must all dance at her wedding without shoes: this will counteract their ill luck, and procure them husbands.\n\nIf you meet a funeral procession, or one passes by you, always take off your hat: this keeps all evil spirits attending the body in good humour.\n\nIf, in eating, you miss your mouth, and the viands fall, it is very unlucky, and denotes approaching sickness.\n\nIt is lucky to put on a stocking the wrong side outwards: changing it alters the luck.\n\nWhen a person goes out to transact any important business, it is lucky to throw an old shoe after him.\n\nIt is unlucky to present a knife, scissors, razor, or any sharp or cutting instrument, to one's mistress or friend, as they are apt to cut love and friendship. To avoid the ill effects of this, a pin, a farthing, or some trifling recompense, must be taken. To find a knife or razor, denotes ill luck and disappointment to the party.\n\nIn the Highlands of Scotland, it is thought unlucky if a person setting out upon a journey stumble over the threshold, or be obliged to return for anything forgotten. If a sportsman see any person stepping over his gun or fishing rod, he expects but little success in that day's diversion. Sneezing is also deemed ominous. If one sneeze when making a bed, a little of the straw or heath is taken out and thrown into the fire, that nothing may disturb the rest of the person who is to sleep in the bed. Among the same people, success in any enterprise is believed to depend greatly upon the first creature that presents itself after the enterprise is undertaken. Thus, upon going to slumber, it is reckoned lucky to meet a horse, but very unfortunate to see a hare, if the escape; and upon meeting any creature deemed unlucky, the best means of averting the omen is to roll a stone towards it. The Greeks attributed the same efficacy to the rolling of a stone, though they greatly preferred killing the ominous animal, that the evil portended might fall on its own head*.\n\nThe motions and appearances of the clouds were not long ago considered as certain signs by which the skilful Highlander might attain to the knowledge of futurity. On the evening before new year's day, if a black cloud appeared in any part of the horizon, it was thought to prognosticate a plague, a famine, or the death of some great man in that part of the country over which it should appear to set; and in order to ascertain the place threatened by the omen, the motions of this cloud were often watched through the whole night, if it happened to continue so long visible above the horizon.\n\nBy the believers in this superstition there are days, as well as words and events, which are deemed ominous of good or bad fortune. The first day of every quarter, midsummer, and new year's day, are reckoned the most fortunate days in the year for accomplishing any design. In the isle of Mull, ploughing, sowing, and reaping, are always begun on Tuesday, though the most favourable weather for these purposes be in this way frequently lost. That day of the week on which the third of May falls, is deemed unlucky throughout the whole year. In Morven, none will upon any account dig peat or turf for fuel on Friday; and it is reckoned unlucky to number the people or cattle belonging to any family, and doubly so if the number be taken on Friday. The age of the moon is also much attended to by the vulgar Highlanders. It is alleged, that during the increase things have a tendency to grow and stick together: and hence, in the isle of Sky, fences, which are there made of turf, are built only at that time; whilst turf or peat for fuel are never, even in the most favourable weather, either made or stacked up but while the moon is in its wane. An opinion prevails in some places, that if a house take fire during the increase of the moon, the family to which it belongs will prosper in the world; but that if the fire happen while the moon is in the decrease, the family will from that time decline in its circumstances, and sink into poverty.\n\nIn attributing such influence to the moon, the superstitious Highlanders have the honour to agree with the philosophic Virgil, who in his Georgics gives the following sage instructions to the husbandman:\n\nIpsa dies alios alio dedit ordine Luna\nFelices, operum. Quintam fuge:\n* * *\nSeptima post decimam felix et ponere viem,\nEt prensos domitare boves, et licta tela\nAddere: nona fugae melior, contraria furtis.\n\nThe lucky days in each revolving moon\nFor labour choose: the fifth be sure to shun.\n* * *\n\nThe seventh is next the tenth, the best to join\nYoung oxen to the yoke, and plant the vine.\nThen weavers stretch your flays upon the weft:\nThe ninth is good for travel, bad for theft.","sp":146,"ep":147},{"h":"OMENTUM","t":"or **Epiloon**, the *Caul*, in Anatomy, a membranaceous part, usually furnished with a large quantity of fat; being placed under the peritoneum, and immediately above the intestines.

It is the key to the bay; and such is the depth of the water, that ships of any burden may ride in the harbour with safety. It is a place of the utmost importance to Spain, as the regal ships to and from Guatemala are sent to it in the time of war. The town was first established in 1751, under the command of Don Joseph Antonio de Palma. At that period the inhabitants were about 20 white men, 60 mulattoes and free negroes, and 200 slaves to the king of Spain; and the military force consisted of about 30 soldiers, besides officers. The fort was originally composed of sand confined in boarded coffers, and faced with half-burnt bricks. It was defended by 12 fine brass 24 pounders mounted, four or five iron guns of different bores, and some field-pieces. The Spaniards sensible of the importance of the place, afterwards fortified it at an incredible expense, the stone of which the walls are built having been raised from the sea, and brought from the distance of 20 leagues. The outworks were not completely finished in the year 1779, though 1000 men had then been employed upon them for 20 years.\n\nTowards the end of that year an expedition was undertaken against this fortress, in consequence of one formed by the Spaniards against the British logwood cutters in the bay of Honduras and on the Moquito shore. The latter, finding themselves hard pressed by their enemies, applied to General Duilling, governor of Jamaica for assistance; who accordingly sent a detachment to their relief under Captain Dalrymple, with necessary supplies of arms, ammunition, and artillery. Before their arrival, however, the Spaniards had taken possession of St George's Key, the chief settlement of the British in these parts, which they plundered, and took a number of prisoners; but those who escaped, being joined by a body of their countrymen, retook it, and forced the enemy to retire. In the meantime Captain Dalrymple, who had been informed of the loss of the place, was hastening to the relief of the inhabitants, and in his way fell in with Admiral Parker, who was in quest of some regal ships; but which, retreating into the harbour of Omoa, were too strongly protected by the fort there to be attacked by sea. As the Spaniards, however, had now been compelled to abandon St George's Key, it was proposed to unite the British forces by land and sea, and to attempt the conquest of this fortress. As the force under Captain Dalrymple was too inconsiderable to attempt the fort by land, it was augmented by the marines of the squadron and a strong party of the settlers; though, after all, it did not exceed the number of the garrison who opposed them.\n\nThe troops were landed at about nine miles distance from the fort in the dusk of the evening, with a design to march directly forward, in order to surprise and carry it by escalade in the night time. No roads, however, being found, they were obliged to explore their way through narrow foot-paths, morasses, and over mountains so steep with precipices, that they were obliged, in order to avoid them, to make use of lights made of the cabbage tree. In consequence of these impediments they were yet at a considerable distance from the fort, when the approach of day discovered them to the enemy. An engagement ensued, in which the Spaniards were quickly routed and driven into the town: from whence as they continued to fire upon the British, it was found necessary to set fire to it, though very much against the inclination of the assailants.\n\nIn the mean time the squadron took the opportunity, while the town was in flames, to come into the bay, and approach the fort with an intention to batter it; but the garrison returned the fire so briskly, that no impression could be made by that of the squadron, which was detained by want of wind from approaching sufficiently near. The troops then, being masters of the ground adjacent to the fort, erected several batteries in such situations as were most proper for annoying it; but though they carried on their operations with great vigour, it was still found that heavier artillery than any they possessed would be requisite, the walls being no less than 18 feet in thickness; in consequence of which they resolved still to attempt the place by escalade.\n\nThe attempt was made on the 21st of October, early in the morning. The troops entered the ditch, which fortunately for them happened to be dry, and fixed their scaling ladders against the walls, which were near 30 feet high. Two seamen mounted first; and, with admirable courage and presence of mind, stood by the ladder which they had mounted, to guard it till others ascended;\ned; and boldly presented their pieces against a large party drawn up to receive them, though they prudently retained their fire till their comrades came up.\n\nThe squadron, now drawing near, kept up a heavy and continual fire upon the fort, while the Spaniards were struck with such surprize at the execellive celerity and boldness of the assailants, that they remained motionless and unable to oppose their enemies, notwithstanding the exhortation and example of their officers. From this panic they never recovered; and while the seamen and soldiers continued to scale the walls with amazing quickness, the Spaniards never made any effort to defend themselves. About 100 of them escaped over the walls on the opposite side of the fort; the remainder surrendered at discretion.\n\nThe whole of this transaction reflected the highest lustre both on the conduct and courage of the British; and an instance of heroism is related in a British sailor to which history affords nothing superior. This man, having scaled the walls, had armed himself with a cutlass in each hand. Thus armed, he met with a Spanish officer unarmed, and just roused from sleep. The generous tar scorned to take advantage of his condition, and therefore presented him with one of his own cutlasses saying, \"You are now on a footing with me!\" The officer, however, was too much struck with admiration at his conduct to accept the offer, and took care to make the circumstance sufficiently known.\n\nThe value of the booty taken on this occasion amounted to three millions of dollars; but the loss most sensibly felt by the Spaniards was that of 250 quintals of quicksilver, a commodity indispensably necessary in extracting the precious metals from their ores. They offered therefore to ransom it at any price; but though the retention of it was far from affording a profit equal to that offered by the Spaniards, the British commanders absolutely refused to part with it, on account of the advantages the enemy would derive from having the metal in their possession. For the same reason they refused to accept of any ransom for the fort, though the governor offered to lay down 300,000 dollars for it. The Spanish military and the inhabitants were treated with the utmost humanity; their personal effects remaining untouched; and this generosity must have appeared to greater advantage, when contrasted with the behaviour of their own countrymen at Honduras, where the British were treated with remarkable severity. The church plate and ornaments were restored, on condition that the terms of capitulation should be faithfully kept.\n\nIn a short time, however, it appeared that it would have been better to have accepted of a ransom for the fort, as from circumstances at that time it could not be retained in the possession of Britain. A garrison was indeed left for its defence on the departure of the British squadron; but as it was very inconsiderable, on account of the small number of men that could be spared, the Spaniards quickly determined to make an attempt to regain the fort. For this purpose a body of 2000 men were collected, who invested it on the 25th of November. The British defended it with the utmost bravery; keeping up a constant fire on the enemy, and obliging them to retire for shelter, and take up their quarters behind a hill. Here they made preparations for an assault, in which their numbers left the success, as they supposed, by no means dubious.\n\nThe garrison was therefore summoned to surrender, with a promise of the honours of war and a safe conveyance to Great Britain, denouncing at the same time the utmost vengeance in case of a refusal; which being refused, the necessary preparations were made for an escalade.\n\nThe condition of the garrison was now such as could afford very little hope of being able to make any effectual resistance. They were but 85 in number, most of whom were become incapable of duty either from illness or excessive fatigue. They were now also obliged to make one sentinel answer for five, by shifting his place, and challenging as many times. There was no surgeon to attend the sick and wounded; nor had they even any water but what came from a floop of war that lay abreast of the fort. In this desperate situation, they resolved, notwithstanding the menaces of the Spanish commander to render the place as unserviceable as they could. For this purpose they spiked up all the guns; destroying the stores and ammunition that could not be carried off; they even locked the gates of the fort, after which they embarked without the loss of a single man. All this was performed in defiance of the large force that besieged them; and the exploit, when duly considered, must appear not less a matter of astonishment than the extraordinary manner in which the fort had been taken. The officer who commanded in this remarkable retreat was Captain Hulke of the navy.","sp":148,"ep":149},{"h":"OMOPHAGIA","t":"an ancient Greek festival, in honour of Bacchus, named Omophagos, i.e. eater of raw flesh.

Mercury was commissioned to sell him, and Omphale bought him, and restored him to liberty. The hero became enamoured of his mistress, and the queen favoured his passion, and had a son by him, whom some call Agelaus, and others Lamon. From this son were descended Gyges and Croesus; but this opinion is different from the account which makes these Lydian monarchs.\nmonarchs spring from Alcaeus, a son of Hercules, by one of the female servants of Omphale. Hercules is represented by the poets as so desperately enamoured of the queen, that, to conciliate her esteem, he spins by her side among her women, while she covers herself with the lion's skin, and arms herself with the club of the hero, and often strikes him with her sandals, for the uncouth manner with which he holds the distaff, &c. Their fondness was mutual. As they once travelled together, they came to a grotto on Mount Timolus, where the queen drest herself in the habit of her lover, and obliged him to appear in a female garment. After they had supped, they both retired to rest in different rooms, as a sacrifice on the morrow to Bacchus required. In the night Faunus, or rather Pan, who was enamoured of Omphale, introduced himself into the cave. He went to the bed of the queen, but the lion's skin persuaded him that it was the dress of Hercules; and therefore he repaired to the bed of Hercules, in hopes to find there the object of his affections. The female dress of Hercules deceived him, and he laid himself down by his side. The hero was awakened, and kicked the intruder into the middle of the cave. The noise awoke Omphale, and Faunus was discovered lying on the ground, greatly disappointed and ashamed.","sp":149,"ep":150},{"h":"OMPHALEA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the monocotyledonous family; and in the natural method ranking with those of which the order is doubtful.

The priests of On were esteemed more noble than all the other priests of Egypt. They were always privy counsellors and ministers of state; and therefore, when Pharaoh resolved to make Joseph prime minister, he very wisely gave him in marriage a daughter of the priest of On, thereby incorporating him into the most venerable caste in Egypt. Bishop Warburton thinks that the superior nobility of the priests of On was chiefly owing to their high antiquity and great learning. That they were much given to the study of astronomy, we know from the testimony of Strabo; and indeed nothing is more probable than that they should be attached to the study of that system over which their god, the Sun, presided, not only in his exalted, but also in his natural capacity. The learned prelate affirms, that \"whether they received the doctrine from original tradition, or invented it at hazard (which last supposition he thinks more probable, though we are of a very different opinion), it is certain they taught that the Sun is in the centre of its system, and that all the other bodies move round it in perpetual revolutions. This noble theory (he continues) came with the rest of the Egyptian learning into Greece (being brought thither by Pythagoras, who received it from Oenuphis*; a* Plut.de priest of On); and after having given the most illustrious of all schools, it sunk into obscurity, and P. 632. suffered a total eclipse throughout a long succession of learned and unlearned ages; till these times restored its ancient splendour, and immovably fixed it on the unerring principles of science.\"\n\nIf it be true, as some philosophers allege, that Moses appears from the first chapter of Genesis to have been acquainted with the true solar system, this account of the origin of that system is extremely probable. As it is of no importance to the civil or religious constitution of a state whether the system of Ptolemy or that of Copernicus be admitted by the people, we cannot reasonably suppose that the Jewish lawgiver was taught astronomy by a revelation from Heaven. But there can be no doubt of his knowing as much of that science as the priests of On; for we know that he was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and therefore, if he held the sun to be in the centre of the system, it is morally certain that the same thing was held by that priesthood.","sp":150,"ep":150},{"h":"ONALASHKA","t":"one of the islands of the Northern Archipelago, visited by Captain Cook in his last voyage. The native inhabitants of this island are, to all appearances, a very peaceable people, having been much polished by the Russians, who now keep them in a state of subjection. As the island furnishes them with subsistence, so it does, in some measure, with clothing, which is chiefly composed of skins. The upper garment, which is made like a waggoner's frock, reaches down to the knees. Besides this, they wear a waistcoat or two, a pair of breeches, a fur cap, and a pair of boots, the legs of which are formed of some kind of strong gut; but the soles and upper-leathers are of Russian leather. Fish and other sea animals, birds, roots, berries, and even sea weed, compose their food. They dry quantities of fish during the summer, which they lay up in small huts for their use in winter. They did not appear to be very deficient of iron, not to want any other instrument, except sewing needles, their own being formed of bone. With these they sew their canoes, and make their clothes, and also work their curious embroidery. They use, instead of thread, the fibres of plants, which they split to the thickness required. All sewing is performed by the females, who are shoemakers, tailors, and boat-builders. They manufacture mats and baskets of grass, which are both strong and beautiful. There is indeed a neatness and perfection in most of their works, that shows they are deficient neither in ingenuity nor perseverance.\n\nThough the climate is sometimes severe, Captain Cook did not observe a fire-place in any of their habitations. They are lighted as well as heated by lamps; which, though simple, effectually answer the purpose for which they are intended. They consist of a flat stone, hollowed on one side like a plate; in the hollow part they put the oil, mixed with some dry grass, which serves for a wick. Both sexes often warm themselves over one of these lamps, by placing it between their legs, under their garments, and fitting thus over it for several minutes. E. Long. 139. 29. N.

In Scripture, besides the instance of Onan above mentioned, we find self-polluters termed effeminate, unclean, filthy, and abominable. Even the heathens, who had not the advantage of revelation, were of the same opinion, as appears from the following lines of Martial.\n\n*Hoc nihil esse putes! scelus est, mihi crede; sed ingens Quantum vis animo concepis ipse tuo.*\n\nYou think 'tis nothing! 'tis a crime, believe! A crime so great you scarcely can conceive.\n\nDr Tissot has published a treatise on the pernicious effects of this shameful practice, which appears to be no less baneful to the mind than to the body. He begins with observing, that, by the continual waste of the human body, aliment are required for our support. These aliment, however, require certain preparations in the body itself; and when by any means we become altered that these preparations cannot be effected, the best aliment then prove insufficient for the support of the body. Of all the causes by which this morbid alteration is brought on, none is more common than too copious evacuations; and of all evacuations, that of the semen is the most pernicious when carried to excess. It is also to be observed, that though excess in natural venery is productive of very dangerous disorders, yet an equal evacuation by self-pollution, which is an unnatural way, is productive of others still more to be dreaded. The consequences enumerated by Dr Tissot are as follow:\n\n1. All the intellectual faculties are weakened; the memory fails; the ideas are confused, and the patient sometimes...\nsometimes even falls into a flight degree of insanity. They are continually under a kind of inward restlessness, and feel a constant anguish. They are subject to giddiness; all the senses, especially those of seeing and hearing, grow weaker and weaker, and they are subject to frightful dreams.\n\n2. The strength entirely fails, and the growth in young persons is considerably checked. Some are afflicted with almost continual watching, and others dole almost perpetually. Almost all of them become hypochondriac or hysterical, and are afflicted with all the evils which attend these disorders. Some have been known to spit calcareous matters; and others are afflicted with coughs, slow fevers, and consumptions.\n\n3. The patients are affected with the most acute pains in different parts of the body, as the head, breast, stomach, and intestines; while some complain of an obtuse sensation of pain all over the body on the slightest impression.\n\n4. There are not only to be seen pimples on the face, which are one of the most common symptoms; but even blotches, or suppurative pustules, appear on the face, nose, breast, and thighs; and sometimes fleshy excrescences arise on the forehead.\n\n5. The organs of generation are also affected; and the semen is evacuated on the slightest irritation, even that of going to stool. Numbers are afflicted with an habitual gonorrhoea, which entirely destroys the vigour of the constitution, and the matter of it resembles a fetid fumes. Others are affected with painful priapisms, dysuries, stranguries, and heat of urine, with painful tumours in the testicles, penis, bladder, and spermatic cords; and impotence in a greater or less degree is the never-failing consequence of this detestable vice.\n\n6. The functions of the intestines are sometimes totally destroyed; and some patients complain of coliciveness, others of diarrhoea, piles, and the running of a fetid matter from the fundament.\n\nWith regard to the cure, the first step is to leave off those practices which have occasioned the disease; which our author affirms is no easy matter; as, according to him, the foul itself becomes polluted, and can dwell on no other idea; or if he does, the irritability of the parts of generation themselves quickly recall ideas of the same kind. This irritability is no doubt much more to be dreaded than any pollution the foul can have received; and by removing it, there will be no occasion for exhortations to discontinue the practice. The principal means for diminishing this irritability are, in the first place, to avoid all stimulating, acrid, and spiced meats. A low diet, however, is improper, because it would further reduce the body, already too much emaciated. The food should therefore be nutritive, but plain, and should consist of flesh rather roasted than boiled, rich broths, &c.\n\nONCA and ONCE.

He flourished in the time of Jesus Christ, according to the Jewish writers; who all agree that he was, at least in some part of his life, contemporary with Jonathan Ben Uzziel, author of the second Targum upon the prophets. Dean Prideaux thinks he was the elder of the two, for several reasons; the chief of which is the purity of the style in his Targum, therein coming nearest to that part of Daniel and Ezra which is in the Chaldee, and is the truest standard of that language, and consequently is the most ancient; since that language, as well as others, was in a constant flux, and continued deviating in every age from the original; nor does there seem to be any reason why Jonathan Ben Uzziel, when he undertook his Targum, should pass over the law, and begin with the prophets, but that he found Onkelos had done this work before him, and with a success which he could not exceed.\n\nAzarias, the author of a book entitled Meor Enaim, or the light of the eyes, tells us, that Onkelos was a proselyte in the time of Hillel and Samai, and lived to see Jonathan Ben Uzziel one of the prime scholars of Hillel. These three doctors flourished 12 years before Christ, according to the chronology of Gauz; who adds, that Onkelos was contemporary with Gamaliel the elder, St Paul's master, who was the grandson of Hillel, who lived 28 years after Christ, and did not die till 18 years before the destruction of Jerusalem. However, the same Gauz, by his calculation, places Onkelos 100 years after Christ; and to adjust his opinion with that of Azarias, extends the life of Onkelos to a great length. The Talmudists tell us that he assisted at the funeral of Gamaliel, and was at a prodigious expense to make it most magnificent. Dean Prideaux observes, that the Targum of Onkelos is rather a version than a paraphrase; since it renders the Hebrew text word for word, and for the most part accurately and exactly, and is by much the best of all this sort: and therefore it has always been held in esteem among the Jews much above all the other Targums: and being set to the same musical notes with the Hebrew text, is thereby made capable of being read in the same tone with it in their public assemblies.\u2014From the excellency and accuracy of Onkelos' Targum, the dean also concludes him to have been a native Jew, since without being bred up from his birth in the Jewish religion and learning, and long exercised in all the rites and doctrines thereof, and being also thoroughly skilled in both the Hebrew and Chaldee languages, as far as a native Jew could be, he can scarce be thought thoroughly adequate to that work which he performed; and that the representing him as a proselyte seems to have proceeded from the error of taking him to have been the same with Akilas, or Aquila, of Pontus, author of the Greek Targum or version of the prophets and Hagiography, who was indeed a Jewish proselyte.","sp":152,"ep":152},{"h":"ONOCLEA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the cryptogamia class and order of Filicet.

The latter constitute an order in the class of amphibious animals. They are covered with scales, breathe by means of lungs, and are destitute of feet and fins.\n\nThe hideous aspect of some of the species, and the poisonous properties of others, long contributed to prevent any deliberate investigation of their structure, constitution, and modes of existence. Hence, the ancients, who at best had very imperfect notions of classification, sometimes indicate different species under the same name, or bestow different appellations on the same species, and moreover blend their vague descriptions with the embellishments or absurdities of fable.\n\nAmong the moderns, few naturalists have directed their researches to the history of serpents. \"It must be acknowledged,\" observes Dr Rusell, \"that it offers no attractive allurements; and that those who from other avocations, can only spare transient attention to subjects of natural history, are more likely to prefer objects less disgusting, and experiments accompanied with less cruelty and personal danger. Even the eager and resolute naturalist has to contend with many difficulties in this path of research. He cannot, at once, divest himself of the abhorrence, next to innate, of these reptiles; nor can he soon acquire a dexterity in handling them, with that calmness requisite for his own safety. The search for plants, for birds, or even insects, is comparatively pastime, or pleasurable occupation; but in the actual pursuit of the disgusting race of serpents, he stands in need of assistants, who are not at all times to be procured; and if he rely solely on the diligence of such as he may employ, he will find himself exposed to the chagrin of incessant disappointment.\"\n\nSeba has indeed presented us with a numerous catalogue; but his species are too multiplied, and his descriptions too concise. Cateby was more solicitous to design and colour his serpents, than to unfold their discriminating characters. The descriptions of Gronovius are, for the most part well and accurately detailed; but they are unprovided with the specific names.\n\nLinnaeus, availing himself of the works to which we Linnaeus have just alluded, of the discoveries of Garden, and of his own disinterment, published his method of distinguishing the species by the number of scaly plates on the abdomen, and beneath the tail. Experience has indeed proved, that these do not always constitute an infallible criterion, and that more obvious marks, such as the relative size of the head, the length of the body and tail, &c., must sometimes be referred to: it must, however, be allowed, that the celebrated Swedish naturalist paved the way to a far more accurate nomenclature of serpents than had yet appeared, and that the value of his scientific distinctions is greatly enhanced by the interesting notices on the same subject which are inserted in his Amanuensis Academicus, and in the first and second volumes of his Adolphian Museum.\n\nThe count de la C\u00e9p\u00e9de has in some respects improved La C\u00e9p\u00e9de's Linnaean arrangement, and exhibited a more complete catalogue than any of his predecessors. Dr Shaw Shaw has likewise displayed his usual sagacity in the second part of the third volume of his General Zoology, which is allotted to his exposition of the serpent tribes. To these we may add, Owen on the natural history of Owen, serpents, Klein's Tentamen Herpetologiae, Blumenbach's Klein, &c., Beytr\u00e4ge zur Naturgeschichte der Schlangen, Schneider's Allgemeine Betrachtungen \u00fcber die Eintheilung und Kennzeichen der Schlangen, Merian's Beytr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Amphibien, Laurenti's Specimen Medicum, continens Synopsis Reptilium, Bonaterrae Ophiologie, in the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, Latreille's Histoire Naturelle des Reptiles, Ruffell's Account of Indian Serpents, &c., &c.\n\nAnatomy and Physiology of Serpents.\n\nThe body of serpents is very long when compared Body, with its thickness; and is sometimes quite cylindrical, or rounded, sometimes compressed on the sides, sometimes flat on the under surface, and sometimes attenuated towards the tail. It is usually covered with scales; but sometimes naked, either rough, or slippery to the touch,\nThe trunk is that part of the body which reaches from the nape to the vent. It is fleshy, annulated, tuberculated, or wrinkled; and comprehends the back, sides, belly, anus, organs of generation, and scales. The back is the upper part of the trunk, commencing at the nape and terminating immediately above the vent. In most species it is rounded, but in some carinated or furrowed. The sides are the lateral portions of the trunk, from the extremity of the jaws to the vent. The belly, or abdomen, is the lower part of the body, from the head to the tail, the want of a diaphragm precluding a breast. The anus is an opening, usually transverse, placed at the extremity of the lower surface of the trunk, forming the line of demarcation between the latter and the tail, and affording a passage to the liquid and solid excrements. The penis of the male, and the ovary of the female, are also situated in this common vent, from which they are extended only during the season of pairing. The scales, properly so called, are round, oval, oblong, and attenuated at the extremities, rhomboidal, smooth, or carinated. The broad undivided plates on the belly and head, are termed scutes, and the smaller or divided plates beneath the tail, are called squamae subcaudales or scutella, subcaudal scales or platelets.\n\nThe tail is attenuated, obtuse, square, in the form of a triangular pyramid, flattened or compressed at the sides.\n\nAs serpents have neither limbs nor breast, the structure of their skeleton is much less complex than that of quadrupeds. The bones of the head are from eight to ten. The skull, which is sometimes flat and sometimes convex, is very hard and compact, and exhibits four principal sutures, which are with difficulty separated. The bones of the trunk consist of a series of vertebrae, incased in one another, and articulated with the ribs. The caudal vertebrae are disposed in the same manner, and provided with similar processes; but they are unconnected with ribs, and gradually diminish in size as they approach to the end of the tail. In most quadrupeds, the joints in the back-bone seldom exceed thirty or forty; whereas in serpents they often amount to 145, from the head to the vent, and 25 more from that to the tail. The number of these joints must give the back-bone a surprising degree of pliancy, which is still increased by the manner in which one is locked into the other. In man and quadrupeds, the flat surfaces of the bones are laid one against the other, and bound tight by sinews; but in serpents the bones play one within the other, like ball and socket, so that they have free motion in every direction.\n\nThe remarkable strength and agility, manifested by serpents, depend on the vigorous muscles with which they are provided. Several of these are inserted along and beneath the skull, and about the upper and lower jaws. Four, which are denominated lateral, have their origin behind the head, and descend, by each side, to the extremity of the tail. Each vertebra has also its corresponding intercostal muscle, which serves the same purpose as in other animals.\n\nThe internal organs, or viscera of individuals of this order of animals, nearly correspond to those of others, and, consequently, need not long detain us.\n\nThe brain is divided into five small portions, which are round, and somewhat elongated. The two first are placed...\nplaced between the eyes, and give origin to the olfactory nerves; other two are situated in the middle region of the skull; and the last, which is a little farther back, appears to be the commencement of the spinal marrow. The tracheal artery, composed of distinct and cartilaginous rings, has its origin at the top of the gullet, and communicates with the lungs, under the heart. The lungs are not lobed, but consist of a cellular and membranous substance, abundantly furnished with blood vessels. The oesophagus is formed of a single membrane, extends to the orifice of the stomach, is of an equal diameter throughout, and susceptible of an extraordinary degree of dilatation. The stomach, which is of a larger capacity, is formed of two concentric tunics, which closely adhere, and which are internally covered with folds or wrinkles. The heart has two ventricles, and is small in proportion to the size of the body. As the circulation of the blood is independent of the lungs, the animal is enabled to remain for a considerable time under water. It cannot, however, make this element its constant residence; because occasional supplies of fresh air are necessary to preserve in its blood those qualities which are necessary to motion and vitality. In serpents, therefore, as well as in viviparous quadrupeds, respiration is essential to life. This function they do not perform by a rapid succession of alternate dilatations and contractions of the lungs; but, having this viscus remarkably large in proportion to their bodies, they are able to fill it with a considerable provision of air; and, as they expire very slowly, some time will elapse before they are obliged to inspire again. The intestinal canal is narrow, sinuous, and internally divided by many transverse partitions. The kidneys are particularly large, and composed of small continuous glands, blended with excretory vessels.\n\nThat animals of the serpent kind possess the use of the five external senses, can scarcely admit of dispute. We have indeed remarked, that most of the species appear to want an external auditory passage; but it is certain that they are often directed to birds, by listening to their notes; and many indicate a degree of sensibility to the sounds of musical instruments. Their sense of smell, with a few remarkable exceptions, is neither very active nor acute; but, in most, that of sight is quick and penetrating. The soft and nervous texture of the tongue and palate would induce a suspicion, that they enjoy the sense of taste in a pre-eminent degree; yet, as they generally swallow their food in large portions, they seldom avail themselves of the delicacy of these organs. Being unprovided with feet, hands, or feelers, their sense of touch is probably very imperfect; and even when they twine very closely round an object, the interposition of their scales will render their feeling of its surface vague and obtuse.\n\nThe sexual union of serpents usually takes place in the sunny days of spring, is very close and ardent, and varies in duration from an hour to several days, according to the species, but terminates without any permanent attachment. The females of some are oviparous, and of others viviparous. The eggs of the former vary in respect of size, colour, and number, according to the species and constitution of the individual; and they are deposited, not in continuous succession, but at intervals, and sometimes with the appearance of much suffering on the part of the female. Segerus relates, that he saw a female snake, after twisting herself, and rolling on the ground in an unusual manner, bring forth an egg. He immediately took her up, and facilitated the extraction of thirteen more, the laying of all which consumed an hour and a half; for, after depositing each, she retired for some time. When he remitted his affiance, the process was more slow and difficult; and the poor animal seemed to receive his good offices with gratitude, which she expressed by gently rubbing her head against his hands. The mother never hatches these eggs, but leaves them exposed in some warm situation, as in holes with a southern aspect, on dry sand, under moss or foliage, on a dung-hill, near an oven, &c. The outer covering of the egg is a thin but compact membrane, and the young serpent is spirally rolled in its albuminous liquid. The viviparous species differ considerably, both with respect to their periods of gestation, and the number of their offspring. Thus, vipers which go about three months with young, generally breed twice a year, and produce from twenty to twenty-four; while the blind-worm, which is pregnant about a month, brings forth sometimes seven, and sometimes ten at a birth. When young serpents are hatched or produced, they are abandoned to the resources of their own instinct, and often perish before they have acquired sufficient experience to flun the snares which are laid for them by quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles.\n\nIn regard to the different stages of growth of the different species, little precise information seems to have been obtained: and, though some arrive at a very large size, their dimensions have, no doubt, been much exaggerated. The young of the viper, at the moment of parturition, measures from twelve to fifteen lines; and two or three years elapse before they are capable of reproducing their kind. Adanson however concludes, from ocular observation, that the largest serpent in Senegal may measure from forty to fifty feet in length, and from a foot to a foot and a half in breadth. Leguat affirms us, that he saw one in Java, that was fifty feet long. Carli affirms, that they grow to upwards of forty feet. Mr Wentworth, a gentleman who had large concerns in the Berbice, informs us, that he one day sent out a folder, with an Indian, to kill wild fowl for the table; and they accordingly went some miles from the fort. In pursuing their game, the Indian, who generally marched before, beginning to tire, went to rest himself on the fallen trunk of a tree, as he supposed it to be; but, when he was just going to sit down, the huge monster began to move, and the poor savage, perceiving that he had approached a Boa, dropped down in an agony. The folder, perceiving what had happened, levelled at the serpent's head, and by a lucky aim shot it dead. He continued his fire, however, until he was assured that the animal was killed; and then going up to rescue his companion, he found him killed by the fright. The animal was brought to the fort, and was found to measure thirty-five feet. Mr W. caused the skin to be stuffed, and sent it as a present to the Prince of Orange. We are told, that when Regulus led his army along the banks of the Bagrada, in Africa, an enormous serpent disputed his passage across the river. If we can give credit to Pliny, this reptile was 120 feet long, and had destroyed many of the folderies, when it was overcome in turn by the battering engines. Its spoils were carried\nIn regard to voice, some serpents are apparently silent, and others have a peculiar cry; but hissing is the sound which they most commonly utter, either as a call to their kind, or a threat to their enemies. In countries where they abound, they are generally silent in the middle of the day; but, in the cool of the evening, they issue from their retreats with continued hissings.\n\nThe masses of food which serpents are enabled to swallow, would appear quite miraculous, did we not reflect on the lax structure of their jaws, their power of crushing their victims, and the viscid humour, or saliva, which lubricates the crude morsel in its passage down an extensible oesophagus. In spite of all these circumstances, the quantity of aliment is sometimes so voluminous, that it sticks in the gullet; when only partly immersed in the stomach, and the animal lies stretched and nearly motionless, in its retreat, till the swallowed portion be digested, and the extruded half introduced, to undergo the same process. But, though serpents thus occasionally gorge themselves with food, as their blood is colder than that of most other terrestrial animals, and circulates slowly, their powers of digestion are feeble and tardy, so that they can endure weeks, and even months of abstinence. Nay, so tenacious are they of the vital principle, that they exist and grow in mephitic marshes, continue to breathe, for a considerable time, in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump, and frequently exhibit symptoms of life after one part of the body has been fevered from the other. Vipers are often kept in boxes, for six or eight months, without any food whatever; and there are little serpents sometimes sent to Europe from Cairo, which live for several years in glaases, and never eat at all.\n\nThe natural term of the existence of serpents, is not accurately known; but it has been conjectured, that some of the larger kinds may complete a century. The first failure of their strength is the almost immediate forerunner of their dissolution; for, when deprived of the requisite elasticity of frame to spring on their prey, and of the requisite force to combat their enemies, they shrink into their recesses, and die of hunger, or are easily devoured by the ichneumon, stork, and other powerful assailants.\n\nIn the more northerly and temperate regions of the globe, the serpent tribes, towards the end of autumn, fall into a state of torpor, more or less profound, according to the greater or less intensity of the cold; and in this condition they remain, nearly lifeless, till the approach of spring reanimates their stiffened frame.\n\nSoon after its resuscitation, the serpent works itself out of its old epidermis, by rubbing itself against the ground, or by wedging itself between any two substances that are sufficiently close to each other. The exuvia come off entire, being loosened first about the head; and are always found turned inside out. It is some time before the scales acquire a sufficient degree of hardness to defend the animal against external injury; and, during this interval, it generally confines itself to its retreat.\n\nGeneric and Specific Exposition of the Order.\n\nGen. I. Crotalus. Rattle-Snake.\n\nScuta on the abdomen, scuta and squamae beneath the tail, rattle terminating the Generic characters.\n\nThe animals of this genus inhabit America, where they prey on the smaller birds, lizards, and insects. They are furnished with poisonous fangs, and have a broad head, covered with large scales. Their snout is obtusely rounded.\n\nBanded Rattle-Snake, Common Rattle-Snake, or Boi-Horridus.\n\nThe characters are, 167 abdominal, and 23 sub-caudal scuta. The ordinary length of this species is from three to four or five feet, and the greatest thickness that of a man's arm. The prevailing colour is a yellowish brown, marked with cross and irregular bands of a deeper shade, and two or three longitudinal stripes from the head down the neck; the under parts are of a dingy brown, with many dusky variegations and freckles. The mouth is capable of great dilatation. The tongue is black, slender, bipartite, and inclosed in a kind of fleath, from which the snake darts forth the double point, and vibrates it with great velocity. The rattlesnake is viviparous, producing in June about twelve young, which, by September, acquire the length of about twelve inches. The, it is said to preserve from danger, like the viper in Europe, by receiving them into its mouth, and swallowing them. In confirmation of this afflention, we shall quote the words of M. de Beauvais, who, during his residence in America, bestowed particular attention on the history of amphibious reptiles.\n\nAmong the information which I endeavoured to obtain in my travels with respect to serpents in general, there was one point which greatly excited my curiosity. Several persons, and one among the rest to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for civilities and marks of friendship, which will for ever engraven on my heart, had informed me, that the female rattlesnake concealed its young ones in its body; that when they were alarmed by any noise, or by the approach of man, they took refuge in the body of their mother, into which they entered by her mouth. This fact had been already ascertained with respect to the viper of Europe; but in consequence of the unfavourable and repulsive dispositions inspired by this kind of reptile, and in order to render it still more hideous, an absurd interpretation was given to this fact. It was pretended, that this serpent eats its little ones after having given them birth. Curious to verify this fact related of the boiquirra, I was constantly occupied with this idea, and began to despair of ever making the observation, when, at a moment in which I thought the least of it, accident furnished me the means. Having fallen sick among the Indians, I found myself obliged to remain a few days with one of them in the neighbourhood of Pine-log. During my convalescence, I took a walk every morning in the neighbourhood, and one day when I was following a pretty broad path, I perceived, at a distance, a serpent lying across the road in the sun. I had a stick in my hand, and drew near to kill it; but what was my surprise, when, in the moment that I was about to give the blow\nCrotalus, the reptile perceived me, coiled up itself, and opened its large mouth, into which five serpents, which I had not till then observed, because they were lying along its body, rushed into the gulf which I had conceived opened for myself. I retired to one side, and hid myself behind a tree. The reptile had crawled a few paces, but hearing no further noise, and not perceiving me, stretched itself out afresh. In a quarter of an hour the young ones came out again. Satisfied with this observation, I advanced anew towards the animal, with intention to kill it and examine the interior of its stomach: but it did not permit me to approach so near as it did the first time, the young ones entered with still greater precipitation into their retreat, and the boiura fled into the grass. My satisfaction and astonishment were so great, that I did not think of following it.\"\n\nThe rattle consists of a number of pieces, inserted into each other, all alike in shape and size, hollow, and of a thin, elastic, brittle substance, similar to the exterior part of the scuta. Their form is nearly that of an inverted quadrilateral pyramid, with the corners rounded off. The first piece, or that nearest the body, may be considered as a kind of case, which contains the three last vertebrae of the tail, on which it appears to be moulded, and has three convex, circular elevations corresponding with them; the two last of these elevations are fitted into the two first of the next piece; so that of every piece except the last, the first only of the elevations is exposed to view, the two others being inclosed in those of the following, in which they have room to play from side to side. These several pieces have no muscles, nerves, nor ligaments, nor are they connected, either with each other, or with the body of the serpent any otherwise than by the mode of insertion already described. Thus they derive no nourishment from the animal, and are merely an appendage which can have no other motion than what is communicated to it by that of the tail. These several pieces of which the rattle consists, appear to have been separately formed.\n\nDr Van Meus imagines them to be no other than the old epidermis of the tail, which, when its nourishment is intercepted by the new skin formed beneath it, grows hard and brittle. Hence, he supposes, that whenever this part acquires a new skin, a new piece of the rattle is added to the former, which is thus detached from the vertebrae, and thrown farther from the tail. The number of these pieces, however, affords no certain criterion of the animal's age, because those which are most remote from the tail, become dry and brittle, that they are very liable to be broken off and lost.\n\nThe two principal fangs are placed without the jaws, on a separate bone, and the smaller ones attached to muscles and tendons. These fangs may be touched, or raised, at the pleasure of the animal, and are furnished with an opening near the root, and a slit towards the point, so that on pressing gently with the finger on the side of the gum, the poison, which is yellowish, is perceived to issue from the hollow of the tooth, through the slit. The vehicle which contains the poison, is externally of a triangular form, and of a tendinous texture; internally, it is cellular; and its anterior part terminates in a small duct, communicating with the faucius which covers the perforated teeth. It is furnished with a constrictor muscle, for the purpose of expressing its contents. The virulence of the latter may be inferred from various experiments reported in the Philosophical Transactions, and other publications. A rattlesnake of about four feet long, being fastened to a stake, bit three dogs, the first of which died in less than a quarter of a minute; the second, which was bitten a short time afterwards, in about two hours, and the third, which was bitten about half an hour afterwards, showed the visible effects of the poison in three hours, and likewise died. Other experiments were instituted; and lastly, in order to try if the snake could poison itself, it was provoked to bite a part of its own body, and actually expired in less than twelve minutes. Our limits will not permit us to enumerate various other instances of the almost instantaneous effects of this poison, which is most to be dreaded in hot weather, and when the animal is much irritated. The rattlesnake, however, is rather afraid of man, and will not venture to attack him unless provoked. It moves slowly, for the most part with its head on the ground; but if alarmed, it throws its body into a circle, coiling itself, with the head erect in the centre, and with its eyes flaming in a terrific manner. In cases of flight bites, the Indians usually suck the wound. They have likewise recourse to the juices of various herbs, and to the root of polygala seneca; but these applications produce little effect, without scarification and ligatures. According to Dr Barton, the rude and simple practice of the western settlers, is, first, to throw a tight ligature above the part into which the poison has been introduced, at least as often as the circumstances of the case admit of such an application. The wound is next scarified, and a mixture of salt and gunpowder, or either of these articles, separately, laid on the part. Over the whole is put a piece of the bark of juglans alba, or white walnut-tree, which acts as a blister. At the same time, a decoction or infusion of one or more stimulant vegetables, with large quantities of milk, are administered internally: the doctor is, nevertheless, of opinion, that the beneficial effects of this mode of treatment are chiefly to be ascribed to the external applications. If the gang has penetrated a vein or artery, or attacked the region of the throat, the bite commonly proves fatal, and the patient expires in dreadful agony. \"Where a rattlesnake, (says Cateby,) with full force, penetrates with his deadly fangs, and pricks a vein, or artery, inevitable death ensues; and that, as I have often seen, in less than two minutes.\" \"The Indians, (he continues,) know their destiny the minute they are bit; and, when they perceive it mortal, apply no remedy, concluding all efforts in vain.\" Dr Barton, however, inclines to think, that this affirmation should be received with considerable limitation, and that the application of ligatures, &c., even in cases apparently the most desperate, should not be neglected. According to Clavigero, the most effectual method is thought to be, the holding of the wounded part some time in the earth. But if the poison be once received into the general mass of the blood, it is almost needless to have recourse to medicines. A considerable degree of nausea is usually the first alarming symptom; the pulse becomes full, strong, and greatly agitated; the whole body swells; the eyes are suffused with blood; a hemorrhage frequently proceeds from the eyes, nose and ears; large quantities of blood are sometimes thrown out on the surface of the body, in the form of sweat; the teeth vacillate in their sockets; and the pains and groans of\nof the unhappy sufferer too plainly indicate, that the moment of dissolution is near at hand.\n\nThe following remarkable case is related by Mr Hector St John. A farmer was one day mowing with his negroes, when he accidentally trod on a rattle-snake, which immediately turned on him, and bit his boot. At night, when he went to bed, he was attacked with fevers; his body swelled, and before a physician could be called in, he died. All his neighbours were surprised at his sudden death; but the body was interred without examination. A few days after, one of the sons put on the father's boots, and, at night, when he pulled them off, he was seized with the same symptoms, and died on the following morning. The physician arrived, and, unable to divine the cause of so singular a disorder, ferociously pronounced both the father and son to have been bewitched. At the tale of the effects, a neighbour purchased the boots, and on putting them on, experienced the like dreadful symptoms with the father and son. A skilful physician, however, being sent for, who had heard of the foregoing accidents, suspected the cause, and by applying proper remedies, recovered the patient. The fatal boots were now carefully examined, and the two fangs of the snake were discovered to have been left in the leather, with the poison-bladders adhering to them. They had penetrated entirely through, and both the father and son had imperceptibly scratched themselves with their point in pulling off the boots.\n\nWe are informed by Dr Barton, that a gentleman of Philadelphia had a large rattle-snake brought to him alive, which he so managed by a string, that he could easily lead it into, or out of a clothe cage. On the first day, he suffered this snake to bite a chicken, which had been allured to the mouth of the cage by crumbs of bread. In a few hours, the bird mortified, and died. On the second day, another chicken was bitten in the same manner, and survived the injury much longer than the first. On the third day, the experiment was made on a third chicken, which swelled much, but, nevertheless, recovered. On the fourth day, several chickens were suffered to be bitten, without receiving any injury. These simple experiments enable us to assign a reason, why persons who have actually been bitten by the rattle-snake, have sometimes experienced very inconsiderable, or no bad consequences from the wound; they shew in what manner many vegetables have acquired a reputation for curing the bites of serpents, without our being obliged to impeach the veracity of those from whom our information is derived; and lastly, they teach us the physiological fact, that the poison of this reptile is secreted very slowly.\n\nIt has been observed by M. Gauthier, that the poison stains linen with a green hue, which is deeper in proportion as the linen has been impregnated with lixivium.\n\nThe pretended fascinating power of the rattle-snake is now generally discredited; and Dr Barton, professor of natural history in the university of Pennsylvania, reduces the whole to the fluttering of old birds in defence of their young, and too near an approach to the formidable enemy. In confirmation of this opinion, he observes, that he can trace no allusion to the alleged fascinating faculty, in the ancient writers of Greece and Rome; that he doubts if it is credited by the American Indians; that Linnaeus was extremely credulous; that the enchanting power of the rattle-snake is questioned by some eminent European naturalists; that the breath of this reptile is not remarkably infectious or pestiferous; that it often fails in catching birds; that the latter, and squirrels, are not its principal food; and that it is even devoured by some of the larger kinds of birds.\n\nMr Peale, an intelligent and zealous naturalist, kept a rattle-snake alive for five years and a half. \"Curious to enquire,\" (says M. Beauvois), \"how this animal sizes his prey, he (Mr Peale) has confined several birds in the same cage with him, and the hungry reptile has made many attempts to take hold of the bird. This experiment has been repeated many times, and every time with the same effect. I have seen myself, one of these birds in the cage; but whether the reptile was not hungry, or was sensible of its want of power, it remained perfectly tranquil, while the bird was perfectly at ease. It gave no indication which could make it be believed that it was either enchanted or affrighted; and the air did not appear different, if we might judge from its behaviour, from that which it found in an ordinary clothe cage. The bird remained two days in the same situation, without the least attention paid to it by the reptile, who, in the meantime, ate a dead one which was presented to him.\"\n\n\"Another living bird was put into the cage with the serpent: far from being alarmed, it amused itself with pecking in the bottom, and picking up a few grains which it found there: often changing place in its accustomed manner, and even resting itself on the back of the boioura, which made no extraordinary movements. This experiment was made several times.\n\n\"Mr Peale, his children, and myself, have often examined the reptile. We never perceived it to send out the slightest suffocating odour. It is in vain to object, that the living birds thus given it were not of the kind fitted for its nourishment; for it has eaten the same birds, when presented to it dead, and it is not useless to remark, that it never refused one of them.\"\n\nCateby mentions an individual of this species, which was about eight feet long, and weighed from eight to nine pounds. It was seen gliding into a gentleman's house, and terrified all the domestic animals.\n\nMr St. John, whom we have quoted above, once saw a tamed rattle-snake, as gentle as it is possible to conceive a reptile to be. It went to the water, and swam wherever it pleased; and when the boys to whom it belonged called it back, their summons was readily obeyed. They often stroked it with a soft brush; and this friction seemed to cause the most pleasing sensations; for it would turn on its back to enjoy it, as a cat does before the fire. We need scarcely add, that it had been deprived of its fangs.\n\nRattle-snakes abound in America, from Brazil to near Lake Champlain: but they are gradually disappearing in the more populous districts. According to Pennant, they affect woods and lofty hills, especially where the strata are rocky or chalky, as at the falls near Niagara. They particularly frequent the sides of rills, to prey on such small animals as resort thither to quench their thirst. In summer, they are generally found in pairs; in winter, they collect in multitudes, and retire underground, beyond the reach of foot. Tempted by the warmth of a spring day, they often creep out, weak and languid. A person has seen a piece of ground covered with them, and killed with a rod between sixty and\nand seventy till, overpowered with the stench, he was obliged to retire. They are most easily dispatched by a blow with a stick on the spine.\n\nThe American Indians often regale on the rattle-snake. When they find it asleep, they put a small forked stick over its neck, which they keep immovably fixed to the ground, giving the snake a piece of leather to bite; and this they pull back several times with great force, until they perceive that the poison fangs are torn out. They then cut off the head, skin the body, and cook it, as we do eels. The flesh is said to be white and excellent. Hogs also sometimes devour the rattle-snake; but horses, dogs, and most other animals, regard it with antipathy and horror.\n\nStriped Rattle-snake, or White Rattle-snake.\u2014172 abdominal, and 21 subcaudal scuta. From a foot and a half, to four feet and a half long. Distinguished from the preceding by a pattern of pale yellow streaks, forming a series of large rhombs, or lozenges, down the back. Has often been confounded with the former, on account of the same general aspect, constitution, and habits.\n\nWood Rattle-snake.\u2014165 abdominal, and 39 subcaudal scuta. Of a lighter tinge than the two preceding, and marked with yellowish variegations on the back.\u2014This species has been hitherto very imperfectly described; and Seba erroneously quotes it as a native of Ceylon.\n\nMiliary, or Small Rattle-snake.\u2014132 abdominal, and 32 subcaudal scuta. Gray, with a triple row of black spots, and a red spot between each of the dorsal ones. The smallest of the genus; its ordinary length being about eighteen inches. From this circumstance, and the faint sound of its rattle, it is more dangerous than the larger species. It is also alleged, that its bite is more active. Its poison, according to Lebeau, is most successfully combated by the volatile alkali. It is confined to the temperate regions of North America, particularly to Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida.\n\nBlack-tailed Rattle-snake.\u2014170 abdominal, and 26 subcaudal scuta. The head greenish-gray, with two brown and oblong spots on the hinder part. The body of a reddish gray, speckled with brown points, and crossed by 24 lengthened patches, or bands, brown, and irregular, and accompanied, on each side, by two spots of a brighter colour. The back is marked by a longitudinal, fawn-coloured stripe. Scales very numerous, rhomboidal, and carinated.\u2014From three to four feet long; a very venomous species; discovered by Boft, in Carolina, and described in Daudin's Natural History of Reptiles.\n\nGen. 2. BOA.\n\nCharacters. Scuta on the abdomen, and under the tail; but no rattle.\n\nThe boa tribe of serpents is very numerous, and contains some species which are remarkable for their huge dimensions. Their head is covered, like that of the crotalus; but their tail terminates in a point. Their immense size has rendered them the objects of terror rather than of observation to mankind; while the quantity of food requisite for their sustenance, has precluded their multiplication within a limited range of country. Hence, a considerable degree of confusion attaches to their history; and a rational suspicion arises, that, with the progress of culture and population, some of the more formidable forts have either been exterminated, or driven from the haunts of men. Some naturalists have asserted, that individuals belonging to this genus have been found in Spain, Italy, and the south of France; but they appear to have mistaken some of the larger forts of coluber for the boa, which last is a native of Asia, Africa, and America.\n\nGreat or Constrictor Boa.\u2014240 abdominal, and 60 Constrictor, subcaudal scuta. The more ordinary disposition of its colouring is yellowish gray with a large, chestnut-coloured, chain-like pattern down the back, and triangular spots on the sides. A considerable degree of variety, however, is occasioned by the circumstances of age, sex, and climate; and even the number of scuta is by no means constant. Nature has bestowed on this celebrated reptile, uncommon strength and beauty, but has wisely withheld from it the poisonous properties of some of the smaller species. It frequently attains to twenty, or even thirty feet in length. Except, however, when stimulated by the calls of hunger, it is a sluggish and harmless animal, affecting most and lazy situations, and, occasionally, devouring large animals, which it crushes in its contorted folds. In the German Ephemerides, we have an account of a combat between one of these huge serpents and a buffalo, by a person who affirms us, that he was himself a spectator. The serpent had for some time been waiting near the brink of a pool, in expectation of prey, when a buffalo was the first animal that appeared. Having darted on the affrighted beast, it instantly began to wrap him round in its voluminous twilights, and, at every twist, the bones of the buffalo were heard to crack almost as loud as the report of a gun. It was in vain that the quadruped struggled and bellowed; its enormous enemy twisted it so closely, that at length all its bones were crushed to pieces, like those of a malefactor on the wheel, and the whole body reduced to one uniform mass. The serpent then untwined its folds, to swallow its prey at leisure. To prepare for this, and also to make it slip down more smoothly, it licked the whole body over, and smeared it with a mucilaginous matter. It then began to swallow it at the end that offered the least resistance, the throat dilating to such an extraordinary degree, as to admit a substance which was thrice its own thickness.\n\nIn the Bombay Courier, of August 31, 1799, it is stated, that as a Malay crew anchored for the night, close under the island of Celebes, one of the crew went on shore, in quest of betel nut in the woods, and on his return, lay down to sleep, as it is supposed, on the beach. In the course of the night, he was heard by his comrades, to scream out for assistance. They immediately went on shore; but an immense snake of this species had already crushed him to death. The attention of the monster being entirely occupied with his prey, the people went boldly up to it, cut off its head, and took both it and the body of the man on board their boat. The snake had seized the poor fellow by the right wrist, where the marks of the teeth were very distinct; and the mangled corpse bore evident signs of being crushed. The length of the snake was about thirty feet, its thickness equal to that of a moderately sized man; and, on extending its jaws, the gape was found.\nfound wide enough to admit a body of the size of a man's head.\n\nThe female deposits a considerable number of eggs, which seldom exceed three inches in their greatest diameter, on the sand, or under leaves exposed to the sun's rays.\n\nIn some districts of Africa, the great boa is regarded as an object of veneration, and on the coast of Mozambique, is worshipped as a god.\n\nIn a very interesting notice of this species, communicated to us by John Corfe Scott, Esq., mention is made of a live individual, which was discovered in a field, near the cattle, by some labourers, in the province of Tipperah in Bengal. This snake, which measured fifteen feet and three inches in length, and eighteen inches in circumference, was stunned by repeated blows, before it could be secured, and tied with cords to a long bamboo. It was pretty active after it was untied, and made frequent darts at any person coming near it. On presenting a long stick, it repeatedly feigned and bit it with great fierceness. On dissection, the heart was found to be of the size of a sheep's, with the communication open between the two ventricles. The liver was small in proportion, being about the size of the human pancreas, and, like it, divided into several lobes. The oesophagus, from the mouth to the pylorus, measured nine feet three inches, and its width was sufficient to admit a man's head with ease. The head was small, in proportion to the size of the animal, the eyes were dark and heavy, and the nostrils large; but there was no perceptible organ of hearing. From the mechanism of the jaws, they were capable of being distended so as to admit a substance or animal much thicker than the snake itself. This mechanism, and the absence of grinders, obviously prove, that the food is swallowed entire, without mastication. In a gorged individual of this species, Mr S. found an entire guana, and in another, a fawn, of a year old; but the bones of these quadrupeds were unbroken.\n\nSpotted Boa.\u2014250 abdominal, and 70 subcaudal scuta. Cinereous, with large, round, black spots on the back, and smaller ones, with white centres, on the sides, and oblong markings, interspersed with smaller variegations on the abdomen. Of a size scarcely inferior to the preceding, and of similar manners. It is a native of several parts of South America, and, like other snakes, occasionally eaten by the Indians.\n\nRinged Boa.\u2014265 abdominal, and 57 subcaudal scuta. General coat ferruginous, with large dark rings on the back, and blackish kidney-shaped spots, with white centres on the sides. The aboma of several writers. Grows to a large size, and is a native of South America, where it is treated with divine honours.\n\nCanine or Green Boa.\u2014203 abdominal, and 77 subcaudal scuta. Green, with cross, waving, and white dorsal bands. It has its specific name from the form of its head, which resembles that of a dog. Though destitute of poison fangs, it inflicts a severe bite, when provoked. It measures from four to twelve feet in length, inhabits South America, and is celebrated for its beauty.\n\nEmbroidered Boa.\u2014A remarkably elegant species, native of the East Indies, and omitted by Linn\u00e6us. White, with a cinereous tinge on the back, and the body marked with black lace-like variegations.\n\nGarden Boa.\u2014290 abdominal, and 123 subcaudal Hortulana scuta. Yellowish gray, with brown variegations, resembling in form the parterres of an old-fashioned garden, the body somewhat compressed, and the sides marked with cuneiform spots. From two to three or four feet long, and native of South America.\n\nFasciata Boa.\u2014233 abdominal, and 36 subcaudal Fasciata scuta. Yellow, with dusky blue transverse bands. The body somewhat triangular, upwards of five feet in length, and five inches in the thickest part. Native of India, and very poisonous.\n\nAn individual of this species was sent to Dr Ruffel, in a very languid and emaciated state. Being set at liberty, it remained for some time without moving, but soon began to crawl slowly towards a dark corner. A chicken being presented, it seemed not to regard it, though the bird fluttered about it, and even rested a toe on its head. The chicken was then put on the snake's back, and clung so fast with its toes, that, when attempted to be separated, the snake was dragged a little way, without offering to resent the insult. An hour after, the chicken was again presented; but the snake shewing no disposition to bite, its jaws were forced apart, and the naked thigh of the chicken placed, that the jaws closed on part of it. The chicken, when engaged, shewed immediate symptoms of poison: it coughed, purged once or twice, and was not able to stand. In the course of the first ten minutes, after several ineffectual efforts to rise, it rested its beak on the ground; and the head was seized with paralysis. After fifteen minutes, it shewed a frequent disposition to lie down; but remained crouched some minutes longer. In twenty minutes, it lay down on one side, and convulsions supervening soon after, it expired within twenty minutes.\n\nViperine Boa.\u2014209 abdominal, and 19 subcaudal Viperina scuta. Gray, with a black waving dorsal band, edged with white; the sides spotted with black. About a foot and a half in length, including the tail, which is only one inch and a half long. Native of India, where its bite is said to produce a slow wasting of the fingers and toes. As, however, it has no fangs, and produces no deleterious effects on brute animals: the truth of the report seems to be very questionable.\n\nLineated Boa.\u2014209 abdominal, and 47 subcaudal Lineata scuta. Blackish line, with white dotted, transverse, arched lines, and whitish abdomen. Slender, native of India, and highly poisonous.\n\nAnnulated Boa.\u2014About two feet in length, somewhat ferruginous, with black rounded spots, included in rings, on the back, reniform ocellated spots on the sides, and waving dusky variegations on the abdomen. Native of South America, figured by Madame Merian, and preserved in the Hunterian Museum, at Glasgow.\n\nThe other species belonging to this genus are, erythris, ophryas, regia, murina, horatta, hipnale, contortrix, and palpebralis.\n\nGen. 3. Coluber, Snake (properly so called).\n\nScuta, or undivided plates, under the abdomen; squamae, Characters, or broad alternate scales, under the tail. The lat.\nter, although alternate, are reckoned by pairs; but, in many instances, the number is still undetermined, and it sometimes varies in the same species.\n\nThis tribe contains about 200 species, which greatly differ from one another in size and habit. The poisonous sorts, which constitute about one-fifth of the whole, are generally distinguished from the rest by their large, flattened, subcylindrical heads, and rather short bodies and tails; whereas most of the harmless species have small heads, with longer bodies and tails in proportion. Laurenti and Latreille have ranged the former under the genus *Vipera*, and the latter under that of *Coluber*: but Linnaeus, Daubenton, La C\u00e9p\u00e9de, &c., include both sorts under *Coluber*. This family of serpents is widely diffused over various quarters of the world.\n\n**Common Viper.**\u2014146 abdominal scuta, 39 subcaudal scales. Attains to the length of two, or even three feet. The ground colour of the body is a dingy yellow, deeper in the female than in the male. The back is marked with rhomboidal, as the sides are with triangular, black spots. Its black belly, the greater thickness of the head, and the more abrupt termination of the tail, sufficiently distinguish it from the common snake, with which it has been often confounded.\n\nThe viper arrives at maturity in five or seven years, and produces 10 or 12 live young at the end of the second or third. Mr. White of Selborne killed and cut up a pregnant female, and found in the abdomen 15 young ones, about the size of full grown earth-worms. No sooner were they freed from confinement, than they twisted and wriggled about, set themselves up, and gaped very wide when touched with a stick, exhibiting manifest tokens of menace and defiance, though as yet no fangs were visible, even with the help of glasses.\u2014That the young, for some time after birth, retreat, when alarmed, into the mouth of the mother, seems to be a fact satisfactorily ascertained.\n\nVipers are capable of supporting long abstinence, feed on reptiles, worms, and young birds, and become torpid in winter. Their poison rarely proves fatal to man, and is most successfully counteracted by olive oil, thoroughly rubbed on the wounded part. They are usually caught by wooden tongs, at the end of the tail, as, in that position, they cannot wind themselves up to injure their enemy. Their flesh was formerly in high esteem, as a remedy for various diseases, particularly as a restorative. Of late years, however, it has lost much of its ancient credit, and is rarely prescribed by modern practitioners.\n\nThe common viper inhabits Europe and Siberia, and is by no means uncommon in Great Britain, being the only poisonous animal in the island, frequenting dry and stony districts, and especially the chalky countries. It abounds in some of the Hebrides, and is called *adder* by the Scots.\n\nThis species is subject to several varieties, which we cannot stop to enumerate. The *adder*, or black viper, resembles the *berus*, in almost every particular but colour; though Linnaeus, and other eminent naturalists, rank it as a distinct species.\n\n**American Black Viper.**\u2014About the length of the preceding, but much thicker, black, and remarkable for the largeness of its head, which it defends, with a horrid hiss, when irritated. Its bite is reckoned as dangerous as that of the rattlesnake. It is a native of Carolina, chiefly frequenting higher grounds.\n\n**Egyptian Viper.**\u2014118 abdominal scuta, and 22 subcaudal scales. Somewhat ferruginous, spotted with brown; whitish beneath, with a short mucronated tail. Rather smaller than the common species. Imported in considerable quantities to Venice, for the use of the apothecaries in the composition of theriacs, &c. Native of Egypt, and supposed by some to be the *asp* of Cleopatra; but it is very difficult to ascertain the true *asp* of the ancients.\n\n**Charasian Viper.**\u2014Rufous, with the snout acuminated above, and the body marked with short, subconfluent, dusky, and transverse streaks. Nearly allied to the common species, and described by Charas, a celebrated anatomist of serpents, in his day, but who contended, in opposition to Redi, that the symptoms caused by the viperine bite, proceeded from what he termed the enraged spirits of the creature, and not from the supposed poisonous fluid.\n\n**Redi's Viper.**\u2014152 abdominal scuta, and 32 subcaudal scales. Of an iron brown colour, with a quadruple transverse series of short, subconfluent, brown streaks on the back. In other respects nearly allied to the common viper, but said to be more poisonous. It occurs in Austria and Italy, and is the sort which Redi chiefly employed in his experiments relative to animal poison.\n\n**Afp.**\u2014155 abdominal scuta, and 37 subcaudal scales. Affinis. Somewhat rufous, with roundish, alternate, dusky spots on the back, and subconfluent ones near the tail. About three feet long, the head rather large, and covered with small carinated scales. Native of France, particularly of the northern provinces of that country. It is very doubtful if this be the genuine *coluber alpis* (Lin.) and still more so if it be the *asp* of the ancients.\n\n**Greek Viper.**\u2014155 abdominal scuta, and 46 subcaudal scales. Labetinus. Gray, with a fourfold series of transverse spots, those on the middle yellowish, and those on the sides dusky. Nearly a cubit in length, very thick towards the middle, and the head large and depressed. Inhabits Greece and the Grecian islands. According to Forficul, its bite proves fatal by inducing insuperable sleep.\n\n**Cerastes, or Horned Viper.**\u2014150 abdominal plates, Cerastes, and 25 subcaudal scales. Pale yellowish, or reddish brown, with a few round, distant, or oblong spots, of a deeper tinge, scattered along the upper parts of the body, and the belly of a pale leaden hue. The two curved processes, situated above the eyes, give the animal a more than ordinary appearance of malignity. Its length varies from about 15 inches to two feet. It is found in many parts of Africa, especially affecting dry places, and sandy deserts, and inflicting a dangerous wound on those who happen to approach it.\n\n**Horn-nose Snake.**\u2014127 abdominal plates, 32 subcaudal scales. Naficornis. Olive brown, with blackish variegations, a row of pale dorsal spots, surrounded by black, and a waving pale band on the sides. This fierce and forbidding species, which has its denomination from two large and pointed processes on the tip of the nose, is supposed to inhabit the interior parts of Africa.\n\n**Megera, or Spear-headed Snake.**\u2014224 abdominal plates, Megara.\nO P H I O L O G Y.\n\nCaluber. p'tes, and 68 subcaudal scales. Brown, with yellow variegations, flat cordate head, and a large orifice on each side, between the eyes and nostrils. Native of Martinico, whence it is frequently called yellow Martinico snake. Measures, when full grown, five or six feet, has very large fangs, and inflicts a dangerous wound.\n\nSpectacle Snake, or Cobra de Capello.\u2014193 abdominal plates, 65 subcaudal scales. \"Its general length (says Dr Shaw), seems to be three or four feet, and the diameter of the body about an inch and a quarter: the head is rather small than large, and is covered on the fore part with large smooth scales; resembling, in this respect, the majority of innoxious serpents: the back part, sides, and neck, with smaller ovate scales; and the remainder of the animal, on the upper parts, with small, distinct, oval scales, not ill resembling the general form of a grain of rice. At a small distance beyond the head is a lateral swelling or dilatation of the skin, which is continued to the distance of about four inches downwards, where the outline gradually sinks into the cylindric form of the rest of the body. This part is extensible, at the pleasure of the animal; and, when viewed from above, while in its most extended state, is of a somewhat cordated form, or wider at the upper than at the lower part: it is marked above by a very large and conspicuous patch or spot, greatly resembling the figure of a pair of spectacles; the mark itself being white, with black edges, and the middle of each of the rounded parts black. This mark is more or less distinct in different individuals, and also varies occasionally in size and form, and in some is even altogether wanting. The usual colour of the animal is a pale ferruginous brown above, the under parts being of a bluish white, sometimes slightly tinged with pale brown or yellow: the tail, which is of a moderate length, tapers gradually, and terminates in a slender sharp-pointed extremity.\n\n\"This formidable reptile has obtained its Portuguese title of cobra de capello, or hooded snake, from the appearance which it presents when viewed in front in an irritated state, or when prepared to bite; at which time it bends the head rather downwards, and seems hooded, as it were, in some degree, by the expanded skin of the neck. In India it is everywhere exhibited publicly as a show, and is, of course, more universally known in that country than almost any other of the race of reptiles. It is carried about in a covered basket, and so managed by its proprietors as to assume, when exhibited, a kind of dancing motion; raising itself up on its lower part, and alternately moving its head and body from side to side for some minutes, to the sound of some musical instrument which is played during the time. The Indian jugglers, who thus exhibit the animal, first deprive it of its fangs, by which means they are secured from the danger of its bite.\"\n\nThe cobra de capello is one of the most formidable and dangerous of the serpent tribe, though it is devoured with impunity by the viverra ichneumon. Dr Ruffel describes ten varieties of this species, and enters into many curious details relative to the effects of its poison on dogs and other animals. He never knew it prove mortal to a dog in less than 27 minutes, nor to a chicken in less than half a minute. Hence its poison, fatal as it is, seems to be less speedy in its operation than that of the rattlesnake.\n\nRuffelian Snake.\u2014168 abdominal plates, 59 subcaudal scales. Brownish yellow; spots on the back acutely ovate, blackish, and edged with white; those on the sides smaller. About four feet long; native of India, and very poisonous. A chicken bitten in the pinion, by an individual of this species, was instantly infected, seized with convulsions, and expired in 33 seconds. Immediately after the chicken, a stout dog was bitten in the thigh. Within less than five minutes he appeared stupified; the thigh was drawn up, and he frequently moved it, as if in pain. He remained, however, standing, and ate some bread that was offered to him. In about 10 minutes the thigh became paralytic; in 15 minutes he entirely lost the use of it, and lay down howling, in a dismal manner, frequently licking the wound, and making, at intervals, ineffectual attempts to rise. In 19 minutes, after a short cessation, he again began to howl, moaned often, and breathed laboriously, till his jaws closed. The few succeeding minutes were pained, alternately, in agony and stupor; and, in 26 minutes after the bite, he expired. A second dog, of much smaller size, was next bitten, and expired in the space of six hours. A rabbit was next exposed to the bite, and died in less than an hour. After this, another chicken was bitten in the pinion, and expired in less than six minutes. These experiments were all made with the same snake, in the course of the same morning.\n\nCrimson-sided Snake.\u2014188 abdominal and 7 anal Porphyria plates, 45 subcaudal scales. Violet black, with the abdomen and sides of a beautiful crimson, the plates margined with black. A singular and elegant species, with the proportions nearly those of the common English snake; poisonous; and a native of New Holland.\n\nHomachate Snake.\u2014132 abdominal plates, 43 subcaudal scales. Red, clouded with white above, yellowish white beneath. Two feet or more in length; tail extremely short, and tapering to a point. Native of India; elegant, and poisonous.\n\nWater Viper.\u2014Brown above, banded with black and yellow beneath. \"This serpent (says Cateby) is called, in Carolina, the water rattlesnake; not that it hath a rattle, but is a large snake, and coloured not much unlike the rattlesnake, and the bite said to be as mortal. This snake frequents the water, and is never seen at any great distance from it: the back and head are brown; the belly transversely marked with black and yellow alternately, as are the sides of the neck; the neck is small, the head large, and armed with the like destructive weapons as the rattlesnake. It is very nimble, and particularly dexterous in catching fish. In summer great numbers are seen lying on the branches of trees hanging over rivers, from which, at the approach of a boat, they drop down into the water, and often into the boat, on the men's heads. They lie in this manner to surprise either birds or fish, after which last they plunge, and pursue them with great swiftness, and catch some of a large size, which they carry on shore, and swallow whole. One of these I surprized swimming ashore, with a large catfish in its mouth. The tail is small towards the end, and terminates in a blunt horny point, about half an inch in length, and which, though harmless,\nharmless, is considered as of dreadful efficacy by the credulous vulgar, who believe, that the animal is able, with this weapon, not only to kill men and other animals, but even to destroy a tree by wounding it with it; the tree withering, turning black, and dying.\"\n\nSuperb Snake.\u2014White, the head variegated with black, and the body marked above by a quintuple series of ocellated red spots. About two feet long, and poisonous.\n\nArgus Snake.\u2014Chestnut brown, yellow beneath, and banded above, by transverse rows of ocellated red spots. Above five feet in length; native of Arabia and Brazil, and very poisonous.\n\nJava Snake.\u2014512 abdominal plates, 93 subcaudal scales. Gray, the head striped with blue, and the body crossed by blue stripes, with gold-colored edges. Frequent in the rice fields of Java, where it grows to the length of nine feet; but, in the more elevated and wooded situations, it attains to a still greater size, and is capable of devouring some of the larger animals. Splendid and innoxious.\n\nCommon, or Ringed Snake.\u2014170 abdominal plates, 60 subcaudal scales. Olive brown, with a black patch, accompanied by a yellow one, on each side of the neck, a row of narrow black spots down each side, and bulky abdomen.\n\nThis species is pretty generally diffused over Europe, and is not uncommon in our own island, affecting moist and warm woods, basking or sleeping in the sunshine, and becoming torpid in winter. The female deposits a chain of from 12 to 20 eggs, about the size of those of the blackbird, connected by bunches of a gluey matter, in dunghills, or warm recesses, near stagnant waters. The young come forth in the following spring. The common snake reappears in March or April, when it casts its skin so completely, that the spoil exhibits even the exterior pellicle of the eye. To adopt the language of Mr White, in his Naturalist's Calendar, \"It would be a most entertaining sight, could a person be an eyewitness to such a feat, and see the snake in the act of changing his garment. As the convexity of the eyes in the trough is now inward, that circumstance alone is a proof that the skin has been turned; not to mention that now, the present inside is much darker than the outer. If you look through the scales of the snake's eye from the concave side, viz., as the reptile used them, they lessen objects much. Thus it appears, that snakes crawl out of the mouth of their own troughs, and quit the tail part last, just as eels are skimmed by a cookmaid. While the scales of the eyes are growing loose, and a new skin is forming, the creature, in appearance, must be blind, and find itself in a very awkward and uneasy situation.\"\n\nThis species occasionally frequents the water, and preys chiefly on frogs, mice, small birds, insects, worms, &c. It is not only perfectly harmless, but even capable of being domesticated. Mr White mentions, that he knew a gentleman who had one in his house quite tame. Though usually as sweet as any other animal, yet, whenever a stranger, or a dog or cat entered, it would begin to hiss, and soon filled the room with an almost insupportable odor. Mr Revett Sheppard of Caius college, Cambridge, had a common snake in his rooms near three months. \"He kept it (says Mr Bingley) in a box of bran; and, during all that time, he never could discover that it ate any thing, although he Coluber frequently put both eggs and frogs, the favorite food of this species, into the box. Whenever he was in the room he used to let the animal out of its prison; it would first crawl several times round the floor, apparently with a desire to escape; and when it found its attempts fruitless, it would climb up the tables and chairs, and not unfrequently even up the chair of its owner as he sat at his table. At length it became familiar as to lie in a serpentine form on the upper bar of his chair: it would crawl through his fingers, if held at a little distance before its head, or lie at full length upon his table, while he was writing or reading, for an hour or more at a time. When first brought into the room, it used to hiss and dart out its forked tongue; but in no instance emitted any unpleasant vapour. It was, in all its actions, remarkably cleanly. Sometimes it was indulged with a run upon the grass, in the court of the college; and sometimes with a swim in a large basin of water, which it seemed to enjoy very much. When this gentleman left the university, he gave his bedmaker orders to turn it out into the fields, which, he believes, was done.\"\n\nBlack Snake.\u2014186 abdominal plates, 92 subcaudal scales. Glossy black, with a very long slender body. Five or six feet long, and not venomous, though often confounded by the ignorant and the timid with the rattlesnake. Native of North America. Its speed and activity, according to Brickell, are astonishing. Sometimes it will climb trees in quest of the tree-frog, or, for other prey, glide at full length, along the ground: on other occasions it presents itself half erect, and appears to great advantage. It is fond of milk, that it has been seen eating it out of the same dish with children, though they often gave it blows with their spoons on the head when it was too greedy. It persecutes rats with wonderful agility, pursuing them even to the roofs of barns and outhouses, and is therefore a great favorite among the Americans.\n\nFasciated or Wampum Snake.\u2014Blue above, paler, Fasciatus, and variegated with brighter blue beneath. Its colours resemble those of the strings of Indian money, called wampum, composed of shells cut into regular pieces, and strung with a mixture of blue and white. Native of Carolina and Virginia, sometimes growing to the length of five feet, and perfectly innocent.\n\nBlue Green Snake.\u2014217 abdominal plates, 122 subcaudal scales. Bright blue green, with a purple tinge on the back, and whitish abdomen. A very beautiful species, about three feet long, harmless, and a native of Surinam.\n\nCoach-whip Snake.\u2014Brown, with pale abdomen; very Flagellum. Long and slender, inoffensive, and native of North America. It runs with extreme swiftness, in pursuit of flies, &c., and is very easily tamed.\n\nOrnamented Snake.\u2014Habit long, and very slender; Ornatus. Colour jet black, with white flower-shaped spots, and white abdomen. This very elegant species inhabits some of the West India islands, and, according to Seba, is also found in Java and Ceylon.\n\nDomicella Snake.\u2014118 abdominal plates, 60 subcaudal scales. A very elegant and harmless species, of a slender habit, with many jet-black cross bands, and a blackish line on the abdomen. It is alleged that the Indian ladies sometimes carry it in their bosoms.\n\nBoaform\n**Ophiology**\n\n---\n\n**Boaform Snake.**\u2014242 abdominal plates, 62 subcaudal scales. Whitish, with brown variegations; white beneath, with very short scuta, the under part of the tail variegated with black and white. Native of India, and so strong, that it can numb the hand by wreathing round the arm. Its bite, however, is not poisonous.\n\n**Domestic Snake.**\u2014245 abdominal plates, 94 subcaudal scales. Gray, spotted with brown, and a double black spot between the eyes. Native of Barbary, where it is domesticated for the purpose of destroying the smaller noxious animals.\n\n**Fasciolatus.** **Fasciolated Snake.**\u2014192 abdominal plates, 62 subcaudal scales. Cinereous, with whitish cross bands, and glaucous abdomen. Native of India, and not poisonous, as vulgarly believed.\n\n**Lineatus.** **Lineated Snake.**\u2014169 abdominal plates, 84 subcaudal scales. This beautiful and inoffensive species, though subject to considerable variety of aspect, may be generally distinguished by its bluish-green ground, and three or five brown linear stripes, of which that in the middle is broadest. It inhabits several parts of India, and is from two to three feet long.\n\n**Elegant Snake.**\u2014202 abdominal plates, 146 subcaudal scales. Yellowish gray, with three broad reticulated blackish bands, a broad fillet on the abdomen, and the head freckled with brown. Length about two feet; tail very long and narrow. Native of South America. Well figured by Seba.\n\n**Mysteriorum.** **Long-snouted Snake.**\u2014192 abdominal plates, 167 subcaudal scales. Slender, with a sharp-pointed snout; colour grayish green, with a yellow line on each side of the abdomen. About three feet and a half in length, and half an inch in diameter. Native of North America, where it is often seen on trees, running very quickly in pursuit of insects.\n\n**Iridescens Snake.**\u2014163 abdominal plates, 150 subcaudal scales. Tinge blue green, and gilded, accompanied with iridescent hues, with pale abdomen, and black streak across the eyes. From three to four feet long. Native of India, one of the most beautiful of the serpent tribe, and perfectly innocent.\n\nTo exhibit even short definitions of the other species included in the genus *Coluber*, would extend this article to a disproportionate length. Of most of the omitted forts, however, we may observe, that the history is either not particularly interesting, or too little known.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 4. Hydrus, Water-snake.**\n\nBody slender in front, gradually thickening, scaled; tail compressed.\u2014This is a genus of recent institution, comprising those species of serpents which naturally inhabit the water.\n\n**Colubrinus.** **Colubrine Hydrus.**\u2014Lead-coloured, with black surrounding bands. Ordinary length about two feet and a half. The fangs are very small in proportion to the size of the animal. It is the *coluber laticeps* (Lin.), and inhabits the American and Indian seas.\n\n**Fasciatus.** **Fasciated Hydrus.**\u2014Long and slender; black, longitudinally marked by yellowish white pointed bands; upwards of two feet in length, poisonous, and native of the Indian seas.\n\n**Spiralis.** **Spiral Hydrus.**\u2014Yellowish, with brown bands; body spirally twisted. A rare and elegant species, thus described by Dr Shaw.\n\n---\n\n**Hydrus.** **Black-backed Hydrus.**\u2014Head oblong, body black above, and yellowish beneath; tail spotted. *Anguis platina*, Lin. Native of the Indian seas, and common about the coasts of Otaheite, where it is used as an article of food.\n\n**Great Hydrus.**\u2014Livid, with brown bands, and hexagonal scales abruptly carinated. Upwards of three feet long. Native of the Indian seas. Its habits little known.\n\nThe other hydrus are, *capensis*, *gracilis*, *caruleocephalus*, *curtus*, *atrocaruleus*, *cinereus*, *pictor*, and *palustris*.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 5. Langaya.**\n\nAbdominal plates, caudal rings, and terminal scales.\n\nThere is only one species known, viz.\n\n**Langaya.**\u2014184 abdominal plates, 42 caudal rings; but these numbers are subject to vary. Length between two and three feet, and diameter about seven lines, in the thickest part of the body. Colour of the upper parts reddish, or violet, of the under parts pale or whitish. Teeth like those of the viper. Native of Madagascar, where it is much dreaded.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 6. Acrochordus.**\n\nBody completely covered with warts.\n\n**Javan Acrochordus.**\u2014This reptile was discovered in Java.\nAcrochordus. A pepper field, in the island of Java, in 1754. It measured eight feet in length, and 10 inches in diameter, in the thickest part of the body. It was blackish above, whitish beneath, and marked by dusky spots on the sides. Five young ones, full formed, and each nine inches long, were found in the belly. The Chinese esteem it as a food.\n\nThe dubius and fasciatus are so nearly allied to the preceding, that they may be regarded only as varieties.\n\nGen. 7. Anguis, Slow-worm.\n\nFurnished with abdominal and subcaudal scales. Conformation resembling that of some of the lizard tribes, the body being composed of a series of moveable rings, which are easily broken and easily reproduced. A very harmless, and rather sluggish genus.\n\nCommon Slow-worm, Blind-worm, or Long Cripple.\u2014135 abdominal, and the same number of subcaudal scales. Black, yellowish ash, or rufous gray; belly black, sides streaked with black and white, tail long and obtuse, scales small, soft, and compact. The colouring is subject to considerable variety. Length, from 10 to 12 inches, or more. Common in Europe and Siberia, frequenting hollow ways, woods, paths, rubbish, &c. Viviparous, subject to hibernation, living on worms and insects, and perfectly innocuous. It is observed of this species, as well as of some others, that, if struck with any degree of violence, the body not only breaks abruptly on the struck part, but even sometimes, at different places, and that the fragments will live a long while afterwards. Though of very gentle dispositions, the blind worm, like many of the family of serpents, refuses to eat in captivity, unless it is tamed. M. Daudin mentions that he kept one two months and a half, during all which time it constantly refused nourishment of every kind.\u2014It is preyed on by various birds, hedgehogs, snakes, frogs, and toads.\n\nAccording to Dr Shaw, the Blue-bellied Snake, or Aberdeen Slow-worm (A. Eryx Lin.) is only a variety of the Fragilis. It occurs in Scotland and North America.\n\nPainted Slow-worm.\u2014240 abdominal, and 13 subcaudal scales. Varies much in colour, but is generally orange, with black blotches; sometimes black and white, sometimes pale rose and black, paler beneath, and elegantly fasciated with bars of deep black. Native of South America, particularly of Cayenne and Surinam. In preserved specimens, the orange hue is very apt to fade into white.\n\nCoral Slow-worm.\u2014Ground colour pale red, with coral red variegations. A very beautiful species, native of Brazil.\n\nGlass Slow-worm.\u2014127 abdominal, 228 subcaudal scales. Blackish green, speckled with yellow, with a very short yellow abdomen, a deep furrow on each side of the body, from the corners of the mouth to the vent, and a tail more than twice the length of the abdomen. Native of North America, and not uncommon in Carolina, where it is called the Glass Snake.

In the rude periods of society, fear is akin to devotion, and Bartram informs us, that the rattlesnake is worshipped by several of the savage tribes in North America. On the\nThe Gold and Slave coasts, a stranger, on entering the cottages of the natives, is often surprized to see the roof swarming with serpents, that cling there without molesting, and unmolested by, the natives. But his surprize will increase as he advances farther southward, to the kingdom of Widah, when he finds that a serpent is the god of the country. This animal, which travellers describe as a huge overgrown creature, has its habitation, its temple, and its priests. These last impress the vulgar with an opinion of its virtues; and numbers are daily seen to offer, not only their goods, provisions, and prayers, but even their wives and daughters, at the shrine of their hideous deity. The priests readily accept the proffered females, and after some days of penance, return them to their supplicants, much benefited by the serpent's supposed embraces.\n\nThe ancients seem to have been aware, that certain species of serpents were attracted by musical sounds, and have celebrated the Pythi and Marsi,\n\nAd quorum canus mitis jacure ceratiae.\n\nAt this day, there are jugglers in India, who train snakes to move and gesticulate to the sound of the flute; and we have already mentioned, that they tame the Cobra de Capello, and exhibit it to the populace. When the snake-man first provokes the creature to attack him, he covers his hand with an earthen jar, which he uses as a shield, and thus hurts the animal's mouth, and knocks it backwards, whenever it attempts to bite. He continues this exercise for an hour, or longer, taking care, however, not to fatigue the snake too much, nor to hurt it so as to deter it from returning to the attack. Thus, the animal is gradually taught to raise itself, on presenting a jar, a stick, or even the bare hand, the motions of which it follows with its head, without daring to bite, lest it should again wound its mouth. The juggler accompanies this exercise with fingering, so that what is really a defensive war on the part of the serpent, has the appearance of a dance. To render this exhibition less dangerous, the fangs are sometimes removed; but more frequently the snake is deprived of its poison, by being daily irritated to bite on a piece of cloth, or any soft fleshy substance; nay, they have the address and courage to press its head, and thus provoke it, while biting, to make it seize the cloth with greater violence, and more effectually express its poison.\n\nThe Egyptian enchanters, however, appear to have recourse to more ingenious and mysterious artifices. \"They take the most poisonous vipers,\" says Haffelquilt, \"with their bare hands, play with them, put them in their bosoms, and use a great many more tricks with them, as I have often seen. I have frequently seen them handle those that were three or four feet long, and of the most horrid form. I inquired and examined if they had cut out the viper's poisonous teeth; but I have with my own eyes seen they do not. We may, therefore, conclude, that there are to this day Pythi in Egypt; but what art they use is not easily known. Some people are very superstitious, and the generality believe this to be done by some supernatural art which they obtain from invisible beings. I do not know whether their power is to be ascribed to good or evil; but I am persuaded that those who undertake it use many superstitions.\n\n\"The circumstances relating to the fascination of serpents in Egypt, related to me,\" he continues, \"were principally, 1. That the art is only known to certain families, who propagate it to their offspring. 2. The person who knows how to fascinate serpents, never meddles with other poisonous animals, such as scorpions, lizards, &c. There are different persons who know how to fascinate these animals; and they again never meddle with serpents. 3. Those that fascinate serpents, eat them both raw and boiled, and even make broth of them, which they eat very commonly amongst them; but in particular, they eat such a dish when they go out to catch them. I have been told, that serpents fried or boiled are frequently eaten by the Arabians both in Egypt and Arabia, though they know not how to fascinate them, but catch them either alive or dead. 4. After they have eaten their soup, they procure a blessing from their sheik (priest or lawyer), who uses some superstitious ceremonies, and amongst others, spits on them several times with certain gestures. This manner of getting a blessing from the priest is pure superstition, and certainly cannot in the least help to fascinate serpents; but they believe, or at least persuade others, that the power of fascinating serpents depends upon this circumstance.\"\n\nOn this subject, the celebrated Mr Bruce in his travels to discover the source of the Nile, is also minute and explicit. Among other passages, we shall be content to quote the following.\n\n\"I will not hesitate to aver, that I have seen at Cairo (and this may be seen daily without trouble or expense) a man who came from above the catacombs, where the pits of the mummy birds are kept, who has taken a ceraite with his naked hand from a number of others lying at the bottom of the tub, has put it upon his bare head, covered it with the common red cap he wears, then taken it out, put it in his breast, and tied it about his neck like a necklace; after which it has been applied to a hen, and bit it, which has died in a few minutes; and to complete the experiment, the man has taken it by the neck and beginning at his tail, has eaten it as one would do a carrot or a stock of celery, without any feeling repugnance.\"\n\n\"I can myself vouch, that all the black people in the kingdom of Sennar, whether Funge or Nuba, are perfectly armed against the bite of either scorpion or viper. They take the ceraites in their hands at all times, put them in their bosoms, and throw them to one another, as children do apples or balls, without having irritated them, by this usage, to much as to bite. The Arabs have not this secret naturally; but from their infancy they acquire an exemption from the mortal consequences attending the bite of these animals, by chewing a certain root, and washing themselves (it is not anointing) with an infusion of certain plants in water.\"\n\nThe testimony of Savary is not less precise. At the feast of Sidi Ibrahim, he saw a troop of people, seemingly possessed, with naked arms and fierce looks, holding in their hands enormous serpents, which twined round their body, and endeavoured to escape. But these enchanters avoided the bite, by grasping the animals strongly by the neck, then tore them with their teeth, and ate them alive, while the blood streamed from their mouth.\nThe circumstance of seizing them fast by the neck, accords with the concluding part of the ensuing relation of Demon.\n\n\"Having been always curious to observe the means by which some men command the opinions of others, I regretted that I was not at Rofetta, at the procession of the feast of Ibrahim, in which the convulsions of the Plylli form the most entertaining part, to the populace, of this religious ceremony. To make up for my loss, I addressed myself to the chief of the fest, who was keeper of the Okel or tavern of the Franks; I flattered him; and he promised to make me a spectator of the exaltation of one of the Plylli, as soon as he should have inspired him. From my curiosity he thought I was likely to become a proselyte, and he proposed to initiate me, which I accepted; but when I learned that in the ceremony of initiation, the grand master spits in the mouth of the neophyte, this circumstance cooled my ardour, and I found that I could not prevail on myself to submit to such a point of probation. I therefore gave my money to the chief, and the high priest promised to let me see one of the inspired.\n\n\"They had brought with them some serpents, which they let loose from a large leather sack in which they were kept, and by irritation made them erect their bodies, and hiss. I remarked that the light was the principal cause of their anger; for as soon as they were returned into the sack, their passion ceased, and they no longer endeavoured to bite. They had a particular quality, which was that when angry, the neck for six inches below the head was dilated to the size of one's hand. I soon saw, that I had no greater reason to dread the bite of these serpents than their masters had; for having well remarked that the Plylli, while they were threatening the animal with one hand, seized it on the back of the head with the other, I did the same with one of the serpents with equal success, though much to the indignation of these mysterious quacks.\"\n\nWe have likewise heard of people in Europe who allowed themselves to be bitten by vipers, with impunity, to the great astonishment of the spectators. They first made the animal eat of a prepared paste, which closed the apertures in the fangs, and thus prevented the discharge of the poison.\n\nVarious and contradictory opinions, conjectures, and fictions, have been advanced relative to the nature, action, and cure of serpentine poison. Among the vulgar errors connected with this subject, we may reckon the sting fixed in the serpent's tail, and the flowing of venom from the black forked tongue, and from the teeth in general.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, Ferdinand II. Grand Duke of Tuscany, invited Steno, Redi, and some other eminent men of science, to his court, with a view to investigate the history of this important phenomenon in the animal economy. Redi, in particular, instituted a great variety of experiments, and arrived at some useful discoveries. When he either caused a living viper to bite a dog, or wounded the latter with the teeth of one newly dead, the event was the same. If the bite was repeated, its effect became weaker, and, at length was lost, the poison contained in the vehicle being exhausted. He observed, that when the teeth of serpents were extended to bite, they were moistened over with a certain liquor, and that when the vehicle at the base of the fangs was pressed, a drop of poison flowed to the point of the fang. When the poison thus flowing from the vehicle was received in soft bread, or a sponge, an animal bitten by the serpent received no more harm from the wound than from the pinch of a needle, till after a few days, when the venom was secreted afresh; but when an animal was wounded with the point of a needle dipped in the poison, it was tormented with the same pains as if it had been bitten by the viper itself. Having preserved some of this poison in a glass, and totally evaporated the moisture in the sun, when the residuum was diluted with water, Redi found, to his great surprise, that it had the same effect as when recent. But the boldness of Jacob Sozzi, a viper charmer, excited the astonishment of the learned. As they happened in the prince's presence to talk of the certain death which would attend the swallowing of viperine poison, Sozzi, confiding in his art, drank a considerable portion of it without hesitation, and with the same safety as if he had drunk so much water. This result, which so much startled the grand duke and his philosophical associates, was not unknown to the ancients, as may be inferred from these lines in Lucan:\n\nNoxia serpantium est admitto sanguine pefiri:\nMorfu virus habent et fatum dente minantur,\nPocula morte carent.\n\nThe ingenious and indefatigable Fontana made no fewer than 6000 experiments on this interesting subject. Of these, our limits will not permit us to enumerate the results. In consequence, however, of his multiplied and persevering researches, we are enabled to state, that this poison is not fatal to all animals; that it kills neither vipers, snakes, blind-worms, snails, nor leeches; that it acts very slightly on tortoises; that it is neither an acid nor an alkali; that it has no determined flavour, and that it leaves the mouth merely a sensation of astringency and stinging. It long retains its virulence in the cavity of the tooth, whether the latter be separated or not from its socket; but when dried and kept in an exposed situation, it loses its deleterious qualities in less than a year. Hence the propriety of caution in examining vipers that are handled or preserved in spirits, and in making use of clothes that have been bitten by them. Fontana has also proved that the poison of the viper is not uniformly fatal except to very small animals, and that it is more dangerous to the larger sorts, according to the quantity of virus secreted, the frequency of the bites, the different parts of the body on which they have been inflicted, and probably also, the higher temperature of the atmosphere. A sparrow dies in five or eight minutes, a pigeon in eight or twelve, a cat sometimes recovers, and a sheep very often; so that a man has little reason to dread the consequences of a single bite in the climate of Italy, and still less so in France or Great Britain. The hundredth part of a grain of poison applied to a mulete will kill a sparrow, whereas six times that quantity are required to kill a pigeon. According to this estimate, about three grains should prove fatal to a man, and 12 to an ox. But the vehicles of an ordinarily sized viper seldom contain more than two grains of poison, and even that quantity is not exhausted till after repeated bites. The poison is of a gummy consistency, and seems to act by destroying the irritability of the muscular fibre,\nfibres, and introducing into the fluids a principle of putrefaction. It may be swallowed with impunity, provided there be no wound in the mouth; but if introduced into the blood, the most violent and convulsive agonies ensue, the fangiferous system becoming coagulated, and the whole animal frame relaxed. Hence, powerful fudorifics, as the flesh of the viper itself, of snakes and lizards, which contain a large proportion of ammoniacal soap, the volatile alkali, and its various preparations, with numerous plants which excite copious perspiration, have been recommended, and often successfully used as antidotes, especially when their exhibition has been preceded by a tight ligature immediately above the wound, and by scarification and caustics.\n\nOn the effects and cure of the poison of snakes, some valuable observations and reflections occur in Dr Ruffell's splendid work on Indian serpents. The judicious author remarks, that when the poison is applied to brute animals, its progress is often so rapid as hardly to leave time for the operation of medicine, or the application of any means whatever, with a probability of success. When the progress is slower, should the remedy be administered before unequivocal symptoms have removed all doubt of the poison having taken effect, recovery may be ascribed to the medicine given, whilst, in reality, no malady existed; and if deferred till doubts are removed, the remedy which, if applied in time might have proved efficacious, may be unjustly regarded as useless. Besides, it is well known that a bite of the most noxious snake does not instantly prove fatal, and that even some of the more tender animals, without the use of any remedy, recover in cases where the symptoms are apparently very formidable. These symptoms, in the bodies of different animals are very much alike, and proceed nearly in the same order of progression, though with different degrees of rapidity.\n\nThe American Indians either suck the wound, or apply to it chewed tobacco, or make several incisions around it, which they fill with gunpowder, and then fire it off. During the progress of the cure they have likewise recourse to several pounded and bruised plants, as to some of the species of *Lactuca*, the root of *Prenanthes alba*, the stems and leaves of a species of *Helianthus*, and in desperate cases the radical bark of the tulip-tree. In general they are partial to the use of the syngeneous plants, and to the bark of the trunk and roots of various trees.\n\nThe experiments of Bernard de Jussieu, Lebeau, Sonnini, and Boof, seem to have established that, of all known remedies for the bite of the viper and the rattlesnake, the most efficacious are, the volatile alkali, or *eau de luce*, with suction and scarification of the recent wound.\n\nIn addition to these methods of cure, we shall quote the prescription of Dr Mofeley, who spent 12 years in the West Indies.\n\n\"The bites and stings of all venomous animals are cured by the same local means, which are very simple if they were always at hand. The injured part must be instantly destroyed or cut out. Destroying it is the most safe, and equally certain; and the best application for that purpose is the *lapis infernalis*, or butter of antimony. These are preferable to a hot iron which the ancients used, because a hot iron forms a crust, which acts as a defence to the under parts instead of destroying them. The *lapis infernalis* is much better than any other, as it melts and penetrates during its application. The bitten part must be destroyed to the bottom, and where there is any doubt that the bottom of the wound is not sufficiently exposed, butter of antimony should be introduced to it on the following day, as deep as possible; and incisions should be made to lay every part open to the action of these applications. Besides destroying, burning, or cutting out the part, incisions should be made round the wound, to prevent the communication of the virus. The wound is to be dried for some time with poultices, to affix the inflammation caused by the caustics; and afterwards with acid dressings and hot digestives to drain the injured parts.\n\n\"Where the above-mentioned caustics cannot be procured, corrosive sublimate, oil of vitriol, aquafortis, spirit of salt, common caustic, or a plaster made of quicklime and soap, may be applied to the wound. Gunpowder laid on the part and fired, has been used with success. When a person is bitten remote from any assistance, he should make a tight ligature above the part until proper application can be made. The Spanish writers say, that the *habilla de Cartagena*, or Carthagena bean, is a specific for poisonous bites taken inwardly.\n\nDr Mofeley then proceeds to state the ample testimony of Ulloa in favour of this bean, which is found in great abundance in the West India islands, under the name of *antidote* or *cocoon antidote*. \"I have been informed (adds he) by some intelligent Indians, that any of the red peppers, such as bird pepper or bell pepper, or what is called *Cayenne pepper*, powdered, and taken in a glass of rum, as much as the stomach can possibly bear, so as to cause and keep up for some time great heat and inflammation in the body, and a vigorous circulation, will stop the progress of the poison of serpents, even after its effects are visible; and that the bitten part only afterwards mortifies and separates, and that the patient, with bark, wine, and cordials, soon recovers.\"\n\nThe naturalist who collects serpents for the purpose of preserving them in his cabinet, should have recourse to various precautions, which, though several of them are sufficiently obvious, are, at the same time, too often neglected. In general the hurtful parts are caught with the greatest safety and dexterity by natives of the country in which they abound. The want of the head in many of the larger stuffed specimens from Guiana, &c., renders them of little value in a scientific point of view, and is the result of superfluous trouble to travellers who send them to Europe in this mutilated condition. Collectors, therefore, should carefully instruct their agents to preserve this part of the animal. As these larger specimens cannot easily be prepared without an incision in the skin, it will be of consequence to make this incision on the side, beginning at the termination of the plates, and not cutting across them, as is too often done, to the great prejudice of distinct classification. When the skin is once stripped, it may be carefully rolled up, up, and stuffed in the preparation room in the usual manner.\n\nThe smaller species of serpents may be kept in prepared spirits. Pure alcohol and spirituous liquors, especially when not reduced by water, frequently affect the\nmost brilliant animal colours. Thus, in the ordinary cabinet liquors, the fine red of the haemachate snake degenerates into a dark brown, scales of a bright green or blue become somewhat pale, yellow always whitens, and orange changes to red or pale. White, brown, black, purple, mother of pearl, and metal-coloured scales are not liable to change. The following is an approved recipe for preserving the various colours of serpents entire.\n\nTake very pure spring water, saturate it with alum, then mix with it about one-fifth of its bulk of very limpid spirit of wine, pass the mixture through a paper strainer, and keep the liquor well corked up in bottles, in some cool and shady situation. Immerse the animal which you wish to preserve in a vessel filled with this liquor, and allow it to remain in it 24 hours. The vessel and its included liquor should be reserved for this preliminary process. Then remove the reptile into a cylindrical vessel of fine glass, filled to three-fourths of its height with the liquor above described, and closed with a glass cover. Lute the latter with mastic and hogs grease; put the vessel on a shelf that is sheltered from heat and the solar rays; and at the end of two months, if the mastic be dry, and you with the jar to remain closed, paint the luting with an oil colour; but if you intend to open it frequently, use only the hogs grease.\n\nReptiles may also be conveniently preserved according to the method indicated by Chaufler, in the Bulletin des Sciences, (for Prairial, year 10, No. 63.), without the previous trouble of preparing the skin. All that is required, is to stuff the cavities with cotton, and to immerse the body in distilled water, saturated with super-oxygenated muriate of mercury; and when it has sufficiently imbibed the saline solution in all its parts, to allow it to dry slowly in a well aired situation, screened from the sun and dust. All the parts of the animal harden, and are thus defended from the voracity of insects, and corruption of every kind.","sp":153,"ep":170},{"h":"OPHIOMANCY","t":"in antiquity, the art of making predictions from serpents.

Some have gone to the West, others to the East Indies, and the eastern coast of Africa, in search of it.\u2014Mr Bruce, the celebrated Abyssinian traveller, has displayed much learning and ingenuity in settling this question of Biblical history. To the satisfaction of most of his readers he has determined Ophir to be Sofala, a kingdom of Africa, on the coast of Mozambique, near Zanguebar (see Sofala). His reasons for this determination are so generally known, that it would be improper to repeat them here at length; because such as are not already acquainted with them may consult his book, which has been long in the hands of the public. He justly observes, that in order to come to a certainty where this Ophir was, it will be necessary to examine what Scripture says of it, and to keep precisely to every thing like description which we can find there, without indulging our fancy farther.\n\nThen, the trade to Ophir was carried on from the Elanitic gulf through the Indian ocean. The returns were gold, silver, and ivory, but especially silver. The time of the going and coming of the fleet was precisely three years, at no period more or less.\n\nNow, if Solomon's fleet failed from the Elanitic gulf to the Indian ocean, this voyage of necessity must have been made by monsoons, for no other winds reign in that ocean. And what certainly shows this was the case, is the precise term of three years in which the fleet went and came between Ophir and Ezion-gaber.\n\nThe mines of Ophir were probably what furnished the East with gold in the earliest times: great traces of excavation must therefore have appeared.\n\nBut John dos Santos says, that he landed at Sofala in the year 1865; that he sailed up the great river Guama as far as Tete, where, always desirous to be in the neighbourhood of gold, his order had placed their convent. Thence he penetrated for about two hundred leagues into the country, and saw the gold mines then working at a mountain called Afara. At a considerable distance from these are the silver mines of Chi, in support of ancient excavations; and at both places the houzes of the kings are built with mud and straw, whilst there are large remains of masonry buildings of stone and lime.\n\nEvery thing then confines to fix the Ophir of Solomon in the kingdom of Sofala, provided it would necessarily require neither more nor less than three years to make a voyage from Ezion-gaber to that place and Tarshish and return. To establish this important fact, our author observes, that the fleet or ship for Sofala, parting in June from Ezion-gaber (see Ezion-gaber), would run down before the northern monsoon to Mocha (see Mocha). Here, not the monsoon, but the direction of the gulf, changes; and the violence of the south-westers, which then reign in the Indian ocean, make themselves at times felt even in Mocha roads. The vessel therefore comes to an anchor in the harbour of Mocha; and here she waits for moderate weather and a fair wind, which carries her out of the straits of Babelmandel, through the few leagues where the wind is variable.\n\nHer course from this is nearly south-west, and she meets at Cape Guardafui, a strong south-wester that blows directly in her teeth. Being obliged to return into the gulf, she mistakes this for a trade-wind; because she is not able to make her voyage to Mocha but by the summer monsoon, which carries her no farther than the straits of Babelmandel, and then leaves her in the face of a contrary wind, a strong current to the northward, and violent swell.\n\nThe attempting this voyage with sails, in these circumstances, was absolutely impossible, as their vessels went only before the wind: if it was performed at all, it must have been by oars; and great havoc and loss of men must have been the consequence of the several trials.\n\nAt last, philosophy and observation, together with the unwearied perseverance of man bent upon his own views and intellect, removed these difficulties, and showed the mariners of the Arabian gulf, that these periodical winds,\nwinds, which in the beginning they looked upon as invincible barriers to the trading to Sofala, when once undertaken, were the very means of performing this voyage safely and expeditiously.\n\nThe vessel trading to Sofala sailed from the bottom of the Arabian gulf in summer, with the monsoon at north, which carried her to Mocha. There the monsoon failed her by the change of the direction of the gulf. The south-west winds, which blow without Cape Guardafui in the Indian ocean, forced themselves round the cape so as to be felt in the road of Mocha, and make it uneasy riding there. But those soon changed, the weather became moderate, and the vessel, we suppose in the month of August, was safe at anchor under Cape Guardafui, where was the port which, many years afterwards, was called Promontorium Aromatium. Here the ship was obliged to stay all November, because all these summer months the wind south of the cape was a strong south-wester, as hath been before said, directly in the teeth of the voyage to Sofala. But this time was not lost; part of the goods bought to be ready for the return was ivory, frankincense, and myrrh; and the ship was then at the principal mart for these.\n\nOur author supposes, that in November the vessel sailed with the wind at north-east, with which she would soon have made her voyage; but off the coast of Melinda, in the beginning of December, there met an anomalous monsoon at south-west, in our days first observed by Dr Halley, which cut off her voyage to Sofala, and obliged her to put into the small harbour of Mocha, near Melinda, but nearer still to Tarshish, which we find here by accident, and which we think a strong corroboration that we are right as to the rest of the voyage. In the annals of Abyssinia, it is said that Amada Sion, making war upon that coast in the 14th century, in a list of the rebellious Moorish vassals, mentions the chief of Tarshish as one of them, in the very situation where we have now placed him.\n\nSolomon's vessel, then, was obliged to stay at Tarshish till the month of April of the second year. In May, the wind set in at north-east, and probably carried her that same month to Sofala. All the time she spent at Tarshish was not lost, for part of her cargo was to be brought from that place; and the probably bought, bespoke, or left it there. From May of the second year, to the end of that monsoon in October, the vessel could not stir; the wind was north-east. But that time, far from being lost, was necessary to the traders for getting in their cargo, which we shall suppose was ready for them.\n\nThe ship sails on her return, in the month of November of the second year, with the monsoon south-west, which in a very few weeks would have carried her into the Arabian gulf. But off Mocha, near Melinda and Tarshish, she met the north-east monsoon, and was obliged to go into that port and stay there till the end of that monsoon; after which a south-wester came to her relief in May of the third year. With the May monsoon she ran to Mocha within the straits, and was there confined by the summer monsoon blowing up the Arabian gulf from Suez, and meeting her. Here she lay till that monsoon which in summer blows northerly from Suez, changed to a south-east one in October or November, and that very easily brought her up into Ophir, the Ebanitic gulf, the middle or end of December of the third year. She had no need of more time to complete her voyage, and it was not possible she could do it in less.\n\nSuch is a very short and imperfect abstract of our author's reasons for placing Ophir in Sofala. If it excite the curiosity of our readers to consult his work, it will answer the purpose for which we have made it.\n\nWe are now to give another ingenious conjecture concerning the situation of Ophir and Tarshish, with hypotheses which we have been favoured by Dr Doig, the learned author of Letters on the Savage State, addressed to Lord Kames.\n\nThis respectable writer holds that Ophir was somewhere on the west coast of Africa, and that Tarshish was the ancient Baetica in Spain. His essay is not yet published; but he authorizes us to give the following abstract of it: \"The first time that Ophir, or rather Agur, occurs in Scripture, is in Gen. x. 29, where the sacred historian, enumerating the sons of Joktan, mentions Aufr as one of them.\" According to his account, the descendants of those 13 brothers settled all in a contiguous situation, from Melha (the Mocha of the moderns) to Sepharah, a mountain of the east. Moles, as every one knows, designates countries, and the inhabitants of countries, from the patriarch from whom those inhabitants descended. In describing the course of one of the branches of the river of paradise, the same Moles informs us that it encompassed the whole land of Havilah, &c., which abounded with fine gold, beldamum, and the onyx stone; and this land had its name from Havilah, the 12th son of the patriarch Joktan. Ophir or Agur was Havilah's immediate elder brother; and of course the descendants of the former, in all probability, fixed their habitation in the neighbourhood of those of the latter. If, then, the land of Havilah abounded with gold and precious stones, the land of Ophir undoubtedly produced the very same articles.\n\nHere then we have the original Ophir; here was the origin found the primary gold of Ophir; and here lay the Ophir mentioned in Job xi. 24. But as navigation was then in its infant state, the native land of gold Solomon; mentioned by Job must have been much nearer home of which than that to which the fleets of Solomon and Hiram made their triennial voyages. That several countries on the north-east coast of Africa abounded with gold long after the era of Job, is evident from the testimony of Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Ptolemy, Pomponius Mela, &c.; but that in these countries the Ophir of Solomon could not be situated, is plain, because his ships in the same voyage touched at Tarshish, which lay in a very different quarter.\n\nThe Abyssinian traveller has placed this regio aurifera in Sofala on the eastern coast of Africa, nearly opposite to the island of Madagascar. This hypothesis was current a hundred years before he was born; but I am perplexed (says our author) that it is not tenable. The Ophir of Solomon, in whatever part of Africa it lay, must have been well known, prior to his reign, both to the Phoenicians and the Edomites. These people navigated that monarch's fleet, and therefore could be no strangers to the port whither they were bound. That\nit was in Africa is certain; and that it was on the west coast of that immense peninsula, will appear more than probable, when we have ascertained the situation of Tarshish, and the usual course of Phoenician navigation. To these objects, therefore, we shall now direct our inquiries.\n\n\"Javan, the fourth son of the patriarch Japhet, had four sons, Elissa, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim or Rodanim; among whose descendants were the isles of the Gentiles divided.\" The city of Tarshish on the coast of Cilicia, at once ascertains the region colonized by the descendants of Tarshish. But as much depends upon determining the position of this country, I shall endeavour (says the Doctor) to fix it with all possible precision.\n\n\"In the first place, I must beg leave to observe, that there is not a single passage in any ancient author, sacred or profane, that so much as alludes to any city, district, canton, or country, of the name of Tarshish in the eastern parts of the world. The descendants of Javan, of whom Tarshish was one, are agreed on all hands to have extended their settlements towards the north-west, i.e., into Asia Minor, Italy, and Spain. The inhabitants of Tarshish are everywhere in Scripture said to be addicted to navigation and commerce, in which they seem to have been connected with the Tyrians and Phoenicians, who were always said by the Jews to inhabit the isles of the sea. Indeed, in Hebrew geography, all the countries toward the north and west, which were divided from Judea by the sea, were called the isles of the sea. Thus Isaiah: 'The burden of Tyre. Howl ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in from the land of Chittim it is revealed unto them.' Be still ye inhabitants of the isle, thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished? The land of Chittim was Macedonia, and often Greece, from which every one knows that the destruction of Tyre came; and that Tarshish was not an unconcerned spectator of that destruction, is obvious from the same prophet, who proceeds to say: 'As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be foreily pierced at the report concerning Tyre. Pass over to Tarshish; howl ye inhabitants of the isle. Is this thy joyous city?' It appears likewise from Ezekiel xxvii. 12, that Tarshish was the merchant with whom Tyre traded for silver, iron, tin, and lead, and that this trade was carried on in fair.\"\n\n\"From all these passages, it seems to be evident, that the descendants of Tarshish settled on the western coast of Asia Minor; that these people were addicted to navigation and commerce; that in the course of their traffic they were connected with the Tyrians and Phoenicians; that the commerce they carried on consisted of silver, iron, tin, and lead; that the people of Tarshish were connected with Kittim and the isles of the Gentiles, which are confessedly situated toward the north and west of Judea.\n\n\"But let, after all, a fact so fully authenticated should still be called in question, I shall add one proof more, which will place the matter beyond the reach of doubt and controversy.\n\n\"When the prophet Jonah intended to flee from the presence of the Lord, in order to avoid preaching at Nineveh, let us see where the peevish defterer embarked. (Jonah i. 3.) 'And Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish, and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them into Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord.'\n\n\"Every body knows that Joppa or Japhan stood upon the shore of the Mediterranean; of course the fugitive prophet had determined to go to some very distant region westward, and by that means to get as far from Nineveh as possible.\"\n\nHaving thus proved to a demonstration, that this not original Tarshish was a region on the western coast of Asia Minor, where either the patriarch of that name, Ishmael of Samson, or some of his immediate descendants, planted a colony, it remains to determine whether this was actually the country from which Solomon imported the vast quantities of silver mentioned by the sacred historian. That it was not, our author frankly acknowledges; and therefore, says he, we must look out for Solomon's Tarshish in some other quarter of the globe.\n\nTo pave the way for this discovery, he very justly observes, that it has at all times been a common practice of one to transfer the name of one country to another, in consequence of some analogy or resemblance between transferred them. It has likewise often happened, that when a commodity was brought from a very distant country by a very distant people, the people to whom it was imported have taken it for granted that it was produced in the region from which it was immediately brought to them. Of the truth of this position no man acquainted with the Greek and Roman poets can for a moment entertain a doubt. Hence the Assyrium ammonium of Virgil, and the Assyrium malabathrum of Horace, though these articles were the product not of Assyria but of India. The Jews, who were as little acquainted with foreign countries as the Greeks and Romans, had very probably the same notions with them respecting articles of commerce; and if so, they would undoubtedly suppose, that the silver sold by the merchants of Tarshish was the product of that country. When this mistake came to be discovered, they very naturally transferred the name Tarshish from the country of the merchants to that of the articles which they imported. Let us now, says our author, try if we cannot find out where that country was.\n\nIt has been already shown, by quotations from Isaiah and Ezekiel, that the merchants of Tarshish traded in the markets of Tyre with silver, iron, lead, and tin. To these authorities, we shall add another from Jeremiah: \"Silver (says that prophet) spread into plates is brought from Tarshish.\" \"But in Spain (continues our learned dissertator), all those commodities were found in the greatest abundance. All the ancient authors who describe that region dwell with rapture on its silver mines. This fact is too generally known to need to be supported by authorities. Spain was then the region which furnished Solomon's traders with the immense mafs of silver he is said to have imported. This was, one might say, the modern Tarshish; and indeed both Josephus and Eusebius are positive that the poverty of Tarshish actually peopled that country. If this was an early opinion, as it certainly was, the Jews would of course denominate Spain from the patriarch in question.\n\nI have shown above, that the inhabitants of Tarshish...\nshih were strictly connected with the Kittim, or Grecians: I shall here produce an authority which will prove to a demonstration that the Kittim had extended their commerce into that part of Africa now called Barbary.\n\n\"The prophet Ezekiel, (xxvii. 6.) describing the splendour and magnificence of Tyre, tells us, 'that the company of the Ashurites made her benches of ivory, brought from the isles of Kittim.' In the first place, I must observe, that there is probably a small error in the orthography of the word Ashurim. This term is everywhere in Scripture translated Assyrians, which translation is certainly just. But how the Assyrians could export ivory from the isles of Kittim, and fashion it into benches for the Tyrian mariners, is, in my opinion, a problem of no easy solution. The fact is Ashurim should be Asherim, that is, the company of the men of Asher. The tribe of Asher obtained its inheritance in the neighbourhood of Tyre; (see Josh. xix. 28.) 'And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon and Canah, unto Zidon the great.' The companies of the tribe of the Asherites then, and not the Ashurim, were the people who manufactured the benches in question.\n\n\"Be that as it may, the ivory of which the implements were formed was imported from the isles of Kittim, that is, from Greece and its neighbourhood. These islands, it is certain, never produced ivory. They must therefore have imported it from some other country; but no other country, to which the Greeks and their neighbours could have extended their commerce, except the north of Africa, produced that commodity. The conclusion then is, that the maritime states of Asia Minor, Greece, and probably the Hetruscans on the west coast of Italy, carried on a gainful commerce with Spain and Barbary at a very early period.\n\n\"We have now seen that the original Tarshish on the coast of Asia Minor did not produce the metals imported by Solomon's fleet; that no Tarshish is to be found in the eastern parts of the globe; that the Tarshish we are in quest of was undoubtedly situated somewhere towards the west of Judea: we have shown that the mercantile people of Asia Minor, Greece, and probably of Italy, actually imported some of those articles from the coast of Africa; we have hazarded a conjecture, that Spain was the modern Tarshish, and that very country from which Solomon imported his silver, and the Tyrians their silver, iron, tin, and lead. Let us now make a trial whether we cannot exhibit some internal proofs in support of the hypothesis we have above adopted.\n\n\"The ancients divided Spain into three parts, Baetica, Lusitania, and Tarraconensis. Baetica is the modern Andalusia. It stretched along the Fretum Herculeum, or Straits of Gibraltar, to the mouth of the Guadalquivir. This region is thought by some to have been the Elytian Fields of the poets. The river Baetis, which divides it, is called Tartessus by Aristotle, Steffchorus, Strabo, Pausanias, Steph. Byzant, and Avianus. Here too we have a city and a lake of the same name. But Tartessus is positively the very same with Tarshish. The Phoenicians, by changing Jehin into Thau, made it Tartish. The Greeks manufactured the rest, by changing Tartish into Tartis, and in process of time by Tartessus. That the Phoenicians actually changed Jehin into Thau is certain; for Plutarch tells us, in the life of Sylla, that in their language an ox was called thor, which is, no doubt, the same with the Hebrew b'or.\n\n\"From this deduction, it appears highly probable at Tarshish least, that the Spanish Baetica was originally called Tar\u2014Spanish Bojibb. Indeed this similarity of names has operated so powerfully on the learned Bochart, and on some other moderns of no mean figure, that they have positively affirmed, as Josephus had done before them, that the patriarch Tarshish actually settled in that country. This I should think not altogether probable; but that his descendants who settled on the coast of Asia Minor colonized Baetica, and carried on an uninterrupted commerce to that country, along with the Phoenicians, for many centuries after it was peopled, and that from the circumstances above narrated, it was denominated Tarboibb, are facts too palpable to admit of contradiction.\n\n\"Let us now see whether this Baetica, where I have endeavoured to fix the situation of the Tarshish of the Scriptures, was actually furnished with those articles of commerce which are said to have been imported from that country. To enlarge on this topic would be altogether superfluous. Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Polybius, Pliny, Solinus, and, in one word, all the Greek and Roman historians who have mentioned that region, have unanimously exhibited it as the native land of silver, iron, and tin: to these, contrary to the opinions of the celebrated modern traveller, they likewise add gold in very large quantities.\"\n\nOur author having thus ascertained the situation of Tarshish, proceeds to prove, by a mass of evidence too large for our insertion, that the Edomites and Tyrians had doubled the Cape, and almost encompassed Africa, long before the era of Solomon. Then referring to 1 Kings, chap. ix. and x. 2 Chron. viii. ix. 2 Kings xxii. and 2 Chron. xx. he observes, that from these authorities it appears indubitably, that the fleets of Solomon and Hiram sailed from Eloth and Eziongeber; that the voyages to Ophir and Tarshish were exactly the same, performed at one and the same time, by the very same fleet; which must necessarily have encompassed the peninsula of Africa before it could arrive at the country of Tarshish. This being the case, the traders might easily enough collect the gold on the coast of Guinea, or on what is now vulgarly called the Gold Coast. The ivory they might readily enough procure on the Barbary coast, opposite to Tarshish. In Africa, too, they might hunt apes, monkeys, baboons, &c.; and peacocks, or rather parrots, and parroquets, they might surprize in the forests which abounded on the coast. In Spain, silver, iron, lead, and tin, were, one may say, the native produce of the soil. Even at this early period, the Phoenician navigators had discovered the Caffiterides or Scilly islands, and Cornwall; and from that region, in company with the merchants, may have supplied them with that rare commodity.\n\n\"I have supposed that the navy of Solomon and Hiram collected their gold in the course of their voyage somewhere on the coast of Africa, beyond the Cape, for the following reasons: Had they found the golden fleece...\"\nfleece at Sofala (A), or any part of the coast of Africa, they would have chosen to return and unload at Eloth or Ezion-geber, rather than pursue a long and dangerous course, quite round Africa, to Tarhith; to which last country they might have shipped their course much more commonly from Zidon, Tyre, Joppa, &c. But being obliged to double the Cape in quest of some of these articles which they were enjoined to import, they pushed onward to Tarhith, and returned by the Pillars of Hercules to Tyre, or perhaps to Joppa, &c. Their next voyage commenced from one or other of these ports, from which they directed their course to Tarhith; and having taken in part of their lading there, they afterwards coasted round Africa, and so arrived once more at Eloth or Ezion-geber.\n\nLet us now attend to the space of time in which these voyages were performed. We are told expressly (2 Chron. ix. 21.) that once every three years came the ships of Tarhith, &c. This is exactly the time one would naturally imagine necessary to perform such a distant voyage, at a period when navigation was still in its infancy, and mariners seldom ventured to lose sight of the coast. Of this we have an irrefragable proof in the history of a voyage round the very same continent, undertaken and accomplished in the very same space of time, about two centuries after.\n\nWe learn from Herodotus, lib. ii. cap. 149., that Nechus, one of the latter kings of Egypt, whom the Scripture calls Pharao Necho, built a great number of ships, both on the Red sea and the Mediterranean. The same historian, lib. iv. cap. 42. informs us, that this enterprising monarch projected a voyage round the continent of Africa, which was actually accomplished in the space of three years. In the conduct of this enterprise, he employed Phoenician mariners, as Solomon had done before him. These, we may suppose, were assisted in the course of this navigation by charts or journals, or at least by traditional accounts derived from their ancestors:\n\nThese navigators (says the historian) took their departure from a port on the Red sea, and failing from thence into the southern ocean, and, in the beginning of autumn, landing on the coast of Africa, there they sowed some grain which they had carried out with them on board their vessels. In this place they waited till the crop was ripened; and, having cut it down, they proceeded on their voyage. Having spent two years in this navigation, in the third they returned to Egypt, by the Pillars of Hercules. These mariners, adds the author, reported a fact, which, for his part, he could by no means believe to be true; namely, that in one part of their course their shadows fell on their right; a circumstance which gives considerable weight to the truth of the relation.\n\nLet it now be observed, that Phoenician mariners navigated the fleet of Solomon: the same people conducted that of Necho: the fleet of Necho spent three years in the course of its voyage; that of Solomon did the same in its course about two centuries before:\n\nVol. XV. Part I.\n\n(A) That Sofala opposite to the island of Madagascar was Ophir, was an ancient conjecture. See Bochart, ch. i. ii. cap. 27. p. 165. 4to.\nto a newly discovered one, resembling the other in appearance, in situation, in figure, in distance, in the nature of the climate, productions, &c. has ever been so common, that to produce instances would be altogether superfluous. The newly discovered region on the coast of Africa abounded with the same species of commodities by which the original one was distinguished; and of course, the name of the latter was annexed to the former.\n\nWhether Mr Bruce's hypothesis, or Dr Doig's, respecting the long-disputed situation of Solomon's Ophir, be the true one, it is not for us to decide. Both are plausible, both are supported by much ingenuity and uncommon erudition; but we do not think that the arguments of either writer furnish a complete contradiction of those adduced by the other.

When one or two men relate a story including many circumstances to a third person, and another comes who positively contradicts it either in whole or in part, he to whom those jarring testimonies are given, weighs all the circumstances in his own mind, balances the one against the other, and lends an assent, more or less wavering, to that side on which the evidence appears to preponderate.

In forming opinions of this kind, upon which, in a great measure depends our success in any pursuit, every circumstance should be carefully attended to, and our judgements guided by former experience. Truth is a thing of such importance to man, that he should always pursue the best methods for attaining it; and when the object eludes all his researches, he should remedy the disappointment, by attaching himself to that which has the strongest resemblance to it; and that which most resembles truth is called probability, as the judgement which is formed of it is termed opinion.

These small fur-\nTheory.\n\nRefraction particles entering the eye, and striking upon the retina (an expansion of the optic nerve over the back part of the eye to receive their impulses), excite in our minds the idea of light. And according as they differ in substance, density, velocity, or magnitude, they produce in us the ideas of different colours; as will be explained in its proper place.\n\nThat the particles which constitute light are exceedingly small, appears from this, that if a hole be made through a piece of paper with a needle, rays of light from every object on the farther side of it are capable of being transmitted through it at once without the least confusion; for any one of those objects may as clearly be seen through it, as if no rays passed through it from any of the rest. Besides, if a candle is lighted, and there be no obstacle in the way to obstruct the progress of its rays, it will fill all the space within some miles of it every way with luminous particles, before it has lost the least sensible part of its substance in consequence of this copious emission.\n\nIt is evident that these particles proceed from every point of the surface of a visible body, and in all directions, because wherever a spectator is placed with regard to the body, every point of that part of the surface which is turned towards him is visible. That they proceed from the body in right lines, we are assured, because just so many and no more will be intercepted in their passage to any place by an interposed object, as that object ought to intercept, supposing them to come in such lines.\n\nThe velocity with which they proceed from the surface of the visible body is no less surprising than their minuteness: the method by which philosophers estimate their velocity, is by observations made on the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites; which eclipses appear to us about seven minutes sooner than they ought to do by calculation, when the earth is placed between the sun and him, that is, when we are nearest to him; and as much later, when the sun is between him and us, at which time we are farthest from him. Hence it is concluded, that they require about seven minutes to pass over a space equal to the distance of the earth from the sun.\n\nA stream of these particles issuing from the surface of a visible body in one and the same direction, is called a ray of light.\n\nAs rays proceed from a visible body in all directions, they necessarily become thinner and thinner, continually spreading themselves as they pass along into a larger space, and that in proportion to the squares of their distances from the body; that is, at the distance of two spaces, they are four times thinner than they are at one; at the distance of three spaces, nine times thinner, and so on.\n\nChap. II. On Refraction.\n\nLight, when proceeding from a luminous body, is invariably found to proceed in straight lines, without the least deviation. But, if it happens to pass obliquely from one medium to another, it always leaves the direction it had before, and assumes a new one; and this change of course is called its refraction. After having taken this new direction, it then proceeds invariably in a straight line till it meets with a different medium, when it is again turned out of its course. It must be observed, however, that though by this means we may cause the rays of light to make any number of angles in their course, it is impossible to make them describe a curve, except in one single case, namely, where they pass through a medium, the density of which uniformly either increases or decreases. This is the case with the light of the celestial bodies, which passes downwards through our atmosphere, and likewise with that which is reflected upwards through it by terrestrial objects. In both these cases, it describes a curve of the hyperbolic kind; but at all other times it proceeds in straight lines, or in what may be taken for straight lines without any sensible error.\n\nSect. I. On the Cause of Refraction, and the Law by which it is performed.\n\nThe phenomena of refraction are explained by an attractive power in the medium through which light passes, in the following manner. All bodies being endowed with an attractive force, which is extended to some distance beyond their surfaces; when a ray of light passes out of a rarer into a denser medium (if this latter medium has a greater attractive force than the former, as is commonly the case), the ray, just before its entrance, will begin to be attracted towards the denser medium; and this attraction will continue to act upon it, till some time after it has entered the medium; and therefore, if a ray approaches a denser medium in a direction perpendicular to its surface, its velocity will be continually accelerated during its passage through the space in which that attraction exerts itself; and therefore, after it has passed that space, it will move on, till it arrive at the opposite side of the medium, with a greater degree of velocity than it had before it entered. So that in this case its velocity only will be altered. Whereas, if a ray enters a denser medium obliquely, it will not only have its velocity augmented thereby, but its direction will become less oblique to the surface. Just as when a stone is thrown downwards obliquely from a precipice, it falls to the surface of the ground in a direction nearer to a perpendicular one, than that with which it was thrown from the hand. Hence we see a ray of light, in passing out of a rarer into a denser medium, is refracted towards the perpendicular; that is, supposing a line drawn perpendicularly to the surface of the medium, through the point where the ray enters, and extended both ways, the ray in passing through the surface is refracted or bent towards the perpendicular line; or, which is the same thing, the line which it describes by its motion after it has passed through the surface, makes a less angle with the perpendicular, than the line which it described before. These positions may be illustrated in the following manner.\n\nLet us suppose first, that the ray passes out of a vacuum into the denser medium ABCD (fig. 3.), and that the attractive force of each particle in the medium is extended from its respective centre to a distance equal to that which is between the lines AB and EF, or AB and GH; and let KL be the path described by a ray of light in its progress towards the denser medium. This ray, when it arrives at L, will enter the sphere of attraction of those particles which lie in AB the surface of the denser medium, and will therefore cease to proceed any longer in the right line KLM, but will be diverted from its course by being attracted towards...\nNow the line which a ray describes before it enters a denser or a rarer medium, is called the incident ray; and that which it describes after it has entered, is the refracted ray.\n\nThe angle comprehended between the incident ray and the perpendicular, is the angle of incidence; and that between the refracted ray and the perpendicular, is the angle of refraction.\n\nThere is a certain and immutable law, by which refraction is always performed; which is this: Whatever inclination a ray of light has to the surface of any medium before it enters it, the degree of refraction will always be such, that the sine of the angle of incidence and that of the angle of refraction, will always have a constant ratio to one another in that medium.\n\nTo illustrate this: Let us suppose ABCD (fig. 4.) to represent a rarer, and ABEF a denser medium: let GH be a ray of light passing through the first and entering the second at H, and let HI be the refracted ray: then supposing the perpendicular PR drawn through the point H, on the centre H, and with any radius, describe the circle ABPR; and from G and I, where the incident and refracted rays cut the circle, let fall the lines GK and IL perpendicularly upon the line PR; the former of these will be the sine of the angle of incidence, the latter of refraction. Now if in this case the ray GH is so refracted at H, that GK is double or triple, &c. of IL, then whatever other inclination the ray GH might have had, the sine of its angle of incidence would have been double or triple, &c. to that of its angle of refraction. For instance, had the ray passed in the line MH before refraction, it would have passed in some line as HN afterwards, so situated that MO should have been double or triple, &c. of NO.\n\nThe following table contains the refractive densities of several bodies.\n\n| Substance          | Refractive Density |\n|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Diamond            | 2.500             |\n| Flint-glass        | 1.585             |\n| Plate glass        | 1.502             |\n| Crown glass        | 1.525             |\n| Sulphuric acid     | 1.435             |\n| Solution of potash | 1.390             |\n| Olive oil          | 1.469             |\n| Alcohol            | 1.370             |\n| Atmospheric air    | 1.00276           |\n| Ice                | 1.31              |\n| Water              | 1.336             |\n\nThis relation of the sine of the angle of incidence to that of refraction, which is a proportion of the most extensive use in explaining the optical phenomena on physical or mechanical principles, may be demonstrated in the following easy and familiar manner.\n\n**Lemma I.**\n\nThe augmentations or diminutions of the squares of the velocities produced by the uniform action of accelerating or retarding forces, are proportional to the forces, and to the spaces along which they act, jointly; or are proportional to the products of the forces multiplied by the spaces.\n\nLet two bodies be uniformly accelerated from a state of rest in the points A a, along the spaces AB, a b, fig. 5.\nTheory.\n\nLaw of Refraction.\n\nFig. 5.\n\nby the accelerating forces $F_f$, and let $AC, ac$ be spaces described in equal times; it is evident, from what has been said under the articles Gravity and Acceleration, that because these spaces are described with motions uniformly accelerated, $AC$ and $ac$ are respectively the halves of the spaces which would be uniformly described during the same time with the velocities acquired at $C$ and $c$, and are therefore measures of these velocities. And as these velocities are uniformly acquired in equal times, they are measures of the accelerating forces. Therefore, $AC : ac = F : f$. Also, from the nature of uniformly accelerated motion, the spaces are proportional to the squares of the acquired velocities. Therefore, (using the symbols $\\sqrt{a} C, \\sqrt{a} c$, &c., to express the squares of the velocities at $C, c$, &c.) we have\n\n$$\\sqrt{a} B : \\sqrt{a} C = AB : AC$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{a} C : \\sqrt{a} c = AC : ac$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{a} c : \\sqrt{a} b = ac : ab$$\n\nTherefore, by equality of compound ratios\n\n$$\\sqrt{a} B : \\sqrt{a} b = AB \\times AC : ab \\times ac = AB \\times F : ab \\times f.$$ \n\nAnd in like manner $$\\sqrt{a} D : \\sqrt{a} d = AD \\times F : ad \\times f,$$\n\nand $$\\sqrt{a} B - \\sqrt{a} D = BD \\times F : bd \\times f.$$\n\nQ.E.D.\n\nCorollary. If the forces are as the spaces inversely, the augmentations or diminutions of the squares of the velocities are equal.\n\nRemark. If $DB, dh$, be taken extremely small, the products $BD \\times F$ and $bd \\times f$ may be called the momentary actions of the forces, or the momentary increments of the squares of the velocities. It is usually expressed, by the writers on the higher mechanics, by the symbol $f'$, or $fdt$, where $f$ means the accelerating force, and $t$ or $dt$ means the indefinitely small space along which it is uniformly exerted. And the proposition is expressed by the fluxionary equation $f' = v$ because $v$ is half the increment of $v^2$, as is well known.\n\nLemma II.\n\nIf a particle of matter, moving with any velocity along the line $AC$, be impelled by an accelerating or retarding force, acting in the same or in the opposite direction, and if the intensity of the force in the different points $B, F, H, C$, &c., be as the ordinates $BD, FG$, &c., to the line $DGE$, the areas $BFGD, BHKD$, &c., will be as the changes made on the square of the velocity at $B$, when the particle arrives at the points $F, H$, &c.\n\nFor let $BC$ be divided into innumerable small portions, of which let $FH$ be one, and let the force be supposed to act uniformly, or to be of invariable intensity during the motion along $FH$; draw $GI$ perpendicular to $HK$: It is evident that the rectangle $FFHG$ will be as the product of the accelerating force by the space along which it acts, and will therefore express the momentary increment of the figure of the velocity. (Lemma I.) The same may be said of every such rectangle. And if the number of the portions, such as $FH$, be increased, and their magnitude diminished without end, the rectangles will ultimately occupy the whole curvilinear area, and the force will therefore be as the finite changes made on the square of the velocity, and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nCorollary. The whole change made on the square of the velocity, is equal to the square of that velocity which the accelerating force would communicate to the particle by impelling it along $BC$ from a state of rest in $B$. For the area $BCED$ will still express the square of this velocity, and it equally expresses the change made on the square of any velocity wherewith the particle may pass through the point $B$, and is independent on the magnitude of that velocity.\n\nRemark. The figure is adapted to the case where the forces all conspire with the initial motion of the particle, or all oppose it, and the area expresses an augmentation or a diminution of the square of the initial velocity. But the reasoning would have been the same, although, in some parts of the line $BC$, the forces had conspired with the initial motion, and in other parts had opposed it. In such a case, the ordinates which express the intensity of the forces must lie on different sides of the abscissa $BC$, and that part of the area which lies on one side must be considered as negative with respect to the other, and be subtracted from it. Thus, if the forces be represented by the ordinates of the dotted curve line $DHE$, which crosses the abscissa in $H$, the figure will correspond to the motion of a particle, which, after moving uniformly along $AB$, is subjected to the action of a variable accelerating force during its motion along $BH$, and the square of its initial velocity is increased by the quantity $BHD$; after which it is retarded during its motion along $HC$, and the square of its velocity in $H$ is diminished by a quantity $HCE$. Therefore the square of the initial velocity is changed by a quantity $BHD - HCE$, or $HCE - BHD$.\n\nThis proposition, which is the 39th of the first book of the Principia, is perhaps the most important in the whole science of mechanics, being the foundation of every application of mechanical theory to the explanation of natural phenomena. No traces of it are to be found in the writings of philosophers before the publication of Newton's Principia, though it is assumed by John Bernoulli and other foreign mathematicians, as an elementary truth, without any acknowledgment of their obligations to its author. It is usually expressed by the equation $f' = v$ and $f' = -v^2$, i.e. the sum of the momentary actions is equal to the whole or finite increment of the square of the velocity.\n\nProposition.\n\nWhen light passes obliquely into or out of a transparent substance, it is refracted so that the fine angle of incidence is to the fine angle of refraction in the constant ratio of the velocity of the refracted light to that of the incident light.\n\nLet $ST, KR$, represent two planes (parallel to, and equidistant from, the refracting surface $XY$) which bound the space in which the light, during its passage, is acted on by the refracting forces.\n\nThe intensity of the refracting forces being supposed equal at equal distances from the bounding planes, though anyhow different at different distances from them, may be represented by the ordinates $T, a, n, q, p, r, e, R$, &c. of the curve $abnpce$, of which the form must be\nbe determined from observation, and may remain forever unknown. The phenomena of inflected light show us that it is attracted by the refracting substance at some distances, and repelled at others.\n\nLet the light, moving uniformly in the direction AB, enter the refracting stratum at B. It will not proceed in that direction, but its path will be incurved upwards, while acted on by a repulsive force, and downwards, while impelled by an attractive force. It will describe some curvilinear path B d o C D E, which AB touches in B, and will finally emerge from the refracting stratum at E, and move uniformly in a straight line EF, which touches the curve in E. If, through b, the intersection of the curve of forces with its abscissa, we draw b o, cutting the path of the light in o, it is evident that this path will be concave upwards between B and o, and concave downwards between o and E. Also, if the initial velocity of the light has been sufficiently small, its path may be so much bent upwards, that in some point d its direction may be parallel to the bounding planes. In this case it is evident, that being under the influence of a repulsive force, it will be more bent upwards, and it will describe d f, equal and similar to d B, and emerge in an angle g f s, equal to A B G. In this case it is reflected, making the angle of reflection equal to that of incidence. By which it appears how reflection, refraction, and inflection, are produced by the same forces and performed by the same laws.\n\nBut let the velocity be supposed sufficiently great to enable the light to penetrate through the refracting stratum, and emerge from it in the direction EF; let AB and EF be supposed to be described in equal times: They will be proportional to the initial and final velocities of the light. Now, because the refracting forces must act in a direction perpendicular to the refracting surface (since they arise from the joint action of all the particles of a homogeneous substance which are within the sphere of mutual action), they cannot affect the motion of the light estimated in the direction of the refracting surface. If, therefore, AG be drawn perpendicular to ST, and FK to KR, the lines GB, EK, must be equal, because they are the motions AB, EF, estimated in the direction of the planes. Draw now EL parallel to AB. It is also equal to it. Therefore, EL, EF, are as the initial and final velocities of the light. But EF is to EL as the fine of the angle ELK to the fine of the angle EFK; that is, as the fine of the angle ABH to the fine of the angle FEI; that is, as the fine of the angle of incidence to the fine of the angle of refraction.\n\nBy the same reasoning it will appear that light, moving in the direction and with the velocity FE, will describe the path EDB, and will emerge in the direction and with the velocity BA.\n\nLet another ray enter the refracting stratum perpendicularly at B, and emerge at Q. Take two points N, P, in the line BQ, extremely near to each other, so that the refracting forces may be supposed to act uniformly along the space NP: draw NC, PD, parallel to ST, CM perpendicular to DP, and MO perpendicular to CD, which may be taken for a straight line. Then, because the forces at C and N are equal, by supposition they may be represented by the equal lines CM and NP. The force NP is wholly employed in accelerating the light along NP; but the force CM being transverse to the motion BD, is but partly employed, and may be conceived as arising from the joint action of the forces CO, OM, of which CO only is employed in accelerating the motion of the light, while OM is employed in incurring its path. Now it is evident, from the similarity of the triangles DCM, MCO, that DC : CM = CM : CO, and that DC \u00d7 CO = CM \u00d7 CM = NP \u00d7 NP. But DC \u00d7 CO and NP \u00d7 NP are as the products of the spaces by the accelerating forces, and express the momentary increments of the squares of the velocities at C and N. (Lemma 1.) These increments, therefore, are equal. And as this must be said of every portion of the paths BCE and BNQ, it follows that the whole increment of the square of the initial velocity produced in the motion along BCE, is equal to the increment produced in the motion along BNQ. And, because the initial velocities were equal in both paths, their squares were equal. Therefore the squares of the final velocities are also equal in both paths, and the final velocities themselves are equal. The initial and final velocities are therefore in a constant ratio, whatever are the directions; and the ratio of the fines of the angles of incidence and refraction being the ratio of the velocities of the refracted and incident light, by the former case of Prop. 1, is also constant.\n\nRemark. The augmentation of the square of the initial velocity is equal to the square of the velocity which a particle of light would have acquired, if impelled from a state of rest at B along the line BQ. (Corol. of the Lemma 2.), and is therefore independent on the initial velocity. As this augmentation is expressed by the curvilinear area a T b n p c R, it depends both on the intensity of the refractive forces, expressed by the ordinates, and on the space through which they act, viz. TR. These circumstances arise from the nature of the transparent substance, and are characteristic of that substance. Therefore, to abbreviate language, we shall call this the specific velocity.\n\nThis specific velocity is easily determined for any substance in which the refraction is observed, by drawing Li perpendicular to EL, meeting in i the circle described with the radius EF. For EI being equal to EF, will represent the velocity of the refracted light, and EL represent the velocity of the incident light, and $E_i = EL^2 + Li^2$, and therefore Li is the augmentation of the square of the initial velocity, and Li is the specific velocity.\n\nIt will now be proper to deduce some corollaries from these propositions, tending to explain the chief phenomena of refraction.\n\nCor. 1. When light is refracted towards the perpendicular to the refracting surface, it is accelerated; and it of light accelerates or is retarded when it is refracted from the perpendicular, retarded by refraction. In the first case, therefore, it must be considered as having been acted on by forces confining (in part at least) with its motion, and vice versa. Therefore, because we see that it is always refracted towards the perpendicular, when passing from a void into any transparent substance, we must conclude that it is, on the whole, attracted by that substance. We must draw the same conclusion from observing, that it is refracted from the perpendicular in its passage out of any transparent substance whatever into a void. It has been attracted backwards by that substance.\nThis acceleration of light in refraction is contrary to the opinion of those philosophers who maintain, that illumination is produced by the undulation of an elastic medium. Euler attempts to prove, by mechanical laws, that the velocities of the incident and refracted light are proportional to the sines of incidence and refraction, while our principles make them in this ratio inversely. Bofovich proposed a fine experiment for deciding this question. The aberration of the fixed stars arises from the combination of the motion of light with the motion of the telescope by which it is observed. Therefore this aberration should be greater or less when observed by means of a telescope filled with water, according as light moves slower or faster through water than through air. He was mistaken in the manner in which the conclusion should be drawn from the observation made in the form prescribed by him; and the experiment has not yet been made in a convincing manner; because no fluid has been found of sufficient transparency to admit of the necessary magnifying power. It is an experiment of the greatest importance to optical science.\n\nCor. 2. If the light be moving within the transparent substance, and if its velocity (estimated in a direction perpendicular to the surface) do not exceed the specific velocity of that substance, it will not emerge from it, but will be reflected backwards in an angle equal to that of its incidence. For it must be observed, that in the figure of last proposition, the excess of the square of EF above the square of EL, is the same with the excess of the square of KF above the square of KL. Therefore the square of the specific velocity is equal to the augmentation or diminution of the square of the perpendicular velocity. If therefore the initial perpendicular velocity FK be precisely equal to the specific velocity, the light will just reach the farther side of the attracting stratum, as at B, where its perpendicular velocity will be completely extinguished, and its motion will be in the direction BT. But it is here under the influence of forces tending towards the plane KR, and its motion will therefore be still incurvated towards it; and it will describe a curve BD equal and similar to EB, and finally emerge back from the refracting stratum into the transparent substance in an angle KDA equal to KEF.\n\nIf the direction of the light be still more oblique, so that its perpendicular velocity is less than the specific velocity, it will not reach the plane ST, but be reflected as soon as it has penetrated so far that the specific velocity of the part penetrated (estimated by the compounding part of the area of forces) is equal to its perpendicular velocity. Thus the ray f'E will describe the path E'd'D'a penetrating to b'd', so that the corresponding area of forces a'b'c'e is equal to the square of f'b', its perpendicular velocity.\n\nThe extreme brilliancy of dew drops and of jewels had often excited the attention of philosophers, and it always appeared a difficulty how light was reflected at all from the posterior surface of transparent bodies. It afforded Sir Isaac Newton his strongest argument against the usual theory of reflection, viz. that it was produced by impact on solid elastic matter. He was the first who took notice of the total reflection in great obliquities; and very properly asked how it can be said that there is any impact in this case, or that the reflecting impact should cease at a particular obliquity?\n\nIt must be acknowledged that it is a very curious circumstance, that a body which is perfectly transparent should cease to be so at a certain obliquity; that certain obliquity should not hinder light from passing wholly through a void into a piece of glass; but that the same wholly obliquity should prevent it from passing from the glass reflected by into a void. The finest experiment for illustrating the substances, fact is, to take two pieces of mirror-glass, not silvered, and put them together with a piece of paper between them, forming a narrow margin all round to keep them apart. Plunge this apparatus into water. When it is held nearly parallel to the surface of the water, everything at the bottom of the vessel will be seen clearly through the glasses; but when they are turned so as to be inclined about 50 degrees, they will intercept the light as much as if they were plates of iron. It will be proper to soak the paper in varnish, to prevent water from getting between the glasses.\n\nWhat is called the brilliant cut in diamonds, is such a disposition of the posterior facets of the diamond, flat cut in that the light is made to fall upon them to obliquely produce that none of it can go through, but all is reflected. To produce this effect in the greatest possible degree is a matter of calculation, and merits the attention of the lapidary. When diamonds are too thin to admit of this form, they are cut in what is called the rose fashion. This has a plain back, and the facets are all on the front, and disposed as to refract the rays into sufficient obliques, to be strongly reflected from the posterior plane. Doublets are made by cutting one thin diamond rose fashion, and another similar one is put behind it, with their plane surfaces joined. Or, more frequently, the outside diamond has the anterior facets of the brilliant, and the inner has the form of the inner part of a brilliant. If they be joined with very pure and strongly refracting varnish, little light is reflected from the separating plane, and their brilliancy is very considerable, though still inferior to a true and deep brilliant. If no varnish be used, much of the light is reflected from the flat side, and the effect of the posterior facets is much diminished. But doublets might be constructed, by making the touching surfaces of a spherical form (of which the curvature should have a due proportion to the size of the stone), that would produce an effect nearly equal to that of the most perfect brilliant.\n\nCor. 3. Since the change made on the square of the velocity of the incident light is a constant quantity, it diminishes follows, that the refraction will diminish as the velocity of the incident light increases. For if Li in fig. 7, be a constant quantity, and EL be increased, it is evident that the ratio of EH or its equal EF, to EL will be diminished, and the angle LEF, which constitutes the refraction, will be diminished. The physical cause of this is easily seen: When the velocity of the incident light is increased, it employs less time in passing through the refracting stratum or space between the planes ST and KR, and is therefore less influenced by the refracting forces. A similar effect would follow if the transparent body were moving with great velocity towards the luminous body.\n\nSome naturalists have accounted for the different refrangibility\nfrangibility of the differently coloured rays, by supposing that the red rays move with the greatest rapidity, and they have determined the difference of original velocity which would produce the observed difference of refraction. But this difference would be observed in the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. They should be ruddy at their immersion, and be some seconds before they attain their pure whiteness; and they should become bluish immediately before they vanish in immersion. This is not observed. Besides, the difference in refrangibility is much greater in flint glass than in crown glass, and this would require a proportionally greater difference in the original velocities. The explanation therefore must be given up.\n\nIt should follow, that the refraction of a star which is in our meridian at six o'clock in the evening should be greater than that of a star which comes on the meridian at six in the morning; because we are moving away from the first, and approaching to the last. But the difference is but \\( \\frac{1}{360} \\) of the whole, and cannot be observed with sufficient accuracy in any way yet practised. A form of observation has been proposed by Dr Blair, professor of practical astronomy in the university of Edinburgh, which promises a very sensible difference of refraction. It is also to be expected, that a difference will be observed in the refraction of the light from the east and western ends of Saturn's ring. Its diameter is about 26 times that of the earth, and it revolves in 10h. 32'. So that the velocity of its edge is about \\( \\frac{1}{7000} \\) of the velocity of the sun's light. If therefore the light be reflected from it according to the laws of perfect elasticity, or in the manner here explained, that which comes to us from the western extremity will move more slowly than that which comes from the eastern extremity in the proportion of 2500 to 2501. And if Saturn can be seen distinctly after a refraction of 30\u00b0 through a prism, the diameter of the ring will be increased one half in one position of the telescope, and will be as much diminished by turning the telescope half round its axis; and an intermediate position will exhibit the ring of a distorted shape. This experiment is one of the most interesting to optical science, as its result will be a severe touchstone of the theories which have been attempted for explaining the phenomena on mechanical principles.\n\nIf the tail of a comet be impelled by the rays of the sun, as is supposed by Euler and others, the light by which its extreme parts are seen by us must have its velocity greatly diminished, being reflected by particles which are moving away from the sun with immense rapidity. This may perhaps be discovered by its greater aberration and refrangibility.\n\nAs common day light is nothing but the sun's light reflected from terrestrial bodies, it is reasonable to expect that it will suffer the same refraction. But nothing but observation could assure us that this would be the case with the light of the stars; and it is rather surprising that the velocity of their light is the same with that of the sun's light. It is a circumstance of connexion between the solar system and the rest of the universe. It was as little to be looked for on the light of terrestrial luminaries. If light be conceived as small particles of matter emitted from bodies by the action of accelerating forces of any kind, the vast diversity which we observe in the constitution of sublunar bodies should make us expect differences in this particular. Yet it is found, that the light of a candle, of a glow-worm, &c., suffers the same refraction, and consilts of the same colours. This circumstance is adduced as an argument against the theory of emission. It is thought more probable that this farness of velocity is owing to the nature of the medium, which determines the frequency of its undulations and the velocity of their propagation.\n\nCor. 4. When two transparent bodies are contiguous, the light in its passage out of the one into the other will be refracted towards or from the perpendicular, according as the refrading forces of the second are greater passes out or less than those of the first, or rather according as the transparent body expressing the square of the specific velocity is dry into a greater or less. And as the difference of these areas is other than a determined quantity, the difference between the velocities in the medium of incidence and the velocity in the medium of refraction, will also be a determined quantity. Therefore the fine of the angle of incidence will be in a constant ratio to the fine of the angle of refraction; and this ratio will be compounded of the ratio of the fine of incidence in the first medium to the fine of refraction in a void; and the ratio of the fine of incidence in a void to the fine of refraction in the second medium. If therefore a ray of light, moving through a void in any direction, shall pass through any number of media bounded by parallel planes, its direction in the last medium will be the same as if it had come into it from a void.\n\nCor. 5. It also follows from these propositions, that if the obliquity of incidence on the posterior surface of a transparent body be such, that the light should be reflected back again, the placing a mass of the same or of another medium in contact with this surface, will cause it to be transmitted, and this the more completely, as the added medium is more dense or more refractive; and the reflection from the separating surface will be the more vivid in proportion as the posterior substance is less dense or of a smaller refractive power. It is not even necessary that the other body be in contact; it is enough if it be so near, that those parts of the refracting strata which are beyond the bodies interfere with or coincide with each other.\n\nAll these consequences are agreeable to experience. The brilliant reflection from a dew-drop ceases when it touches the leaf on which it rests: The brilliancy of a diamond is greatly damaged by moisture getting behind it: The opacity of the combined mirror plates, mentioned in Cor. 2, is removed by letting water get between them: A piece of glass is distinctly or clearly seen in air, more faintly when immersed in water, still more faintly amidst oil of olives, and it is hardly perceived in spirits of turpentine. These phenomena are incompatible with the notion that reflection is occasioned by impact on solid matter, whether of the transparent body, or of any ether or other fancied fluid behind it; and their perfect coincidence with the legitimate consequences of the assumed principles, is a strong argument in favour of the truth of those principles.\n\nIt is worth while to mention here a fact taken notice of by Mr Beguelin, and proposed as a great difficulty to the Newtonian theory of refraction. In order to get Newton an the greatest possible refraction, and the simplest measure theory of the refracting power at the anterior surface of any transparent...\nLaw of Refraction\n\ntransparent substance, Sir Isaac Newton enjoins us to employ a ray of light falling on the surface quam obliquissimi. But Mr Beguelin found, that when the obliquity of incidence in glass was about 80\u00b0 30', no light was refracted, but that it was wholly reflected. He also observed, that when he gradually increased the obliquity of incidence on the posterior surface of the glass, the light which emerged last of all did not skim along the surface, making an angle of 90\u00b0 with the perpendicular, as it should do by the Newtonian theory, but made an angle of more than ten minutes with the posterior surface. Also, when he began with very great obliquities, so that all the light was reflected back into the glass, and gradually diminished the obliquity of incidence, the first ray of light which emerged did not skim along the surface, but was raised about 10 or 15 minutes.\n\nBut all these phenomena are necessary consequences of our principles, combined with what observation teaches us concerning the forces which bodies exert on the rays of light. It is evident, from the experiments of Grimaldi and Newton, that light is both attracted and repelled by solid bodies. Newton's sagacious analysis of these experiments discovered several alternations of actual inflection and deflection; and he gives us the precise distance from the body when some of these attractions end and repulsion commences; and the most remote action to be observed in his experiments is repulsion. Let us suppose this to be the case, although it be not absolutely necessary. Let us suppose that the forces are represented by the ordinates of a curve \\(abnp\\), which crosses the abscissa in \\(b\\). Draw \\(bo\\) parallel to the refracting surface. When the obliquity of incidence of the ray \\(AB\\) has become so great, that its path in the glass, or in the refracting stratum, does not cut, but only touches the line \\(ob\\), it can penetrate no further, but is totally reflected; and this must happen in all greater obliquities. On the other hand, when the ray \\(LE\\), moving within the glass, has but a very small perpendicular velocity, it will penetrate the refracting stratum no further than till this perpendicular velocity is extinguished, and its path becomes parallel to the surface, and it will be reflected back. As the perpendicular velocity increases by diminishing the obliquity of incidence, it will penetrate farther; and the last reflection will happen when it penetrates so far that its path touches the line \\(ob\\). Now diminish the obliquity by a single second; the light will get over the line \\(ob\\), will describe an arch \\(adB\\) concave upwards, and will emerge in a direction \\(BA\\), which does not skim the surface, but is sensibly raised above it. And thus the facts observed by M. Beguelin, instead of being an objection against this theory, afford an argument in its favour.\n\nCor. 6. Those philosophers who maintain the theory of undulation, are under the necessity of connecting the dispersive powers of bodies with their mean refractive powers. M. Euler has attempted to deduce a necessary difference in the velocity of the rays of different colours from the different frequency of the undulations, which he affirms as the cause of their different colorific powers. His reasoning on this subject is of the most delicate nature, and unintelligible to such as are not completely master of the infinitesimal calculus of partial differences, and is unsatisfactory to such as are able to go through its intricacies. It is contradicted by fact. He says,\n\nthat musical sounds which differ greatly in acuteness are propagated through the air with different velocities; but one of the smallest bells in the chimes of St Giles's church in Edinburgh was struck against the rim of the very deep-toned bell on which the hours are struck. When the sound was listened to by a nice observer at the distance of more than two miles, no interval whatever could be observed. A similar experiment was exhibited to M. Euler himself, by means of a curious instrument used at St Peterburgh, and which may be heard at three or four miles distance. But the experiment with the bells is unexceptionable, as the two sounds were produced in the very same instant. This connection between the refrangibility in general and the velocity must be admitted, in its full extent, in every attempt to explain refraction by undulation; and Euler was forced by it to adopt a certain consequence which made a necessary connection between the mean refraction and the dispersion of heterogeneous rays. Confident of his analysis, he gave a deaf ear to all that was told him of Mr Dollond's improvements on telephones, and affirmed, that they could not be such as were related; for an increase of mean refraction must always be accompanied with a determined increase of dispersion. Newton had said the same thing, being misled by a limited view of his own principles; but the dispersion assigned by him was different from that assigned by Euler. The dispute between Euler and Dollond was confined to the decision of this question only; and when some glases made by a German chemist at Peterburgh convinced Euler that his determination was erroneous, he did not give up the principle which had forced him to this determination of the dispersion, but immediately introduced a new theory of the achromatic telephones of Dollond; a theory which took the artists out of the track marked out by mathematicians, and in which they had made considerable advances, and led them into another path, proposing maxims of construction hitherto untried, and inconsistent with real improvements which they had already made. The leading principle in this theory is to arrange the different ultimate images of leads artists, a point which arise either from the errors of a spherical figure or different refrangibility, in a straight line passing through the centre of the eye. The theory itself is specious; and it requires great mathematical skill to accomplish this point, and hardly less to decide on the propriety of the construction which it recommends. It is therefore but little known. But that it is a false theory, is evident from one simple consideration. In the most distinct vision arising from the worst construction, this rectilineal arrangement of the images obtains completely in that pencil which is situated in the axis, and yet the vision is indistinct. But, what is to our present purpose, this new theory is purely mathematical, failing any observed dispersive power, and has no connection with the physical theory of undulations, or indeed with any mechanical principles whatever. But, by admitting any dispersive power, whatever may be the mean refraction, all the physical doctrines in his Nova Theoria Lucis et Colorum are overlooked, and therefore never once mentioned, although the effects of M. Zeiller's glasses are taken notice of as inconsistent with that mechanical proposition of Newton's which occasioned the whole dispute between Euler and Dollond.\n\nThey are indeed inconsistent with the universality of\nthat proposition. Newton advances it in his Optics merely as a mathematical proposition highly probable, but says that it will be corrected if he shall find it false. The ground on which he seems (for he does not expressly say so) to rest its probability, is a limited view of his own principle, the action of bodies on light. He (not knowing any cause to the contrary) supposed that the action of all bodies was similar on the different kinds of light, that is, that the specific velocities of the differently coloured rays had a determined proportion to each other. This was gratuitous; and it might have been doubted by him who had observed the analogy between the chemical actions of bodies by elective attractions and repulsions, and the similar actions on light. Not only have different substances unequal actions on their solids, but the order of their affinities is also different. In like manner, we might expect not only that some bodies would attract light in general more than others, but also might differ in the proportion of their actions on the different kinds of light, and this so much, that some might even attract the red more than the violet. The late discoveries in chemistry show us some very distinct proofs, that light is not exempted from the laws of chemical action, and that it is susceptible of chemical combination. The changes produced by the sun's light on vegetable colours, show the necessity of illumination to produce the green foliage; and the aromatic oils of plants, the irritability of their leaves by the action of light, the curious effects of it on the mineral acids, on manganese, and the calces of bismuth and lead, and the inhibition and subsequent emission of it by phosphorescent bodies, are strong proofs of its chemical affinities, and are quite inexplicable on the theory of undulations.\n\nAll these considerations taken together, had they been known to Sir Isaac Newton, would have made him expect differences quite anomalous in the dispersive powers of different transparent bodies; at the same time that they would have afforded to his sagacious mind the strongest arguments for the actual emission of light from the luminous body.\n\nHaving in this manner established the observed law of refraction on mechanical principles, showing it to be a necessary consequence of the known action of bodies on light, we proceed to trace its mathematical consequences through the various cases in which it may be exhibited to our observation. These constitute that part of the mathematical branch of optical science which is called dioptries.\n\nWe are quite unacquainted with the law of action of bodies on light, that is, with the variation of the intensity of the attractions and repulsions exerted at different distances. All that we can say is, that from the experiments and observations of Grimaldi, Newton, and others, light is deflected towards a body, or is attracted by it, at some distances, and repelled at others, and this with a variable intensity. The action may be extremely different, both in extent and force, in different bodies, and change by a very different law with the same change of distance. But, amidst all this variety, there is a certain similarity arising from the joint action of many particles, which should be noticed, because it tends both to explain the familiarity observed in the reflections of light, and also its connexion with the phenomena of refraction.\n\nThe law of variation in the joint action of many particles adjoining to the surface of a refracting medium, is the law of extremely different from that of a single particle; but variation in when this last is known, the other may be found out. We shall illustrate this matter by a very simple case. Let DE be the surface of a medium, and let us suppose different that the action of a particle of the medium on a particle from that of light extends to the distance EA, and that it is proportional to the ordinates ED, FF', GG', HH', &c. of Plate cclxxxvii. fig. 9. the line A C f D; that is, that the action of the particle E of the medium on a particle of light in F, is to its action on a particle in H as F' to HH', and that it is attracted at F but repelled at H, as expressed by the situation of the ordinates with respect to the abscissa. In the line AE produced to B, make EB, EZ, EY, E\u03c6, &c. respectively equal to EA, EH, EC, EG, EF, &c.\n\nIt is evident that a particle of the medium at B will exert no action on the particle of light in E, and that the particles of the medium in \u03c6 will exert on it actions proportional to HH', GG', FF', ED. Therefore, supposing the matter of the medium continuous, the whole action exerted by the row of particles EB will be represented by the area A h CDE; and the action of the particles between B and \u03c6 will be represented by the area A h C f F, and that of the particles between it and \u03c6 by the area F' f DE.\n\nNow let the particle of light be in F, and take F o = A E. It is no less evident that the particle of light in F will be acted on by the particles in Eo alone, and that it will be acted on in the same manner as a particle in E is acted on by the particles in \u03c6B. Therefore the action of the whole row of particles EB on a particle in F will be represented by the area A h C f F. And thus the action on a particle of light in any point of AE will be represented by the area which lies beyond it.\n\nBut let us suppose the particles of light to be within the medium, as at \u03c6, and make \u03c6 d = A E. It is again evident that it is acted on by the particles of the medium between \u03c6 and d with a force represented by the area A h CDE, and in the opposite direction by the particles in E\u03c6 with a force represented by the area F' f DE. This balances an equal quantity of action, and there remains an action expressed by the area A h C f F. Therefore, if an equal and similar line to A h CDE be described on the abscissa EB, the action of the medium on a particle of light in \u03c6 will be represented by the area \u03c6 f x h B, lying beyond it.\n\nIf we now draw a line AKLMRNPB, whose ordinates CK, FQ, \u03c6 R, &c. are as the areas of the other curve, eliminated from A and B; these ordinates will represent the whole forces which are exerted by the particles in EB, on a particle of light moving from A to B. This curve will cut the axis in points L, N such, that the ordinates drawn through them intercept areas of the first curve, which are equal on each side of the axis; and in these points the particle of light sustains no action from the medium. These points are very different from the similar points of the curve expressing the action of a single particle. These last are in the very places where the light sustains the greatest repulsive action.\nTheory.\n\nRefraction of the whole row of particles. In the same manner may a curve be constructed, whose ordinates express the united action of the whole medium.\n\nFrom these observations we learn in general, that a particle of light within the space of action is acted on with equal forces, and in the same direction, when at equal distances on each side of the surface of the medium.\n\nSect. II. Of the focal distance of rays refracted by passing out of one medium into another of different density and through a plane surface.\n\nLemma.\n\nThe indefinitely small variation of the angle of incidence is to the simultaneous variation of the angle of refraction as the tangent of incidence is to the tangent of refraction; or, the contemporaneous variations of the angles of incidence and refraction are proportional to the tangents of these angles.\n\nLet RVF, r Vf (fig. 10.) be the progress of the rays refracted at V (the angle r VR being considered in its nascent or evanescent state), and VC perpendicular to the refracting surface VA. From C draw CD, CB perpendicular to the incident and refracted rays RV, VF, cutting r V, Vf in \u03b4 and \u03b2, and let Cd, Cb be perpendicular to r V, Vf.\n\nBecause the fines of incidence and refraction are in a constant ratio, their simultaneous variations are in the same constant ratio. Now the angle RVr is to the angle FVf in the ratio of BC to DV; that is, of BC to DV; that is, of fin. incid. to fin. refr.; that is, of cof. incid. to cof. refr.; that is, of tan. incid. to tan. refr.\n\nCorollary. The difference of these variations is to the greatest or least of them as the difference of the tangents to the greatest or least tangent.\n\nProblem.\n\nLet two rays RV, RP diverge from, or converge to, a point R, and pass through the plane surface PV, separating two refracting mediums AB, of which let B be the most refracting, and let RV be perpendicular to the surface. It is required to determine the point of dispersion or convergence, F, of the refracted rays VD, PE.\n\nMake VR to VG as the fine of refraction to the fine of incidence, and draw GIK parallel to the surface, cutting the incident ray in I. About the centre P, with the radius PI, describe an arch of a circle IP, cut-\n\nting VR in F; draw PE tending from or towards F. We say PE is the refracted ray, and F the point of dispersion or convergence of the rays RV, RP, or the conjugate focus to R.\n\nFor since GI and PV are parallel, and PF equal to PI, we have PF : PR = PI : PR = VG : VR = fin. incid. : fin. refr. But PF : PR = fin. PRV : fin. PFV, and RRV is equal to the angle of incidence at P; therefore PFV is the corresponding angle of refraction, FPE is the refracted ray, and F the conjugate focus to R.\n\nCor. 1. If diverging or converging rays fall on the surface of a more refracting medium, they will diverge or converge less after refraction, F being farther from the surface than R. The contrary must happen when the diverging or converging rays fall on the surface of a less refracting medium, because, in this case, F is nearer to the surface than R.\n\nCor. 2. Let Rp be another ray, more oblique than RP, the refracting point p being farther from V, and let fp e be the refracted ray, determined by the same construction. Because the arches FI, fi, are perpendicular to their radii, it is evident that they will converge to some point within the angle RJK, and therefore will not cross each other between F and I; therefore RF will be greater than RF, as RF is greater than RG, for similar reasons. Hence it follows, that all the rays which tended from or towards R, and were incident on the whole of VPp, will not diverge from or converge to F, but will be diffused over the line GFf. This diffusion is called aberration from the focus, and is so much greater as the rays are more oblique. No rays flowing from or towards R will have point of concourse with RV nearer to R than F is: But if the obliquity be inconceivable, so that the ratio of RP to FP does not differ sensibly from that of RV to FV, the point of concourse will not be sensibly removed from G. G is therefore usually called the conjugate focus to R. It is the conjugate focus of an indefinitely slender pencil of rays falling perpendicularly on the surface. The conjugate focus of an oblique pencil, or even of two oblique rays, whose dispersion on the surface is considerable, is of more difficult investigation. See Gravefind's Natural Philosophy for a very neat and elementary determination (B).\n\nIn a work of this kind, it is enough to have pointed out, in an easy and familiar manner, the nature of optical aberration. But as this is the chief cause of the imperfection of optical instruments, and as the only method of removing this imperfection is to diminish this aberration, or correct it by a subsequent aberration in the opposite direction, we shall here give a fundamental and very simple proposition, which will (with obvious alterations) apply to all important cases. This is the determination of the focus of an infinitely slender pencil of oblique rays RP, Rp.\n\n\"Retaining the former construction for the ray PF,\"\n\n(Plate ccclxxviii. figs. 1, 2, 3, 4.)\n\n(n) We refer to Gravefind, because we consider it of importance to make such a work as ours serve as a general index to science and literature. At the same time we take the liberty to observe, that the focus in question is virtually determined by the construction which we have given: for the points P, F of the line PF are determined, and therefore its position is also determined. The same is true of the position of pf, and therefore the intersection \u03d5 of the two lines is likewise determined.\nRefraction (fig. 1.) suppose the other ray R\u03c1 infinitely near to RP.\n\nDraw PS perpendicular to PV, and RV perpendicular to RP, and make PR : PS = VR : VF. On PR describe the semicircle rRP, and on PS the semicircle S\u03c6P, cutting the refracted ray PF in \u03c6, draw \u03c1r, \u03c1S, \u03c1\u03c6. It follows from the lemma, that if \u03d5 be the focus of refracted rays, the variation P\u03c6\u03c1 of the angle of refraction is to the corresponding variation PR\u03c1 of the angle of incidence as the tangent of the angle of refraction VRF is to the tangent of the angle of incidence VRP. Now PR may be considered as coinciding with the arch of the semicircles. Therefore the angles PR\u03c1, P\u03c1r are equal, as also the angles P\u03c6\u03c1, PS\u03c6. But PS\u03c6 is to P\u03c1r as PR to PS; that is, as VR to VF; that is, as the cotangent of the angle of incidence to the cotangent of the angle of refraction; that is, as the tangent of the angle of refraction to the tangent of the angle of incidence. Therefore the point \u03d5 is the focus.\n\n**Sect. III. Of Refraction by Spherical Surfaces.**\n\n**Problem.**\n\nTo find the focus of refracted rays, the focus of incident rays being given.\n\nLet PV\u03c0 (figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,) be a spherical surface whose centre is C, and let the incident light diverge from or converge to R. Draw the ray RC through the centre, cutting the surface in the point V, which we shall denominate the vertex, while RC is called the axis. This ray passes on without refraction, because it coincides with the perpendicular to the surface.\n\nLet RP be another incident ray, which is refracted at P, draw the radius PC. In RP make RE to RP as the fine of incidence m to the fine of refraction n; and about the centre R, with the distance RE, describe the circle EK, cutting PC in K; draw RK and RF parallel to it, cutting the axis in F. PF is the refracted ray, and F is the focus.\n\nFor the triangles PCF, KCR are similar, and the angles at P and K are equal. Also RK is equal to RF, and RPD is the angle of incidence. Now \\( m : n = RK : RP = \\text{fin. DPR} : \\text{fin. RKP} = \\text{fin. DPR} : \\text{fin. CPF} \\). Therefore CPF is the angle of refraction corresponding to the angle of incidence RPD, and PF is the refracted ray, and F the focus. Q.E.D.\n\nCor. 1. CK : CP = CR : CF, and \\( \\frac{CP}{CK} = \\frac{CR}{CF} \\).\n\nNow \\( \\frac{CP}{CK} \\) is a constant quantity; and therefore CF is reciprocally as CK, which evidently varies with a variation of the arch VP. Hence it follows, that all the rays flowing from R are not collected at the conjugate focus F. The ultimate situation of the point F, as the point P gradually approaches to, and at last coincides with, V, is called the conjugate focus of central rays, and the distance between this focus and the focus of a lateral ray is called the aberration of that ray, arising from the spherical figure.\n\nThere are, however, two situations of the point R such, that all the rays which flow from it are made to diverge from one point. One of those is C (fig. 5.), because they all pass through without refraction, and therefore still diverge from C; the other is when rays in the rare medium with a convex surface flow from a point R, so situated beyond the centre that CV is to CR as the fine of incidence in the rare medium is to the fine of refraction in the denser, or when rays in the rare medium fall on the convex surface of the denser, converging to F, so situated that \\( CV : CV = m : n \\). In this case they will all be dispersed from F, so situated that \\( CV : CF = n : m = CR : CV \\) for fine RPC: fine PKC = n : m = CR : CP, fine RPC : fine PRC. Therefore the angle PRC is equal to PKC, or to FPC (by construction of the problem), and the angle C is common to the triangles PRC, FPC; they are therefore similar, and the angles PRC, FPC are equal, and \\( n : m = CP : CF = CR : CP \\); therefore \\( CP : CK = CP : CR \\); but CP and CR are constant quantities, and therefore CK is a constant quantity, and (by the corollary) CF is a constant quantity, and all the rays flowing from R are dispersed from F by refraction. In like manner rays converging to F will by refraction converge to R. This was first observed by Huygens.\n\nCor. 2. If the incident ray R'P' is parallel to the axis Fig. 5. RC, we have PO to CO as the fine of incidence to the fine of refraction. For the triangles R'PK'PCO are similar, and PO : CO = R'K' : R'P', \\( m : n \\).\n\nCor. 3. In this case, too, we have the focal distance of central parallel rays reckoned from the vertex \\( \\frac{n}{m-n} \\times VC \\). For since PO is ultimately VO, we have \\( \\frac{n}{m-n} : VO : CO \\), and \\( m - n : m = VO : CO : VO = VC : VO \\), and \\( VO = \\frac{m}{m-n} \\times VC \\). This is called the principal focal distance, or focal distance of parallel rays. Also CO, the principal focal distance reckoned from the centre, \\( \\frac{n}{m-n} \\times VC \\).\n\nN.B. When \\( m \\) is less than \\( n \\), \\( m - n \\) is a negative quantity. Also observe, that in applying symbols to this computation of the focal distances, those lines are to be accounted positive which lie from their beginnings, that is, from the vertex, or the centre, or the radiant point, in the direction of the incident rays. Thus when rays diverge from R on the convex surface of a medium, VR is accounted negative and VC positive. If the light passes out of air into glass, \\( m \\) is greater than \\( n \\); but if it passes out of glass into air, \\( m \\) is less than \\( n \\). If, therefore, parallel rays fall on the convex surface of glass out of air, in which case \\( m : n = 3 : 2 \\) very nearly, we have for the principal focal distance \\( \\frac{3}{2-3} \\times VC \\), or \\( +\\frac{3}{2} \\times VC \\). But if it passes out of glass into the convex surface of air, we have \\( VO = \\frac{2}{2-3} \\times VC \\), or \\( -\\frac{2}{2} \\times VC \\); that is, the focus O will be in the same side of the surface with the incident light. In like manner, we shall have for these two cases \\( CO = +\\frac{2}{2} \\times VC \\) and \\( -\\frac{2}{2} \\times VC \\).\n\nCor. 4. By construction we have \\( RK : RP = m : n \\) by similarity of triangles \\( \\frac{PF}{RK} = \\frac{CF}{CR} \\), \\( \\frac{PF}{PH} = \\frac{m}{n} \\times CF : nCR \\), and \\( mPR \\times CF = CR \\times PF \\), therefore \\( mPR : nCR = PF : CF \\) and \\( mPR = nCR : mPR = PF : CF : PF \\) ultimately \\( mVR = nCR : mVR = VC : VF \\).\n\nThis is a very general optical theorem, and affords an easy method for computing the focal distance of refracted rays.\nFor this purpose let VR, the distance of the radiant point, be expressed by the symbol r, the distance of the focus of refracted rays by the symbol f, and the radius of the spherical surface by a; we have\n\n\\[ m r - n r - a : m r = a : f, \\text{ and} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{m r}{m r - n r - a}, \\quad \\frac{m r}{m r - n r + n d}. \\]\n\nIn its application due attention must be paid to the qualities of r and a, whether they be positive or negative, according to the conditions of last corollary.\n\nCor. 5. If Q be the focus of parallel rays coming from the opposite side, we shall have RQ: QC = RV: VF. For draw Cq parallel to PF, cutting RP in q; then Rq: qC = RP: PF. Now q is the focus of the parallel rays FP, Cq. And when the point P ultimately coincides with the point V, q must coincide with Q, and we have RQ: QC = RV: VF.\n\nThis is the most general optical theorem, and is equally applicable to lenses, or even to a combination of them, as to simple surfaces. It is also applicable to reflections, with this difference, that Q is to be assumed the focus of parallel rays coming the same way with the incident rays. It affords us the most compendious methods of computing symbolically and arithmetically the focal distances in all cases.\n\nCor. 6. We have also Rq: RP = RV: RF, and ultimately for central rays RQ: RV = RV: RF, and RF = RV. This proposition is true in lenses and mirrors, but not in single refracting surfaces.\n\nCor. 7. Also Rq: RC = RP: RF, and ultimately RQ: RV = RC: RF, and RF = RV \u00d7 RC. N.B. These four points Q, V, C, F, either lie all one way from P, or two of them forward and two backward.\n\nCor. 8. Also, making O the principal focus of rays coming the same way, we have Rq: qC = CO: OF, and OF = QC \u00d7 CO, ultimately RQ: QC = CO: OF, and OF = QC \u00d7 CO, and therefore reciprocally proportional to RQ, because QC \u00d7 CO is a constant quantity.\n\nThese corollaries or theorems give us a variety of methods for finding the focus of refracted rays, or the other points related to them; and each formula contains four points, of which any three being given, the fourth may be found. Perhaps the last is the most simple, as the quantity OC + QC is always negative, because O and Q are on different sides.\n\nCor. 9. From this construction we may also derive a very easy and expeditious method of drawing many refracted rays. Draw through the centre C (fig. 15, 16.) a line to the point of incidence P, and a line CA parallel to the incident ray RP. Take VO as the line of incidence to the line of refraction, and about A, with the radius VO, describe an arch of a circle cutting PC produced in B. Join AB; and PF parallel to AB is the refracted ray. When the incident light is parallel to RC, the point A coincides with V, and a circle described round V with the distance VO will cut the lines PC, pC, &c., in the points Bb. The demonstration is evident.\n\nHaving thus determined the focal distance of refracted rays, it will be proper to point out a little more particularly its relation to its conjugate focus of incident rays. We shall consider the four cases of light incident on the convex or concave surface of a denser or a rarer medium.\n\n1. Let light moving in air fall on the convex surface of glass. Let us suppose it tending to a point beyond the glass infinitely distant. It will be collected to its principal focus o beyond the vertex V. Now let the incident light converge a little, so that R is at a great distance beyond the surface. The focus of refracted rays F will be a little within O or nearer to V. As the incident rays are made to converge more and more, the point R comes nearer to V, and the point F also approaches it, but with a much slower motion, being always situated between O and C till it is overtaken by R at the centre C, when the incident light is perpendicular to the surface in every point, and therefore suffers no refraction. As R has overtaken F at C, it now passes it, and is again overtaken by it at V. Now the point R is on the side from which the light comes, that is, the rays diverge from R. After refraction they will diverge from F a little without R; and as R recedes farther from V, F recedes still farther, and with an accelerated motion, till, when R comes to O, F has gone to an infinite distance, or the refracted rays are parallel. When R still recedes, F now appears on the other side, or beyond V; and as R recedes back to an infinite distance, F has come to O; and this completes the series of variations, the motion of F during the whole changes of situation being in the same direction with the motion of R.\n\n2. Let the light moving in air fall on the concave surface of glass; and let us begin with parallel incident rays, conceiving, as before, R to lie beyond the glass at an infinite distance. The refracted rays will move as if they came from the principal focus O, lying on that side of the glass from which the light comes. As the incident rays are made gradually more converging, and the point of convergence R comes toward the glass, the conjugate focus F moves backward from O; the refracted rays growing less and less diverging, till the point R comes to Q, the principal focus on the other side. The refracted rays growing parallel, or F has retreated to an infinite distance. The incident light converging still more, or R coming between Q and V, F will appear on the other side, or beyond the surface, or within the glass, and will approach it with a retarded motion, and finally overtake R at the surface of the glass. Let R continue its motion backwards (for it has all the while been moving backwards, or in a direction contrary to that of the light); that is, let R now be a radiant point moving backwards from the surface of the glass. F will at first be without it, but will be overtaken by it at the centre C, when the rays will suffer no refraction. R still receding will get without F; and while R recedes to an infinite distance, F will recede to O, and the series will be completed.\n\n3. Let the light moving in glass fall on the convex surface of air; that is, let it come out of the concave surface of glass, and let the incident rays be parallel, or tending to R, infinitely distant: they will be dispersed by refraction from the principal focus O within the glass. As they are made more converging, R comes\nOn Lens, comes nearer, and F retreats backward, till R comes to Q, the principal focus without the glass; when F is now at an infinite distance within the glass, and the refracted rays are parallel. R still coming nearer, F now appears before the glass, overtakes R at the centre C, and is again overtaken by it at N. R now becoming a radiant point within the glass, F follows it backwards, and arrives at O, where it has receded to an infinite distance, and the series is completed.\n\n4. Let the incident light, moving in glass, fall on the concave surface of air, or come out of the convex surface of glass. Let it tend to a point R at an infinite distance without the glass. The refracted rays will converge to O, the principal focus without the glass. As the incident light is made more converging, R comes towards the glass, while F, setting out from v, also approaches the glass, and R overtakes it at the surface V. R now becomes a radiant point within the glass, receding backwards from the surface. F recedes slower at first, but overtakes R at the centre C, and passes it with an accelerated motion to an infinite distance; while R retreats to Q, the principal focus within the glass. If still retreating, F appears before the glass; and while R retreats to an infinite distance, F comes to V, and the series is completed.\n\nSect. IV. On Lenses.\n\nLenses for optical purposes may be ground into nine different shapes. Lenses cut into five of these shapes, together with their axes, are described in vol. vi. page 33. (See Dioptics.) The other four are,\n\n1. A plane glass, which is flat on both sides, and of equal thickness in all its parts, as EF, fig. 1.\n\n2. A flat plano-convex, whose convex side is ground into several little flat surfaces, as A, fig. 2.\n\n3. A prism, which has three flat sides, and when viewed endwise appears like an equilateral triangle, as B.\n\n4. A concavo-convex glass, or meniscus, as C, which is seldom made use of in optical instruments.\n\nA ray of light Gk falling perpendicularly on a plane glass EF, will pass through the glass in the same direction, and go out of it into the air in the same straight line hi.\n\nA ray of light AB falling obliquely on a plane glass, will go out of the glass in the same direction, but not in the same straight line: for in touching the glass, it will be refracted in the line BC; and in leaving the glass, it will be refracted in the line CD.\n\nLemma.\n\nThere is a certain point E within every double convex or double concave lens, through which every ray that passes will have its incident and emergent parts QA, ag parallel to each other: but in a plano-convex or plano-concave lens, that point E is removed to the vertex of the concave or convex surface; and in a meniscus, and in that other concavo-convex lens, it is removed a little way out of them, and lies next to the surface which has the greatest curvature.\n\nFor let REr be the axis of the lens joining the centres B, r of its surfaces A, a. Draw any two of their semidiameters RA, ra parallel to each other, and join the point, A, a, and the line Aa will cut the axis in the point E above described. For the triangles REA, rEr being equiangular, RE will be to Er in the given ratio of the semidiameters RA, ra; and consequently the point E is invariable in the same lens. Now supposing a ray to pass both ways along the line Aa, it being equally inclined to the perpendiculars to the surfaces, will be equally bent, and contrariwise in going out of the lens; so that its emergent parts AQ, ag will be parallel. Now any of these lenses will become plano-convex or plano-concave, by conceiving one of the semidiameters RA, ra to become infinite, and consequently to become parallel to the axis of the lens, and then the other semidiameter will coincide with the axis; and so the points A, E or a, r will coincide. Q. E. D.\n\nCorol. Hence when a pencil of rays falls almost perpendicularly upon any lens, whose thickness is considerable, the course of the ray which passes through E, above described, may be taken for a straight line passing through the centre of the lens without sensible error in sensible things. For it is manifest from the length of Aa, and from the quantity of the refractions at its extremities, that the perpendicular distance of AQ, ag, when produced, will be diminished both as the thickness of the lens and the obliquity of the ray is diminished.\n\nProp. I.\n\nTo find the focus of parallel rays falling almost perpendicularly upon any given lens.\n\nLet E be the centre of the lens, and r the centres of its surfaces, ltr its axis, gLG a line parallel to the incident rays upon the surface B, whole centre is R. Parallel to gE draw a semidiameter BR, in which produced parallel let V be the focus of the rays after their first refraction rays falling at the surface B, and joining VR let it cut gE produced perpendicularly in G, and G will be the focus of the rays that emerge largely upon any lens.\n\nFor since V is also the focus of the rays incident upon the second surface A, the emergent rays must have their focus in some point of that ray which passes straight through this surface; that is, in the line VR, drawn through its centre r; and since the whole course of another ray is reckoned a straight line gEG \u2020, its intersection G with VR determines the focus of them from Lem. Corol. 1. When the incident rays are parallel to the axis rR, the focal distance EF is equal to EG. For let the incident rays that were parallel to gE be gradually more inclined to the axis till they become parallel to it; and their first and second foci V and G will describe circular arches NT and GF whose centres are R and E. For the line RV is invariable; being in proportion to RB in a given ratio of the lesser of the fines of incidence and refraction to their difference (by a former proposition); consequently the line EG is also invariable, being in proportion to the given line RV in the given ratio of rE to rR, because the triangles EGR, RVR are equiangular.\n\nCorol. 2. The last proportion gives the following rule for finding the focal distance of any thin lens. As RV, the interval between the centres of the surfaces, is\nTheory.\n\nOf Lenses. To rE, the semidiameter of the second surface, so is RV or RT, the continuation of the first semidiameter to the first focus, to EG or EF the focal distance of the lens; which, according to the lens is thicker or thinner in the middle than at its edges, must lie on the same side as the emergent rays, or on the opposite side.\n\nCorol. 3. Hence when rays fall parallel on both sides of any lens, the focal distances EF, Ef are equal. For let rt be the continuation of the semidiameter Er to the first focus t of rays falling parallel upon the surface A; and the same rule that gave rR : rE = RT : EF, gives also rR : RE = rt : Ef. Whence Ef = EF, because the rectangles rE \u00d7 BT = RE \u00d7 rt. For rE is to rt and also RE to RT in the same given ratio.\n\nCorol. 4. Hence in particular in a double convex or double concave lens made of glass, it is as the sum of their semidiameters (or in a meniscus as their difference) to either of them, so is double the other, to the focal distance of the glass. For the continuations RT, rt are severally double their semidiameters; because in glass ET : TR and also Ee : ee = 3 : 2.\n\nCorol. 5. Hence if the semidiameters of the surfaces of the glass be equal, its focal distance is equal to one of them; and is equal to the focal distance of a plano-convex or plano-concave glass whose semidiameter is as short again. For considering the plane surface as having an infinite semidiameter, the first ratio of the last mentioned proportion may be reckoned a ratio of equality.\n\nProp. II.\n\nThe focus of incident rays upon a single surface, sphere, or lens, being given, it is required to find the focus of the emergent rays.\n\nLet any point Q be the focus of incident rays upon a spherical surface, lens, or sphere, whose centre is E; and let other rays come parallel to the line QG, the contrary way to the given rays, and after refraction let them belong to a focus F; then taking Ef equal to EF the lens or sphere, but equal to FC in the single surface, say as QF to FE to Ef to fg; and placing fg the contrary way from f to that of FO from F, the point q will be the focus of the refracted rays, without sensible error; provided the point Q be not too remote from the axis, nor the surfaces too broad, as to cause any of the rays to fall too obliquely upon them.\n\nFor with the centre E and semidiameters EF and Ef describe two arches FG, fg cutting any ray QAqg in G and g, and draw EG and Eg. Then supposing G to be a focus of incident rays (as GA), the emergent rays (as agg) will be parallel to GE *; and on the other hand supposing g another focus of incident rays (as ga), the emergent rays (as AGQ) will be parallel to gE. Therefore the triangles QGE, Egq are equiangular, and consequently QG : GE = Eg : gg; that is, when the ray QAqg is the nearest to QE q, QF : FE = Ef : fg. Now when Q accedes to F and coincides with it, the emergent rays become parallel, that is, q recedes to an infinite distance; and consequently when Q passes to the other side of F, the focus q will also pass through an infinite space from one side of f to the other side of it. Q. E. D.\n\nCorol. 1. In a sphere or lens the focus q may be found by this rule: QF : QE = OE : Qg, to be placed the same way from Q as Qf lies from Q. For let the incident and emergent rays QA, qa be produced till they meet in e; and the triangles QGE, Qeg being equiangular, we have QG : QE = Qe : Qg; and when the angles of these triangles are vanishing, the point e will coincide with E; because in the sphere the triangle Ace is equiangular at the base Aa, and consequently Ae and ae will at last become semidiameters of the sphere. In a lens the thickness Aa is inconsiderable.\n\nThe focus may also be found by this rule: QF : FE = QE : Eg, for QG : GE = QA : Ag. And then the rule formerly demonstrated for single surfaces holds good for the lenses.\n\nCorol. 2. In all cases the distance fg varies reciprocally as FQ does; and they lie contrariwise from f and F; because the rectangle or the square under EF and Ef, the middle terms in the foregoing proportions, is invariable.\n\nThe principal focal distance of a lens may not only be found by collecting the rays coming from the sun, considered as parallel, but also (by means of this proposition) it may be found by the light of a candle or window. For, because Qq : qA = QE : EG, we have (when A coincides with E) Qq : qE = QE : EF; that is, the distance observed between the radiant object and its picture in the focus is to the distance of the lens from the focus as the distance of the lens from the radiant is to its principal focal distance. Multiply therefore the distances of the lens from the radiant and focus, and divide the product by their sum.\n\nCorol. 3. Convex lenses of different shapes that have equal focal distance when put into each others places, have equal powers upon any pencil of rays to refract them to the same focus. Because the rules above-mentioned depend only upon the focal distance of the lens, and not upon the proportion of the semidiameters of its surfaces.\n\nCorol. 4. The rule that was given for a sphere of an uniform density, will serve also for finding the focus of a pencil of rays refracted through any number of concentric surfaces, which separate uniform mediums of any different densities. For when rays come parallel to any line drawn through the common centre of these mediums, and are refracted through them all, the distance of their focus from that centre is invariable, as in an uniform sphere.\n\nCorol. 5. When the focuses Q, q lie on the same side of the refracting surfaces, if the incident rays flow from Q, the refracted rays will also flow from q; and if the incident rays flow towards Q, the refracted will also flow towards q; and the contrary will happen when Q and q are on contrary sides of the refracting surfaces. Because the rays are continually going forwards.\n\nFrom this proposition we also derive an easy method of drawing the progress of rays through any number of lenses ranged on a common axis.\n\nLet A, B, C, be the lenses, and RA a ray incident on the first of them. Let \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, be their foci for parallel rays coming in the opposite direction; draw the perpendicular ad; cutting the incident ray in d, and draw da through the centre of the lens: AB parallel to\nOf Vision. To \\( da \\) will be the ray refracted by the first lens. Through the focus of the second lens draw the perpendicular \\( ae \\), cutting \\( AB \\) in \\( e \\); and draw \\( eb \\) through the centre of the second lens. \\( BD \\) parallel to \\( be \\) will be the next refracted ray. Through the focus \\( f \\) of the third lens draw the perpendicular \\( ef \\), cutting \\( BD \\) in \\( f \\); and draw \\( fc \\) through the centre of the third lens. \\( CE \\) parallel to \\( fc \\), will be the refracted ray; and so on.\n\n**Sect. V. On Vision.**\n\nHaving described how the rays of light, flowing from objects, and passing through convex glasses, are collected into points, and form the images of external objects; it will be easy to understand how the rays are refracted by the humours of the eye, and are thereby collected into innumerable points on the retina, on which they form the images of the objects from which they flow. For the different humours of the eye, and particularly the crystalline, are to be considered as a convex glass; and the rays in passing through them are affected in the same manner as in the other. A description of the coats and humours, &c. has been given in Anatomy; but it will be proper to repeat as much of the description as will be sufficient for our present purpose.\n\nThe eye is nearly globular, and consists of three coats and three humours. The part \\( DHHG \\) of the outer coat, is called the sclerotic; the red, \\( DEFG \\), the cornea. Next within this coat is that called the choroides, which serves as it were for a lining to the other, and joins with the iris, \\( mn \\), \\( mn \\). The iris is composed of two sets of muscular fibres; the one of a circular form, which contracts the hole in the middle called the pupil, when the light would otherwise be too strong for the eye; and the other of radial fibres, tending everywhere from the circumference of the iris towards the middle of the pupil; which fibres, by their contraction, dilate and enlarge the pupil when the light is weak, in order to let in a greater quantity of it. The third coat is only a fine expansion of the optic nerve \\( L \\), which forebears like net work all over the inside of the choroides, and is therefore called the retina; upon which are thrown the images of all visible objects.\n\nUnder the cornea is a fine transparent fluid like water, thence called the aqueous humour. It gives a protuberant figure to the cornea, fills the two cavities \\( mm \\) and \\( nn \\), which communicate by the pupil \\( P \\); and has the same limpidity, specific gravity, and refracting power, as water. At the back of this lies the crystalline humour \\( II \\), which is shaped like a double convex glass; and is a little more convex on the back than the fore part. It converges the rays, which pass through it from every visible object to its focus at the bottom of the eye. This humour is transparent like crystal, is of the consistence of hard jelly, and is to the specific gravity of water as 11 to 10. It is enclosed in a fine transparent membrane, called the capsule of the crystalline lens, from which proceed radial fibres \\( oo \\), called the ciliary ligament, all around its edge, and join to the circumference of the iris.\n\nAt the back of the crystalline, lies the vitreous humour \\( KK \\), which is transparent like glass, and is largest of all in quantity, filling the whole orb of the eye, and giving it a globular shape. It is much of a consistence of vision, with the white of an egg, and very little exceeds the specific gravity and refractive power of water.\n\nAs every point of an object \\( ABC \\), sends out rays in the objects all directions, some rays, from every point on the side in the nearest the eye, will fall upon the cornea between \\( B \\) and \\( n \\) of the \\( F \\); and by passing on through the pupil and humours of the eye into the retina or bottom of the eye, and will form upon it a distinct inverted picture \\( ab \\) of the object. Thus, the pencil of rays \\( qrs \\) that flows from the point \\( A \\) of the object, will be converged to the point \\( a \\) on the retina; those from the point \\( B \\) will be converged to the point \\( b \\); those from the point \\( C \\) will be converged to the point \\( c \\); and so of all the intermediate points: by which means the whole image \\( ab \\) is formed, and the object made visible; though it must be owned, that the method by which this sensation is conveyed by the optic nerve from the eye to the brain, and there discerned, is above the reach of our comprehension.\n\nThat vision is effected in this manner, may be demonstrated experimentally. Take a bullock's eye whilst it is fresh; and having cut off the three coats from the back part, quite to the vitreous humour, put a piece of white paper over that part, and hold the eye towards any bright object, and you will see an inverted picture of the object upon the paper, or the same thing may be better accomplished by paring the sclerotic coat so thin that it becomes a little transparent, and retains the vitreous humour.\n\nSince the image is inverted, many have wondered why they the object appears upright. But we are to consider, are seen up.\n\n1. That inverted is only a relative term: and, 2. That right there is a very great difference between the real object and the image by which we perceive it. When all the parts of a distant prospect are painted upon the retina, they are all right with respect to one another, as well as the parts of the prospect itself; and we can only judge of an object's being inverted, when it is turned reverse to its natural position with respect to other objects which we see and compare it with.\u2014If we lay hold of an upright stick in the dark, we can tell which is the upper or lower part of it, by moving our hand downward or upward; and know very well that we cannot feel the upper end by moving our hand downward. In the same manner we find by experience, that upon directing our eyes towards a tall object, we cannot see its top by turning our eyes downward, nor its foot by turning our eyes upward; but must trace the object the same way by the eye to see it from head to foot, as we do by the hand to feel it; and as the judgement is informed by the motion of the hand in one case, so it is also by the motion of the eye in the other.\n\nIn fig. 9, is exhibited the manner of seeing the same object \\( ABC \\), by both the eyes \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) at once.\n\nWhen any part of the image \\( cba \\) falls upon the optic nerve \\( L \\), the corresponding part of the object becomes invisible. On this account, the optic nerve is placed not in the middle of the bottom of both eyes, but towards the side next the nose; so that whatever ever part of the image falls upon the optic nerve of one eye, may not fall upon the optic nerve of the other optic nerve of the eye \\( D \\), but not of the eye \\( E \\); and the point of light.\nTheory.\n\nOf vision. c falls upon the optic nerve of the eye E, but not of the eye D; and therefore to both eyes taken together, the whole object ABC is visible.\n\nThe nearer that any object is to the eye, the larger is the angle under which it is seen, and the magnitude of which it appears. Thus to the eye D, the object ABC is seen under the angle APC; and its image cba is very large upon the retina: but to the eye E, at a double distance, the same object is seen under the angle ApC, which is equal only to half the angle APC, as is evident by the figure. The image cba is likewise twice as large in the eye D, as the other image cba is in the eye E. In both these representations, a part of the image falls on the optic nerve, and the object in the corresponding part is invisible.\n\nAs the sense of seeing is allowed to be occasioned by the impulse of the rays from the visible object upon the retina, and thus forming the image of the object upon it, and that the retina is only the expansion of the optic nerve all over the choroides; it should seem surprising, that the part of the image which falls on the optic nerve should render the like part of the object invisible; especially as that nerve is allowed to be the instrument by which the impulse and image are conveyed to the common fenestra in the brain.\n\nThat part of the image which falls upon the middle of the optic nerve is lost, and consequently the corresponding part of the object is rendered invisible, is plain by experiment. For if a person fixes three patches, A, B, C, (fig. 2.) upon a white wall, at the height of the eye, and at the distance of about a foot from each other, and places himself before them, shutting the right eye, and directing the left towards the patch C, he will see the patches A and C, but the middle patch B will disappear. Or, if he shuts his left eye, and directs the right towards A, he will see both A and C, but B will disappear; and if he directs his eye towards B, he will see both B and A, but not C. For whatever patch is directly opposite to the optic nerve N, vanishes. This requires a little practice; after which he will find it easy to direct his eye so as to lose the sight of whatever patch he pleases.\n\nThis experiment, first tried by M. Marriotte, occasioned a new hypothesis concerning the seat of vision, which he supposed not to be in the retina, but in the choroides. An improvement on the experiment was afterwards made by M. Picard, who contrived that an object should disappear when both the eyes were kept open. He fastened upon a wall a round white paper, an inch or two in diameter; and by the side of it he fixed two marks, one on the right hand, and the other on the left, each at about two feet distance from the paper, and somewhat higher. He then placed himself directly before the paper, at the distance of nine or ten feet, and putting the end of his finger over against both his eyes, so that the left-hand mark might be hid from the right eye, and the right-hand mark from the left eye. Remaining firm in this posture, and looking steadily, with both eyes, on the end of his finger, the paper which was not at all covered by it would totally disappear. This, he says, is the more surprising, because, without this particular encounter of the optic nerves, where no vision is made, the paper will appear double, as is the case when the finger is not rightly placed.\n\nM. Marriotte observes, that this improvement on his experiment, by M. Picard, is ingenious, but difficult to execute, since the eyes must be considerably strained in looking at any object so near as four inches; and professes another not less surprising, and more easy. Place, says he, on a dark ground, two round pieces of white paper, at the same height, and three feet from one another; then stand opposite to them, at the distance of 12 or 13 feet, and hold your thumb before your eyes, at the distance of about eight inches, so that it may conceal from the right eye the paper that is to the left hand, and from the left eye the paper to the right hand. Then, if you look at your thumb steadily with both eyes, you will lose sight of both the papers; the eyes being so disposed, that each of them receives the image of one of the papers upon the back of the optic nerve, while the other is intercepted by the thumb.\n\nM. Le Cat pursued this curious experiment a little farther than M. Marriotte. In the place of the second paper, he fixed a large white board, and observed, that at a proper distance he lost sight of a circular space in the centre of it. He also observed the size of the paper which is thus concealed from the sight, corresponding to several distances, which enabled him to ascertain several circumstances relating to this part of the structure of the eye more exactly than had been done before.\n\nThe following is the manner in which this curious experiment is now generally made. Let three pieces of paper be fastened upon the side of a room, about two feet asunder; and let a person place himself opposite to the middle paper, and, beginning near to it, retire gradually backwards, all the while keeping one of his eyes shut, and the other turned obliquely towards that outside paper which is towards the covered eye, and he will find a situation (which is generally at about five times the distance at which the papers are placed from one another), when the middle paper will entirely disappear, while the two outermost continue plainly visible; because the rays which come from the middle paper will fall upon the retina where the optic nerve is inserted.\n\nIt is not surprising that M. Marriotte was led, by this remarkable observation, to suspect that the retina was the seat of vision. He not only did so; but, in consequence of attentively considering the subject, a variety of other arguments in favour of the choroides occurred to him, particularly his observation, that the retina is transparent, as well as the crystalline and other humours of the eye, which he thought could only enable it to transmit the rays farther; and he could not persuade himself that any substance could be considered as being the termination of the pencils and the proper seat of vision, at which the rays are not stopped in their progress.\n\nHe was farther confirmed in his opinion of the small degree of sensibility in the retina, and of the greater sensibility of the choroides, by observing that the pupil dilates itself in the shade, and contracts itself in a great light; which involuntary motion, he thought, was a clear proof that the fibres of the iris are extremely sensible to the action of light; and this part of the eye is only a continuation of the choroides. He also thought that the dark colour of the choroid coat was intended to make it more susceptible of the impression of light.\nM. Pecquet, in answer to M. Marriotte's observation concerning the transparency of the retina, says, that it is very imperfectly so, resembling only oiled paper, or the horn that is used for lanterns; and besides, that its whiteness demonstrates it to be sufficiently opaque for stopping the rays of light, as much as is necessary for the purpose of vision; whereas, if vision be performed by means of those rays which are transmitted through such a substance as the retina, it must be very difficult. The retina resembles very much the thin white film which intervenes between the white of an egg and its shell.\n\nAs to the blackness of the choroides, which M. Marriotte thought to be necessary for the purpose of vision, M. Pecquet observes, that it is not the same in all eyes, and that there are very different shades of it among the individuals of mankind, as also among birds, and some other animals, whose choroides is generally black; and that in the eyes of lions, camels, bears, oxen, hogs, sheep, dogs, cats, and many other animals, that part of the choroides which is the most exposed to light, very often exhibits colours as vivid as those of mother-of-pearl, or of the iris. He admits that there is a defect of vision at the insertion of the optic nerve; but he thought that it was owing to the blood-vessels of the retina, the trunks of which are so large in that place as to obstruct all vision.\n\nTo M. Pecquet's objection, founded on the opacity of the retina, M. Marriotte replies, that there must be a great difference betwixt the state of that substance in living and dead subjects; and as a further proof of the transparency of the retina, and the power of the choroides beyond it to reflect light, he says, that if a lighted candle be held near to a person's eyes, and a dog, at the distance of eight or ten steps, be made to look at him, he would see a bright light in the dog's eyes, which he thought to proceed from the reflection of the light of the candle from the choroides of the dog, since the same appearance cannot be produced in the eyes of men, or other animals, whose choroides is black.\n\nM. Marriotte observes, in opposition to Pecquet's remark concerning the blood-vessels of the retina, that they are not large enough to prevent vision in every part of the base of the nerve, since the diameter of each of the two vessels occupies no more than a third part of it. Besides, if this were the cause of this want of vision, it would vanish gradually, and the place to which it is confined would not be so exactly terminated as it appears to be.\n\nWe must add, that M. Pecquet also observed, that notwithstanding the insensibility of the retina at the insertion of the optic nerve when the light is only moderate; yet luminous objects, such as a bright candle placed at the distance of four or five paces, do not absolutely disappear, in the same circumstances in which a white paper would; for this strong light may be perceived though the picture fall on the base of the nerve.\n\nDr Priceley, however, found that a large candle made no impression on that part of his eye, though by no means able to bear a strong light.\n\nThe common opinion was also favoured by the anatomical description of several animals by the members of the French academy, and particularly their account of the sea calf and porcupine; in both of which the optic nerve is inserted in the very axis of the eye, exactly opposite to the pupil, which was thought to leave no room to doubt, but that in these animals the retina is perfectly sensible to the impression of light at the insertion of the nerve.\n\nM. De la Hire took part with M. Pecquet, arguing in favour of the retina from the analogy of the senses, in all of which the nerves are the proper seat of sensation. This philosopher, however, supposed that the choroid coat receives the impressions of images, in order to transmit them to the retina.\n\nM. Perrault also took the part of M. Pecquet against M. Marriotte, and in M. Perrault's works we have several letters that passed between these two gentlemen upon this subject.\n\nThis dispute was revived by an experiment of M. Mery, recorded in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1704. He plunged a cat in water, and exposing her eye to the strong light of the sun, observed that the pupil was not at all contracted by it; whence he concluded, that the contraction of the iris is not produced by the action of the light. For he contended that the eye receives more light in this situation than in the open air. At the same time he thought he observed that the retina of the cat's eye was transparent, and that he could see the opaque choroides beyond it: from which he concludes, that the choroides is the substance intended to receive the rays of light, and to be the chief instrument of vision. But M. De la Hire, in opposition to this argument of M. Mery, endeavours to show that fewer rays enter the eye under water, and that in those circumstances it is not so liable to be affected by them. Besides, it is obvious, that the cat must be in great terror in this situation; and being an animal that has a very great voluntary power over the muscles of the iris, and being now extremely attentive to everything about her, she might keep her eye open notwithstanding the action of the light upon it, and though it might be very painful to her. We are informed, that when a cat is placed in a window through which the sun is shining, and consequently her iris nearly closed, if she hear a rustling, like that which is made by a mouse, on the outside of the window, she will immediately open her eyes to their greatest extent, without in the least turning her face from the light.\n\nM. Le Cat took the side of M. Marriotte in this controversy, it being peculiarly agreeable to his general hypothesis, viz. that the pia mater, of which the choroides is a production, and not the nerves themselves, is the proper instrument of sensation. He thought that the change which takes place in the eyes of old people (the choroides growing less black with age) favoured his hypothesis, as they do not see with the same distinctness as young persons. M. Le Cat supposed that the retina answers a purpose similar to that of the scarf-fkin, covering the papillae pyramidales, which are the immediate organs of feeling, or that of the porous membrane which covers the glandulous papillae of the tongue. The retina, he says, receives the impression of light, moderates it, and prepares it for its proper organ, but is not itself sensible of it.\n\nIt must be observed, that M. Le Cat had discovered that the pia mater, after closely embracing the optic nerve, at its entrance into the eye, divides into two branches, one of which closely lines the cornea, and at length is lost in it, while the second branch forms what is\nTheory.\n\nOf Vision. is called the choroides, or uvea. He also showed that the sclerotic coat is an expansion of the dura mater; and he sent diffusions of the eye to the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1739, to prove these affections, and several others contrary to the opinions of the celebrated Windlow, which he had advanced in his Trait\u00e9 de Sent.\n\nTo these arguments in favour of the choroides, we may add the following given by Mr Michell.\n\nIn order that vision be distinct, the pencils of rays which issue from the several points of any object, must be collected either accurately, or at least very nearly, to corresponding points in the eye, which can only be done upon some uniform surface. But the retina being of a considerable thickness, and the whole of it being uniformly nervous, and at least nearly, if not perfectly, transparent, presents no particular surface; so that, in whatever part of it the pencils be supposed to have their foci, the rays belonging to them will be separated from one another, either before or after they arrive there, and consequently vision would be confused.\n\nIf we suppose the seat of vision to be at the interior surface of the retina, and the images of objects to be formed by direct rays, a considerable degree of confusion could not but arise from the light reflected by the choroides, in those animals in which it is white, or coloured. On the other hand, it would be impossible that vision should be performed at this place by light reflected from the choroides, because in many animals it is perfectly black; and yet such animals see even more distinctly than others.\n\nIf the seat of vision be at the farther surface of the retina, and if vision be performed by direct rays, a white choroid coat could be of no use; and if it were by reflected rays, a black one could not answer the purpose.\n\nIt is likewise an argument in favour of the choroides being the organ of vision, that it is a substance which receives a more distinct impression from the rays of light than any other membrane in any part of the animal system, excepting, perhaps, that white cuticle which lies under the scales of fishes; whereas the retina is a substance on which the light makes an exceedingly faint impression, and perhaps no impression at all; since light, in passing out of one transparent medium into another immediately contiguous to it, suffers no refraction or reflection, nor are any of the rays absorbed, unless there is some difference in the refracting power of the two media, which probably is not the case between the retina and the vitreous humour which is in contact with it. And wherever the light is not affected by the medium on which it falls, we can hardly suppose the medium to receive any impression from the light, the action being probably always mutual and reciprocal.\n\nBesides, the retina is so situated, as to be exposed to many rays besides those which terminate in it, and which, therefore, cannot be subservient to vision, if it be performed there. Now this is not the case with the choroides, which is in no shape transparent, and has no reflecting substance beyond it.\n\nIt is, besides, peculiarly favourable to the opinion of Mariotte, that we can then see a sufficient reason for the diversity of its colour in different animals, according as they are circumstanced with respect to vision. In all terrestrial animals, which use their eyes by night, the choroides is either of a bright white, or of some very vivid colour, which reflects the light very strongly. On this account vision may be performed with less light, but it cannot be with great distinctness, the reflection of the rays doubling their effect, since it must extend over some space, all reflection being made at a distance from the reflecting body. Besides, the choroides in brutes is not in general perfectly white, but inclined to blue; and is therefore, probably, better adapted to see by the fainter coloured light, which chiefly prevails in the night; and we would add, is on the same account more liable to be strongly impressed by the colours to which they are chiefly exposed.\n\nOn the other hand, the choroides of birds in general, especially eagles, hawks, and other birds of prey, is black; by which means they are able to see with the greatest distinctness, but only in bright daylight. The owl, however, seeking her food by night, has the choroides white, like that of a cat. In the eyes of man, which are adapted to various uses, the choroides is neither so black as that of birds, nor so white as that of those animals who make the greatest use of their eyes in the night.\n\nAs to a third hypothesis, which is in effect that of M. De la Hire, and which makes both the retina and the choroides equally necessary to vision, and supposes it to be performed by the impression of light on the choroides communicated to the retina; Mr Michell observes, that the perceptions can hardly be supposed to be so acute, when the nerves do not receive the impressions immediately, but only after they have been communicated to another substance. Besides, it must be more natural to suppose, that, when the principal impression is made upon the choroides, it is communicated to the brain by its own nerves, which are sufficient for the purpose.\n\nThe dimensions and precise form of the spot in the eye in which there is no vision, were more accurately calculated by Daniel Bernouilli, in the following manner. He placed a piece of money, O, upon the floor; there is no need of raising it higher, and then shutting one of his eyes, and making a pendulum-vision, so that the extremity of it might be nearly in the line AO, he observed at what place C it began to be invisible, and where it again emerged into view at A. Raising the pendulum higher and lower, he found other points, as H, N, P, G, B, at which it began to be invisible; and others, as M, L, E, A, at which it began to be visible again; and drawing a curve through them, he found that it was elliptical; and, with respect to his own eye, the dimensions of it were as follow; OC was 23, AC 10, BD 3, DH 13, and EG 14; so that the centre being at F, the greater axis was to the less as 8 to 7.\n\nFrom these data the plane on which the figure was drawn being obliquely situated with respect to the eye, he found, that the place in the eye that corresponded to it was a circle, the diameter of which was a seventh part of the diameter of the eye, the centre of it being 27 parts of the diameter from the point opposite to the pupil, a little above the middle. In order, therefore, that this space in which there is no vision may be as small as possible, it is necessary that the nerve should enter the eye perpendicularly, and that both this end, and also its entering the eye at a distance from its axis, are gained by the particular manner in which the two optic nerves...\nOf Vision, nerves unite and become separate again, by crossing one another.\n\nIn support of one of the observations of Mr Michell, Dr Priestley observes, that Aquapendente mentions the case of a person at Pisa, who could see very well in the night, but very little or none at all in the daytime. This is also said to be the case with those white people among the blacks of Africa, and the inhabitants of the isthmus of America, who, from this circumstance, are called moon-eyed. Dr Priestley thinks it probable that their choroides is not of a dark colour, as it is in others of the human species; but white or light-coloured, as in those animals which have most occasion for their eyes in the night.\n\nDr Porterfield observes, that the reason why there is no vision at the entrance of the optic nerve into the eye, may be its want of that softness and delicacy which it has when it is expanded upon the choroides; and that, in those animals in which that nerve is inserted in the axis of the eye, it is observed to be equally delicate, and therefore probably equally sensible, in that place as in any other part of the retina. In general, the nerves, when embraced by their coats, have but little sensibility in comparison of what they are endowed with when they are divested of them, and unfolded in a soft and pulpy substance.\n\nHaller observes, that the choroides cannot be universally the seat of vision, because, sometimes in men and birds, but especially in fishes, it is covered internally with a black mucus, through which the rays cannot penetrate. This writer speaks of a fibrous membrane in the retina distinct from its pulpy substance. On these fibres, he conjectures, that the images of objects are painted.\n\nM. De la Hire's argument in favour of the retina, from the analogy of the senses, is much strengthened by considering that the retina is a large nervous apparatus, immediately exposed to the impression of light; whereas the choroides receives but a slender supply of nerves, in common with the sclerotic, the conjunctiva, and the eyelids, and that its nerves are much less exposed to the light than the naked fibres of the optic nerve.\n\nThat the optic nerve is of principal use in vision, is farther probable, from several phenomena attending some of the diseases of the eye. When an amaurosis has affected one eye only, the optic nerve of that eye has been found manifestly altered from its sound state. Dr Priestley was present when Mr Hey examined the brain of a young girl, who had been blind of one eye, and saw that the optic nerve belonging to it was considerably smaller than the other; and he informed him, that upon cutting into it it was much harder, and cineritious. Morgagni mentions two cases, in one of which he found the optic nerves smaller than usual, and of a cineritious colour, when, upon inquiry, he was informed that the person had not been blind, though there might have been some defect in the sight of one of the eyes. In the other case, only one of the optic nerves was affected in that manner, and the eye itself was in other respects very perfect. Here, also, he was expressly told, that the person was not blind of that eye.\n\nBesides, as the optic nerve is solely spent in forming the retina, so no function of the eye not immediately subservient to vision, is affected by an amaurosis. On the contrary, those nerves which go to the choroides of vision, are found to retain, in this disease, their natural influence. The iris will contract in a recent gutta serena of one eye, if the other remains sound, and is suddenly exposed to a strong light. The sclerotic, conjunctiva, and eyelids, which receive their nerves from the same branches as the choroides, retain their sensibility in this disorder.\n\nThe manner in which persons recover from an amaurosis, favours the supposition of the seat of vision being in the retina: since those parts which are the most distant from the insertion of the nerve recover their sensibility the soonest, being in those places the most pulpy and soft; whereas there is no reason to think that there is any difference in this respect in the different parts of the choroides. Mr Hey has been repeatedly informed, by persons labouring under an imperfect amaurosis, or gutta serena, that they could not, when looking at any object with one eye, see it so distinctly when it was placed in the axis of the eye, as when it was situated out of the axis. And those persons whom he had known to recover from a perfect amaurosis, first discovered the objects whose images fell upon that part of the retina which is at the greatest distance from the optic nerve.\n\nWe shall conclude these remarks with observing, that if the retina be as transparent as it is generally represented to be, so that the termination of the pencils must necessarily be either upon the choroides, or some other opaque substance interposed between it and the retina, the action and reaction occasioned by the rays of light being at the common surface of this body and the retina, both these mediums (supposing them to be equally sensitive to light) may be equally affected; but the retina, being naturally much more sensitive to this kind of impression, may be the only instrument by which the sensation is conveyed to the brain, though the choroides, or the black substance with which it is sometimes lined, may also be absolutely necessary to vision. This is not far from the hypothesis of M. de la Hire, and will completely account for the entire defect of vision at the insertion of the optic nerve.\n\nVision is distinguished into bright and obscure, distinct and indistinct.\u2014It is said to be bright, when a sufficient number of rays enter the pupil at the same time; obscure, when too few. It is distinct when each pencil of indistinct rays is collected into a focus exactly upon the retina; indistinct, when they meet before they come at it, or when they would pass before they meet; for, in either of these last cases, the rays flowing from different parts of the object will fall upon the same part of the retina, which must necessarily render the image indistinct.\u2014Now, that objects may appear with a due brightness, whether more or fewer rays proceed from them, we have a power of contracting or dilating the pupil, by means of the muscular fibres of the iris, in order to take in a greater or smaller number of rays. But this power has its limits. In some animals it is much greater than in others; particularly in such as are obliged to seek their food by night as well as by day, as in cats, &c.\n\nIn order that the rays be collected into points exactly upon the retina, that is, in order that objects may appear distinct, whether they be nearer or farther off, i.e., whether the rays proceeding from them diverge more or less,\nTheory.\n\nThe nature of this change has been a subject of great dispute among philosophers. While some have maintained, that the eye accommodates itself to different distances, by the muscular power of the ciliary ligament, which makes the crystalline lens approach to, or recede from, the retina; others are of opinion, that the form of the crystalline is altered by the ciliary ligament, or by the muscular power of the laminae of which it is composed. M. de la Hire supposes, that the eye is adapted to various distances by the contraction and dilatation of the pupil; and Dr Monro imagines, that its effect is produced by the pressure of the orbicular muscles upon the upper and under parts of the cornea, or by the action of the recti muscles, which elongate the axis of the eye, by pressing chiefly upon the sides of the eyeballs.\u2014This subject has lately been accurately examined by Mr Randden, and Mr Everard Home, who found, that the adjustment of the eye is effected by three changes in the organ: 1. By an increase of curvature in the cornea, occasioned by the action of the recti muscles, which produces \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the effect. 2. By an elongation of the eyeball; and, 3. By a motion of the crystalline lens.\n\nIn those eyes where the cornea is very protuberant, and the rays of light suffer a considerable refraction at their entrance into the aqueous humour, and are therefore collected into a focus before they fall upon the retina, unless the object be placed very near, so that the rays which enter the eye may have a considerable degree of divergency. People that have such eyes are said to be purblind. Now, since the nearer an object is to the eye, the greater is its image, these people can see much smaller objects than others, as they see much nearer ones with the same distinctness; and their sight continues good longer than that of other people, because the cornea, as they grow old, becomes less protuberant, from the want of that redundancy of humours with which they were filled before. On the contrary, old men having the corneas of their eyes too flat, for want of a sufficient quantity of the aqueous humour, if the rays diverge too much before they enter the eye, they cannot be brought to a focus when they reach the retina: on which account these people cannot see distinctly, unless the object be situated at a greater distance from the eye than is required for those whose eyes are of a due form. The latter require the assistance of convex glasses to make them see objects distinctly; the former of concave ones. For if either the cornea \\( a b c \\) (fig. 4), or crystalline humour \\( e \\), or both of them, be too flat, as in the eye \\( A \\), their focus will not be on the retina as at \\( A \\), where it ought to be, in order to render vision distinct; but beyond the eye, as at \\( f \\). This is remedied by placing a convex glass \\( g h \\) before the eye, which makes the rays converge sooner, and forms the image exactly on the retina as at \\( d \\). Again, If either the cornea, or crystalline humour, or both of them, be too convex, as in the eye \\( B \\), the rays that enter it from the object \\( C \\) will be converged to a focus in the vitreous humour, as at \\( f \\); and by diverging from thence to the retina, will form a very confused image upon it; so that the observer will have as confused a view of the object as if his eye had been too flat. This inconvenience is remedied by placing a concave glass \\( g h \\) before the eye; which glass, by causing the rays to diverge between it and the eye, lengthens the focal distance, and makes the rays unite at the retina, and form a distinct image of the object.\n\nSuch eyes as are of a proper convexity, cannot see any object distinctly at less distance than six inches; and angle of there are numberless objects too small to be seen at that distance, because they cannot appear under any sensible angle.\u2014Concerning the least angle under which any object is visible, there was a debate between Dr Hooke and Hevelius. The former asserted that no object could well be seen if it subtended an angle less than one minute; and, if the object be round, as a black circular spot upon a white ground, or a white circle upon a black ground, it follows, from an experiment made by Dr Smith, that this is near the truth; and from this he calculates, that the diameter of the picture of such least visible point upon the retina is the 800th part of an inch; which he therefore calls a sensible point of the retina. On the other hand, Mr Courtivron found, by experiment, that the final least angle of vision was 40 seconds. According to Dr Jurin, there are cases in which a much smaller angle than one minute can be distinguished by the eye; and he observes, that in order to our perceiving any impression upon our senses, it must either be of a certain degree of force, or of a certain degree of magnitude. For this reason, a star, which appears only as a lucid point through a telescope subtending not so much as an angle of one second, is visible to the eye; though a white or black spot of 25 or seconds, is not lines can perceptible. Also a line of the same breadth with the feet under circular spot will be visible at such a distance as the spot is not to be perceived at; because the quantity of impressions, and pretension from the line is much greater than that from why the spot; and a longer line is visible at a greater distance than a shorter one of the same breadth. He found by experience, that a silver wire could be seen when it subtended an angle of three seconds and a half; and that a silk thread could be seen when it subtended an angle of two seconds and a half.\n\nThis greater visibility of a line than of a spot seems to arise only from the greater quantity of the impression; but without the limits of perfect vision, Dr Jurin observes, that another cause concurs, whereby the difference of visibility between the spot and the line is rendered much more considerable. For the impression upon the retina made by the line is then not only much greater, but also much stronger, than that of the spot; because the faint image, or penumbra, of any one point of the line, when the hole is placed beyond the limits of distinct vision, will fall within the faint image of the next point, and thereby much increase the light that comes from it.\n\nIn some cases Dr Jurin found the cause of indistinct vision to be the unsteadiness of the eye; as our being able to see a single black line upon a white ground, or a single white line upon a black ground, and not a white line between two black ones on a white ground. In viewing either of the former objects, if the eye be imperceptibly moved, all the effect will be, that the object will be painted upon a different part of the retina; but wherever it is painted, there will be but one picture, single and uncompounded with any other. But in viewing the other, if the eye fluctuate ever so little, the image of one or other of the black lines will be so shifted to that part of the retina which was before possessed by\nby the white line; and this must occasion such a dazzling in the eye, that the white line cannot be distinctly perceived, and distinguished from the black lines; which, by a continual fluctuation, will alternately occupy the space of the white line, whence must arise an appearance of one broad dark line, without any manifest separation.\n\nBy trying this experiment with two pins of known diameters, set in a window against the sky light, with a space between them equal in breadth to one of the pins, he found that the distance between the pins could hardly be distinguished when it subtended an angle of less than 40 seconds, though one of the pins alone could be distinguished when it subtended a much less angle. But though a space between two pins cannot be distinguished by the eye when it subtends an angle less than 40 seconds, it does not follow that the eye must necessarily commit an error of 40 seconds in estimating the distance between two pins when they are much farther from one another. For if the space between them subtends an angle of one minute, and each of the pins subtends an angle of four seconds, which is greater than the least angle the eye can distinguish, it is manifest that the eye may judge of the place of each pin within two seconds at the most; and consequently the error committed in taking the angle between them cannot at the most exceed four seconds, provided the instrument be sufficiently exact. And yet, says he, upon the like mistake was founded the principal objection of Dr Hooke against the accuracy of the celestial observations of Hevelius.\n\nA black spot upon a white ground, or a white spot upon a black ground, he says, can hardly be perceived by the generality of eyes when it subtends a less angle than one minute. And if two black spots be made upon white paper, with a space between them equal in breadth to one of their diameters, that space is not to be distinguished, even within the limits of perfect vision, under so small an angle as a single spot of the same size. To see the two spots distinctly, therefore, the breadth of the space between them must subtend an angle of more than a minute. It would be difficult, he says, to make this experiment accurately, within the limits of perfect vision; because the objects must be extremely small: but by a rude trial, made with square bits of white paper, placed upon a black ground, he judged, that the least angle under which the interval of two objects could be perceived, was at least a fourth part greater than the least angle under which a single object can be perceived. So that an eye which cannot perceive a single object under a smaller angle than one minute, will not perceive the interval between two such objects under a less angle than 75 seconds.\n\nWithout the limits of perfect vision, the distance at which a single object ceases to be perceptible will be much greater in proportion than the distance at which a space of equal breadth between two such objects ceases to be perceptible. For, without these limits, the image of each of the objects will be attended with a penumbra, and the penumbra of the two near objects will take up part of the space between them, and thus render it less perceptible; but the penumbra will add to the breadth of the single object, and will thereby make it more perceptible, unless its image be very faint. Upon the same principles he likewise accounts for the radiation of the stars, whereby the light seems to project from them different ways at the same time.\n\nMr Mayer made many experiments in order to ascertain the smallest angle of vision in a variety of respects. He began with observing at what distance a black spot was visible on white paper; and found, that when it could barely be distinguished, it subtended an angle of about 34 seconds. When black lines were disposed with intervals broader than themselves, they were distinguished at a greater distance than they could be when the objects and the intervals were equal in breadth. In all these cases it made no difference whether the objects were placed in the shade or in the light of the sun; but when the degrees of light were small, their differences had a considerable effect, though by no means in proportion to the differences of the light. For if an object was illuminated to such a degree as to be just visible at the distance of nine feet, it would be visible at the distance of four feet, though the light was diminished above 160 times. It appeared in the course of these experiments, that common daylight is, at a medium, equal to that of 25 candles placed at the distance of one foot from the object.\n\nAs an image of every visible object is painted on the retina of each of our eyes, it thence becomes a natural question, Why do we not see everything double? It was the opinion of Sir Isaac Newton and others, that objects appear single, because the two optic nerves unite before they reach the brain. But Dr Porterfield shows, from the observation of several anatomists, that the optic nerves do not mix, or confound their substance, being only united by a close cohesion; and objects have appeared single where the optic nerves were found to be disjointed.\n\nDr Briggs supposed that single vision was owing to the equal tension of the corresponding parts of the optic nerves, whereby they vibrated in a synchronous manner. But, besides several improbable circumstances in this account, Dr Porterfield shows that facts do by no means favour it.\n\nTo account for this phenomenon, this ingenious writer supposes, that by an original law in our natures, we imagine objects to be situated somewhere in a right line drawn from the picture of it upon the retina, through the centre of the pupil. Consequently, the same object appearing to both eyes to be in the same place, the mind cannot distinguish it into two. In answer to an objection to this hypothesis, from objects appearing double when one eye is distorted, he says the mind mistakes the position of the eye, imagining that it had moved in a manner corresponding to the other, in which case the conclusion would have been just.\n\nThis principle, however, has been thought sufficient to account for this appearance. Originally, every object, making two pictures, is imagined to be double; but by degrees, we find, that when two corresponding parts of the retina are impressed, the object is but one; but if those corresponding parts be changed, by the distortion of one of the eyes, the object must again appear double as at the first. This has been thought verified by Mr Chefelden; who informs us, that a gentleman, who from a blow on his head had one eye distorted, found every object to appear double; but by degrees\nTheory.\n\nOf Vision\n\nthe most familiar ones came to appear single again, and in time all objects did so, without any amendment of the distortion.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr Reid is of opinion, that the correspondence of the centres of the two eyes, on which single vision depends, does not arise from custom, but from some natural constitution of the eye and of the mind. He makes several just objections to the case of Mr Foster, recited by Dr Smith and others; and thinks that the case of the young man crouched by Chefelden, who saw singly with both eyes immediately upon receiving his sight, is nearly decisive in proof of his supposition. He also found that three young gentlemen, whom he endeavoured to cure of squinting, saw objects singly, as soon as they were brought to direct the centres of both their eyes to the same object, though they had never been used to do so from their infancy; and he observes, that there are cases, in which, notwithstanding the fullest conviction of an object being single, no practice of looking at it will ever make it appear so, as when it is seen through a multiplying glass.\n\nTo all these solutions of the difficulty respecting single vision by both eyes, objections have been lately made which seem infirmountable. By judicious experiments, Dr Wells has shown, that it is neither by custom alone, nor by the original property of the eyes alone, that objects appear single; and having demolished the theories of others, he thus endeavours to account for the phenomenon.\n\n\"The visible place of an object being composed of its visible distance and visible direction, to show how it may appear the same to both eyes, it will be necessary (says he *) to explain in what manner the distance and direction, which are perceived by one eye, may coincide with those which are perceived by the other.\" With respect to visible distance, the author's opinion seems not to differ from that which we have stated elsewhere (see Metaphysics, No 49, 50); and therefore we have to attend only to what he says of visible direction.\n\nWhen a small object is so placed with respect to either eye, as to be seen more distinctly than in any other situation, our author says that it is then in the optic axis, or the axis of that eye. When the two optic axes are directed to a small object not very distant, they may be conceived to form two sides of a triangle, of which the base is the interval between the points of the corners where the axes enter the eyes. This base he called the visual base; and a line drawn from the middle of it to the point of intersection of the optic axis he calls the common axis. He then proceeds to show, that objects really situated in the optic axis do not appear to be in that line, but in the common axis.\n\nEvery person (he observes) knows, that if an object be viewed through two small holes, one applied to each eye, the two holes appear but as one. The theories hitherto invented afford two explanations of this fact. According to Aguilonius, Dechales, Dr Porterfield, and Dr Smith, the two holes, or rather their borders, will be seen in the same place as the object viewed through them, and will consequently appear united, for the same reason that the object itself is seen single. But whoever makes the experiment will distinctly perceive, that the united hole is much nearer to him than the object; not to mention, that any fallacy on this head might be corrected by the information from the sense of touch, that the card or other substance in which the holes have been made is within an inch or less of our face. The other explanation is that furnished by the theory of Dr Reid. According to it, the centres of the retinas, which in this experiment receive the pictures of the holes, will, by an original property, represent but one. This theory, however, though it makes the two holes to appear one, does not determine where this one is to be seen. It cannot be seen in only one of the perpendiculars to the images upon the retinas, for no reason can be given why this law, of visible direction, which Dr Reid thinks established beyond dispute, if it operates at all, should not operate upon both eyes at the same time; and if it be seen by both eyes in such lines, it must appear where those lines cross each other, that is, in the same place with the object viewed through the holes, which, as I have already mentioned, is contrary to experience. Nor is it seen in any direction, the consequence of a law affecting both eyes considered as one organ, but suspended when each eye is used separately. For when the two holes appear one, if we pay attention to its situation, and then close one eye, the truly single hole will be seen by the eye remaining open in exactly the same direction as the apparently single hole was by both eyes.\n\n\"Hitherto I have supposed the holes almost touching the face. But they have the same unity of appearance, in whatever parts of the optic axes they are placed; whether both be at the same distance from the eyes, or one be close to the eye in the axis of which it is, and the other almost contiguous to the object seen through them. If a line, therefore, be drawn from the object to one of the eyes, it will represent all the real or tangible positions of the hole, which allow the object to be seen by that eye, and the whole of it will coincide with the optic axis. Let a similar line be drawn to the other eye, and the two must appear but as one line; for if they do not, the two holes in the optic axes will not, at every distance, appear one, whereas experiments prove that they do. This united line will therefore represent the visible direction of every object situated in either of the optic axes. But the end of it, which is toward the face, is seen by the right eye to the left, and by the left eye as much to the right. It must be seen then in the middle between the two, and consequently in the common axis. And as its other extremity coincides with the point where the optic axes intersect each other, the whole of it must lie in the common axis. Hence the truth of the proposition is evident, that objects situated in the common axis, do not appear to be in that line, but in the common axis.\n\nHe then proves by experiments, that objects situated in the common axis do not appear to be in that line, but in the axis of the eye by which they are not seen; that is, an object situated in the common axis appears to the right eye in the axis of the left, and vice versa. His next proposition, proved likewise by experiments, is, that \"objects situated in any line drawn through the mutual intersection of the optic axes to the visual base, do not appear to be in that line, but in another, drawn through the same intersection, to a point in the visual base distant half this base from the similar extremity of the former line towards the left, if the objects be...\"\nseen by the right eye, but towards the right if seen by the left eye.\"\n\nFrom these propositions he thus accounts for single vision by both eyes. \"If the question be concerning an object at the concourse of the optic axes, it is seen single, because its two similar appearances, in regard to size, shape, and colour, are seen by both eyes in one and the same direction, or if you will, in two directions, which coincide with each other through the whole of their extent. It therefore matters not whether the distance be truly or falsely estimated; whether the object be thought to touch our eyes, or to be infinitely remote. And hence we have a reason, which no other theory of visible direction affords, why objects appeared single to the young gentleman mentioned by Mr Cheelden, immediately after his being couched, and before he could have learned to judge of distance by sight.\n\n\"When two similar objects are placed in the optic axes, one in each, at equal distances from the eyes, they will appear in the same place, and therefore one, for the same reason that a truly single object, in the concourse of the optic axes, is seen single.\n\n\"To finish this part of my subject, it seems only necessary to determine, whether the dependence of visible direction upon the actions of the muscles of the eyes be established by nature, or by custom. But facts are here wanting. As far as they go, however, they serve to prove that it arises from an original principle of our constitution. For Mr Cheelden's patient saw objects single, and consequently in the same directions with both eyes, immediately after he was couched; and persons affected with squinting from their earliest infancy see objects in the same directions with the eye they have never been accustomed to employ, as they do with the other they have constantly used.\"\n\nWe are indebted to Dr Jurin for the following curious experiments, to determine whether an object seen by both eyes appears brighter than when seen with one only.\n\nHe laid a slip of clean white paper directly before him on a table, and applying the side of a book close to his right temple, so that the book was advanced considerably farther forward than his face, he held it in such a manner, as to hide from his right eye that half of the paper which lay to his left hand, while the left half of the paper was seen by both eyes, without any impediment.\n\nThen looking at the paper with both eyes, he observed it to be divided, from the top to the bottom, by a dark line, and the part which was seen with one eye only was manifestly darker than that which was seen with both eyes; and, applying the book to his left temple, he found, by the result of the experiment, that both his eyes were of equal goodness.\n\nHe then endeavoured to determine the excess of this brightness; and comparing it with the appearance of an object illuminated partly by one candle and partly by two, he was surprized to find that an object seen with two eyes is by no means twice as luminous as when it is seen with one; and, after a number of trials, he found, that when one paper was illuminated by a candle placed at the distance of three feet, and another paper by the same candle at the same distance, and by another candle at the distance of 11 feet, the former seen by both eyes, and the latter with one eye only, appeared to be of equal whiteness; so that an object seen with both eyes appears brighter than when it is seen with one only by about a 13th part.\n\nHe then proceeded to inquire, whether an object seen with both eyes appears larger than when seen with one; but he concluded that it did not, except on account of some particular circumstances, as in the case of the binocular telescope and the concave spectulum.\n\nM. du Tour maintains, that the mind attends to no more than the image made in one eye at a time; and produces several curious experiments in favour of this hypothesis, which had also been maintained by Kepler and almost all the first opticians. But, as Mr Buffon observes, it is a sufficient answer to this hypothesis, however ingeniously it may be supported, that we see more distinctly with two eyes than with one; and that when a round object is near us, we see more of the surface in one case than in the other.\n\nWith respect to single vision with two eyes, Dr Hartley observes, that it deserves particular attention, that the optic nerves of men, and such other animals as look the same way with both eyes, unite in the cella turcica in a ganglion, or little brain, as one may call it, peculiar to themselves; and that the affections between synchronous impressions on the two retinas must be made sooner and cemented stronger on this account; also that they ought to have a much greater power over one another's images, than in any other part of the body. And thus an impression made on the right eye alone, by a single object, may propagate itself into the left, and there raise up an image almost equal in vividness to itself; and consequently when we see with one eye only, we may, however, have pictures in both eyes.\n\nA curious deception in vision, arising from the use of both eyes, was observed and accounted for by Dr Smith. It is a common observation, he says, that objects seen with both eyes appear more vivid and stronger than they do to a single eye; especially when both of them are equally good. A person not short-sighted may soon be convinced of this fact, by looking attentively at objects that are pretty remote, first with one eye, and then with both. This observation gave occasion to the construction of the binocular telescope, in the use of which the phenomenon is still more striking.\n\nBesides this, Dr Smith observes, that there is another phenomenon observable with this instrument, which is very remarkable. In the foci of the two teleopes there are two equal rings, as usual, which terminate the pictures of the objects there formed, and consequently the visible area of the objects themselves. These equal rings, by reason of the equal eye-glasses, appear equal and equidistant when seen separately by each eye; but when they are seen with both eyes, they appear much larger, and more distant also; and the objects seen through them also appear much larger, though circumscribed by their united rings, in the same places as when they were seen separately.\n\nHe observes that the phenomenon of the enlarged circle of the visible area in the binocular telescope, may be seen very plainly in looking at distant objects through a pair of spectacles, removed from the eyes about four or five inches, and held steady at that distance. The two innermost of the four apparent rings, which hold the glasses, will then appear united in one larger and more\nTheory.\n\nOf Vision.\n\nA curious circumstance relating to the effect of one eye upon the other, was noticed by M. \u00c6pinus, who observed, that, when he was looking through a hole made in a plate of metal, about the 10th part of a line in diameter, with his left eye, both the hole itself appeared larger, and also the field of view seen through it was more extended, whenever he shut his right eye; and both these effects were more remarkable when that eye was covered with his hand. He found considerable difficulty in measuring this augmentation of the apparent diameter of the hole, and of the field of view; but at length he found, that, when the hole was half an inch, and the tablet which he viewed through it was three feet from his eye, if the diameter of the field when both his eyes were open was 1, it became 1\u00bd when the other eye was shut, and nearly 2 when his hand was laid upon it.\n\nUpon examining this phenomenon, it presently appeared to depend upon the enlargement of the pupil of one eye when the other is closed, the physical cause of which he did not pretend to affirm; but he observes, that it is wisely appointed by Providence, in order that when one eye fails, the field of view in the other may be extended. That this effect should be more sensible when the eye is covered with the hand, is owing, he observes, to the eyelids not being impervious to the light. But the augmentation of the pupil does not enlarge the field of view, except in looking through a hole, as in this particular case; and therefore persons who are blind of one eye can derive no advantage from this circumstance.\n\nA great deal has been written by Gassendi, Le Clerc, Muffchenbroek, and Du Tour, concerning the place to which we refer an object viewed by one or both eyes. But the most satisfactory account of this matter that we have met with, will be found in Dr Wells\u2019s Essay above quoted.\n\nSect. VI. Of the Appearance of Objects seen through Media of different Forms.\n\nFor the more easy apprehension of what relates to this subject, we shall premise the five following particulars, which either have been already mentioned, or follow from what has been before laid down.\n\n1. That as each point of an object, when viewed by the naked eye, appears in its proper place, and as that place is always to be found in the line in which the axis of a pencil of rays flowing from it enters the eye, or else in the line which Dr Wells calls the common axis; we hence acquire a habit of considering the point to be situated in that line; and, because the mind is unacquainted with what refractions the rays suffer before they enter the eye, therefore, in cases where they are diverted from their natural course, by passing through any medium, it judges the point to be in that line produced back in which the axis of a pencil of rays flowing from it is situated, the instant they enter the eye, and not in that it was in before refraction. We shall, therefore, in what follows, suppose the apparent place of an object, when seen through a refracting medium, to be somewhere in that line produced back in which the axis of a pencil of rays flowing from it proceeds after they have passed through the medium.\n\n2. That we are able to judge, though imperfectly, of the distance of an object by the degree of divergency, wherein the rays flowing from the same point of the object enter the pupil of the eye, in cases where that divergency is considerable; but because in what follows it will be necessary to suppose an object, when seen through a medium whereby its apparent distance is altered, to appear in some determinate situation, in those cases where the divergency of the rays at their entrance into the eye is considerable, we will suppose the object to appear where those lines which they describe in entering, if produced back, would cross each other: though it must not be inferred, that this is the precise distance; because the brightness, distinctness, and apparent magnitude of the object, on which its apparent distance in some measure depends, will also suffer an alteration by the refraction of the rays in passing through that medium.\n\n3. That we estimate the magnitude of an object by that of the optic angle.\n\n4. That vision is the brighter, the greater the number of rays is which enter the pupil.\n\n5. And that, in some cases, the apparent brightness, distinctness, and magnitude of an object, are the only means by which our judgement is determined in estimating the distance of it.\n\nProp. I.\n\nAn object placed within a medium terminated by a plane surface on that side which is next the eye, if the medium be denser than that in which the eye is (as we shall suppose it to be, unless where the contrary is expressed), appears nearer to the surface of the medium than it is.\n\nThus, if A (fig. 5.) be a point of an object placed within the medium BCDE, and A b A c be two rays proceeding from thence, these rays passing out of a denser into a rarer medium, will be refracted from their respective perpendiculars b d, c e, and will enter the eye at H, suppose in the directions b f, c g; let then these lines be produced back till they meet in F; this will be the apparent place of the point A; and because the refracted rays b f, c g will diverge more than the incident ones A b, A c, it will be nearer to the points b and c than the point A; and as the same is true of each point in the object, the whole will appear to an eye at H, nearer to the surface BC than it is.\n\nHence it is, that when one end of a straight stick is put under water, and the stick is held in an oblique position, it appears bent at the surface of the water; viz. because each point that is under water appears nearer the surface, and consequently higher than it is.\n\nFrom this likewise it happens, that an object at the bottom of a vessel may be seen when the vessel is filled with water, though it be so placed with respect to the eye, that it cannot be seen when the vessel is empty. To explain this, let ABCD (fig. 6.) represent a vessel, and Fig. 6. let E be an object lying at the bottom of it. This object, when the vessel is empty, will not be seen by an eye\n\nAn object seen through a medium terminated by plane and parallel surfaces, appears nearer, brighter, and larger, than with the naked eye.\n\nFor instance, let AB (fig. 7.) be the object, CDEF the medium, and GH the pupil of an eye, which is here drawn large to prevent confusion in the figure.\u2014And, please nearer 1. Let RK, RL be two rays proceeding from the point R, and entering the denser medium at K and L; these rays will here by refraction be made to diverge lets, and to proceed afterwards, suppose in the lines Ka, La, b; at a and b, where they pass out of the denser medium, they will be as much refracted the contrary way, proceeding in the lines ac, bd, parallel to their first directions. Produce these lines back till they meet in e; this will be the apparent place of the point R; and it is evident from the figure, that it must be nearer the eye than that point; and because the same is true of all other pencils flowing from the object AB, the whole will be seen in the situation fg, nearer to the eye than the line AB.\n\n2. As the rays RK, RL would not have entered the eye, but have passed by it in the directions Kr, Lt, had they not been refracted in passing through the medium, the object appears brighter. 3. The rays Ah, Bi, will be refracted at h and i into the less converging lines hk, il, and at the other surface into kM, lM, parallel to Ah and Bi produced; so that the extremities of the object will appear in the lines Mk, Ml produced, viz. in f and g, and under as large an angle fMg, as the angle AqB under which an eye at q would have seen it had there been no medium interposed to refract the rays; and therefore it appears larger to the eye at GH, being seen through the interposed medium, than otherwise it would have done. But it is here to be observed, that the nearer the point e appears to the eye on account of the refraction of the rays RK, RL, the shorter is the image fg, because it is terminated by the lines Mf and Mg, upon which account the object is made to appear less; and therefore the apparent magnitude of an object is not much augmented by being seen through a medium of this form.\n\nFarther, it is apparent from the figure, that the effect of a medium of this form depends wholly upon its thickness; for the distance between the lines Kr and ee, and consequently the distance between the points e and R, depends upon the length of the line KA.\u2014Again, the distance between the lines AM and fM depends on the length of the line hk; but both Ku and kh depend on the distance between the surfaces CE and DF, and therefore the effect of this medium depends upon its thickness.\n\nPROP. III.\n\nAn object seen through a convex lens, appears larger, brighter, and more distant, than with the naked eye.\n\nTo illustrate this, let AB (fig. 8.) be the object, CD seen thro' the lens, and EF the eye. 1. From A and B, the extremes of the object, draw the lines AY r, BX r, crossing lens, appearing larger, and more distant than they would be if the object were seen with the naked eye. But by diffusing the interposition of a lens of this form, whose property Fig. 8. it is to render converging rays more so, the rays AY and BX will be made to cross each other before they reach the pupil. There the eye at E will not perceive the extremities of the object by means of these rays (for they will pass it without entering), but by some others which must fall without the points Y and X, or between them; but if they fall between them, they will be made to concur sooner than they themselves would have done: and therefore, if the extremities of the object could not be seen by them, it will much less be seen by these. It remains therefore, that the rays which will enter the eye from the points A and B after refraction, must fall upon the lens without the points Y and X;\nTheory.\n\nX; let then the rays AO and BP be such. The after refraction entering the eye at r, the extremities of the object will be seen in the lines r Q r T, produced, and under the optic angle Q r T, which is larger than \u0394 r B, and therefore the apparent magnitude of the object will be increased.\u20142. Let GHI be a pencil of rays flowing from the point G; as it is the property of this lens to render diverging rays less divergent, parallel, or converging, it is evident that some of those rays, which would proceed on to F and E, and miss the eye were they to suffer no refraction in passing through the lens, will now enter it; by which means the object will appear brighter. 3. The apparent distance of the object will vary according to the situation of it with respect to the focus of parallel rays of the lens. 1. Then, let us suppose the object placed so much nearer the lens than its focus of parallel rays, that the refracted rays KE and LF, though rendered less diverging by passing through it, may yet have a considerable degree of divergency, so that we may be able to form a judgment of the distance of the object thereby. In this case, the object ought to appear where EK, FL, produced back concur; which, because they diverge less than the rays GH, GI, will be beyond G, that is, at a greater distance from the lens than the object is. But because both the brightness and magnitude of the object will at the same time be augmented, prejudice will not permit us to reckon it quite so far off as the point where those lines meet, but somewhere between that point and its proper place. 2. Let the object be placed in the focus of parallel rays, then will the rays KE and LF become parallel; and though in this case the object would appear at an immense distance, if that distance were to be judged of by the direction of the rays KE and LF, yet on account of its brightness and magnitude, we shall not think it much farther from us than if it were seen by the naked eye. 3. If the object be situated beyond the focus of parallel rays, as in BA, the rays flowing from it, and falling upon the lens CD, will be collected into their respective foci at a and b, and the intermediate points m, n, &c. and will there form an image of the object AB; and after crossing each other in the several points of it, as expressed in the figure, will pass on diverging as from a real object. Now if an eye be situated at e, where A c, B c, rays proceeding from the extreme points of the object, make not a much larger angle A c B, than they would do if no lens were interposed, and the rays belonging to the same pencil do not converge so much as those which the eye would receive if it were placed nearer to a or b, the object upon these accounts appearing very little larger or brighter than with the naked eye, is seen nearly in its proper place: but if the eye recede a little way towards a b, the object then appearing both brighter and larger, seems to approach the lens: which is an evident proof of what has been so often asserted, viz. that we judge of the distance of an object in some measure by its brightness and magnitude; for the rays converge the more the farther the eye recedes from the lens; and therefore if we judged of the distance of the object by the direction of the rays which flow from it, we ought in this case to conceive it at a greater distance, than when the rays were parallel, or diverged at their entrance into the eye.\n\nThat the object should seem to approach the lens in this case, was a difficulty that puzzled Dr Barrow, and which he pronounces insuperable, and not to be accounted for by any theory we have of vision. Mo. lincus also leaves it to the solution of others, as that which will be inexplicable, till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty, as he expresses it, he obtained by mortals.\n\nThey imagined, that since an object appears farther off, the less the rays diverge which fall upon the eye, if they should proceed parallel to each other, it ought to appear exceeding remote; and if they should converge, it should then appear more distant still: the reason of this was, because they looked upon the apparent place of an object, as owing only to the direction of the rays whatever it was, and not at all to its apparent magnitude or splendour.\n\nPerhaps it may proceed from our judging of the distance of an object in some measure by its magnitude, that the deception of sight commonly observed by travellers may arise; viz. that upon the first appearance of a building larger than usual, as a cathedral church, or the like, it generally seems nearer to them, than they afterwards find it to be.\n\nPROP. IV.\n\nIf an object be placed farther from a convex lens than its focus of parallel rays, and the eye be situated farther from it on the other side than the place where the rays of the several pencils are collected into their proper foci, the object appears inverted, and pendulous in the air, between the eye and the lens.\n\nTo explain this, let AB represent the object, CD the lens; and let the rays of the pencil ACD be collected in a, and those of BCD in b, forming there an inverted image of the object AB, and let the eye be placed in F: it is apparent from the figure, that some of the refracted rays which pass through each point of the image, appear inverted and therefore the object AB will appear there, as in the air.\n\nIf the eye be situated in a or b, or very near them on either side, the object appears exceedingly indistinct, viz. if at d, the rays which proceed from the same point of the object converge too much, and if at e, they diverge so much, that they cannot be collected together upon the retina, but fall upon it as if they were the axes of so many distinct pencils coming through every point of the lens; wherefore little more than one single point of the object is seen at a time, and that appears all over the lens; whence nothing but indistinctness arises.\n\nIf the lens be so large that both eyes may be applied to it, as in h and k, the object will appear double; for it is evident from the figure, that the rays which enter the eye at h from either extremity of the object A or B, do not proceed as from the same point with that\nthat from whence those which enter the other at \\( k \\) seem to flow; the mind therefore is here deceived, and looks upon the object as situated in two different places, and therefore judges it to be double.\n\n**Prop. V.**\n\nAn object seen through a concave lens appears nearer, smaller, and less bright, than with the naked eye.\n\nThus, let \\( AB \\) (fig. 10.) be the object, \\( CD \\) the pupil of an eye, and \\( EF \\) the lens. Now, as it is the property of a lens of this form to render diverging rays more so, and converging ones less so, the diverging rays \\( GH, GI \\), proceeding from the point \\( G \\), will be made to diverge more, and so to enter the eye as from some nearer point \\( g \\); and the rays \\( AH, BI \\), which converge, will be made to converge less, and to enter the eye as from the points \\( a \\) and \\( b \\); therefore the objects will appear in the situation \\( a g h \\), less and nearer than without the lens.\n\nFurther, as the rays which proceed from \\( G \\) are rendered more diverging, some of them will pass by the pupil of the eye, which otherwise would have entered it, and therefore each point of the object will appear less bright.\n\n**Prop. VI.**\n\nAn object seen through a polygonal glass, that is, one which is terminated by several plain surfaces, is multiplied thereby.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be an object, and \\( BC \\) a polygonous glass terminated by the plane surfaces \\( BD, DE, \\) &c. and let the situation of the eye \\( F \\) be such, that the rays \\( AB \\) being refracted in passing through the glass, may enter it in the direction \\( BF \\), and the rays \\( AC \\) in the direction \\( CF \\). Then will the eye, by means of the former, see the object in \\( G \\), and by the latter in \\( H \\); and by means of the rays \\( AI \\), the object will also appear in its proper situation \\( A \\).\n\n**Sect. VII. On the Reflection of Light.**\n\nWhen a ray of light falls upon any body, however transparent, the whole of it never passes through the body, but some part is always reflected from it; and it is by this reflected light that all bodies which have no light of their own become visible to us. Of that part of the ray which enters, another part is also reflected from the second surface, or that which is farthest from the luminous body. When this part arrives again at the first surface, part of it is reflected back from that surface; and thus it continues to be reflected between the two surfaces, and to pass backwards and forwards within the substance of the medium, till some part is totally extinguished and lost.\n\nBesides this inconsiderable quantity, however, which is lost in this manner, the second surface often reflects much more than the first; so that, in certain positions, scarcely any rays will pass through both sides of the medium. A very considerable quantity is also unaccountably lost at each reflecting surface; so that no body, however transparent, can transmit all the rays which fall upon it; neither, though it be ever so well fitted for reflection, will it reflect them all.\n\n---\n\n**On the Cause of Reflection.**\n\nThe reflection of light is not so easily accounted for as refraction. This last property may be accounted for in a satisfactory manner, by the supposition of an attractive power diffused throughout the medium, and extending a very little way beyond it; but with regard to the reflection of light, there seems to be no satisfactory hypothesis hitherto invented. Of the principal opinions on this subject Mr Rowning has given us the following account.\n\nI. It was the opinion of philosophers, before Sir Isaac Newton discovered the contrary, that light is reflected not reflected by impinging upon the solid parts of bodies. But that by impinging on this is not the case is evident from the following reasons:\n\nFirstly, It is not reflected at the first surface of a body, parts of by impinging against it. For in order that the light bodies at may be regularly reflected, there should be no aperture, the first furtries or unevennesses in the reflecting surface large enough face, to bear a sensible proportion to the magnitude of a ray of light; because if the surface abound with these, the incident rays would be irregularly scattered rather than reflected with that regularity with which light is observed to be from a well polished surface. Now those surfaces, which to our senses appear perfectly smooth and well polished, are far from being so; for to polish, is only to grind off the larger protuberances of the metal with the rough and sharp particles of emery, which must of necessity leave behind them an infinity of asperities and scratches, which, though inconsiderable with regard to the former roughnesses, and too minute to be discerned by us, must nevertheless bear a large proportion to, if not vastly exceed, the magnitude of the particles of light.\n\nSecondly, It is not reflected at the second surface by nor at the impinging against any solid particles. That it is not second reflected by impinging upon the solid particles which constitute this second surface, is sufficiently obvious from the foregoing argument; the second surfaces of bodies being as incapable of a perfect polish as the first; and it is farther confirmed from this, viz. that the quantity of light reflected differs according to the different density of the medium behind the body. It is likewise not reflected by impinging upon the particles which constitute the surface of the medium behind it, because the strongest reflection at the second surface of a body, is when there is a vacuum behind it.\n\nII. It has been the opinion of some, that light is reflected at the first surface of a body, by a repulsive force of a repulsive force; equally diffused over it; and at the second, by an attractive force.\n\n1. If there be a repulsive force diffused over the surface of bodies that repels the rays of light, then, since by increasing the obliquity of a ray we diminish its perpendicular force (which is that only whereby it must make its way through this repulsive force), however weakly that force may be supposed to act, rays of light may be made to fall with so great a degree of obliquity on the reflecting surface, that there shall be a total reflection of them there, and not one particle of light be able to make its way through: which is contrary to observation; the reflection of light at the first surface of a transparent body being never total in any obliquity whatever.\n\n2. As to the reflection at the second surface by the force sup-attractiveposed;\nTheory.\n\nCause of attractive force of the body; this may be considered in two respects: first, when the reflection is total; secondly, when it is partial.\n\nFirst, in cases where the reflection is total, the cause of it is undoubtedly that same attractive force by which light would be refracted in passing out of the same body. This is manifest from that analogy which is observable between the reflection of light at the second surface, and its refraction there. For, otherwise, what can be the reason that the total reflection should begin just when the obliquity of the incident ray, at its arrival at the second surface, is such, that the refracted angle ought to be a right one; or when the ray, were it not to return in reflection, ought to pass parallel to the surface, without going from it? For in this case it is evident, that it ought to be returned by this very power, and in such a manner that the angle of reflection shall be equal to the angle of incidence; just as a stone thrown obliquely from the earth, after it is so far turned out of its course by the attraction of the earth, as to begin to move horizontally, or parallel to the surface of the earth, is then by the same power made to return in a curve similar to that which is described in its departure from the earth, and so falls with the same degree of obliquity that it was thrown with.\n\nBut, secondly, As to the reflection at the second surface, when it is partial; an attractive force uniformly spread over it, as the abettors of this hypothesis conceive it to be, can never be the cause thereof. Because it is inconceivable, that the same force, acting in the same circumstances in every respect, can sometimes reflect the violet-coloured rays, and transmit the red, and at other times reflect the red and transmit the violet.\n\nThis objection, however, is not well founded; for in each colour, the reflection takes place at that angle, and no other, where the refraction of that ray would make it parallel to the posterior surface.\n\nThis partial reflection and refraction is a great difficulty in all the attempts which have been made to give a mechanical explanation of the phenomena of optics. It is equally a desideratum in that explanation which was proposed by Huygens, by means of the undulations of an elastic fluid, although a vague consideration of undulatory motions seems to offer a very specious analogy. But a rigid application of the knowledge we have acquired of these motions, will convince us that the phenomena of undulation are essentially dissimilar to the phenomena of light. The inflection and refraction of light, demonstrate that light is acted on by moving forces in a direction perpendicular to the surface; and it is equally demonstrable that such forces must, in proper circumstances, produce reflections precisely such as we observe. The only difficulty is to show how there can be forces which produce both reflection and refraction, in circumstances which are similar. The fact is, that such effects are produced: the first logical inference is, that with respect to the light which is reflected and that which is refracted, the circumstances are not similar; and our attention should be directed to the discovery of that dissimilarity. All the phenomena of combined reflection and refraction should be examined and classified according to their generality, not doubting but that these points of resemblance will lead to the discovery of their causes.\n\nNow the experiments of M. Bouguer show that bodies differ in their powers of thus separating light by reflection and refraction. It is not therefore a general property of light to be partly reflected and partly refracted, but a distinctive property of different bodies; and since we see that they possess it in different degrees, we are authorized to conclude that some bodies may want it altogether. We may therefore expect some success, by considering how bodies are affected by light, as well as how light is affected by bodies. Now, in all the phenomena of the material world we find bodies connected by mutual forces. We know no case where a body A tends towards a body B, or, in common language, is attracted by it, without, at the same time, the body B tending towards A. This is observed in the phenomena of magnetism, electricity, gravitation, corporeal attraction, impulse, &c. We should therefore conclude from analogy, that as bodies change the motion of light, light also changes the motion of bodies; and that the particles near the surface are put into vibration by the passage of light through among them. Suppose a parcel of cork balls all hanging as pendulums in a symmetrical order, and that an electrified oblong ball passes through the midst of them; it is very easy to show that it may proceed through this assemblage in various directions with a sinuous motion, and without touching any of them, and that its ultimate direction will have a certain inclination to its primary direction, depending on the outline of the assemblage, just as is observed in the motion of light; and, in the mean time, the cork balls will be variously agitated. Just so must it happen to the particles of a transparent body, if we suppose that they act on the particles of light by mutual attractions and repulsions.\n\nAn attentive consideration of what happens here will show us that the superficial particles will be much more agitated than the rest; and thus a stratum be produced, which, in any instant, will act on those particles of light which are then approaching them in a manner different from that in which they will act on similarly situated particles of light, which come into the place of the first in the following moment, when these acting particles of the body have (by their motion of vibration) changed their own situation. Now it is clearly understood, that, in all motions of vibration, such as the motions of pendulums, there is a moment when the body is in its natural situation, as when the pendulum is in the vertical line. This may happen in the same instant in each atom of the transparent body. The particles of light which then come within the sphere of action may be wholly reflected; in the next moment, particles of light in the very situation of the first may be refracted.\n\nThen will arise a separation of light; and as this will depend on the manner in which the particles of bodies are agitated by it during its passage, and as this again will depend on the nature of the body, that is, on the law of action of those forces which connect the particles with each other, and with the particles of light, it will be different in different bodies. But in all bodies there will be this general resemblance, that the separation will be most copious in great obliquities of incidence, which gives the repulsive forces more time for action, while it diminishes the perpendicular force of the light. Such a resemblance between the phenomena and the\nCause of the legitimate consequences of the assumption (the agitation of the parts of the body), gives us some authority for afflicting this as the cause; nor can the assumption be called gratuitous. To suppose that the particles of the transparent body are not thus agitated, would be a most gratuitous contradiction of a law of nature to which we know no other exception.\n\nThus the objection stated in No. 164 is obviated, because the reflection and refraction are not here conceived as simultaneous, but as successive.\n\nIII. Some have supposed, that, by the action of light upon the surface of bodies, their parts are put into an undulatory motion; and that where the surface of it is subsiding light is transmitted, and in those places where it is rising light is reflected.\n\nBut to overlook the objections which we have just made to this theory of undulation, we have only to observe, that, were it admitted, it does not seem to advance us a step farther; for in those cases, suppose where red is reflected and violet transmitted, how comes it to pass that the red impinges only on those parts when the waves are rising, and the violet when they are subsiding?\n\nIV. The next hypothesis is that remarkable one of Sir Isaac Newton's fits of easy reflection and transmission, which we shall now explain and examine.\n\nThat author, as far as we can apprehend his meaning in this particular, is of opinion, that light in its passage from the luminous body, is disposed to be alternately reflected by, and transmitted through, any refracting surface it may meet with; that these dispositions, which he calls fits of easy reflection and easy transmission, return successively at equal intervals; and that they are communicated to it at its first emission out of the luminous body, from which it proceeds probably by some very subtle and elastic substance diffused through the universe, and that in the following manner. As bodies falling into water, or passing through the air, produce undulations in each, so the rays of light may excite vibrations in this elastic substance. The quickness of these vibrations depending on the elasticity of the medium (as the quickness of the vibrations in the air, which propagate sound, depend solely on the elasticity of the air, and not upon the quickness of those in the founding body), the motion of the particles of it may be quicker than that of the rays, and therefore, when a ray at the instant it impinges upon any surface, is in that part of a vibration of this elastic substance which confines with its motion, it may be easily transmitted; and when it is in that part of a vibration which is contrary to its motion, it may be reflected. He further supposes, that when light falls upon the surface of a body, if it be not in a fit of easy transmission, every ray is there put into one, so that when they come at the other side (for this elastic substance, pervading the pores of bodies, is capable of the same vibrations within the body as without it), the rays of one colour shall be in a fit of easy transmission, and those of another in a fit of easy reflection, according to the quickness of the body, the intervals of the fits being different in rays of a different kind. This seems to account for the different colours of the bubble and thin plate of air and water; and likewise for the reflection of light at the second surface of a thicker body; for the light thence reflected is also observed to be coloured, and to form rings according to the different quickness of the body, when not intermixed and confounded with other light, as will appear from the following experiment. If a piece of glass be ground concave on one side and convex on the other, both its concavity and convexity having one common centre; and if a ray of light be made to pass through a small hole in a piece of paper held in that common centre, and be permitted to fall on the glass; besides those rays which are regularly reflected back to the hole again, there will be others reflected to the paper, and form coloured rings surrounding the hole, not unlike those occasioned by the reflection of light from thin plates.\n\nIt is ever with extreme reluctance that we venture to call in question the doctrines of Newton; but to this hypothesis of his theory of reflection there is this infallible objection, that it explains nothing, unless the cause of the fits of more easy reflection and transmission be held as legitimate, namely, that they are produced by the undulations of another elastic fluid, incomparably more fugitive than light, acting upon it in the way of impulse. The fits themselves are matters of fact, and no way different from what we have endeavoured to account for; but to admit this theory of them would be to transgress every rule of philosophizing.\n\nOf the Laws of Reflection.\n\nThe fundamental law of the reflection of light, is, that the angle of reflection is always equal to the angle of incidence. This is found by experiment to be the case, and besides may be demonstrated mathematically from the laws of impulse in bodies perfectly elastic. The axiom therefore holds good in every case of reflection, whether it be from plane or spherical surfaces; and hence the seven following propositions relating to the reflection of light from plane and spherical surfaces may be deduced.\n\nI. Rays of light reflected from a plane surface have the same degree of inclination to one another that their respective incident ones have.\u2014For the angle of reflection of each ray being equal to that of its respective incident one, it is evident, that each reflected ray will have the same degree of inclination to that portion of the surface from which it is reflected that its incident one has; but it is here supposed, that all those portions of surface from which the rays are reflected, are situated in the same plane; consequently the reflected rays will have the same degree of inclination to each other that their incident ones have, from whatever part of the surface they are reflected.\n\nII. Parallel rays reflected from a concave surface are rendered converging.\u2014To illustrate this, let AF, CD, EB, (fig. 1.) represent three parallel rays falling upon the concave surface FB, whose centre is C. To the points F and B draw the lines CF, CB; these being drawn from the centre, will be perpendicular to the surface at those points. The incident ray CD also passing through the centre, will be perpendicular to the surface, and therefore will return after reflection in the same line; but the oblique rays AF and EB will be reflected into the lines FM and RM, situated on the contrary side of their respective perpendiculars CF and CB. They will therefore proceed converging after reflection towards some point, as M, in the line CD.\n\nIII. Converging rays falling on a concave surface, are made...\nTheory.\n\nLaws of Reflection.\n\nIV. Diverging rays falling upon a concave surface, are, after reflection, parallel, diverging, or converging. If they diverge from the focus of parallel rays, they then become parallel; if from a point nearer to the surface than that, they will diverge, but in a less degree than before reflection; if from a point between that and the centre, they will converge after reflection, to some point on the contrary side of the centre, but situated farther from it than the radiant point. If the incident rays diverge from a point beyond the centre, the reflected ones will converge to one on the other side of it, but nearer to it than the radiant point; and if they diverge from the centre, they will be reflected thither again.\n\n1. Let them diverge in the lines MF, MB, proceeding from the radiant point M, the focus of parallel rays; then, as the parallel rays AF and EB were reflected into the lines FM and BM (by Prop. ii.), those rays will now on the contrary be reflected into them.\n\n2. Let them diverge from N, a point nearer to the surface than the focus of parallel rays, they will then be reflected into the diverging lines FG and BH, which the incident rays GF and HB described that were shown to be reflected into them in the foregoing proposition; but the degree of their divergency will be less than their divergency before reflection.\n\n3. Let them diverge from X, a point between the focus of parallel rays and the centre; they then make less angles of incidence than the rays MF and MB, which became parallel by reflection: they will consequently have less angles of reflection, and therefore proceed converging towards some point, as Y; which point will always fall on the contrary side of the centre, because a reflected ray always falls on the contrary side of the perpendicular with respect to that on which its incident one falls; and of consequence it will be farther off from the centre than X.\n\n4. If the incident rays diverge from Y, they will, after reflection, converge to X; those which were the incident rays in the former case being the reflected ones in this.\n\n5. If the incident rays proceed from the centre, they fall in with their respective perpendiculars; and for that reason are reflected thither again.\n\nV. Parallel rays reflected from convex surfaces are rendered diverging.\u2014For, let AB, GD, EF, be three parallel rays falling upon the convex surface BF, whose centre is C, and let one of them, viz. GD, be perpendicular to the surface. Through B, D, and F, the points of reflection, draw the lines CV, CG, and CT; which will be perpendicular to the surface at these points. The incident ray GD being perpendicular to the surface, will return after reflection in the same line, but the oblique ones AB and EF will return in the lines BK and FL, situated on the contrary side of their respective perpendiculars BV and FT. They will therefore diverge, after reflection, as from some point M in the line GD produced; and this point will be in the middle between D and C.\n\nVI. Diverging rays reflected from convex surfaces are rendered more diverging.\u2014For, things remaining as above, let GB, GF, be the incident rays. These having greater angles of incidence than the parallel ones AB and EF in the preceding case, their angles of reflection will also be greater; they will therefore diverge after reflection, supposing in the lines BP and FQ, as from some point N, farther from C than the point M; and the degree of their divergency will exceed their divergency before reflection.\n\nVII. Converging rays reflected from convex surfaces are parallel, converging, or diverging.\u2014If they tend towards the focus of parallel rays, they then become parallel; if to a point nearer the surface, they converge, but in a less degree than before reflection; if to a point between that and the centre, they will diverge after reflection, as from some point on the contrary side of the centre, but situated farther from it than the point to which they converged; if the incident rays converge to a point beyond the centre, the reflected ones will diverge as from one on the contrary side of it, but nearer to it than the point to which the incident ones converged; and if the incident rays converge towards the centre, the reflected ones will seem to proceed from it.\n\n1. Let them converge in the lines KB and LF, tending towards M, the focus of parallel rays; then, as the parallel rays AB, EF were reflected into the lines BK and FL (by Prop. v.), those rays will now on the contrary be reflected into them.\n\n2. Let them converge in the lines PB, QF, tending towards N a point nearer the surface than the focus of parallel rays, they will then be reflected into the converging lines BG and FG, in which the rays GB, GF proceeded that were shown to be reflected into them by the last proposition; but the degree of their convergency will exceed their convergency before reflection.\n\n3. Let them converge in the lines RB and SF proceeding towards X, a point between the focus of parallel rays and the centre; their angles of incidence will then be less than those of the rays KB and LF, which became parallel after reflection: their angles of reflection will therefore be less; on which account they must necessarily diverge, supposing in the lines BH and FI, from some point, as Y; which point (by Prop. iv.) will fall on the contrary side of the centre with respect to X, and will be farther from it than that.\n\n4. If the incident rays tend towards Y, the reflected ones will diverge as from X; those which were the incident ones in one case being the reflected ones in the other.\n\n5. If the incident rays converge towards the centre, they coincide with their respective perpendiculars; and will therefore proceed after reflection as from that centre.\n\nWe have already observed, that in some cases there is a very great reflection from the second surface of a transparent body. The degree of inclination necessary to cause a total reflection of a ray at this surface, is that which requires that the refracted angle (supposing the ray to pass out there) should be equal to or greater than\n\nLaws of Reflection.\n\nA right one; and consequently it depends on the refractive power of the medium through which the ray passes, and is therefore different in different media. When a ray passes through glass surrounded with air, and is inclined to its second surface under an angle of 42\u00b0 or more, it will be wholly reflected there. For, as 11 is to 17 (the ratio of refraction out of glass into air), so is the sine of an angle of 42\u00b0 to a fourth number that will exceed the sine of a right angle. Hence it follows, that when a ray of light arrives at the second surface of a transparent substance with as great or a greater degree of obliquity than that which is necessary to make a total reflection, it will there be all returned back to the first: and if it proceeds towards that with as great an obliquity as it did towards the other (which it will do if the surfaces of the medium be parallel to each other), it will there be all reflected again, &c., and will therefore never get out, but pass from side to side, till it be wholly extinguished within the body.\u2014From this may arise an obvious inquiry, how it comes to pass, that light falling very obliquely upon a glass window from without, should be transmitted into the room. In answer to this it must be considered, that however obliquely a ray falls upon the surface of any medium whose sides are parallel as those of the glass in a window, it will suffer such a degree of refraction in entering there, that it shall fall upon the second with a less obliquity than that which is necessary to cause a total reflection. For since the medium be glass; then, as 17 is to 11, so is the sine of the greatest angle of incidence with which a ray can fall upon any surface to the sine of a less angle than that of total reflection. Therefore, if the sides of the glass be parallel, the obliquity with which a ray falls upon the first surface cannot be so great, that it shall pass the second without suffering a total reflection there.\n\nWhen light passes out of a denser into a rarer medium, the nearer the second medium approaches the first in its refractive power, the less of it will be refracted in passing from one to the other; and when their refracting powers are equal, all of it will pass into the second medium.\n\nThe above propositions may be all mathematically demonstrated in the following manner:\n\nProposition I.\n\nOf the reflection of rays from a plane surface.\n\nWhen rays fall upon a plane surface, if they diverge, the focus of the reflected rays will be at the same distance behind the surface, that the radiant point is before it; if they converge, it will be at the same distance before the surface that the imaginary focus of the incident rays is behind it.\n\nThis proposition admits of two cases.\n\nCase 1. Of diverging rays.\n\nLet AB, AC be two diverging rays incident on the plane surface DE, the one perpendicularly, the other obliquely: the perpendicular one AB will be reflected to A, proceeding as from some point in the line AB produced; the oblique one AC will be reflected into some line as CF, so that the point G, where the line FG produced intersects the line AB produced also, shall be at an equal distance from the surface DE with the radiant point A. For the perpendicular CH being drawn, ACH and HCF will be the angles of incidence and reflection; which being equal, their complements ACB and FCE are also equal: but the angle BCG is equal to its vertical angle FCE: therefore in the triangles ABC and GBC the angles at C are equal, the side BC is common, and the right angles at B are equal; therefore AB = BG; and consequently the point G, the focus of the incident rays AB, AC, is at the same distance behind the surface, that the point A is before it.\n\nCase 2. Of converging rays.\n\nThis is the converse of the former case. For supposing FC and AB to be two converging incident rays, CA and BA will be the reflected ones (the angles of incidence in the former case being now the angles of reflection, and vice versa), having the point A for their focus; but this is at an equal distance from the reflecting surface with the point G, which in this case is the imaginary focus of the incident rays FC and AB.\n\nIt is not here, as in the case of rays passing through a plane surface, where some of the refracted rays proceed as from one point, and some as from another; but they all proceed after reflection as from one and the same point, however obliquely they may fall upon the surface; for what is here demonstrated of the ray AC holds equally of any other, as AI, AK, &c.\n\nThe case of parallel rays incident on a plane surface is included in this proposition: for in that case we are to suppose the radiant point infinitely distant from the surface, and then by the proposition the focus of the reflected rays will be so too: that is, the rays will be parallel after reflection, as they were before it.\n\nProposition II.\n\nOf the reflection of parallel rays from a spherical surface.\n\nWhen parallel rays are incident upon a spherical surface, the focus of the reflected rays will be the middle point between the centre of convexity and the surface.\n\nThis proposition admits of two cases.\n\nCase 1. Of parallel rays falling upon a convex surface.\n\nLet AB, DH, represent two parallel rays incident on the convex surface BH, the one perpendicularly, the other obliquely; and let C be the centre of convexity. Suppose HE to be the reflected ray of the oblique one DH, proceeding as from F, a point in the line AB produced. Through the point H draw the line CI, which will be perpendicular to the surface at that point; and the angles DHI and IHE, being the angles of incidence and reflection, will be equal. But HCF = DHI, the lines AC and DH being parallel; and CHF = IHE; wherefore the triangle CFH is isosceles, and consequently CF = FH: but supposing BH to vanish, FH = FB; and therefore upon this supposition FC = FB; that is, the focus of the reflected rays is the middle point between the centre of convexity and the surface.\n\nCase 2. Of parallel rays falling upon a concave surface.\n\nLet AB, DH, be two parallel rays incident, the one perpendicularly, the other obliquely, on the concave surface BH, whose centre of concavity is C. Let BF and HF be the reflected rays meeting each other in F; this will be the middle point between B and C. For drawing through C the perpendicular CH, the angles DHC = FHC, being the angles of incidence and reflection; but HCF = DHC its alternate angle, and therefore the triangle CFH is isosceles. Wherefore CF = FH: but if we suppose BH to vanish, FB = FH, and therefore\nTheory.\n\nLaws of Reflection.\n\nTherefore \\( CF = FB \\); that is, the focal distance of the reflected rays is the middle point between the centre and the surface.\n\nIt is here observable, that the farther the line \\( DH \\), either in fig. 4, or 5, is taken from \\( AB \\), the nearer the point \\( F \\) falls to the surface. For the farther the point \\( H \\) recedes from \\( B \\), the greater the triangle \\( CFH \\) will become; and consequently, since it is always isosceles and the base \\( CH \\), being the radius, is everywhere of the same length, the equal legs \\( CF \\) and \\( FH \\) will lengthen; but \\( CF \\) cannot grow longer unless the point \\( F \\) approach towards the surface. And the farther \\( H \\) is removed from \\( B \\), the farther \\( F \\) approaches to it.\n\nThis is the reason, that whenever parallel rays are considered as reflected from a spherical surface, the distance of the oblique ray from the perpendicular one is taken so small with respect to the focal distance of that surface, that without any physical error it may be supposed to vanish.\n\nHence it follows, that if a number of parallel rays, as \\( AB, CD, EG, \\&c. \\) fall upon a convex surface, and if \\( BA, DK \\), the reflected rays of the incident ones \\( AB, CD \\), proceed as from the point \\( F \\), those of the incident ones \\( CD, EG, viz. DK, GL \\), will proceed as from \\( N \\), those of the incident ones \\( EG, HI \\), as from \\( O, \\&c. \\) because the farther the incident ones \\( CD, EG, \\&c. \\) are from \\( AB \\), the nearer to the surface are the points \\( f, f, f \\), in the line \\( BF \\), from which they proceed after reflection; so that properly the foci of the reflected rays \\( BA, DK, GL, \\&c. \\) are not in the line \\( AB \\) produced, but in a curve line passing through the points \\( F, N, O, \\&c. \\)\n\nThe same is applicable to the case of parallel rays reflected from a concave surface, as expressed by the dotted lines on the other half of the figure, where \\( PQ, RS, TV \\), are the incident rays; \\( QF, SF, VF \\), the reflected ones, intersecting each other in the points \\( X, Y, \\) and \\( F \\); so that the foci of those rays are not in the line \\( FB \\), but in a curve passing through those points.\n\nHad the surface \\( BH \\) in fig. 4, or 5, been formed by the revolution of a parabola about its axis having its focus in the point \\( F \\), all the rays reflected from the convex surface would have proceeded as from the point \\( F \\), and those reflected from the concave surface would have fallen upon it, however distant their incident ones \\( AB, DH \\), might have been from each other. For in the parabola, all lines drawn parallel to the axis make angles with the tangents to the points where they cut the parabola (that is, with the surface of the parabola) equal to those which are made with the same tangents by lines drawn from thence to the focus; therefore, if the incident rays describe those parallel lines, the reflected ones will necessarily describe these other, and so will all proceed as from, or meet in, the same point.\n\nProp. III.\n\nOf the reflection of diverging and converging rays from a spherical surface.\n\nWhen rays fall upon any spherical surface, if they diverge, the distance of the focus of the reflected rays from the surface is to the distance of the radiant point from the same (or, if they converge, to that of the imaginary focus of the incident rays), as the distance of the focus of the reflected rays from the centre is to the distance of the radiant point (or imaginary focus of the incident rays) from the same.\n\nThis proposition admits of ten cases.\n\nCase 1. Of diverging rays falling upon a convex surface.\n\nLet \\( RB, RD \\), represent two diverging rays flowing from the point \\( R \\) as from a radiant, and falling the one perpendicularly, the other obliquely, on the convex surface \\( BD \\), whose centre is \\( C \\). Let \\( DE \\) be the reflected ray of the incident one \\( RD \\); produce \\( ED \\) to \\( F \\), and through \\( R \\) draw the line \\( RH \\) parallel to \\( FE \\) till it meets \\( CD \\) produced in \\( H \\). Then \\( RHD = EDH \\) the angle of reflection, and \\( RHD = RDH \\) the angle of incidence; wherefore the triangle \\( DRH \\) is isosceles, and \\( DR = RH \\).\n\nNow the lines \\( FD \\) and \\( RH \\) being parallel, the triangles \\( FDC \\) and \\( RHC \\) are similar, or the sides are cut proportionally, and therefore \\( FD : RH \\) or \\( RD = CF : CR \\); but \\( BD \\) vanishing, \\( FD \\) and \\( RD \\) differ not from \\( FB \\) and \\( RB \\); wherefore \\( FB : RB = CF : CR \\); that is, the distance of the focus from the surface is to the distance of the radiant point from the same, as the distance of the focus from the centre is to the distance of the radiant point from it.\n\nCase 2. Of converging rays falling upon a concave surface.\n\nLet \\( KD \\) and \\( CB \\) be the converging incident rays, having their imaginary focus in the point \\( R \\), which was the radiant point in the foregoing case. Then as \\( RD \\) was in that case reflected into \\( DE \\), \\( KD \\) will in this be reflected into \\( DF \\); for, since the angles of incidence in both cases are equal, the angles of reflection will be equal also; so that \\( F \\) will be the focus of the reflected rays; but it was there demonstrated, that \\( FB : RB = CF : CR \\); that is, the distance of the focus from the surface is to the distance (in this case) of the imaginary focus of the incident rays, as the distance of the focus from the centre is to the distance of the imaginary focus of the incident rays from the same.\n\nCase 3. Of converging rays falling upon a convex surface, and tending to a point between the focus of parallel rays and the centre.\n\nLet \\( B \\) represent a convex surface whose centre is \\( C \\), Fig. 8, and whose focus of parallel rays is \\( P \\); and let \\( AB, KD \\), be two converging rays incident upon it, and having their imaginary focus at \\( R \\), a point between \\( P \\) and \\( C \\). Now because \\( KD \\) tends to a point between the focus of parallel rays and the centre, the reflected ray \\( DE \\) will diverge from some point on the other side the centre, suppose \\( F \\); as explained above. Through \\( D \\) draw the perpendicular \\( CD \\) and produce it to \\( H \\); then will \\( KDH = HDE \\) being the angles of incidence and reflection, and consequently \\( RDC = CDF \\) too. Therefore the triangle \\( RDF \\) is bisected by the line \\( DC \\); wherefore \\( (3 El. 6.) \\) \\( FD \\) and \\( DR \\), or \\( BD \\) vanishing, \\( FB : BR = FC : CR \\); that is, the distance of the focus of the reflected rays is to that of the imaginary focus of the incident ones, as the distance of the former from the centre is to the distance of the latter from the centre.\n\nCase 4. Of diverging rays falling upon a concave surface, and proceeding from a point between the focus of parallel rays and the centre.\n\nLet \\( RB, RD \\), be the diverging rays incident upon Fig. 9, the concave surface \\( BD \\), having their radiant point in \\( G \\), \\( g \\), \\( 2 \\), \\( R \\),\nR, the imaginary focus of the incident rays in the preceding case. Then as KD was in that case reflected into DE, RD will now be reflected into DF. But we had FB : RB = CF : CR; that is, the distance of the focus is to that of the radiant as the distance of the former from the centre is to the distance of the latter from the centre.\n\nThe angles of incidence and reflection being equal, it is evident, that if, in any case, the reflected ray be made the incident one, the incident will become the reflected one; and therefore the four following cases may be considered respectively as the converse of the four preceding; for in each of them the incident rays are supposed to coincide with the reflected ones in the other. Or they may be thus demonstrated independently of them.\n\n**Case 5. Of converging rays falling upon a convex surface, and tending to a point nearer the surface than the focus of parallel rays.**\n\nLet ED, RB be the converging rays incident upon the convex surface BD whose centre is C, and principal focus P; let the imaginary focus of the incident rays be at F, a point between P and B; and let DR be the reflected ray. From C and R draw the lines CH, RH, the one passing through D, the other parallel to FE. Then RHD = HDE the angle of incidence. But RHD = HDR, the angle of reflection; wherefore the triangle HDR is isosceles, and DR = RH. Now the lines FD and RH being parallel, the triangles FDC and RHC are similar; and therefore RH or RD : FD = CR : CF; but BD vanishing, RD and FD coincide with RB and FE, wherefore RB : FB = CR : CF; that is, the distance of the focus from the surface is to the distance of the imaginary focus of the incident rays, as the distance of the focus from the centre is to the distance of the imaginary focus of the incident rays from the centre.\n\n**Case 6. Of diverging rays falling upon a concave surface, and proceeding from a point between the focus of parallel rays and the surface.**\n\nLet FD and FB be two rays diverging from the point F, which was the imaginary focus of the incident rays in the preceding case. Then as ED was in that case reflected into DR, FD will be reflected into DK (for the reason mentioned in case 2.), so that the reflected ray will proceed as from the point R; but it was demonstrated in case 5., that RB : FB = CR : CF; that is, the distance of the focus from the surface is to that of the radiant from the surface, as the distance of the former from the centre is to that of the latter from the centre.\n\n**Case 7. Of converging rays falling upon a convex surface, and tending towards a point beyond the centre.**\n\nLet AB, ED be the incident rays tending to F, a point beyond the centre C, and let DK be the reflected ray of the incident one ED. Then because the incident ray ED tends to a point beyond the centre, the reflected ray DK will proceed as from one on the contrary side, suppose R; see Prop. vii. Through D draw the perpendicular CD, and produce it to H. Then will EDH = HDK, being the angles of incidence and reflection; but CDF = CDR, being their verticals; consequently the angle FDR is bisected by the line CD; wherefore, RD : DF, or (Elem. 6.) BD vanishing, RB : BF = RC : CF; that is, the distance of the focus of the reflected rays is to that of the imaginary focus of the incident rays, as the distance of the former from the centre is to the distance of the latter from the centre.\n\n**Case 8. Of diverging rays falling upon a concave surface, and proceeding from a point beyond the centre.**\n\nLet FB, FD be the incident rays radiating from F, the imaginary focus of the incident rays in the case. Then as ED was in that case reflected into DK, FD will now be reflected into DR; so that R will be the focus of the reflected rays. But it was demonstrated in the case 7., that RB : FB = RC : CF; that is, the distance of the focus of the reflected rays from the surface is to the distance of the radiant from the surface, as the distance of the focus of the reflected rays from the centre is to the distance of the radiant from the centre.\n\nThe two remaining cases may be considered as the converse of those under Prop. ii. (p. ), because the incident rays in these are the reflected ones in them; or they may be demonstrated in the same manner with the preceding, as follows.\n\n**Case 9. Converging rays falling upon a convex surface, and tending to the focus of parallel rays, become parallel after reflection.**\n\nLet ED, RB represent two converging rays incident on the convex surface BD, and tending towards F, which we shall now suppose to be the focus of parallel rays; and let DR be the reflected ray, and C the centre of convexity of the reflecting surface. Through C draw CD, and produce it to H, drawing RH parallel to ED produced to F. Now it has been demonstrated (case 5., where the incident rays are supposed to tend to the point F), that RB : FB = RC : CF; but F in this case being supposed to be the focus of parallel rays, it is the middle point between C and B (by Prop. ii.) and therefore FB = FC, consequently RB = RC; which can only be upon the supposition that R is at an infinite distance from B; that is, that the reflected rays BR and DR be parallel.\n\n**Case 10. Diverging rays falling upon a concave surface, and proceeding from the focus of parallel rays, become parallel after reflection.**\n\nLet RD, RB be two diverging rays incident upon the concave surface BD, as supposed in case 4., where it was demonstrated that FB : RB = CF : CR. But in the present case RB = CR, because R is supposed to be the focus of parallel rays; therefore FB = FC, which cannot be unless F be taken at an infinite distance from B; that is, unless the reflected rays BF and DF be parallel.\n\nIt may here be observed that in the case of diverging rays falling upon a convex surface, the farther the point D is taken from B, the nearer the point F, the focus of the reflected rays, approaches to B, while the radiant point R remains the same. For it is evident from the Fig. 10. curvature of a circle, that the point D may be taken so far from B, that the reflected ray DE shall proceed as from F, G, H, or even from B, or from any point between B and R; and the farther it is taken from B, the faster the point from which it proceeds approaches towards R; as will appear if we draw several incident rays with their respective reflected ones, in such a manner that the angles of reflection may be equal to their respective angles of incidence, as done in the figure. The like is applicable to any of the other cases of diverging and converging rays incident upon a spherical surface. This is the reason, that, when rays are considered as reflected from a spherical surface,\nTheory.\n\nLaws of surface, the distance of the oblique rays from the perpendicular one is taken so small, that it may be supposed to vanish.\n\nFrom this it follows, that if a number of diverging rays are incident upon the convex surface BD at the several points B, D, D, &c., they will not proceed after reflection as from any point in the line RB produced, but as from a curve line passing through the several points F, f, f, &c.\n\nHad the curve BD been a hyperbola, having its foci in R and F, then R being the radiant (or the imaginary focus of incident rays), F would have been the focus of the reflected ones, and vice versa; however distant the points B and D might be taken from each other. In like manner, had the curve BD been an ellipse having its foci in F and R, the one of these being made the radiant (or imaginary focus of incident rays), the other would have been the focus of reflected ones, and vice versa. For both in the hyperbola and ellipse, lines drawn from each of their foci through any point make equal angles with the tangent to that point. Therefore, if the incident rays proceed to or from one of their foci, the reflected ones will all proceed as from or to the other focus. Therefore, in order that diverging or converging rays may be accurately reflected to or from a point, the reflecting surface must be formed by the revolution of an hyperbola about its longer axis, when the incident rays are such, that their radiant or imaginary focus of incident rays shall fall on one side of the surface, and the focus of the reflected ones on the other; when they are both to fall on the same side, it must be formed by the revolution of an ellipse about its longer axis. However, as spherical surfaces are more easily formed, than those which are generated by the revolution of any of the conic sections about their axes, the latter are very rarely used.\n\nNow, because the focal distance of rays reflected from a spherical surface cannot be found by the analogy laid down in the third proposition, without making use of the quantity sought; we shall here give an example whereby the method of doing it in all others will readily appear.\n\n**Problem.**\n\nLet it be required to find the focal distance of diverging rays incident upon a convex surface, whose radius of convexity is five parts, and the distance of the radiant from the surface is 20.\n\nCall \\( x \\) the focal distance sought; then will the distance of the focus from the centre be \\( 5 - x \\), and that of the radiant from the same \\( 25 \\); therefore by Prop. iii. we have the following proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{20} = \\frac{5-x}{25}\n\\]\n\nand multiplying extremes together and means together, we have\n\n\\[\n25x = 100 - 20x, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{100}{45}.\n\\]\n\nIf it should happen in any case that the value of \\( x \\) is a negative quantity, the focal point must then be taken on the contrary side of the surface to that on which it was supposed it would fall in stating the problem.\n\nBecause it was observed in the preceding section, that different incident rays, though tending to or from one point, would after refraction proceed to or from different points, a method was there given of determining the distinct point which each separate ray entering a spherical surface converges to, or diverges from, after refraction: the same has been observed here with regard to Appearance rays reflected from a spherical surface (see cafe 2, and cafe 10.) But the method of determining the distinct point to or from which any incident ray proceeds after reflection, is much more simple. It is only necessary to draw the reflected ray such, that the angle of reflection may be equal to the angle of incidence, which will determine the point it proceeds to or from in any case whatever.\n\n**Sect. VIII. Of the Appearance of Bodies seen by Light reflected from Plane and Spherical Surfaces.**\n\nWhatever has been said concerning the appearance of bodies seen through lenses, by refracted light, respects also the appearance of bodies seen by reflection. But besides this, there is one thing peculiar to images by reflection, viz. that each point in the representation of an object made by reflection appears situated somewhere in a right line that passes through its correspondent point in the object, and is perpendicular to the reflecting surface.\n\nThe truth of this appears sufficiently from the propositions formerly laid down: in each of which, rays flowing from any radiant point, are shown to proceed after reflection to or from some point in a line that passes through the radiant point, and is perpendicular to the reflecting surface. For instance (fig. 1.), rays flowing from Y are collected in X, a point in the perpendicular CD, which, being produced, passes through Y again (fig. 2.), rays flowing from G, proceed, after reflection, as from N, a point in the perpendicular CD, which, being produced, passes through G.\n\nThis observation, however, except where an object is seen by reflection from a plain surface, relates only to those cases where the representation is made by means of such rays as fall upon the reflecting surface with a very small degree of obliquity; because such as fall at a considerable distance from the perpendicular, do not proceed after reflection as from any point in that perpendicular, but as from other points situated in a certain curve, on which account these rays are neglected, as making an indistinct and deformed representation. And therefore it is to be remembered, that however the situation of the eye with respect to the object and reflecting surface may be represented in the following figures, it is to be supposed as situated in such a manner with respect to the object, that rays flowing from thence and entering it after reflection, may be such only as fall with a very small degree of obliquity upon the surface; that is, the eye must be supposed to be placed almost directly behind the object, or between it and the reflecting surface. The reason why it is not always so placed, is only to avoid confusion in the figures.\n\n1. When an object is seen by reflection from a plane surface, the image of it appears at the same distance behind the surface that the object is before it, of the same magnitude, and directly opposite to it.\n\nTo explain this, let AB represent an object seen by the reflection from the plane surface SV; and let the rays of appearance of AF, AG, be so inclined to the surface, that they shall reflect an eye at H after reflection; and let AE be perpendicular to the surface; then, by the observation just mentioned, the point A will appear in some part of the line AE produced, suppose I; that is, the oblique rays\nAppearance AF and AG will proceed after reflection as from that point; and further, because the reflected rays FH, GK, will have the same degree of inclination to one another that their incident ones have, that point must necessarily be at the same distance from the surface that the point A is; the representation therefore of the point A will be at the same distance from the surface that the point itself is before it, and directly opposite to it: consequently, since the like may be thrown of any other point B, the whole image IM will appear at the same distance behind the surface that the object is before it, and directly opposite to it; and because the lines AI, BM, perpendicular to the plain surface, are parallel to each other, the image will also be of the same magnitude with the object.\n\nII. When an object is seen by reflection from a convex surface, its image appears nearer to the surface, and less than the object.\n\nLet AB represent the object, SV a reflecting surface whose centre of convexity is C: and let the rays AF, AG, be so inclined to the surface, that after reflection from it, they shall enter the eye at H: and let AE be perpendicular to the surface; then will the oblique rays AF, AG, proceed after reflection as from some point in the line AE produced, suppose from I; which point, because the reflected rays will diverge more than the incident ones, must be nearer to the surface than the point A. And since the same is also true of the rays which flow from any other B, the representation IM will be nearer to the surface than the object; and because it is terminated by the perpendiculars AE and BF, which incline to each other, as concurring at the centre, it will also appear less.\n\nIII. When an object is seen by reflection from a concave surface, the representation of it is various, both with regard to its magnitude and situation, according as the distance of the object from the reflecting surface is greater or less.\n\n1. When the object is nearer to the surface than its principal focus, the image falls on the opposite side of the surface, is more distant from it, and larger than the object.\n\nThus let AB be the object, SV the reflecting surface, F its principal focus, and C its centre. Through A and B, the extremities of the object, draw the lines CE, CR, which will be perpendicular to the surface; and let the rays AR, AG, be incident upon such points of it that they shall be reflected into an eye at H. Now, because the radiant points A and B are nearer the surface than the principal focus F, the reflected rays will diverge, and therefore proceed as from some points on the opposite side of the surface; which points, by the observation laid down at the beginning of this section, will be in the perpendiculars AE, BR, produced, suppose in I and M: but they will diverge in a less degree than their incident ones; and therefore the said points will be farther from the surface than the points A and B. The image therefore will be on the opposite side of the surface with respect to the object: it will be more distant than it; and consequently, being terminated by the perpendiculars CI and CM, it will also be larger.\n\n2. When the object is placed in the principal focus, the reflected rays enter the eye parallel; in which case the image ought to appear at an infinite distance behind the reflecting surface; but the representation of it, for the reasons given in the foregoing case, being large and distinct, we do not reckon it much farther from the surface than the image.\n\n3. When the object is placed between the principal focus and the centre, the image falls on the opposite side of the centre, is larger than the object, and in an inverted position.\n\nThus let AB be the object, SV the reflecting surface, CCCLXXXIIT, F its principal focus, and C its centre. Through A Fig. 14. and B, draw the lines CE and CN, which will be perpendicular to the surface; and let AR, AG, be a pencil of rays flowing from A. These rays proceeding from a point beyond the principal focus, will after reflection converge towards some point on the opposite side the centre, which will fall upon the perpendicular EC produced, but at a greater distance from C than the radiant A from which they diverged. For the same reason, rays flowing from B will converge to a point in the perpendicular NC produced, which shall be farther from C than the point B; whence it is evident, that the image IM is larger than the object AB, that it falls on the contrary side of the centre, and that their positions are inverted with respect to each other.\n\n4. If the object be placed beyond the centre of convexity, the image is then formed between the centre and the focus of parallel rays, is less than the object, and its position is inverted.\n\nThis proposition is the converse of the preceding; for as in that case rays proceeding from A were reflected to I, and from B to M; so rays flowing from I and M will be reflected to A and B: if therefore an object be supposed to be situated beyond the centre in IM, the image of it will be formed in AB between that and the focus of parallel rays, will be less than the object, and inverted.\n\n5. If the middle of the object be placed in the centre of convexity of the reflecting surface, the object and its image will be coincident; but the image will be inverted with respect to the object.\n\nThat the place of the image and the object should be the same in this case requires little explication; for the middle of the object being in the centre, rays flowing from it will fall perpendicularly upon the surface, and therefore necessarily return thither again; so that the middle of the image will be coincident with the middle of the object. But that the image should be inverted is perhaps not so clear. To explain this, let AB Fig. 15. be the object, having its middle point C in the centre of the reflecting surface from SV; through the centre and the point R draw the line CR, which will be perpendicular to the reflecting surface; join the points AR and BR, and let AR represent a ray flowing from A; this will be reflected into RB; for C being the middle point between A and B, the angle ARC=CRB; and a ray from B will likewise be reflected to A; and therefore the position of the image will be inverted with respect to that of the object.\n\nIn this proposition it is to be supposed, that the object AB is so situated with respect to the reflecting surface, that the angle ACR may be right; for otherwise the angles ARC and BRC will not be equal, and part of the image only will therefore fall upon the object.\n6. If in any of the three last cases, in each of which the image is formed on the same side of the reflecting surface with the object, the eye be situated farther from the surface than the place where the image falls, the rays of each pencil, crossing each other in the several points of the image, will enter the eye as from a real object situated there; so that the image will appear pendulous in the air between the eye and the reflecting surface, and in the position wherein it is formed, viz. inverted with respect to the object, in the same manner that an image formed by refracted light appears to an eye placed beyond it; which was fully explained under Prop. iv. and therefore needs not be repeated.\n\nBut as what relates to the appearance of the object when the eye is placed nearer to the surface than the image, was not there fully inquired into, that point shall now be more strictly examined under the following case, which equally relates to refracted and reflected light.\n\n7. If the eye be situated between the reflecting surface and the place of the image, the object is then seen beyond the surface; and the farther the eye recedes from the surface towards the place of the image, the more confused, larger, and nearer, the object appears.\n\nTo explain this, let \\( \\Delta B \\) represent the object; \\( IM \\) its image, one of whose points \\( M \\) is formed by the concurrence of the reflected rays \\( DM, EM, \\) &c., which before reflection came from \\( B \\); the other, \\( I, \\) by the concurrence of \\( DI, EI, \\) &c., which came from \\( A \\); and let \\( ab \\) be the pupil of an eye, situated between the surface \\( DP \\) and the image. This pupil will admit the rays \\( Ha, Ka; \\) which, because they are tending towards \\( I, \\) are such as came from \\( A, \\) and therefore the point \\( A \\) will appear diffused over the space \\( RS. \\) In like manner the pupil will also receive into it the reflected rays \\( Ka \\) and \\( Lb, \\) which, because they are tending towards \\( M, \\) by supposition came from \\( B; \\) and therefore the point \\( B \\) will be seen spread as it were over the space \\( TV, \\) and the object will seem to fill the space \\( RV; \\) but the representation of it will be confused, because the intermediate points of the object being equally enlarged in appearance, there will not be room for them between the points \\( S \\) and \\( T, \\) but they will coincide in part one with another: for instance, the appearance of that point in the object, whose representation falls upon \\( c \\) in the image, will fill the space \\( mn; \\) and so of the rest. Now, if the same pupil be removed into the situation \\( ef, \\) the reflected rays \\( Ee \\) and \\( Gf \\) will then enter the eye, and therefore one extremity of the object will appear to cover the space \\( XY; \\) and because the rays \\( Of \\) and \\( Le \\) will also enter it in their progress towards \\( M, \\) the point \\( B, \\) from which they came, will appear to cover \\( ZV; \\) the object therefore will appear larger and more confused than before. When the eye recedes quite to the image, it sees but one single point of the object, and that appears diffused all over the reflecting surface: for instance, if the eye recedes to the point \\( M, \\) then rays flowing from the point \\( B \\) enter it upon whatever part of the surface they fall. The object also appears nearer to the surface the farther the eye recedes from it towards the place of the image; probably because, as the appearance of the object becomes more and more confused, its place is not so easily distinguished from that of the reflecting surface itself, till at last when it is quite confused (as it is when the eye is arrived at \\( M)) \\) they both appear as one, the surface assuming the colour of the object.\n\nAs to the precise apparent magnitude of an object seen after this manner, it is such that the angle it appears under shall be equal to that which the image of the same object would appear under were we to suppose it seen from the same place: that is, the apparent rent magnitude of the object (for such we must call it, to distinguish it from the image of the same object) and the image subtend equal angles at the eye.\n\nHere we must suppose the pupil of the eye to be a point only, because the magnitude of it causes a small alteration in the apparent magnitude of the object. Let \\( a \\) be the point representing the pupil, then will the extreme rays that can enter it be \\( Ha \\) and \\( Ka; \\) the object therefore will appear under the angle \\( HaK = MaI, \\) the angle under which the image \\( IM \\) would appear were it to be seen from \\( a. \\) Again, If the eye be placed in \\( f, \\) the object appears under the angle \\( GfO = IfM, \\) which the image subtends at the same place, and therefore the apparent object and image of it subtend equal angles at the eye.\n\nNow if we suppose the pupil to have any sensible magnitude \\( ab; \\) then the object seen by the eye in that situation will appear under the angle \\( HXL, \\) which is larger than the angle \\( HaK, \\) under which it appeared before; because the angle at \\( X \\) is nearer than the angle at \\( a, \\) to the line \\( IM, \\) which is a subtena common to them both.\n\nFrom this proposition it follows; that, were the eye close to the surface at \\( K, \\) the real and apparent object would be seen under equal angles (for the real object appears from that place under the same angle that the image does, as will be shown at the end of this section); therefore, when the eye is nearer to the image than that point, the image will subtend a larger angle at it than the object does; and consequently, since the image and apparent object subtend equal angles at the eye, the apparent object must necessarily be seen under a larger angle than the object itself, wherever the eye be placed, between the surface and the image.\n\nAs each point in the representation of an object made by reflection is situated somewhere in a right line that passes through its correspondent point in the object, and is perpendicular to the reflecting surface; we may hence deduce the following easy and expeditious method of determining both the magnitude and situation of the image in all cases whatever.\n\nThrough the extremities of the object \\( \\Delta B \\) and the centre \\( C \\) (fig. 17, 18, 19.) draw the lines \\( AC BC, \\) and produce them as the case requires; these lines will be perpendicular to the reflecting surface, and therefore the extremities of the image will fall upon them. Through \\( F \\) the middle point of the object and the centre, draw the line \\( FC, \\) and produce it till it passes through the reflecting surface; this will also be perpendicular to the surface. Through \\( G, \\) the point where this line cuts the surface, draw the lines \\( AG \\) and \\( BG, \\) and produce them this way or that, till they cross the former perpendiculars; and where they cross, there \\( I \\) and \\( M \\) the extremities of the image will fall. For supposing \\( AG \\) to be a ray proceeding from the point \\( A, \\) and\nAppearance and falling upon G, it will be reflected to B; because of Bodies FA = FB, and FG is perpendicular to the reflecting surface; and therefore the representation of the point A from different surfaces will be in LG produced as well as in AC; consequently it will fall on the point I, where they cross each other. Likewise the ray BG will for the same reason be reflected to A; and therefore the representation of the point B will be in AG produced, as well as in some part of BC, that is, in M where they cross. Hence the proposition is obvious.\n\nIf it happens that the lines will not cross which waysoever they are produced, as in fig. 20, then is the object in the focus of parallel rays of that surface, and has no image formed in the place whatever. For in this case the rays AH, AG, flowing from the point A, become parallel after reflection in the lines HC, GB, and therefore do not flow as to or from any point: in like manner, rays flowing from B are reflected into the parallel lines KB and GA; so that no representation can be formed by such reflection.\n\nFrom this we learn another circumstance relating to the magnitude of the image made by reflection; viz., that it subtends the same angle at the vertex of the reflecting surface that the object does. This appears by inspection of the 17th, 18th, or 19th figure, in each of which the angle IGM = AGB, the angles which the image subtends at G the vertex of the reflecting surface, and which the object subtends at the same place; for in the two first of those figures they are vertical, in the third they are the same.\n\nThe angle ICM, which the image subtends at the centre, is also equal to the angle ACB which the object subtends at the same place; for in the two first figures they are the same, in the last they are vertical to each other.\n\nWhence it is evident, that the object and its image are to each other in diameter, either as their respective distances from the vertex of the reflecting surface, or as their distances from the centre of the same.\n\nIV. As objects are multiplied by being seen through transparent media, whose surfaces are properly disposed, so they may also by reflecting surfaces.\n\n1. If two reflecting surfaces be disposed at right angles, as the surfaces AB, BC, an object at D may be seen by an eye at E, after one reflection at F, in the line EF produced; after two reflections, the first at G, the second at H, in the line EH produced; and also, after one reflection made at A, in the line EA produced.\n\n2. If the surfaces be parallel, as AB, CD, (fig. 22.), and the object be placed at E and the eye at F, the object will appear multiplied an infinite number of times: thus it may be seen in the line FG produced, after one reflection at G; in the line FH produced, after two reflections, the first at I, the second at H; and also in FP produced, after several successive reflections of the ray EL, at the points L, M, N, O, and P; and so on in infinitum. But the greater the number of reflections are, the weaker their representation will be.\n\nSect. IX. Of the apparent Place, Distance, Magnitude, and Motion of Objects.\n\nIt had in general been taken for granted, that the place to which the eye refers any visible object seen by reflection or refraction, is that in which the visual rays meet a perpendicular from the object upon the reflecting or refracting plane. But this method of judging of the place of objects was called in question by Dr Barrow, who contended that the arguments brought in favour of the opinion were not conclusive. These arguments are, that the images of Dr Barrow's objects appeared straight in a plane mirror, but curved in water; that a straight thread, when partly immersed perpendicularly in water, does not appear crooked as when it is obliquely plunged into place of objects.\n\nPlate CCCLXXII.\n\nFig. 21.\n\nFig. 22.\n\nAccording to Dr Barrow, we refer every point of an object to the place from which the pencils of light, that give us the image of it, issue, or from which they would have issued if no reflecting or refracting substance intervened. Pursuing this principle, he proceeds to investigate the place in which the rays issuing from each of the points of an object, and which reach the eye after one reflection or refraction, meet; and he found, that if the refracting surface was plane, and the refraction was made from a denser medium into a rarer, those rays would always meet in a place between the eye and a perpendicular to the point of incidence. If a convex mirror be used, the case will be the same; but if the mirror be plane, the rays will meet in the perpendicular, and beyond it if it be concave. He also determined, according to these principles, what form the image of a right line will take, when it is presented in different manners to a spherical mirror, or when it is seen through a refracting medium.\n\nThough Dr Barrow reckoned the maxim which he endeavoured to establish, concerning the supposed place of visible objects, highly probable, he has the candour to mention an objection to it, of which he was not able to give a satisfactory solution. It is this. Let an object be placed beyond the focus of a convex lens; and if the eye be close to the lens, it will appear confused, but very near to its true place. If the eye be a little withdrawn, the confusion will increase, and the object will seem to come nearer; and when the eye is near the focus, the confusion will be exceedingly great, and the object will seem to be close to the eye. But in this experiment the eye receives no rays but those that are converging; and the point from which they issue is far from being nearer than the object, that it is beyond it; notwithstanding which, the object is conceived to be much nearer than it is, though no very distinct idea can be formed of its precise distance. It may be observed, that in reality, the rays falling upon the eye in this case\nTheory.\n\nApparent in a manner quite different from that in which they fall upon it in other circumstances, we can form no judgment about the place from which they issue. This subject was afterwards taken up by Berkeley, Smith, Montucla, and others.\n\nM. de la Hire made several observations concerning the distance of visible objects, and various other phenomena of vision, which are worthy of notice. He also took particular pains to ascertain the manner in which the eye conforms itself to the view of objects placed at different distances. He enumerates five circumstances, which assist us in judging of the distance of objects, namely their apparent magnitude, the strength of the colouring, the direction of the two eyes, the parallax of the objects, and the distinctness of their small parts. Painters, he says, can only take advantage of the two first-mentioned circumstances, and therefore pictures can never perfectly deceive the eye; but in the decorations of theatres, they, in some measure, make use of them all. The size of objects, and the strength of their colouring, are diminished in proportion to the distance at which they are intended to appear. Parts of the same object which are to appear at different distances, as columns in an order of architecture, are drawn upon different planes a little removed from one another, that the two eyes may be obliged to change their direction, in order to distinguish the parts of the nearer plane from those of the more remote. The small distance of the planes serves to make a small parallax, by changing the position of the eye; and as we do not preserve a distinct idea of the quantity of parallax, corresponding to the different distances of objects, it is sufficient that we perceive there is a parallax, to be convinced that these planes are distant from one another, without determining what that distance is; and as to the last circumstance, viz. the distinctness of the small parts of objects, it is of no use in discovering the deception, on account of the false light that is thrown upon these decorations.\n\nTo these observations concerning deception of sight, we shall add a similar one of M. le Cat, who took notice that the reason why we imagine objects to be larger when they are seen through a mist, is the dimness or obscurity with which they are then seen; this circumstance being associated with the idea of great distance. This, he says, is confirmed by our being surprised to find, upon approaching such objects, that they are too much nearer to us, as well as too much smaller, than we had imagined.\n\nAmong other cases concerning vision, which fell under the consideration of M. de la Hire, he mentions one which is difficult to solve. It is when a candle, in a dark place, and situated beyond the limits of distinct vision, is viewed through a very narrow chink in a card; in which case a considerable number of candles, sometimes so many as six, will be seen along the chink. This appearance he attributes to small irregularities in the surface of the humours of the eye, the effect of which is not sensible when rays are admitted into the eye through the whole extent of the pupil, and consequently one principal image effaces a number of small ones; whereas, in this case, each of them is formed separately, and no one of them is so considerable as to prevent the others from being perceived at the same time.\n\nThere are few persons, M. de la Hire remarks, who have both their eyes exactly equal, not only with respect to the limits of distinct vision, but also with regard to the colour with which objects appear tinged when they are viewed by them, especially if one of the eyes has been exposed to the impression of a strong light. To compare them together in this respect, he directs us to take two thin cards, and to make in each of them a round hole of a third or a fourth of a line in diameter, and, applying one of them to each of the eyes, to look through the holes on a white paper, equally illuminated, when a circle of the paper will appear to each of the eyes, and, placing the cards properly, these two circles may be made to touch one another, and thereby the appearance of the same object to each of the eyes may be compared to the greatest advantage. To make this experiment with exactness, it is necessary, he says, that the eyes be kept shut some time before the cards be applied to them.\n\nBy the following calculation, M. de la Hire gives us an idea of the extreme sensibility of the optic nerves. One may see very easily, at the distance of 4000 toises, the tail of a windmill, 6 feet in diameter; and the eye being supposed to be an inch in diameter, the picture of this tail, at the bottom of the eye, will be about an inch, which is less than the 666th part of a line, and is about the 66th part of a common hair, or the 8th part of a single thread of silk. So small, therefore, must one of the fibres of the optic nerve be, which, he says, is almost inconceivable, since each of these fibres is a tube that contains spirits.\n\nThe person who particularly noticed Dr Barrow's Berkeley's hypothesis was the ingenious Dr Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, who distinguished himself so much by the objections which he started to the reality of a material world, and by his opposition to the Newtonian doctrine of fluxions. In his Essay towards a new Theory of Vision, he observes, that the circle formed upon the retina, by the rays which do not come to a focus, produce the same confusion in the eye, whether they cross one another before they reach the retina, or tend to do it afterwards; and therefore that the judgment concerning distance will be the same in both the cases, without any regard to the place from which the rays originally issued; so that in this case, as, by receding from the lens, the confusion, which always accompanies the nearness of an object, increases, the mind will judge that the object comes nearer.\n\nBut, says Dr Smith, if this be true, the object ought always to appear at a less distance from the eye than that at which objects are seen distinctly, which is not the case: and to explain this appearance, as well as every other in which a judgment is formed concerning distance, he maintains, that we judge of it chiefly if not only by the apparent magnitude of objects, so that, since the image grows larger as we recede from the lens through which it is viewed, we conceive the object to come nearer. He also endeavours to show, that in all cases in which glasses are used, we judge of distance by the same rule; from which he concludes, that the apparent distance of an object seen in a glass is to its apparent distance seen by the naked eye, as the apparent magnitude in the naked eye is to its apparent magnitude in the glass.\n\nBut that we do not judge of distance merely by the angle...\nApparent angle under which objects are seen, is an observation as old as Alhazen, who mentions several instances, in which, though the angles under which objects appear be different, the magnitudes are universally and instantaneously deemed not to be so. Mr Robins clearly shows the hypothesis of Dr Smith to be contrary to fact in the most common and simple cases. In microscopes, he says, it is impossible that the eye should judge the object to be nearer than the distance at which it has viewed the object itself, in proportion to the degree of magnifying. For when the microscope magnifies much, this rule would place the image at a distance, of which the sight cannot possibly form any opinion, as being an interval from the eye at which no object can be seen. In general, he says, he believes, that whoever looks at an object through a convex glass, and then at the object itself without the glass, will find it to appear nearer in the latter case, though it be magnified in the glass; and in the same trial with the concave glass, though by the glass the object be diminished, it will appear nearer through the glass than without it.\n\nBut the following experiment is the most convincing proof that the apparent distance of the image is not determined by its apparent magnitude. If a double convex glass be held upright before some luminous object, as a candle, there will be seen two images, one erect, and the other inverted. The first is made simply by reflection from the nearest surface, the second by reflection from the farther surface, the rays undergoing a refraction from the first surface both before and after the reflection. If this glass has not too short a focal distance when it is held near the object, the inverted image will appear larger than the other, and also nearer; but if the glass be carried off from the object, though the eye remain as near to it as before, the inverted image will diminish so much faster than the other, that, at length, it will appear very much less than it, but still nearer. Here, says Mr Robins, two images of the same object are seen under one view, and their apparent distances, when immediately compared, seem to have no necessary connexion with the apparent magnitude. He also shows how this experiment may be made still more convincing, by sticking a piece of paper on the middle of the lens, and viewing it through a short tube.\n\nM. Bouguer adopts the general maxim of Dr Barrow, in supposing that we refer objects to the place from which the pencils of rays seemingly converge at their entrance into the pupil. But when rays issue from below the surface of a vessel of water, or any other refracting medium, he finds that there are always two different places of this seeming convergence; one of them of the rays that issue from it in the same vertical circle, and therefore fall with different degrees of obliquity upon the surface of the refracting medium; and another, of those that fall upon the surface with the same degree of obliquity, entering the eye laterally with respect to one another. Sometimes, he says, one of these images is attended to by the mind, and sometimes the other, and different images may be observed by different persons. An object immersed in water affords an example, he says, of this duplicity of images.\n\nIf BA b be part of the surface of water, and the object be at O, there will be two images of it in two different places; one at G, on the caustic by refraction, and the other at E, in the perpendicular AO, which is as much a caustic as the other line. The former image place, &c., is visible by the rays ODM, Odm, which are one higher than the other, in their progress to the eye; whereas the image at E is made by the rays ODM, Oef, which enter the eye laterally. This, says he, may serve to explain the difficulty of Father Tacquet, Barrow, Smith, and many other authors.\n\nG. W. Kraft has ably supported the opinion of Dr Barrow, that the place of any point, seen by reflection from the surface of any medium, is that in which rays issuing from it, infinitely near to one another, would meet; and considering the case of a distant object, viewed in a concave mirror, by an eye very near to it, when the image, according to Euclid and other writers would be between the eye and the object, and the rule of Dr Barrow cannot be applied; he says that in this case the speculum may be considered as a plane, the effect being the same, only the image is more obscure.\n\nDr Porterfield gives a distinct view of the natural methods of judging concerning the distance of objects.\n\nThe conformation of the eye, he observes, can be of no use to us with respect to objects placed without the limits of distinct vision. As the object, however, does not then appear more or less confused, according as it is more or less removed from those limits, this confusion afflicts the mind in judging of the distance of the object; it being always estimated so much the nearer, or the farther off, as the confusion is greater. But this confusion hath its limits also; for when an object is placed at a certain distance from the eye, to which the breadth of the pupil bears no sensible proportion, the rays of light that come from a point in the object, and pass the pupil, are so little diverging, that they may be considered as parallel. For a picture on the retina will not be sensibly more confused, though the object be removed to a much greater distance.\n\nThe most general, and frequently the most certain means of judging of the distance of objects is, he says, by the angle made by the optic axis. For our two eyes are like two different stations, by the affluence of which distances are taken; and this is the reason why those persons who are blind of one eye, so frequently miss their marks in pouring liquor into a glass, fulfilling a candle, and such other actions as require that the distance be exactly distinguished. To be convinced of the utility of this method of judging of the distance of objects, he directs us to suspend a ring in a thread, so that its side may be towards us, and the hole in it to the right and left hand; and taking a small rod, crooked at the end, retire from the ring two or three paces, and having with one hand covered one of our eyes, to endeavour with the other to pass the crooked end of the rod through the ring. This, says he, appears very easy; and yet, upon trial, perhaps once in 100 times we shall not succeed, especially if we move the rod a little quickly.\n\nThe use of this second method of judging of distances Dechales limited to 120 feet; beyond which, he says, we are not sensible of any difference in the angle of the optic axis.\n\nA third method of judging of the distance of objects, consists in their apparent magnitudes, on which so much stress was laid by Dr Smith. From this change in the magnitude\nTheory.\n\nApparent magnitude of the image upon the retina, we easily judge of the distance of objects, as often as we are otherwise acquainted with their magnitude; but as often as we are ignorant of the real magnitude of bodies, we can never, from their apparent magnitude, form any judgment of their distance.\n\nHence we may see why we are so frequently deceived in our estimates of distance, by any extraordinary magnitudes of objects seen at the end of it; as, in travelling towards a large city, or a castle, or a cathedral church, or a mountain larger than common, we fancy them to be nearer than they really are. This also is the reason why animals, and little objects, seen in valleys, contiguous to large mountains, appear exceedingly small.\n\nFor we think the mountains nearer to us than if it were smaller; and we should not be surprised at the smallness of the neighbouring animals, if we thought them farther off. For the same reason, we think them exceedingly small, when they are placed upon the top of a mountain, or a large building; which appear nearer to us than they really are, on account of their extraordinary size.\n\nDr Jurin accounts for our imagining objects, when seen from a high building, to be smaller than they are, and smaller than we fancy them to be when we view them at the same distance on level ground. It is, says he, because we have no distinct idea of distance in that direction, and therefore judge of things by their pictures upon the eye only; but custom will enable us to judge rightly even in this case.\n\nLet a boy, says he, who has never been upon any high building, go to the top of a lofty spire, and look down into the street; the objects seen there, as men and horses, will appear so small as greatly to surprise him. But 10 or 20 years after, if in the mean time he has used himself now and then to look down from that and other great heights, he will no longer find the same objects to appear so small. And if he were to view the same objects from such heights as frequently as he sees them upon the same level with himself in the streets, he supposes that they would appear to him just of the same magnitude from the top of the spire, as they do from a window one story high. For this reason it is, that statues placed upon very high buildings ought to be made of a larger size than those which are seen at a nearer distance; because all persons, except architects, are apt to imagine the height of such buildings to be much less than it really is.\n\nThe fourth method by which Dr Porterfield says that we judge of the distance of objects, is the force with which their colour strikes upon our eyes. For if we be assured that two objects are of a similar and like colour, and that one appears more bright and lively than the other, we judge that the brighter object is the nearer of the two.\n\nThe fifth method consists in the different appearance of the small parts of objects. When these parts appear distinct, we judge that the object is near; but when they appear confused, or when they do not appear at all, we reckon the object to be at a greater distance. For the image of any object, or part of an object, diminishes as its distance increases.\n\nThe sixth and last method by which we judge of the distance of objects is, that the eye does not represent to our mind one object alone, but at the same time all those that are placed betwixt us and the principal object, whose distance we are considering; and the more this distance is divided into separate and distinct parts, the greater it appears to be. For this reason, distances upon uneven surfaces appear less than upon a plane: for the inequalities of the surfaces, such as hills, and holes, and rivers, that lie low and out of sight, either do not appear, or hinder the parts that lie behind them from appearing; and so the whole apparent distance is diminished by the parts that do not appear in it. This is the reason that the banks of a river appear contiguous to a distant eye, when the river is low and not seen.\n\nDr Porterfield very well explains several fallacies in several fictions which depend upon our mistaking the distances of objects. Of this kind, he says, is the appearance of parallel lines, and long vistas consisting of parallel rows of trees; for they seem to converge more and more as they are farther extended from the eye. The reason of this, he says, is because the apparent magnitudes of their perpendicular intervals are perpetually diminishing, while, at the same time, we mistake their distance. Hence we may see why, when two parallel rows of trees stand upon an ascent, whereby the more remote parts appear farther off than they really are, because the line that measures the length of the vistas now appears under a greater angle than when it was horizontal, the trees, in such a case, will seem to converge less, and sometimes, instead of converging, they will be thought to diverge.\n\nFor the same reason that a long vista appears to converge more and more the farther it is extended from the eye, the remoter parts of a horizontal walk or a long floor will appear to ascend gradually; and objects placed upon it, the more remote they are the higher they will appear, till the last be seen on a level with the eye; whereas the ceiling of a long gallery appears to descend towards a horizontal line, drawn from the eye of the spectator. For this reason, also, the surface of the sea, seen from an eminence, seems to rise higher and higher the farther we look; and the upper parts of high buildings seem to stoop, or incline forwards over the eye below, because they seem to approach towards a vertical line proceeding from the spectator's eye; so that statues on the top of such buildings, in order to appear upright, must recline, or bend backwards.\n\nDr Porterfield also shows the reason why a windmill, seen from a great distance, is sometimes imagined to move the contrary way from what it really does, by our taking the nearer end of the sail for the more remote. The uncertainty we sometimes find in the course of the motion of a branch of lighted candles, turned round at a distance, is owing, he says, to the same cause; as also our sometimes mistaking a convex for a concave surface, more especially in viewing seals and impressions with a convex glass or a double microscope; and lastly, that, upon coming in a dark night into a street, in which there is but one row of lamps, we often mistake the side of the street they are on.\n\nFar more light was thrown upon this curious subject by M. Bouguer.\n\nThe proper method of drawing the appearance of two\nApparent two rows of trees that shall appear parallel to the eye, place, &c., is a problem which has exercised the ingenuity of several philosphers and mathematicians. That the apparent magnitude of objects decreases with the angle under which they are seen, has always been acknowledged. It is also acknowledged, that it is only by custom and experience that we learn to form a judgment both of magnitudes and distances. But in the application of these maxims to the above-mentioned problem, all persons, before M. Bouguer, made use of the real distance instead of the apparent one; by which only the mind can form its judgement. And it is manifest, that, if any circumstances contribute to make the distance appear otherwise than it is in reality, the apparent magnitude of the object will be affected by it; for the same reason, that, if the magnitude be misapprehended, the idea of the distance will vary.\n\nFor want of attending to this distinction, Tacquet pretended to demonstrate, that nothing can give the idea of two parallel lines (rows of trees for instance) to an eye situated at one of their extremities, but two hyperbolic curves, turned the contrary way; and M. Vignon maintained, that in order to make a vista appear of the same width, it must be made narrower, instead of wider, as it recedes from the eye.\n\nM. Bouguer observes, that very great distances, and those that are considerably less than they, make nearly the same impression upon the eye. We, therefore, always imagine great distances to be less than they are; and for this reason the ground plan of a long vista always appears to rise. The visual rays come in a determinate direction; but as we imagine that they terminate sooner than they do, we necessarily conceive that the place from which they issue is elevated. Every large plane, therefore, as AB, viewed by an eye at O, will seem to lie in such a direction as A b; and consequently lines, in order to appear truly parallel on the plane AB, must be drawn so as that they would appear parallel on the plane A d, and be from thence projected to the plane AB.\n\nTo determine the inclination of the apparent ground-plan A d to the true ground-plan AB, our ingenious author directs us to draw upon a piece of level ground two straight lines of a sufficient length (for which purpose lines fastened to small sticks are very convenient), making an angle of 3 or 4 degrees with one another. Then a person, placing himself within the angle, with his back towards the angular point, must walk backwards and forwards till he can fancy the lines to be parallel. In this situation, a line drawn from the point of the angle through the place of his eye, will contain the same angle with the true ground-plan which this does with the apparent one.\n\nM. Bouguer then shows other more geometrical methods of determining this inclination; and says, that by these means he has often found it to be 4 or 5 degrees, though sometimes only 2 or 2\u00bd degrees. The determination of this angle, he observes, is variable; depending upon the manner in which the ground is illuminated and the intensity of the light. The colour of the foil is also not without its influence, as well as the particular conformation of the eye, by which it is more or less affected by the same degree of light, and also the part of the eye on which the object is painted. When, by a flight motion of his head, he contrived, that certain parts of the foil, the image of which fell towards the bottom of his eye, should fall towards the top of the retina, he always thought that this apparent inclination became a little greater.\n\nBut what is very remarkable, is, that if he looks towards a rising ground, the difference between the apparent ground-plan and the true one will be much more considerable, so that they will sometimes make an angle of 25 or 30 degrees. Of this he had made frequent observations. Mountains, he says, begin to be inaccessible when their sides make an angle from 35 or 37 degrees with the horizon, as then it is not possible to climb them but by means of lones or shrubs, to serve as steps to fix the feet on. In these cases, both he and his companions always agreed that the apparent inclination of the side of the mountain was 60 or 70 degrees.\n\nThese deceptions are represented in fig. 3, in which, when the ground-plan AM, or AN, is much inclined, the apparent ground-plan Am, or An, makes a very large angle with it. On the contrary, if the ground dips below the level, the inclination of the apparent to the true ground-plan diminishes, till, at a certain degree of the slope, it becomes nothing at all; the two plans AP and Ap being the same, so that parallel lines drawn upon them would always appear fo. If the inclination below the horizon is carried beyond the situation AP, the error will increase; and what is very remarkable, it will be on the contrary side; the apparent plan Ar being always below the true plan AR, so that if a person would draw upon the plan AR lines that shall appear parallel to the eye, they must be drawn converging, and not diverging, as is usual on the level ground; because they must be the projections of two lines imagined to be parallel, on the plan Ar, which is more inclined to the horizon than AR.\n\nThese remarks, he observes, are applicable to different planes exposed to the eye at the same time. For if BH, fig. 4, be the front of a building, at the distance Fig. 4. of AB from the eye, it will be reduced in appearance to the distance A b; and the front of the building will be b h, rather inclined towards the spectator, unless the distance be inconceivable.\n\nAfter making a great number of observations upon this subject, our author concludes, that when a man stands upon a level plane, it does not seem to rise sensibly but at some distance from him. The apparent plane, therefore, has a curvature in it, at that distance, the form of which is not very easy to determine; so that a man standing upon a level plane, of infinite extent, will imagine that he stands in the centre of a basin. This is also, in some measure, the case with a person standing upon the level of the sea.\n\nHe concludes with observing, that there is no difficulty in drawing lines according to these rules, so as to have any given effect upon the eye, except when some parts of the prospect are very near the spectator, and others very distant from him, because, in this case, regard must be had to the conical or conoidal figure of a surface. A right line passing at a small distance from the observer, and below the level of his eye, in that case almost always appears sensibly curved at a certain distance from the eye; and almost all figures in this case are subject to some complicated optical alteration to which the rules of perspective have not as yet been extended. If a circle be drawn near our feet, and within that...\nTheory.\n\nApparent that part of the ground which appears level to us, it will always appear to be a circle, and at a very considerable distance it will appear an ellipse; but between these two situations, it will not appear to be either the one or the other, but will be like one of those ovals of Descartes, which is more curved on one of its sides than the other.\n\nOn these principles a parterre, which appears distorted when it is seen in a low situation, appears perfectly regular when it is viewed from a balcony or any other eminence. Still, however, the apparent irregularity takes place at a greater distance, while the part that is near the spectator is exempt from it. If $AB$, fig. 5, be the ground-plan, and $Aa$ be a perpendicular under the eye, the higher it is situated, at $O$, to the greater distance will $T'$, the place at which the plane begins to have an apparent ascent along $Tb$, be removed.\n\nAll the varieties that can occur with respect to the visible motion of objects, are thus succinctly summed up by Dr Porterfield under eleven heads:\n\n1. An object moving very swiftly is not seen, unless it be very luminous. Thus a cannon ball is not seen if it is viewed transversely: but if it be viewed according to the line it describes, it may be seen, because its picture continues long on the same place of the retina; which, therefore, receives a more sensible impression from the object.\n\n2. A live coal swung briskly round in a circle appears a continued circle of fire, because the impressions made on the retina by light, being of a vibrating, and consequently of a lasting nature, do not presently perish, but continue till the coal performs its whole circuit, and returns again to its former place.\n\n3. If two objects, unequally distant from the eye, move with equal velocity, the more remote one will appear the slower; or, if their velocities be proportional to their distances, they will appear equally swift.\n\n4. If two objects, unequally distant from the eye, move with unequal velocities in the same direction, their apparent velocities are in a ratio compounded of the direct ratio of their true velocities, and the reciprocal one of their distances from the eye.\n\n5. A visible object moving with any velocity appears to be at rest, if the space described in the interval of one second be imperceptible at the distance of the eye. Hence it is that a near object moving very slowly, as the index of a clock, or a remote one very swiftly, as a planet, seems to be at rest.\n\n6. An object moving with any degree of velocity will appear at rest, if the space it runs over in a second of time be to its distance from the eye as 1 to 1450.\n\n7. The eye proceeding straight from one place to another, a lateral object, not too far off, whether on the right or left, will seem to move the contrary way.\n\n8. The eye proceeding straight from one place to another, and being sensible of its motion, distant objects will seem to move the same way, and with the same velocity. Thus, to a person running eastwards, the moon on his right hand appears to move the same way, and with equal swiftness; for, on account of its distance, its image continues fixed upon the same place of the retina, from whence we imagine that the object moves along with the eye.\n\n9. If the eye and the object move both the same way, only the eye much swifter than the object, the last will appear to go backwards.\n\n10. If two or more objects move with the same velocity, and a third remain at rest, the moveable ones will appear fixed, and the quiescent one in motion the contrary way. Thus when clouds move very swiftly, their parts seem to preserve their situation, and the moon to move the contrary way.\n\n11. If the eye be moved with great velocity, lateral objects at rest appear to move the contrary way. Thus to a person sitting in a coach, and riding briskly through a wood, the trees seem to retire the contrary way; and to people in a ship, &c. the shores seem to recede.\n\nAt the conclusion of these observations, Dr Porterfield endeavours to explain another phenomenon of motion, which, though common and well known, had not been explained in a satisfactory manner. It is this: If a person turns swiftly round, without changing his motion to a place, all objects about will seem to move round in a circular contrary way; and this deception continues not only while the person himself moves round, but also after he ceases to move, when the eye, as well as the object, is at absolute rest.\n\nThe reason why objects appear to move round the contrary way, when the eye turns round, is not so difficult to explain: for though, properly speaking, motion is not seen, as not being in itself the immediate object of sight; yet by the sight we easily know when the image changes its place on the retina, and thence conclude that either the object, the eye, or both, are moved. But by the sight alone we can never determine how far this motion belongs to the object, how far to the eye, or how far to both. If we imagine the eye at rest, we ascribe the whole motion to the object, though it be truly at rest. If we imagine the object at rest, we ascribe the whole motion to the eye, though it belongs entirely to the object; and when the eye is in motion, though we are sensible of its motion, yet, if we do not imagine that it moves so swiftly as it really does, we ascribe only a part of the motion to the eye, and the rest of it we ascribe to the object, though it be actually at rest. This last, he says, is what happens in the present case, when the eye turns round; for though we are sensible of the motion of the eye, yet we do not apprehend that it moves so fast as it really does; and therefore the bodies about appear to move the contrary way, as is agreeable to experience.\n\nBut the great difficulty still remains, viz. Why, after the eye ceases to move, objects should, for some time, still appear to continue in motion, though their pictures on the retina be really at rest, and do not at all change their place. This, he imagined, proceeds from a mistake we are in with respect to the eye, which, though it be absolutely at rest, we nevertheless conceive as moving the contrary way to that in which it moved before; from which mistake, with respect to the motion of the eye, the objects at rest will appear to move the same way which the eye is imagined to move; and, consequently, will seem to continue their motion for some time after the eye is at rest.\n\nThis is ingenious, but perhaps not just. An accurate count of this matter, which seems to us more satisfactory, nomenclature.\ntory, has been lately given to the public by Dr Wells. \"Some of the older writers upon optics (says this ingenious philosopher) imagined the vivific spirits to be contained in the head, as water is in a vessel; which, therefore, when once put in motion by the rotation of our bodies, must continue in it for some time after this has ceased; and to this real circular movement of the vivific spirits, while the body is at rest, they attributed the apparent motions of objects in giddiness. Dechales saw the weakness of this hypothesis; and conjectured, that the phenomenon might be owing to a real movement of the eyes; but produced no fact in proof of his opinion. Dr Porterfield, on the contrary, supposed the difficulty of explaining it to consist in showing, why objects at rest appear in motion to an eye which is also at rest. The solution he offered of this representation of the phenomenon, is not only extremely ingenious, but is, I believe, the only probable one which can be given. It does not apply, however, to the fact which truly exists; for I shall immediately show, that the eye is not at rest, as he imagined. The last author I know of who has touched upon this subject is Dr Darwin. His words are, 'When any one turns round rapidly on one foot till he becomes dizzy, and falls upon the ground, the spectra of the ambient objects continue to present themselves in rotation, or appear to librate, and he seems to behold them for some time in motion.' I do not indeed pretend to understand his opinion fully; but this much seems clear, that if such an apparent motion of the surrounding objects depends in any way upon their spectra, or the illusive representations of those objects, occasioned by their former impressions upon the retinas, no similar motion would be observed, were we to turn ourselves round with our eyes shut, and not to open them till we became dizzy; for in this case, as the surrounding objects could not send their pictures to the retinas, there would consequently be no spectra to present themselves afterward in rotation. But whoever will make the experiment, will find, that objects about him appear to be equally in motion, when he has become dizzy by turning himself round, whether this has been done with his eyes open or shut. I shall now venture to propose my own opinion upon this subject.\n\n\"If the eye be at rest, we judge an object to be in motion when its picture falls in succeeding times upon different parts of the retina; and if the eye be in motion, we judge an object to be at rest, as long as the change in the place of its picture upon the retina holds a certain correspondence with the change of the eye's position. Let us now suppose the eye to be in motion, while, from some disorder in the system of vision, we are either without those feelings which indicate the various positions of the eye, or are not able to attend to them. It is evident, that in such a state of things an object at rest must appear to be in motion, since it lends in succeeding times its picture to different parts of the retina. And this seems to be what happens in giddiness. I was first led to think so from observing, that, during a slight fit of giddiness I was accidentally seized with, a coloured spot, occasioned by looking steadily at a luminous body, and upon which I happened at that moment to be making an experiment, was moved in a manner altogether independent of the positions I conceived my eyes to possess. To determine this point, I again produced the spot, by looking some time at the flame of a candle: then turning myself round till I became giddy, I suddenly discontinued this motion, and directed my eyes to the middle of a facet of paper, fixed upon the wall of my chamber. The spot now appeared upon the paper, but only for a moment; for it immediately after seemed to move to one side; and the paper to the other, notwithstanding I conceived the position of my eyes to be in the mean while unchanged. To go on with the experiment, when the paper and spot had proceeded to a certain distance from each other, they suddenly came together again; and this separation and conjunction were alternately repeated a number of times, the limits of the separation gradually becoming less, till at length the paper and spot both appeared to be at rest, and the latter to be projected upon the middle of the former. I found also, upon repeating and varying the experiment a little, that when I had turned myself from left to right, the paper moved from right to left, and the spot consequently the contrary way; but that when I had turned from right to left, the paper would then move from left to right. These were the appearances observed while I stood erect. When I inclined, however, my head in such a manner as to bring the side of my face parallel to the horizon, the spot and paper would then move from each other, one upward and the other downward. But all these phenomena demonstrate, that there was a real motion in my eyes at the time I imagined them to be at rest; for the apparent situation of the spot, with respect to the paper, could not possibly have been altered, without a real change of the position of those organs. To have the same thing proved in another way, I desired a person to turn quickly round, till he became very giddy; then to stop himself, and look steadfastly at me. He did so, and I could plainly see, that although he thought his eyes were fixed, they were in reality moving in their sockets, first toward one side and then toward the other.\"\n\nM. Le Cat well explains a remarkable deception, by which a person shall imagine an object to be on the opposite side of a board, when it is not so, and also inverted and magnified. It is illustrated by fig. 6, in which D represents the eye, and CB a large black board, pierced with a small hole. E is a large white board, placed beyond it, and strongly illuminated; and d a pin, or other small object, held betwixt the eye and the first board. In these circumstances, the pin shall be imagined to be at F, on the other side of the board, where it will appear inverted and magnified; because what is in fact perceived, is the shadow of the pin upon the retina; and the light that is stopped by the upper part of the pin coming from the lower part of the enlightened board, and that which is stopped by the lower part coming from the upper part of the board, the shadow must necessarily be inverted with respect to the object. This is nothing more than Mr Grey's experiment, in which he saw an inverted image of the pin, and which we have already noticed.\n\nThere is a curious phenomenon relating to vision, which some persons have ascribed to the inflection of light, but which Mr Melville explains in a very different and very simple manner.\n\nWhen any opaque body is held at the distance of three or four inches from the eye, so that a part of some more distant luminous object, such as the window, or the flame of a candle, may be seen by rays passing near its edge,\nTheory.\n\nApparent edge, if another opaque body, nearer to the eye, be brought across from the opposite side, the edge of the first body will seem to swell outwards, and meet the latter; and in doing so will intercept a portion of the luminous object that was seen before.\n\nThis appearance he explains in the following manner:\n\nLet AB represent the luminous object to which the sight is directed, CD the more distant opaque body, GH the nearer, and EF the diameter of the pupil. Join ED, FD, EG, FG, and produce them till they meet AB in K, N, M, and L. It is plain that the parts AN, MB, of the luminous object cannot be seen. But taking any point a between N and K, and drawing a D d, since the portion d F of the pupil is filled with light flowing from that point, it must be visible. Any point b, between a and K, must fill f F, a greater portion of the pupil, and therefore must appear brighter. Again, Any point c between b and K, must appear brighter than b, because it fills a greater portion g F with light. The point K itself, and every other point in the space KL, must appear very luminous, since they send entire pencils of rays EKF, ELF, to the eyes, and the visible brightnesses of every point from L towards M, must decrease gradually, as from K to N, that is, the spaces KN, LM, will appear as dim shadowy borders, or fringes, adjacent to the edges of the opaque bodies.\n\nWhen the edge G is brought to touch the right line KF, the penumbras unite; and as soon as it reaches NDF, the above phenomenon begins; for it cannot pass that right line without meeting some line a D d, drawn from a point between N and K, and, by intercepting all the rays that fall upon the pupil, render it invisible. In advancing gradually to the line KDE, it will meet other lines b D f, c D g, &c., and therefore render the points b, c, &c., from N to K, successively invisible; and therefore the edge of the fixed opaque body CD must seem to swell outwards, and cover the whole space NK; while GH, by its motion, covers MK. When GH is placed at a greater distance from the eye, CD continuing fixed, the space OP to be passed over in order to intercept NK is less; and therefore, with an equal motion of GH, the apparent swelling of CD must be quicker; which is found true by experience.\n\nIf ML represent a luminous object, and REFQ any plane exposed to its light, the space FQ will be entirely shaded from the rays, and the space FE will be occupied by a penumbra, gradually darker, from E to F. Let now GH continue fixed, and CD move parallel to the plane EF; and as soon as it passes the line LF, it is evident that the shadow QF will seem to swell outwards; and when CD reaches ME, so as to cover with its shadow the space RE, QF, by its extension, will cover FE. This is found to hold true likewise by experiment.\n\nSect. X. On Aberration of Figure or Sphericity.\n\nThe great practical use of the science of optics is to aid human sight; but it has been repeatedly observed during the progress of this article, that in constructing dioptrical instruments for this purpose, great difficulties arise from the aberration of light. It has been shown how to determine the concurrence of any refracted ray PF' with the ray RVCF', which passes through the centre C, and therefore falls perpendicularly on the spherical surface at the vertex V, and suffers no refraction. This is the conjugate focus to R for the two rays RP, RV, and for another ray flowing from R and falling on the surface at an equal distance on the opposite side to P. In short, it is the conjugate focus for all the rays flowing from R and falling on the spherical surface in the circumference of a circle described by the revolution of the point P round the axis RVCF'; that is, of all the rays which occupy the conical surface described by the revolution of RP, and the refracted rays occupy the conical surface produced by the revolution of PP'.\n\nBut no other rays flowing from R are collected at F', for it appeared in the demonstration of that proposition, that rays incident at a greater distance from the axis RC were collected at a point between C and F'; and then the rays which are incident on the whole arch PC, or the spherical surface generated by its revolution round RC, although they all cross the axis RC, are diffused over a certain portion of it, by what has been called the aberration of figure. It is called also (but improperly) the aberration from the geometrical focus, by which is meant the focus of an infinitely slender pencil of rays, of which the middle ray (or axis of the pencil) occupies the lens RC, and suffers no refraction. But there is no such focus. But if we make mRV = nRC : mRV = VC : VF, the point F is called the geometrical focus, and is the nearest limit from C of all the foci (equally geometrical) of rays flowing from R. The other limit is easily determined by constructing the problem for the extreme point of the given arch.\n\nIt is evident from the construction, that while the point of incidence P is near to V, the line CK increases but very little, and therefore CP diminishes little, and the refracted rays are but little diffused from F; and therefore they are much denser in its vicinity than any other point of the axis. It will soon be evident that they are incomparably denser. It is on this account, that the point F has been called the conjugate focus to R, and the geometrical focus, and the diffusion has been called aberration. A geometrical point R is thus represented by a very small circle at F, and F has drawn the chief attention. And as, in the performance of optical instruments, it is necessary that this extended representation of a mathematical point R be very small, that it may not sensibly interfere with the representations of the points adjacent to R, and thus cause indistinct vision, a limit is thus set to the extent of the refracting surface which must be employed to produce this representation. But this evidently diminishes the quantity of light, and renders the vision obscure though distinct. Artists have therefore endeavoured to execute refracting surfaces of forms not spherical, which collect accurately to one point the light issuing from another, and the mathematicians have furnished them with forms having this property; but their attempts have been fruitless. Spherical surfaces are the only ones which can be executed with accuracy. All are done by grinding the refracting substance in a mould of proper materials. When this is spherical, the two work themselves, with moderate attention, into an exact sphere; because if any part is more prominent than another, it is ground away, and the whole gets of necessity one curvature. And it is astonishing to what degree of accuracy this is done. An error of the millionth part of an inch would totally destroy...\nOf Aberration so as to make it useless for the coarsest instrument. Therefore all attempts to make other figures are given up. Indeed other reasons make them worse than spherical, even when accurately executed. They would not collect to accurate focuses the rays of oblique pencils.\n\nIt is evident from these observations, that the theory of aberrations is absolutely necessary for the successful construction of optical instruments; and it must be acceptable to the reader to have a short account of it in this place. Enough shall be said here to show the general nature and effects of it in optical instruments, and in some of the more curious phenomena of nature. Under the article Telescope the subject will be resumed, in such a manner as to enable the reader who possesses a very moderate share of mathematical knowledge, not only to understand how aberrations are increased and diminished, but also how, by a proper employment of contrary aberrations, their hurtful effects may be almost entirely removed in all important cases. And the manner in which the subject shall be treated in the present general sketch, will have the advantage of pointing out at the same time the maxims of construction of the greatest part of optical instruments, which generally produce their effects by means of pencils of rays which are either out of the axis altogether, or are oblique to it; cases which are seldom considered in elementary treatises of optics.\n\nLet PV be a spherical surface of a refracting substance (glass for instance), of which C is the centre, and let an indefinitely slender pencil of rays AP be incident on it, in a direction parallel to a ray CV passing through the centre. It is required to determine the focus f of this pencil.\n\nLet AP be refracted into PF. Draw CI, CR the fines of incidence and refraction, and CP the radius. Draw RB perpendicular to CP, and Bf parallel to AP or CV. I say, first, f is the focus of the indefinitely slender pencil, or, more accurately speaking, f is the remotest limit from P of the concourse of rays with PF refracted by points lying without the arch VP, or the nearest limit for rays incident between V and P.\n\nDraw the radius Cc, the line pf, and draw pg parallel to pf, and po perpendicular to pf. It is evident, that if f be the focus, c'pf is the angle of refraction corresponding to the angle of incidence, apc as c'pf is the angle corresponding to APC. Also pcp is the increment of the angle of incidence, and the angle c'pg is equal to the sum of the angle c'pf and c'cc, and the angle gpf is equal to the angle pfP. Therefore c'pf = c'pf + p, cp + pfP. Therefore pcp + pfP is the corresponding increment of the angle of refraction. Also, because RP = CPP (being right angles) the angle ppo = RPC, and po : pp = PR : PC.\n\nTherefore by a preceding Lemma in this article, we have pcp + pfP : pcp = tan. ref. : tan. incid. = T, R : T, I; and pfP : pcp = T, R : T, I : T, I, = diff. : T, I; but pfP : pcp = po : pp = PR : PC, = PR : pfP = DR : DB (because DP is parallel to Bf by construction) = tan. CPR = tan. CPI. Now CPI is the angle of incidence; and therefore CPR is the angle properly corresponding to it as an angle of refraction, and the point f is properly determined.\n\nHence the following rule. As the difference of the tangents of incidence and refraction is to the tangent of incidence, so is the radius of the surface multiplied by the cosine of refraction to the distance of the focus of an infinitely slender pencil of parallel incident rays.\n\nN.B. We here consider the cosine of refraction as a number. This was first done by the celebrated Euler, and is one of the greatest improvements in mathematics which this century can boast of. The sines, tangents, secants, &c. are considered as fractional numbers, of which the radius is unity. Thus, CP \u00d7 sin. 30\u00b0, is the same thing with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) CP, or \\( \\frac{CP}{2} \\). And in like manner, CB, drawn perpendicular to the axis \u00d7 sin. 19\u00b0 28' 16\" 32\", is the same thing with \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) CB. Also \\( \\frac{CB}{\\text{col. } 60\u00b0} \\) is the same thing with twice CB, &c.\n\nIn this manner, BE = BC \u00d7 sin. BCE, and also BE = CE \u00d7 tan. BCE, and CB = CE \u00d7 sec. BCE, &c. &c. This manner of considering the lines which occur in geometrical constructions is of immense use in all parts of mixed mathematics; and nowhere more remarkably than in optics, the most beautiful example of them. Of this an important instance shall now be given.\n\nCor. 1. The distance fG of this lateral focus from the axis CV (that is, from the line drawn through the centre parallel to the incident light) is proportional to the cube of the semi-aperture PH of the spherical surface.\n\nFor fG = BE. Now BE = CB \u00d7 sin. BCE, = CB \u00d7 sin. CPA; and CB = RC \u00d7 cos. RCB, = RC \u00d7 sin. CPR, and RC = CP \u00d7 sin. CPR: Therefore BE = PC \u00d7 sin. CPR \u00d7 sin. PCA, = PC \u00d7 sin. refr. \u00d7 sin. incid. but sin. refr. = \\( \\frac{m^2}{n^2} \\) \u00d7 sin. incid. Therefore, finally, BE, or fG = PC \u00d7 \\( \\frac{m^2}{n^2} \\) \u00d7 sin. incid.: But PC, sin. incid. is evidently PH the semi-aperture; therefore the proposition is manifest.\n\nCor. 2. Now let this slender pencil of rays be incident at the vertex V. The focus will now be a point F in the axis, determined by making CV : CF = m : n. Let the incident pencil gradually recede from the axis CF, still, however, keeping parallel to it. The focus f will always be found in a curve line DC', fo constituted that the ordinate G will be as the cube of the line PH, perpendicular to the axis intercepted between the axis and that point of the surface which is cut by a tangent to the curve in f.\n\nAll the refracted rays will be tangents to this curve, and the adjacent rays will cross each other in these lateral foci f; and will therefore be incomparably more dense along the curve than anywhere within its area. This is finely illustrated by receiving on white paper the light of the sun refracted through a globe or cylinder of glass filled with water. If the paper is held parallel to the axis of the cylinder, and close to it, the illuminated part will be bounded by two very bright parallel lines, where it is cut by the curve; and these lines will gradually approach each other as the paper is withdrawn from the vessel, till they coalesce into one very bright\nbright line at F, or near it. If the paper be held with its end touching the vessel, and its plane nearly perpendicular to the axis, the whole progress of the curve will be distinctly seen.\n\nAs such globes were used for burning glasses, the point of greatest condensation (which is very near but not exactly in F) was called the focus. When these curves were observed by Mr Tchirnhaus, he called them caustics; and those formed by refraction he called dia-caustics, to distinguish them from the catacaustics formed by reflection.\n\nIt is somewhat surprising, that these curves have been so little studied since the time of Tchirnhaus. The doctrine of aberrations has indeed been considered in a manner independent on their properties. But whoever considers the progress of rays in the eye-piece of optical instruments, will see that the knowledge of the properties of diacaustic curves determines directly, and almost accurately, the foci and images that are formed there. For, let the object-glass of a telescope or microscope be of any dimensions, the pencils incident on the eye-glasses are almost all of this evanescent bulk. These advantages will be shown in their proper places: and we proceed at present to extend our knowledge of aberrations in general, first considering the aberrations of parallel incident rays.\n\nAbiding by the influence represented by the figure, it is evident that the caustic will touch the surface in a point P, so situated that \\( \\frac{cP}{cK} = \\frac{m}{n} \\). The refracted ray \\( \\phi \\Phi \\) will touch the surface, and will cross the axis in \\( \\Phi \\), the nearest limit of diffusion along the axis. If the surface is of smaller extent, as PV, the caustic begins at \\( f \\); when the extreme refracted ray \\( P'f \\) touches the caustic, and crosses the axis in \\( F' \\), and the opposite branch of the caustic in K. If there be drawn an ordinate KO to the caustic, it is evident that the whole light incident on the surface PVII passes through the circle whose diameter is KK, and that the circle is the smallest space which receives all the refracted light.\n\nIt is of great importance to consider the manner in which the light is distributed over the surface of this circle of smallest diffusion: for this is the representation of one point of the infinitely distant radiant object. Each point of a planet, for instance, is represented by this little circle; and as the circles representing the different adjacent points must interfere with each other, an indistinctness must arise similar to what is observed when we view an object through a pair of spectacles which do not fit the eye. The indistinctness must be in proportion to the number of points whose circles of diffusion interfere; that is, to the area of these circles, provided that the light is uniformly diffused over them: but if it be very rare at the circumference, the impression made by the circles belonging to the adjacent points must be less sensible. Accordingly, Sir Isaac Newton, supposing it incomparably rarer at the circumference than towards the centre, affirms that the indistinctness of telescopes, arising from the spherical figure of the object-glass, was some thousand times less than that arising from the unequal refrangibility of light; and therefore, that the attempts to improve them by diminishing or removing this aberration were useless, while the indistinctness from unequal refrangibility remained. It is surprising, that a philosopher so eminent for sagacity and for mathematical knowledge should have made such a mistake, and unfortunate that the authority of his great name hindered others from examining the matter, trusting to his affirmation that the light was so rare at the border of this circle. His mistake is surprising, because the very nature of a caustic should have showed him that the light was infinitely dense at the borders of the circle of smallest diffusion. The first person who detected this oversight of the British philosopher was the Abb\u00e9 Bofcovitch, who, in a dissertation published at Vienna in 1767, showed, by a very beautiful analysis, that the distribution was extremely different from what Newton had asserted, and that the superior indistinctness arising from unequal refrangibility was incomparably less than he had said. We shall attempt to make this delicate and interesting matter conceived by those who have but small mathematical preparation.\n\nLet the curve DVZCIE be the caustic (magnified), EI its axis, I the focus of central rays, B the focus of extreme rays, and IB the line containing the foci of all the intermediate rays, and CO the diameter of the circle of smallest diffusion.\n\nIt is plain, that from the centre O there can be drawn two rays OV, Ov, touching the caustic in V, v. Therefore the point O will receive the ray EO, which passes through the vertex of the refracting surface, and all the rays which are incident on the circumference of a circle described on the refracting surface by the extremity of the ray OV, or Ov. The density of the light at O will therefore be indefinitely great.\n\nFrom the point C there can be drawn two rays; one of them CX touching the caustic in C, and the other C, touching it at d on the opposite side. The rays which touch the caustic in the immediate vicinity of C, both in the arch CV and the arch CI will cut OC in points indefinitely near to each other; because their distance from each other in the line OC will be to their uniform distance on the refracting surface as the distance between their points of contact with the caustic to the distance of these points from the refracting surface. Here therefore at C the density of the light will also be indefinitely great.\n\nFrom any point H, lying between O and C, may be drawn three rays. One of them LHT, P, touching the arch CD of the caustic in T, cutting the refracting surface in P, and the axis in L; another \\( \\tau H \\rho \\), touching the arch CI of the caustic in \\( \\tau \\). The third is \\( \\tau \\pi \\), touching the arch cd of the opposite branch of the caustic in \\( \\tau \\).\n\nIt will greatly assist our conception of this subject, Fig. 1, if we consider a ray of light from the refracting surface as a thread attached at I of this figure, or at F of fig. 1, and gradually unlooped from the caustic DVCI on one side, and then lopped on the opposite branch I cd; and attend to the point of its intersection with the diameter c OC of the circle of smallest diffusion.\n\nTherefore, 1. Let the ray be first supposed to pass through the refracting surface at F, the right hand extremity of the aperture. The thread is then folded up on the whole right hand branch ICVD of the caustic; and if the straight part of it FD be produced, it will cut the diameter of the circle of smallest diffusion in the opposite extremity c. Or suppose a ruler in place of the thread, applied to the caustic at D and to the refracting surface at F, the part of it DC, which\nwhich is detached from the caustic, cuts COc in the point c. 2. Now suppose the ruler to revolve gradually, its extremity moving across the arch RAf of the refracting surface while the edge is applied to the caustic; the point of contact with the caustic will shift gradually down the branch DV of the caustic, while its edge passes across the line c C; and when the point of contact arrives at V, the extremity will be at Y on the refracting surface, and the intersection of the edge will be at O. 3. Continuing the motion, the point of contact shifts from V to Z, the extremity from Y to Q', and the intersection from O to Q, so that $OQ^2 = \\frac{OC^2}{2}$, as will presently appear. 4. After this, the point of contact will shift from Z to C, the extremity from Q' to X, halfway from F to A, as will soon be shown, and the intersection from Q to C. 5. The point of contact will now shift from C down to I, the extremity will pass from X to A, and the intersection will go back from C to O. 6. The ruler must now be applied to the other branch of the caustic I e v d, and the point of contact will ascend from I to c, the extremity will pass from A to x, half way to f from A, and the intersection from O to c. 7. The point of contact will ascend from C to z, the extremity passes from x to q', and the intersection from C to q, Or being $\\frac{Oq^2}{2}$. 8. While the contact of the ruler and caustic shifts from z to v, the extremity shifts from q' to y, and the intersection from q to O. 9. The contact rises from v to d, the extremity passes from y to f, and the intersection from O to C; and then the motion across the refracting surface is completed: the point of contact shifting down from D to I along the branch DVZCI, and then ascending along the other branch I e v d, while the intersection passes from c to C, back again from C to c, and then back again from c to C, where it ends, having thrice passed through every intermediate point of c C.\n\nWe may form a notion of the density of the light in any point H, by supposing the incident light of uniform density at the refracting surface, and attending to the continuation of the rays in the circle of smallest diffusion. Their vicinity may be estimated both in the direction of the radii OH, and in the direction of the circumference described by its extremity H, during its revolution round the axis; and the density must be conceived as proportional to the number of originally equidistant rays, which are collected into a spot of given area. These have been collected from a corresponding spot or area of the refracting surface; and as the number of rays is the same in both, the density at H will be to the density of the refracting surface, as the area occupied of the refracting surface to the corresponding area at H. The vicinity of the rays in the direction of the radius depends on the proportion between PT and TH. For the ray adjacent to PTH may be supposed to cross it at the point of contact T; and therefore the uniform distance between them at the surface of that medium is to the distance between the same rays at H as the distance of T from the refracting surface to its distance from H. Therefore the number of rays which occupy a tenth of an inch, for example, of the radius AP, is to the number which would occupy a tenth of an inch at H as TH to TP; and the radial density at P is to the radial density at H, also as TH to TP. In the next place, of the circumferential density at P is to that at H as the radius AP to the radius OH. For supposing the figure to turn round its axis AI, the point P of the refracting surface will describe a circumference whose radius is AP, and H will describe a circumference whose radius is OH; and the whole rays which pass through the first circumference pass also through the last, and therefore their circumferential densities will be in the inverse proportion of the spaces into which they are collected. Now the radius AP is to the radius OH as AL to OL; and circumferences have the same proportion with their radii. Therefore the circumferential density at P is to that in H as AL to OL inversely; and it was found that the radial density was as AN to ON inversely, being as TH to TP, which are very nearly in this ratio. Therefore the absolute density (or number of rays collected in a given space) at P will be to that at H, in the ratio compounded of these ratios; that is, in the ratio of ON \u00d7 OL to AN \u00d7 AL. But as NL bears but a very small ratio to AN or AL, AN \u00d7 AL may be taken as equal to AO without any sensible error. It never differs from it in telescopes 100th part, and is generally incomparably smaller. Therefore the density at H may be considered as proportional to ON \u00d7 OL inversely. And it will afterwards appear that NS = 3OL. Therefore the density at H is inversely as ON \u00d7 NS.\n\nNow describe a circle on the diameter OS, and draw N1\u03c6 cutting the circumference Nq = ON \u00d7 NS, and the density at H is as Nq inversely. This gives us a very easy estimation of the density, viz. draw a line from the point of contact of the ray which touches the part VC of the caustic, and the density is in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the part of this line intercepted between the axis and the circumference SgO. It will afterwards appear that the density corresponding to this ray is one half of the density corresponding to all the three: or a better expression will be had for the density at H by drawing Rg perpendicular to R\u03c6, and so perpendicular to \u03c6\u03b2, making \u03c6R in o; then \u03c6o is as $\\frac{1}{\u03c6N^2}$, or is proportional to the density, as is evident.\n\nWhen H is at O, N is at S, and \u03c6o is infinite. As H moves from O, N descends, and \u03c6o diminishes, till H comes to Q, and T to z, and \u03c6 to \u03be, and o to R. When H moves from Q towards C, T descends below z, \u03c6o again increases, till it is again infinite, when H is at C, T at C, and N at O.\n\nThus it appears, without any minute consideration, that the light has a density indefinitely great in the centre O; that the density decreases to a minimum in some intermediate point Q, and then increases again to infinity at the margin C. Hence it follows, that the indistinctness arising from the spherical figure of the refracting surfaces is incomparably greater than Newton supposed; and that the valuable discovery of Mr Dollond of achromatic lenses, must have failed of answering his fond expectations, if his very method of producing them had not, at the same time, enabled him to remove that other indistinctness by employing contrary aberrations. And now, since the discovery by Dr Blair of substances which disperse the different colours in the same proportions, but very different degrees,\nTheory.\n\nDegrees, has enabled us to employ much larger portions of the sphere than Mr Dollond could introduce into his object-glasses; it becomes absolutely necessary to study this matter completely, in order to discover and ascertain the amount of the errors which perhaps unavoidably remain.\n\nThis flight sketch of the most simple case of aberration, namely, when the incident rays are parallel, will serve to give a general notion of the subject; and the reader can now see how contrary aberrations may be employed in order to form an ultimate image which shall be as distinct as possible. For let it be proposed to converge parallel rays accurately to the focus F by the refraction of spherical surfaces of which V is the vertex. Let PV be a convex lens of such a form that rays flowing from F and passing through it immediately round the vertex V are collected to the conjugate focus R, while the extreme ray FP, incident on the margin of the lens P, is converged to r, nearer to V, having the longitudinal aberration Rr.\n\nLet PV be a plano-concave lens, of such sphericity that a ray Ap, parallel to the axis CV, and incident on the point p, as far from its vertex V as P in the other lens is from its vertex x, is dispersed from r, the distance qV being equal to rV, while the central rays are dispersed from P, as far from V as R is from V.\n\nIt is evident, that if these lenses be joined as in fig. 4, a ray Ap, parallel to the common axis CV, will be collected at the distance VF equal to VF in the fig. 4, and that rays passing through both lenses in the neighbourhood of the axis will be collected at the same point F.\n\nThis compound lens is said to be without spherical aberration; and it is true that the central and the extreme rays are collected in the same point F; but the rays which fall on the lens between the centre and margin are a little diffused from F, and it is not possible to collect them all to one point. For in the rules for computing the aberration, quantities are neglected which do not preserve, in different apertures, the same ratio to the quantities retained. The diffusion is least when the aberration is corrected, not for the very extremity, but for a certain intermediate point (varying with the aperture, and having no known ratio to it); and when this is done the compound lens is in its state of greatest perfection, and the remaining aberration is quite insensible. See Telescope.\n\nSect. VI. On the different Refrangibility of Light.\n\nAs this property of light solves a great number of the phenomena which could not be understood by former opticians, we shall give an account of it nearly in the words of Sir Isaac Newton, who first discovered it; especially as his account is more full and perspicuous than those of succeeding writers.\n\n\"In a dark chamber, at a round hole F, about one third of an inch broad, made in the shutter of a window, I placed a glass prism ABC, whereby the beam of the sun's light, SF, which came in at that hole, might be refracted upwards, toward the opposite wall of the chamber, and there form a coloured image of the sun, represented at PT. The axis of the prism was, in this and the following experiments, perpendicular to the incident rays. About this axis I turned the prism slowly, and saw the refracted or coloured image of the sun, first to ascend, and then to descend. Between the descent and ascent, when the image seemed stationary, I flopped the prism and fixed it in that posture.\n\nThen I let the refracted light fall perpendicularly upon a sheet of white paper MN, placed at the opposite wall of the chamber, and observed the figure and dimensions of the solar image, PT, formed on the paper by that light. This image was oblong, and not oval, but terminated by two rectilinear and parallel sides and two semicircular ends. On its sides it was bounded pretty distinctly; but on its ends very indistinctly, the light there vanishing by degrees. At the distance of 18\u00bd feet from the prism the breadth of the image was about 2\u00bd inches, but its length was about 103 inches, and the length of its rectilinear sides about 8 inches; and ACB, the refracting angle of the prism, by which so great a length was made, was 64 degrees. With a less angle the length of the image was less, the breadth remaining the same. It is farther to be observed, that the rays went on in straight lines from the prism to the image, and therefore at their going out of the prism had all that inclination to one another from which the length of the image proceeded. This image PT was coloured, and the more eminent colours lay in this order from the bottom at T to the top at P; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet; together with all their intermediate degrees in a continual succession perpetually varying.\"\n\nOur author concludes from this and other experiments, \"that the light of the sun consists of a mixture of several sorts of coloured rays, some of which at equal incidences are more refracted than others, and therefore are called more refrangible. The red at T, being nearest reflected to the place Y, where the rays of the sun would go refrangible, directly if the prism was taken away, is the least refracted of all the rays; and the orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, are continually more and more refracted, as they are more and more diverted from the course of the direct light. For by mathematical reasoning he has proved, that when the prism is fixed in the posture above mentioned, so that the place of the image shall be the lowest possible, or at the limit between its descent and ascent, the figure of the image ought then to be round like the spot at Y, if all the rays that tended to it were equally refracted. Therefore, since it is found by experience that this image is not round, but about five times longer than broad, it follows, that all the rays are not equally refracted. This conclusion is farther confirmed by the following experiments.\n\n\"In the fumebam SF, which was propagated into the room through the hole in the window-flutter EG, at the distance of some feet from the hole, I held the prism ABC in such a posture, that its axis might be perpendicular to that beam: then I looked through the prism upon the hole F, and turning the prism to and fro about its axis to make the image p't' of the hole ascend and descend, when between its two contrary motions it seemed stationary, I flopped the prism; in this situation of the prism, viewing through it the said hole F, I observed the length of its refracted image p't' to be many times greater than its breadth; and that the most refracted part thereof appeared violet at p'; the least refracted, at t'; and the middle parts indigo, blue, green, yellow,\"\nOn the different refrangibility of Light.\n\nThe same thing happened when I removed the prism out of the sun's light, and looked through it upon the hole shining by the light of the clouds beyond it. And yet if the refractions of all the rays were equal according to one certain proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction, as is vulgarly supposed, the refracted image ought to have appeared round, by the mathematical demonstration above mentioned. So then by these two experiments it appears, that in equal incidences there is a considerable inequality of refractions.\n\nFor the discovery of this fundamental property of light, which has unfolded the whole mystery of colours, we see our author was not only beheld to the experiments themselves, which many others had made before him, but also to his skill in geometry; which was absolutely necessary to determine what the figure of the refracted image ought to be upon the old principle of an equal refraction of all the rays: but having thus made the discovery, he contrived the following experiment to prove it at light.\n\n\"In the middle of two thin boards, DE, I made a round hole in each, at G and g, a third part of an inch in diameter; and in the window-flut a much larger hole being made, at F, to let into my darkened chamber a large beam of the sun's light, I placed a prism, ABC, behind the flut in that beam, to refract it towards the opposite wall; and close behind this prism I fixed one of the boards DE, in such a manner that the middle of the refracted light might pass through the hole made in it at G, and the rest be intercepted by the board. Then at the distance of about 12 feet from the first board, I fixed the other board, de, in such manner that the middle of the refracted light, which came through the hole in the first board, and fell upon the opposite wall, might pass through the hole g in this other board de, and the rest being intercepted by the board, might paint upon it the coloured spectrum of the sun. And close behind this board I fixed another prism abc, to refract the light which came through the hole g. Then I returned speedily to the first prism ABC, and by turning it slowly to and fro about its axis, I caused the image which fell upon the second board de, to move up and down upon that board, that all its parts might pass successively through the hole in that board, and fall upon the prism behind it. And in the meantime I noted the places, M, N, on the opposite wall, to which that light after its refraction in the second prism did pass; and by the difference of the places at M and N, I found that the light, which being most refracted in the first prism ABC, did go to the blue end of the image, was again more refracted by the second prism abc, than the light which went to the red end of that image. For when the lower part of the light which fell upon the second board de, was cast through the hole g, it went to a lower place M on the wall; and when the higher part of that light was cast through the same hole g, it went to a higher place N on the wall; and when any intermediate part of the light was cast through that hole, it went to some place in the wall between M and N. The unchanged position of the holes in the boards made the incidence of the rays upon the second prism to be the same in all cases. And yet in that common incidence some of the rays were more refracted and others less: and those were more refracted in this prism, which by a greater refraction in the first prism were more turned out of their way; and therefore, for their constancy of being more refracted, are deservedly called more refrangible.\"\n\nSir Isaac shows also, by experiments made with convex glas, that lights, reflected from natural bodies, which differ in colour, differ also in refrangibility; and that they differ in the same manner as the rays of the sun do.\n\n\"The sun's light consists of rays differing in reflectibility, and those rays are more reflexible than others which are more refrangible. A prism, ABC, whose two angles, at its base BC, were equal to one another and half right ones, and the third at A a right one, I placed in a beam FM of the sun's light, let into a dark chamber through a hole F one third part of an inch broad. And turning the prism slowly about its axis until the light which went through one of its angles ACB, and was refracted by it to G and H, began to be reflected into the line MN by its base BC, at which till then it went out of the glas; I observed that those rays, as MH, which had suffered the greatest refraction, were sooner reflected than the rest. To make it evident that the rays which vanished at H were reflected into the beam MN, I made this beam pass through another prism VXY, and being refracted by it to fall afterwards upon a sheet of white paper pt placed at some distance behind it, and there by that refraction to paint the usual colours at pt. Then causing the first prism to be turned about its axis according to the order of the letters ABC, I observed, that when those rays MH, which in this prism had suffered the greatest refraction, and appeared blue and violet, began to be totally reflected, the blue and violet light on the paper which was most refracted in the second prism received a sensible increase at pt, above that of the red and yellow at t: and afterwards, when the rest of the light, which was green, yellow, and red, began to be totally reflected and vanished at C, the light of those colours at t, on the paper pt, received as great an increase as the violet and blue had received before. Which puts it past dispute, that those rays became first of all totally reflected at the base BC, which before at equal incidences with the rest upon the base BC had suffered the greatest refraction. I do not here take any notice of any refractions made in the sides AC, AB, of the first prism, because the light enters almost perpendicularly at the first side, and goes out almost perpendicularly at the second; and therefore suffers none, or so little, that the angles of incidence at the base BC are not sensibly altered by it; especially if the angles of the prism at the base BC be each about 40 degrees. For the rays FM begin to be totally reflected when the angle CMF is about 50 degrees, and therefore they will then make a right angle of 90 degrees with AC.\n\n\"It appears also from experiments, that the beam of light MN, reflected by the base of the prism, being augmented first by the more refrangible rays and afterwards by the less refrangible, is composed of rays differently refrangible.\n\n\"The light whose rays are all alike refrangible, I call simple, homogeneous, and similar; and that whose rays are some more refrangible than others, I call compound, heterogeneous, and dissimilar. The former light I call homogeneous, not because I would affirm it so in all respects;\nTheory.\n\nOn the different refrangibility of Light.\n\nThe colours of homogeneous lights I call primary, homogeneous, and simple; and those of heterogeneous lights, heterogeneous and compound. For these are always compounded of homogeneous lights, as will appear in the following discourse.\n\nThe homogeneous light and rays which appear red, or rather make objects appear so, I call rubrific or red-making; those which make objects appear yellow, green, blue, and violet, I call yellow-making, blue-making, violet-making; and so of the rest. And if at any time I speak of light and rays as coloured or endowed with colours, I would be understood to speak not philosophically but properly, but grossly, and according to such conceptions as vulgar people in seeing all these experiments would be apt to frame. For the rays, to speak properly, are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that colour. For as found, in a bell or musical string or other sounding body, is nothing but a trembling motion, and in the air nothing but that motion propagated from the object, and in the fenestrum it is a sense of that motion under the form of sound; so colours in the object are nothing but a disposition to reflect this or that sort of rays more copiously than the rest; in rays they are nothing but their dispositions to propagate this or that motion into the fenestrum; and in the fenestrum they are sensations of those motions under the forms of colours. See Chromatics.\n\nBy the mathematical proposition above mentioned, it is certain that the rays which are equally refrangible do fall upon a circle answering to the sun's apparent disk, which will also be proved by experiment by and by. Now let AG represent the circle which all the most refrangible rays, propagated from the whole disk of the sun, will illuminate and paint upon the opposite wall if they were alone; EL the circle, which all the least refrangible rays would in like manner illuminate if they were alone; BH, CI, DK, the circles which so many intermediate sorts would paint upon the wall, if they were singly propagated from the sun in successive order, the rest being intercepted; and conceive that there are other circles without number, which innumerable other intermediate sorts of rays would successively paint upon the wall, if the sun should successively emit every sort apart. And seeing the sun emits all these sorts at once, they must all together illuminate and paint innumerable equal circles; of all which, being according to their degrees of refrangibility placed in order in a continual series, that oblong spectrum PT is composed, which was described in the first experiment.\n\nNow if these circles, whilst their centres keep their distances and positions, could be made less in diameter, their interfering one with another, and consequently the mixture of the heterogeneous rays, would be proportionally diminished. Let the circles AG, BH, CI, &c. remain as before; and let ag, bh, ci, &c. be so many less circles lying in a like continual series, between two parallel right lines ae and ef, with the same distance between their centres, and illuminated with the same sorts of rays; that is, the circle ag with the same sort by which the corresponding circle AG was illuminated; and the rest of the circles bh, ci, dk, el, respectively with the same sorts of rays by which the corresponding circles BH, CI, DK, EL, were illuminated. In the figure PT, composed of the great circles, three of those, AG, BH, CI, are so expanded into each other, that three sorts of rays, by which those circles are illuminated, together with innumerable other sorts of intermediate rays, are mixed at QR in the middle of the circle BH. And the like mixture happens throughout almost the whole length of the figure PT. But in the figure pi, composed of the less circles, the three less circles ag, bh, ci, which answer to those three greater, do not extend into one another; nor are there anywhere mingled so much as any two of the three sorts of rays by which those circles are illuminated, and which in the figure PT are all of them intermingled at QR.\n\nSo then, if we would diminish the mixture of the rays, we are to diminish the diameters of the circles. Now these would be diminished if the sun's diameter, to which they answer, could be made less than it is, or (which comes to the same purpose) if without doors, at great distance from the prism towards the sun, some opaque body were placed with a round hole in the middle of it to intercept all the sun's light, except so much as coming from the middle of his body could pass through that hole to the prism. For so the circles AG, BH, and the rest, would not any longer answer to the whole disk of the sun, but only to that part of it which could be seen from the prism through that hole; that is, to the apparent magnitude of that hole viewed from the prism. But that these circles may answer more distinctly to that hole, a lens is to be placed by the prism to cast the image of the hole (that is, every one of the circles AG, BH, &c.) distinctly upon the paper at PT; after such a manner, as by a lens placed at a window the pictures of objects abroad are cast distinctly upon a paper within the room. If this be done, it will not be necessary to place that hole very far off, no not beyond the window. And therefore, instead of that hole, I used the hole in the window-flut as follows.\n\nIn the sun's light let into my darkened chamber through a small round hole in my window-flut, at about 10 or 12 feet from the window, I placed a lens MN, Fig. 6, by which the image of the hole F might be distinctly cast upon a sheet of white paper placed at I. Then immediately after the lens I placed a prism ABC, by which the trajected light might be refracted either upwards or downwards, and thereby the round image which the lens alone did cast upon the paper at I, might be drawn out into a long one with parallel sides, as represented at pi. This oblong image I let fall upon another at about the same distance from the prism as the image at I, moving the paper either towards the prism or from it, until I found the just distance where the rectilinear sides of the images pi become most distinct. For in this case the circular images of the hole, which compose that image, after the manner that the circles ag, bh, ci, &c. do the figure pi, were terminated most distinctly, and therefore extended into one another the least that they could, and by consequence the mixture of the heterogeneous rays was now the least of all. The circles ag, bh, ci, &c. which compose the image pi, are each equal to the circle at I; and therefore, by diminishing the hole F, or by removing the lens farther from it, may be diminished at pleasure, whilst their centres keep the same distances from each other. Thus, by diminishing the...\nOn the different refrangibility of Light.\n\nThe breadth of the image \\( p \\), the circles of heterogeneous rays that compose it may be separated from each other as much as you please. Yet instead of the circular hole \\( F \\), it is better to substitute an hole shaped like a parallelogram, with its length parallel to the length of the prism. For if this hole be an inch or two long, and but a tenth or twentieth part of an inch broad, or narrower, the light of the image \\( p \\) will be as simple as before, or simpler; and the image being much broader, is therefore fitter to have experiments tried in its light than before.\n\n\"Homogeneous light is refracted regularly without any dilatation, splitting, or fluttering of the rays; and the confused vision of objects seen through refracting bodies by heterogeneous light, arises from the different refrangibility of several sorts of rays. This will appear by the experiments which will follow. In the middle of a black paper I made a round hole about a fifth or a sixth part of an inch in diameter. Upon this part I caused the spectrum of homogeneous light, described in the former article, so to fall that some part of the light might pass through the hole in the paper. This transmitted part of the light, I refracted with a prism placed behind the paper: and letting the refracted light fall perpendicularly upon a white paper, two or three feet distant from the prism, I found that the spectrum formed on the paper by this light was not oblong, as when it is made in the first experiment, by refracting the sun's compound light, but was, so far as I could judge by my eye, perfectly circular, the length being nowhere greater than the breadth, which shows that this light is refracted regularly without any dilatation of the rays, and is an ocular demonstration of the mathematical proposition mentioned above.\n\n\"In the homogeneous light I placed a paper circle of a quarter of an inch in diameter; and in the sun's unrefracted, heterogeneous, white light, I placed another paper circle of the same bigness; and going from these papers to the distance of some feet, I viewed both circles through a prism. The circle illuminated by the sun's heterogeneous light appeared very oblong, as in the second experiment, the length being many times greater than the breadth. But the other circle, illuminated with homogeneous light appeared circular, and distinctly defined, as when it is viewed by the naked eye; which proves the whole proposition mentioned in the beginning of this article.\n\n\"In the homogeneous light I placed flies and such like minute objects, and viewing them through a prism I saw their parts as distinctly defined as if I had viewed them with the naked eye. The same objects placed in the sun's unrefracted heterogeneous light, which was white, I viewed also through a prism, and saw them most confusedly defined, so that I could not distinguish their smaller parts from one another. I placed also the letters of a small print one while in the homogeneous light, and then in the heterogeneous; and viewing them through a prism, they appeared in the latter case so confused and indistinct that I could not read them; but in the former, they appeared so distinct that I could read readily, and thought I saw them as distinct as when I viewed them with my naked eye; in both cases, I viewed the same objects through the same prism, at the same distance from me, and in the same situation. There was no difference but in the lights by which the objects were illuminated, and which in one case was simple, in the other compound; and therefore the distinct vision of the former case, and confused in the latter, could arise from nothing else than from that difference in the light.\n\n\"Which proves the whole proposition.\n\n\"In these three experiments, it is farther very remarkable, that the colour of homogeneous light was never changed by the refraction. And as these colours were not changed by refractions, so neither were they by reflections. For all white, gray, red, yellow, green, blue, violet bodies, as paper, ashes, red lead, orpiment, indigo, rice, gold, silver, copper, glass, blue flowers, violets, bubbles of water tinged with various colours, peacock feathers, the tincture of lignum nephriticum, and such like, in red homogeneous light appeared totally red, in blue light totally blue, in green light totally green, and so of other colours. In the homogeneous light of any colour they all appeared totally of that same colour; with this only difference, that some of them reflected that light more strongly, others more faintly. I never yet found any body which by reflecting homogeneous light could sensibly change its colour.\n\n\"From all which it is manifest, that if the sun's light consisted of but one sort of rays, there would be but one colour in the world, nor would it be possible to produce any new colour by reflections and refractions; and by consequence, that the variety of colours depends upon the composition of light.\n\n\"The solar image \\( p \\), formed by the separated rays in the 6th experiment, did in the progress from its end \\( p \\), on which the most refrangible rays fell, unto its end \\( t \\), on which the least refrangible rays fell, appear tinged with this series of colours; violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, together with all their intermediate degrees in a continual succession perpetually varying; so that there appeared as many degrees of colours as there were sorts of rays differing in refrangibility. And since these colours could not be changed by refractions nor by reflections, it follows, that all homogeneous light has its proper colour answering to its degree of refrangibility.\n\n\"Every homogeneous ray considered apart is refracted, according to one and the same rule; so that its homogeneous fine of incidence is to its fine of refraction in a given ratio: that is, every different coloured ray has a different ratio belonging to it. Our author has determined, by what numbers those given ratios are expressed. For instance, if an heterogeneous white ray of the sun emerges out of glass into air; or, which is the same thing, if rays of all colours be supposed to succeed one another in the same line AC, and AD their common fine of incidence in glass be divided into 50 equal parts, then EF and GH, the fines of refraction into air, of the least and most refrangible rays, will be 77 and 78 such parts respectively. And since every colour has several degrees, the fines of refraction of all the degrees of red will have all intermediate degrees of magnitude from 77 to 77\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\); of all the degrees of orange from 77\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 77\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\); of yellow from 77\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to 77\\(\\frac{5}{4}\\); of green from 77\\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) to 77\\(\\frac{7}{4}\\); of blue from 77\\(\\frac{7}{4}\\) to 77\\(\\frac{9}{4}\\); of indigo from 77\\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) to 77\\(\\frac{11}{4}\\); and of violet from 77\\(\\frac{11}{4}\\) to 78.\"\n\nPlate CCCLXXXIII. Fig. 15.\nPART II. EXPLANATION OF OPTICAL PHENOMENA.\n\nSect. I. Of the Rainbow.\n\nTHE observations of the ancients, and the philosophers of the middle ages, concerning the rainbow, were such as could not have escaped the notice of the most illiterate husbandmen; and their various hypotheses deserve no notice. It is a considerable time, even after the dawn of true philosophy, before we find any discovery of importance on this subject. Maurolycus was the first who pretended to have measured the diameters of the two rainbows with much exactness; and he found that of the inner bow to be $45^\\circ$, and that of the outer bow $56^\\circ$; from which Descartes takes occasion to observe, how little we can depend upon the observations of those who were not acquainted with the cause of the phenomena.\n\nChichtovetus, who died in 1543, had maintained, that the second bow is the image of the first, which he thought was evident from the inverted order of the colours. For, said he, when we look into the water, all the images that we see reflected by it are inverted with respect to the objects themselves; the tops of the trees, for instance, that stand near the brink, appearing lower than the roots.\n\nAs the rainbow was opposite to the sun, it was natural to imagine, that its colours were produced by some kind of reflection of the rays of light from the drops of rain. No person seems to have thought of attributing these colours to refraction, till one Fletcher of Brellaw, in a treatise published in 1571, endeavoured to account for them by means of a double refraction and one reflection. But he imagined that a ray of light, after entering a drop of rain, and suffering a refraction both at its entrance and exit, was afterwards reflected from another drop, before it reaches the eye of the spectator. He seems to have overlooked the reflection at the posterior surface of the drop, or to have imagined that all the bendings of the light within the drop would not make a sufficient curvature to bring the rays of the sun to the eye of the spectator. That he should think of two refractions, was the necessary consequence of his supposing that the ray entered the drop at all. This supposition, therefore, was all that he instituted to explain the phenomena. B. Porta supposed that the rainbow is produced by the refraction of light in the whole body of rain or vapour, but not in the separate drops.\n\nIt is to a man who had no pretensions to philosophy, that we are indebted for the true explanation. This was Antonio De Dominis, bishop of Spalatro, whose treatise *De Radiis Vifus et Lucis*, was published by J. Bartolus in 1611. He first maintained, that the double refraction of Fletcher, with an intervening reflection, was sufficient to produce the colours of the bow, and also to bring the rays that formed them to the eye of the spectator, without any subsequent reflection. He distinctly describes the progress of a ray of light entering the upper part of the drop, where it suffers one refraction, and after being thereby thrown upon the back part of the inner surface, is thence reflected to the lower part of the drop; at which place undergoing a second refraction, it is thereby bent, so as to come directly to the eye. To verify this hypothesis, De Dominis proceeded in a very sensible and philosophical manner. He procured a small globe of solid glass, and viewing it when it was exposed to the rays of the sun, in the same manner in which he had supposed that the drops of rain were situated with respect to them, he actually observed the same colours which he had seen in the true rainbow, and in the same order.\n\nThus the circumstances in which the colours of the rainbow were formed, and the progress of a ray of light through a drop of water, were clearly understood; but philosophers were a long time at a loss when they endeavoured to assign reasons for all the particular colours, and for the order of them. Indeed nothing but the doctrine of the different refrangibility of the rays of light, could furnish a complete solution of this difficulty. De Dominis supposed that the red rays were those which had traversed the least space in the inside of a drop of water, and therefore retained more of their native force, and consequently, striking the eye more briskly, gave it a stronger sensation; that the green and blue colours were produced by those rays, the force of which had been, in some measure, obviated in passing through a greater body of water; and that all the intermediate colours were composed (according to the hypothesis which generally prevailed at that time) of a mixture of these three primary ones. That the different colours were produced by some difference in the impulse of light upon the eye, was an opinion which had been adopted by many persons, who had ventured to depart from the authority of Aristotle.\n\nAfterwards the same De Dominis observed, that all the rays of the same colour must leave the drop of water in a part similarly situated with respect to the eye, in order that each of the colours may appear in a circle, the centre of which is a point of the heavens, in a line drawn from the sun through the eye of the spectator. The red rays, he observed, must issue from the drop nearest to the bottom of it, in order that the circle of red may be the outermost, and the most elevated in the bow.\n\nThough De Dominis conceived to justify the manner in which the inner rainbow is formed, he was far from having as just an idea of the cause of the exterior bow. This he endeavoured to explain in the very same manner as the interior, viz. by one reflection of the light within the drop, preceded and followed by a refraction; supposing only that the rays which formed the exterior bow were returned to the eye by a part of the drop lower than that which transmitted the red of the interior bow. He also supposed that the rays which formed one of the bows came from the upper limb of the sun, and those which formed the other from the lower limb, without considering that the bows ought thus to have been contiguous; or rather, that an indefinite number of bows would have had their colours all intermixed.\n\nWhen Sir Isaac Newton discovered the different refrangibility of the rays of light, he immediately applied the discovery to the phenomena of the rainbow, taking up\nup the subject where De Dominis and Descartes were obliged to leave their investigations imperfect.\n\nLet \\(a\\) be a drop of water, and \\(S\\) a pencil of light; which, on its leaving the drop reaches the eye of the spectator. This ray, at its entrance into the drop, begins to be decomposed into its proper colours; and upon leaving the drop, after one reflection and a second refraction, it is farther decomposed into as many small differently-coloured pencils as there are primitive colours in the light. Three of them only are drawn in this figure, of which the blue is the most, and the red the least, refracted.\n\nThe theory of the different refrangibility of light enables us to assign a reason for the size of a bow of each particular colour. Newton, having found that the fines of refraction of the most refrangible and least refrangible rays, in passing from rain water into air, are in the ratio of 185 to 182, when the fine of incidence is 13\u00b0, computed the size of the bow; and found, that if the sun was only a physical point, the breadth of the inner bow would be 2\u00b0; and if to this 30' were added for the apparent diameter of the sun, the whole breadth would be 2\u00b0 30'. But as the outermost colours, especially the violet, are extremely faint, the breadth of the bow will not appear to exceed two degrees. He found, by the same principles, that the breadth of the exterior bow, if it was everywhere equally vivid, would be 4\u00b0 25'. But in this case there is a greater deduction to be made, on account of the faintness of the light of the exterior bow; so that it will not appear to be more than 3 degrees broad.\n\nThe principal phenomena of the rainbow are explained on Sir Isaac Newton's principles in the following propositions.\n\n**Proposition I.**\n\nWhen the rays of the sun fall upon a drop of rain and enter into it, some of them, after one reflection and two refractions, may come to the eye of a spectator who has his back towards the sun, and his face towards the drop.\n\nIf \\(XY\\) be a drop of rain, and if the sun shine upon it in any lines \\(s f, s d, s a, \\&c.\\) most of the rays will enter into the drop; some of them only will be reflected from the first surface; those rays which are thence reflected do not come under our present consideration, because they are never refracted at all. The greatest part of the rays then enter the drop, and those passing on to the second surface, will most of them be transmitted through the drop. At the second surface, or hinder part of the drop, at \\(p g\\), some few rays will be reflected, whilst the rest are transmitted; those rays proceed in some such lines as \\(n r, n q\\); and coming out of the drop in the lines \\(r v, q t\\), may fall upon the eye of the spectator, who is placed anywhere in those lines, with his face towards the drop, and consequently with his back towards the sun, which is supposed to shine upon the drop in the lines \\(s f, s d, s a, \\&c.\\). These rays are twice refracted and once reflected; they are refracted when they pass out of the air into the drop; they are reflected from the second surface, and are refracted again when they pass out of the drop into the air.\n\n**Definition.** When rays of light reflected from a drop of rain come to the eye, those are called effectual which are able to excite a sensation.\n\n**Proposition II.**\n\nWhen rays of light come out of a drop of rain, they will not be effectual, unless they are parallel and contiguous.\n\nThere are but few rays that can come to the eye at all; for since the greatest part of those rays which enter the drop \\(XY\\) between \\(X\\) and \\(a\\), pass out of the drop through the hinder surface \\(p g\\); only few are thence reflected, and come out through the nearer surface between \\(a\\) and \\(Y\\). Now, such rays as emerge, or come out of the drop, between \\(a\\) and \\(Y\\), will be ineffectual, unless they are parallel to one another, as \\(r v\\) and \\(q t\\) are; because such rays as come out diverging from one another will be so far asunder when they come to the eye, that all of them cannot enter the pupil; and the very few that can enter it will not be sufficient to excite any sensation. But even rays, which are parallel, as \\(r v, q t\\), will not be effectual, unless there are several of them contiguous or very near to one another. The two rays \\(r v\\) and \\(q t\\) alone will not be perceived, though both of them enter the eye; for so very few rays are not sufficient to excite a sensation.\n\n**Proposition III.**\n\nWhen rays of light come out of a drop of rain after one reflection, those will be effectual which are reflected from the same point, and which entered the drop near to one another.\n\nAny rays, as \\(s b\\) and \\(c d\\), when they have passed out of the air into a drop of water, will be refracted towards the perpendiculars \\(b l, d l\\); and as the ray \\(s b\\) falls farther from the axis \\(a v\\) than the ray \\(c d\\), \\(s b\\) will be more refracted than \\(c d\\); so that these rays, though parallel to one another at their incidence, may describe the lines \\(b e\\) and \\(d e\\) after refraction, and be reflected from the same point \\(e\\). Now all rays, which are thus reflected from the same point, when they have described the lines \\(e f, e g\\), and after reflection emerge at \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), will be so refracted, when they pass out of the drop into the air, as to describe the parallel lines \\(f h, g i\\). If these rays were to return from \\(e\\) in the lines \\(b e, d e\\), and were to emerge at \\(b\\) and \\(d\\), they would be refracted into the lines of their incidence \\(b s, d c\\). But if these rays, instead of being returned in the lines \\(e b, e d\\), are reflected from the same point \\(e\\) in the lines \\(e g, e f\\), the lines of reflection \\(e g\\) and \\(e f\\) will be inclined to one another and to the surface of the drop, just as much as the lines \\(e b\\) and \\(e d\\) are. First, \\(e b\\) and \\(e g\\) make the same angle with the surface of the drop; for the angle \\(b e x\\), which \\(e b\\) makes with the surface of the drop, is the complement of incidence, and the angle \\(g e v\\), which \\(e g\\) makes with the surface, is the complement of reflection; and these two are equal to one another. In the same manner it might be shown, that \\(e d\\) and \\(e f\\) make equal angles with the surface of the drop. Secondly, The angle \\(b c d = f e g\\); or the reflected rays \\(e g, e f\\), and the incident rays \\(b e, d e\\), are equally inclined to each other. For the angle of incidence \\(b c d = f e g\\), the angle of reflection, and the angle of incidence \\(d e l = f e l\\), the angle\nOf the angle of reflection; consequently, the difference between the angles of incidence is equal to the difference between the angles of reflection, or \\( b e l = d f l = e f l \\), or \\( b e d = e f \\). Since therefore either the lines \\( e g, ef \\), or the lines \\( eb, ed \\), are equally inclined both to one another and to the surface of the drop; the rays will be refracted in the same manner, whether they return in the lines \\( eb, ed \\), or are reflected in the lines \\( eg, ef \\).\n\nBut if they return in the lines \\( eb, ed \\), the refraction, when they emerge at \\( b \\) and \\( d \\), would make them parallel. Therefore, if they are reflected from one and the same point \\( e \\) in the lines \\( eg, ef \\), the refraction, when they emerge at \\( g \\) and \\( f \\), will likewise make them parallel.\n\nBut though such rays as are reflected from the same point in the hinder part of a drop of rain, are parallel to one another when they emerge, and to have one condition that is requisite towards making them effectual, yet there is another condition necessary; for rays that are effectual, must be contiguous as well as parallel. And though rays, which enter the drop in different places, may be parallel when they emerge, those only will be contiguous which enter nearly at the same place.\n\nLet \\( XY \\) be a drop of rain, \\( ag \\) the axis or diameter of the drop, and \\( sa \\) a ray of light that enters the drop at \\( a \\). This ray \\( sa \\), being perpendicular to both the surfaces, will pass through the drop in the line \\( ag \\) without being refracted; but any collateral rays, such as those that fall about \\( sb \\), will be made to converge to the axis, and passing out at \\( n \\) will meet the axis at \\( h \\). Rays which fall farther from the axis than \\( sb \\), such as those which fall about \\( sc \\), will likewise be made to converge; but their focus will be nearer to the drop than \\( h \\).\n\nSuppose therefore \\( i \\) to be the focus of the rays that fall about \\( sc \\), any ray \\( sc \\), when it has described the line \\( eo \\) within the drop, and is tending to the focus \\( i \\), will pass out of the drop at the point \\( o \\). The rays that fall upon the drop about \\( sd \\), will converge to a focus still nearer than \\( i \\), as at \\( k \\). These rays therefore go out of the drop at \\( p \\). The rays, that fall about \\( se \\), will converge to a focus nearer than \\( k \\), as suppose at \\( l \\); and the ray \\( se \\), when it has described the line \\( eo \\) within the drop, and is tending to \\( l \\), will pass out at the point \\( o \\).\n\nThe rays that fall still more remote from the axis will converge to a focus still nearer. Thus the ray \\( sf \\) will after refraction converge to a focus at \\( m \\), which is nearer than \\( l \\); and having described the line \\( fn \\) within the drop, it will pass out to the point \\( n \\). Now we may here observe, that as any rays \\( sb \\) or \\( sc \\), fall farther above the axis \\( sa \\), the points \\( n \\), or \\( o \\), where they pass out behind the drop, will be farther above \\( g \\); or that, as the incident ray rises from the axis \\( sa \\), the arc \\( gn \\) increases, till we come to some ray \\( sd \\), which passes out of the drop at \\( p \\); and this is the highest point where any ray that falls upon the quadrant or quarter \\( ax \\) can pass out: for any rays \\( se \\), or \\( sf \\), that fall higher than \\( sd \\), will not pass out on any point above \\( p \\), but at the points \\( o \\), or \\( n \\), which are below it. Consequently, though the arc \\( gnop \\) increases, whilst the distance of the incident ray from the axis \\( sa \\) increases, till we come to the ray \\( sd \\); yet afterwards, the higher the ray falls above the axis \\( sa \\), this arc \\( pon \\) will decrease.\n\nWe have hitherto spoken of the points on the posterior part of the drop, where the rays pass out of it; but this was for the sake of determining the points from which those rays are reflected, which do not pass out behind the drop. For, in explaining the rainbow, we have no further reason to consider those rays which go through the drop; since they can never come to the eye of a spectator placed anywhere in the lines \\( rv \\) or \\( qt \\) with his face towards the drop. Now, as there are many rays which pass out of the drop between \\( g \\) and \\( p \\), some rays will be thence reflected; and consequently the several points between \\( g \\) and \\( p \\), which are the points where some of the rays pass out of the drop, are likewise the points of reflection for the rest which do not pass out. Therefore in respect of those rays which are reflected we may call \\( gp \\) the arc of reflection; and may say, that this arc of reflection increases, as the distance of the incident ray from the axis \\( sa \\) increases, till we come to the ray \\( sd \\); the arc of reflection is \\( gn \\) for the ray \\( sb \\), it is \\( go \\) for the ray \\( sc \\), and \\( ep \\) for the ray \\( sd \\).\n\nBut after this, as the distance of the incident ray from the axis \\( sa \\) increases, the arc of reflection decreases; for \\( og \\) less than \\( pg \\) is the arc of reflection for the ray \\( se \\), and \\( ng \\) is the arc of reflection for the ray \\( sf \\).\n\nHence it is obvious, that some ray, which falls above \\( sd \\), may be reflected from the same point with some other ray which falls below \\( sd \\). Thus, for instance, the ray \\( sb \\) will be reflected from the point \\( n \\), and the rays \\( sf \\) will be reflected from the same point; and consequently, when the reflected rays \\( nr, nq \\), are refracted as they pass out of the drop at \\( r \\) and \\( q \\), they will be parallel. But since the intermediate rays, which enter the drop between \\( sf \\) and \\( sb \\), are not reflected from the same point \\( n \\), these two rays alone will be parallel to one another when they come out of the drop, and the intermediate rays will not be parallel to them. And consequently these rays \\( rv, rq \\), though they are parallel after they emerge at \\( r \\) and \\( q \\), will not be contiguous, and for that reason will not be effectual; the ray \\( sd \\) is reflected from \\( p \\), which has been shown to be the limit of the arc of reflection; such rays as fall just above \\( sd \\), and just below \\( sd \\), will be reflected from nearly the same point \\( p \\), as appears from what has been already shown. These rays therefore will be parallel, because they are reflected from the same point \\( p \\); and they will likewise be contiguous, because they all of them enter the drop at the same place very near to \\( d \\). Consequently, such rays as enter the drop at \\( d \\), and are reflected from \\( p \\) the limit of the arc of reflection, will be effectual; hence, when they emerge at the part of the drop between \\( a \\) and \\( y \\), they will be both parallel and contiguous.\n\nIf it can be shown that the rainbow is produced by the rays of the sun which are thus reflected from drops of rain as they fall while the sun shines upon them, this proposition may serve to show us, that this appearance is not produced by any rays that fall upon any part, and are reflected from any part of those drops; since this appearance cannot be produced by any rays but those which are effectual; and effectual rays must always enter each drop at one certain place in the anterior part of it, and must likewise be reflected from one certain place in the posterior surface.\n\n**Prop. IV.**\n\nWhen rays that are effectual emerge from a drop of rain after one reflection and two refractions, those which are most refrangible will...\nat their emersion, make a less angle with the incident rays than those which are least refrangible; and by this means the rays of different colours will be separated from one another.\n\nLet \\( fh \\) and \\( gi \\) be effectual violet rays emerging from the drop at \\( f \\); and \\( fn \\), \\( gp \\), effectual red rays emerging from the same drop at the same place. Now, though all the violet rays are parallel to one another, because they are supposed effectual, and though all the red rays are likewise parallel to one another for the same reason; yet the violet rays will not be parallel to the red rays. These rays, as they have different degrees of refrangibility, will diverge from one another; any violet ray \\( gi \\), which emerges at \\( g \\), will diverge from any red ray \\( gp \\), which emerges at the same place. Now, both the violet ray \\( gi \\), and the red ray \\( gp \\), as they pass out of the drop of water into the air, will be refracted from the perpendicular \\( lo \\). But the violet ray is more refrangible than the red one; and for that reason \\( gi \\), or the refracted violet ray, will make a greater angle with the perpendicular than \\( gp \\), the refracted red ray; or the angle \\( ig \\) will be greater than the angle \\( pg \\).\n\nSuppose the incident ray \\( sb \\) to be continued in the direction \\( sk \\), and the violet ray \\( ig \\) to be continued backwards in the direction \\( ik \\), till it meets the incident ray at \\( k \\). Suppose likewise the red ray \\( pg \\) to be continued backwards in the same manner, till it meets the incident ray at \\( w \\). The angle \\( ik \\) is that which the violet ray, or most refrangible ray at its emersion, makes with the incident ray; and the angle \\( pw \\) is that which the red ray, or least refrangible ray at its emersion, makes with the incident ray. The angle \\( ik \\) is less than the angle \\( pw \\). For, in the triangle, \\( gwk \\), \\( gw \\), or \\( pw \\), is the external angle at the base, and \\( yk \\) or \\( ik \\) is one of the internal opposite angles. (Eucl. B. I. Prop. xvi.) What has been shown to be true of the rays \\( gi \\) and \\( gp \\) might be shown in the same manner of the rays \\( fh \\) and \\( fn \\), or of any other rays that emerge respectively parallel to \\( gi \\) and \\( gp \\). But all the effectual violet rays are parallel to \\( gi \\), and all the effectual red rays are parallel to \\( gp \\). Therefore the effectual violet rays at their emersion make a less angle with the incident ones than the effectual red ones. For the same reason, in all the other sorts of rays, those which are most refrangible, at their emersion from a drop of rain after one reflection, will make a less angle with the incident rays, than those which are least refrangible.\n\nOtherwise: When the rays \\( gi \\) and \\( gp \\) emerge at the same point \\( g \\), as they both come out of water into air, and consequently are refracted from the perpendicular, instead of going straight forwards in the line \\( eg \\) continued, they will both be turned round upon the point \\( g \\) from the perpendicular \\( go \\). Now it is easy to conceive, that either of these lines might be turned in this manner upon the point \\( g \\) as upon a centre, till they became parallel to \\( sb \\) the incident ray. But if either of these lines or rays were refracted so much from \\( go \\) as to become parallel to \\( sb \\), the ray thus refracted, would, after emersion, make no angle with \\( sk \\), because it would be parallel to it. Consequently that ray which is most turned round upon the point \\( g \\), or that ray which is most refrangible, will after emersion be nearest parallel to the incident ray, or will make the least angle with it. The same may be proved of all other rays emerging parallel to \\( gi \\) and \\( gp \\) respectively, or of all effectual rays; those which are most refrangible will after emersion make a less angle with the incident rays, than those do which are least refrangible.\n\nBut since the effectual rays of different colours make different angles with \\( sk \\) at their emersion, they will be separated from one another: so that if the eye were placed in the beam \\( fh \\), it would receive only rays of one colour from the drop \\( agv \\); and if it were placed in the beam \\( fgnp \\), it would receive only rays of some other colour.\n\nThe angle \\( swp \\), which the least refrangible or red rays make with the incident ones when they emerge so as to be effectual, is found by calculation to be \\( 42^\\circ 2' \\). And the angle \\( sk \\), which the most refrangible rays make with the incident ones when they emerge so as to be effectual, is found to be \\( 40^\\circ 17' \\). The rays which have the intermediate degrees of refrangibility, make with the incident ones intermediate angles between \\( 42^\\circ 2' \\), and \\( 40^\\circ 17' \\).\n\n**Prop. V.**\n\nIf a line is supposed to be drawn from the centre of the sun through the eye of the spectator, the angle which any effectual ray, after two refractions and one reflection, makes with the incident ray, will be equal to the angle which it makes with that line.\n\nLet the eye of the spectator be at \\( i \\), and let \\( gt \\) be the line supposed to be drawn from the centre of the sun through the eye of the spectator; the angle \\( git \\), which any effectual ray makes with this line, will be equal to the angle \\( ik \\), which the same ray makes with the incident ray \\( sb \\) or \\( sk \\). If \\( sb \\) is a ray coming from the centre of the sun, then since \\( gt \\) is supposed to be drawn from the same point, these two lines, upon account of the remoteness of the point from whence they are drawn, may be looked upon as parallel to one another. But the right line \\( ki \\) crossing these two parallel lines will make the alternate angles equal. (Eucl. B. I. Prop. xxix.) Therefore \\( ki \\) or \\( git = sk \\).\n\n**Prop. VI.**\n\nWhen the sun shines upon the drops of rain as they are falling, the rays that come from those drops to the eye of a spectator, after one reflection and two refractions, produce the primary rainbow.\n\nIf the sun shines upon the rain as it falls, there are commonly seen two bows, as \\( \\Delta F B \\), \\( CHD \\); or if the bows seen cloud and rain does not reach over that whole side of once. Of these two bows, the innermost \\( \\Delta F B \\) is the more vivid of the two, and this is called the primary bow. The outer part \\( TFY \\) of the primary bow is red, the inner part \\( VEX \\) is violet; the intermediate parts, reckoning from the red to the violet, are orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo. Suppose the spectator's eye to be at \\( O \\), and let \\( LOP \\) be an imaginary line drawn...\ndrawn from the centre of the sun through the eye of the spectator: if a beam of light S coming from the sun fall upon any drop F; and the rays that emerge at F in the line FO, so as to be effectual, make an angle FOP of $42^\\circ$ with the line LP; then these effectual rays make an angle of $42^\\circ$ with the incident rays, by the preceding proposition, and consequently these rays will be red, so that the drop F will appear red. All the other rays, which emerge at F, and would be effectual if they fell upon the eye, are refracted more than the red ones, and consequently pass above the eye. If a beam of light S fall upon the drop E, and the rays that emerge at E in the line EO, so as to be effectual, make an angle of $42^\\circ$ with the line LP; then these effectual rays make likewise an angle of $42^\\circ$ with the incident rays, and the drop E will appear of a violet colour. All the other rays, which emerge at E, and would be effectual if they came to the eye, are refracted less than the violet ones, and therefore pass below the eye. The intermediate drops between F and E will for the same reasons be of the intermediate colours.\n\nThus we have shown why a set of drops from F to E, as they are falling, should appear of the seven primary colours. It is not necessary that the several drops, which produce these colours, should all of them fall at exactly the same distance from the eye. The angle FOP, for example, is the same whether the distance of the drop from the eye is OF, or whether it is in any other part of the line OP something nearer to the eye. And whilst the angle FOP is the same, the angle made by the emerging and incident rays, and consequently the colour of the drop, will be the same. This is equally true of any other drop. So that though in the figure the drops F and E are represented as falling perpendicularly one under the other, yet this is not necessary in order to produce the bow.\n\nBut the coloured line FE, which we have already accounted for, is only the breadth of the bow. It still remains to be shown, why not only the drop F should appear red, but why all the other drops from A to B in the arc ATFYB should appear of the same colour. Now it is evident, that wherever a drop of rain is placed, if the angle which the effectual rays make with the line LP is equal to the angle FOP, that is, if the angle which the effectual rays make with the incident rays is $42^\\circ$, any of those drops will be red, for the same reason that the drop F is of this colour.\n\nIf FOP were to turn round upon the line OP, so that one end of this line should always be at the eye, and the other be at P opposite to the sun; such a motion of this figure would be like that of a pair of compasses turning round upon one of the legs OP with the opening FOP. In this revolution the drop F would describe a circle, P would be the centre, and ATFYB would be an arc in this circle. Now hence, in this motion of the line and drop OF, the angle made by FO with OP, that is the angle FOP, continues the same; if the sun were to shine upon this drop as it revolves, the effectual rays would make the same angle with the incident rays, in whatever part of the arc ATFYB the drop was to be. Therefore, whether the drop be at A, or at T, or at Y, or at B, or wherever else it is in this whole arc, it would appear red, as it does at F.\n\nThe drops of rain, as they fall, are not indeed turned round in this manner: but then, as great numbers of them are falling at once in right lines from the cloud, whilst one drop is at F, there will be others at Y, at T, at B, at A, and in every other part of the arc ATFYB: and all these drops will be red for the same reason that the drop F would have been red, if it had been in the same place. Therefore, when the sun shines upon the rain as it falls, there will be a red arc ATFYB opposite to the sun. In the same manner, because the drop E is violet, we might prove that any other drop, which, whilst it is falling, is in any part of the arc AVEXB, will be violet; and consequently, at the same time that the red arc ATFYB appears, there will likewise be a violet arc AVEXB below or within it. FE is the distance between these two coloured arcs; and from what has been said, it follows, that the intermediate space between these two arcs will be filled up with arcs of the intermediate colours, orange, yellow, blue, green, and indigo. All these coloured arcs together make up the primary rainbow.\n\n**Prop. VII.**\n\nThe primary rainbow is never a greater arc than a semicircle.\n\nSince the line LOP is drawn from the sun through the eye of the spectator, and since P is the centre of the rainbow; it follows, that the centre of the rainbow is always opposite to the sun. The angle FOP is an angle of $42^\\circ$, as was observed, or F the highest part of the bow is $42^\\circ$ from P the centre of it. If the sun is arc of the more than $42^\\circ$ high, P the centre of the rainbow, which is opposite to the sun, will be more than $42^\\circ$ below the horizon; and consequently F the top of the greater bow, which is only $42^\\circ$ from P, will be below the horizon; that is, when the sun is more than $42^\\circ$ high, no primary rainbow will be seen. If the altitude of the sun be something less than $42^\\circ$, then P will be something less than $42^\\circ$ below the horizon; and consequently F, which is only $42^\\circ$ from P, will be just above the horizon; that is, a small part of the bow at this height of the sun will appear close to the ground opposite to the sun. If the sun be $25^\\circ$ high, then P will be $25^\\circ$ below the horizon; and F the top of the bow, being $42^\\circ$ from P, will be $25^\\circ$ above the horizon; therefore, at this height of the sun, the bow will be an arc of a circle whose centre is below the horizon; and consequently that arc of the circle which is above the horizon, or the bow, will be less than a semicircle. If the sun be in the horizon, then P, the centre of the bow, will be in the opposite part of the horizon; F, the top of the bow, will be $42^\\circ$ above the horizon; and the bow itself, because the horizon passes through the centre of it, will be a semicircle. More than a semicircle can never appear; because if the bow were more than a semicircle, P the centre of it must be above the horizon; but P is always opposite to the sun, therefore P cannot be above the horizon, unless the sun is below it; and when the sun is set; or is below the horizon, it cannot shine upon the drops of rain as they fall; and consequently, when the sun is below the horizon, no bow at all can be seen.\n\n**Prop. VIII.**\n\nWhen the rays of the sun fall upon a drop of rain, some of them, after two reflections and two re-\nfractions, may come to the eye of a spectator, who has his back towards the sun and his face towards the drop.\n\nIf HGW is a drop of rain, and parallel rays coming from the sun, as v, y, w, fall upon the lower part of it, they will be refracted towards the perpendiculars v l, w l, as they enter into it, and will describe some such lines as v h, w i. At h and i great part of these rays will pass out of the drop; but some of them will be reflected from thence in the lines h f, i g. At f and g again, great part of the rays that were reflected thither will pass out of the drop. But these rays will not come to the eye of a spectator at o. Here, however, all the rays will not pass out; but some will be reflected from f and g, in some such lines as d f, g h; and these, when they emerge out of the drop of water into the air at b and d, will be refracted from the perpendiculars, and, describing the lines d t, b o, may come to the eye of the spectator who has his back towards the sun and his face towards the drop.\n\nProp. IX.\n\nThose rays, which are parallel to one another after they have been once refracted and once reflected in a drop of rain, will be effectual when they emerge after two refractions and two reflections.\n\nNo rays can be effectual, unless they are contiguous and parallel. It appears from what was said, that when rays come out of a drop of rain contiguous to one another, either after one or after two reflections, they must enter the drop nearly at the same place. And if such rays as are contiguous are also parallel after the first reflection, they will emerge parallel, and therefore will be effectual. Let v v and g w be contiguous rays which come from the sun, and are parallel when they fall upon the lower part of the drop, suppose these rays to be refracted at v and w, and to be reflected at h and i; if they are parallel, as h f, i g, after this first reflection, then, after they are reflected a second time from f and g, and refracted a second time as they emerge at d and b, they will go out of the drop in the parallel lines d t and b o, and will therefore be effectual.\n\nThe rays v v, y w, are refracted towards the perpendiculars v l, w l, when they enter the drop, and will be made to converge. As these rays are very oblique, their focus will not be far from the surface v w. If this focus be at k, the rays, after they have passed the focus, will diverge from thence in the directions h k, i k; and if k i is the principal focal distance of the concave reflecting surface h i, the reflected rays h f, i g, will be parallel. These rays e f, i g, are reflected again from the concave surface f g, and will meet in a focus at e, so that g e will be the principal focal distance of this reflecting surface f g. And because h i and f g are parts of the same sphere, the principal focal distances g e and k i will be equal. When the rays have passed the focus e, they will thence diverge in the line e d, e b; and we are to show, that when they emerge at d and b, and are refracted there, they will become parallel.\n\nNow if the rays v k, w k, when they have met at k, were to be turned back again in the directions k v, k w, and were to emerge at v and w, they would be refracted into the lines of their incidence, v v, w w, and therefore would be parallel. But since g = k, as has already been shown, the rays e d, e b, that diverge from e, fall in the same manner upon the drop at d and b, as the rays k v, k w, would fall upon it at v and w; and e d, e b, are just as much inclined to the refracting surface d b, as k v, k w would be to the surface v w. Hence it follows, that the rays e d, e b, emerging at d and b, will be refracted in the same manner, and will have the same direction in respect of one another, as k v, k w would have. But k v and k w would be parallel after refraction. Therefore the rays e d and e b will emerge in the lines d t, b o, parallel to one another, and consequently effectual.\n\nProp. X.\n\nWhen rays that are effectual emerge from a drop of rain after two reflections and two refractions, those which are most refrangible will at their emergence make a greater angle with the incident rays than those do which are least refrangible; and by this means the rays of different colours will be separated from one another.\n\nIf rays of different colours, which are differently refrangible, emerge at any point b, these rays will not be all of them equally refracted from the perpendicular. Thus, if b o is a red ray, which is of all others the least refrangible, and b m is a violet ray, which is of all others the most refrangible; when these two rays emerge at b, the violet ray will be refracted more from the perpendicular b x than the red ray, and the refracted angle x b m will be greater than the refracted angle x b o. Hence it follows, that these two rays, after emergence, will diverge from one another. In like manner, the rays that emerge at d will diverge from one another; a red ray will emerge in the line d p, a violet ray in the line d t. So that though all the effectual red rays of the beam b d m t are parallel to one another, and all the effectual red rays of the beam b d o p are likewise parallel, yet the violet rays will not be parallel to the red beam. Thus the rays of different colours will be separated from one another.\n\nThis will appear farther, if we consider what the proposition affirms, That any violet or most refrangible ray will make a greater angle with the incident rays, than any red or least refrangible ray makes with the same incident rays. Thus if y w be an incident ray, b m a violet ray emerging from the point b, and b o a red ray emerging from the same point; the angle which the violet ray makes with the incident one is y r m, and that which the red ray makes with it is y s o. Now y r m is greater than y s o. For in the triangle b r s the internal angle b r s is less than b s y the external angle at the base. (Eucl. B. I. Prop. xvi.) But y r m is the complement of b r s or of b r y to two right ones, and y s o is the complement of b s y to two right ones. Therefore, since b r y is less than b s y, the complement of b r y to two right angles will be greater than the complement of b s y to two right angles; or y r m will be greater than y s o.\n\nOtherwise: Both the rays b o and b m, when they are refracted in passing out of the drop at b, are turned round upon the point b from the perpendicular b x. Now either of these lines b o or b m might be turned round.\nround in this manner, till it made a right angle with \\( yw \\). Consequently, that ray which is most turned round upon \\( b \\), or which is most refracted, will make an angle with \\( yw \\), that will be nearer to a right one than that ray makes with it which is least turned round upon \\( b \\), or which is least refracted. Therefore that ray which is most refracted will make a greater angle with the incident ray than that which is least refracted.\n\nBut since the emerging rays, being differently refrangible, make different angles with the same incident ray \\( yw \\), the refraction which they suffer at emergence will separate them from one another.\n\nThe angle \\( yrm \\), which the most refrangible or violet rays make with the incident ones, is found by calculation to be \\( 54^\\circ 7' \\); and the angle \\( yso \\), which the least refrangible or red rays make with the incident ones, is found to be \\( 50^\\circ 57' \\): the angles, which the rays of the intermediate colours, indigo, blue, green, yellow, and orange, make with the incident rays, are intermediate angles between \\( 54^\\circ 7' \\) and \\( 50^\\circ 57' \\).\n\n**Prop. XI.**\n\nIf a line is supposed to be drawn from the centre of the sun through the eye of the spectator; the angle which, after two refractions and two reflections, any effectual ray makes with the incident ray, will be equal to the angle which it makes with that line.\n\nIf \\( yw \\) is an incident ray, \\( bo \\) an effectual ray, and \\( gn \\) a line drawn from the centre of the sun through the eye of the spectator; the angle \\( yso \\), which the effectual ray makes with the incident ray, is equal to \\( son \\) the angle which the same effectual ray makes with the line \\( gn \\). For \\( yw \\) and \\( gn \\), considered as drawn from the centre of the sun, are parallel; \\( bo \\) crosteth them, and consequently makes the alternate angles \\( yso \\), \\( son \\), equal to one another. Eucl. B. I. Prop. xxix.\n\n**Prop. XII.**\n\nWhen the sun shines upon the drops of rain as they are falling, the rays, that come from these drops to the eye of a spectator, after two reflections and two refractions, produce the secondary rainbow.\n\nThe secondary rainbow is the outermost, CHD. When the sun shines upon a drop of rain \\( H \\); and the rays \\( HO \\), which emerge at \\( H \\) so as to be effectual, make an angle \\( HOP \\) of \\( 54^\\circ 7' \\) with \\( LOP \\) a line drawn from the sun through the eye of the spectator; the same effectual rays will make likewise an angle of \\( 54^\\circ 7' \\) with the incident rays \\( S_3 \\), and the rays which emerge at this angle are violet ones, by what was observed above. Therefore, if the spectator's eye is at \\( O \\), none but violet rays will enter it: for as all the other rays make a less angle with \\( OP \\), they will fall above the spectator's eye.\n\nIn like manner, if the effectual rays that emerge from the drop \\( G \\) make an angle of \\( 50^\\circ 57' \\) with the line \\( OP \\), they will likewise make the same angle with the incident rays \\( S_3 \\); and consequently, from the drop \\( G \\) no rays will come to the spectator's eye at \\( O \\) but red ones; for all the other rays making a greater angle with the line \\( OP \\), will fall below the eye at \\( O \\). For the same reason, the rays emerging from the intermediate drops between \\( H \\) and \\( G \\), and coming to the spectator's eye at \\( O \\), will emerge at intermediate angles, and therefore will have the intermediate colours. Thus if there are seven drops from \\( H \\) to \\( G \\) inclusive, their colours will be violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. This coloured line is the breadth of the secondary rainbow.\n\nNow, if \\( HOP \\) were to turn round upon the line \\( OP \\), like a pair of compasses upon one of the legs \\( OP \\) with the opening \\( HOP \\), it is plain from the supposition, that, in such a revolution of the drop \\( H \\), the angle \\( HOP \\) would be the same, and consequently the emerging rays would make the same angle with the incident ones. But in such a revolution the drop would describe a circle of which \\( P \\) would be the centre, and \\( CNHRD \\) an arc. Consequently, since, when the drop is at \\( N \\), or at \\( R \\), or anywhere else in that arc, the emerging rays make the same angle with the incident ones as when the drop is at \\( H \\), the colour of the drop will be the same to an eye placed at \\( O \\), whether the drop is at \\( N \\), or at \\( H \\), or at \\( R \\), or anywhere else in that arc. Now, though the drop does not thus turn round as it falls, and does not pass through the several parts of this arc, yet, since there are drops of rain falling everywhere at the same time, when one drop is at \\( H \\), there will be another at \\( R \\), another at \\( N \\), and others in all parts of the arc; and these drops will all be violet-coloured, for the same reason that the drop \\( H \\) would have been of this colour if it had been in any of those places. In like manner, as the drop \\( G \\) is red when it is at \\( G \\), it would likewise be red in any part of the arc \\( CWGQD \\); and so will any other drop when, as it is falling, it comes to any part of that arc. Thus as the sun shines upon the rain, whilst it falls, there will be two arcs produced, a violet-coloured arc \\( CNHRD \\), and a red one \\( CWGQD \\); and for the same reasons the intermediate space between these two arcs will be filled up with arcs of the intermediate colours. All these arcs together make up the secondary rainbow.\n\n**Prop. XIII.**\n\nThe colours of the secondary rainbow are fainter than those of the primary rainbow; and are arranged in the contrary order.\n\nThe primary rainbow is produced by such rays as have been only once reflected; the secondary rainbow colours of is produced by such rays as have been twice reflected, the secondary rainbow are. But at every reflection some rays pass out of the drop of rain without being reflected; so that the fewer the rays are reflected, the fewer of them are left. Therefore, while of the colours of the secondary bow are produced by primary, fewer rays, and consequently will be fainter, than the arrangement of the primary bow.\n\nIn the primary bow, reckoning from the outside of it, the colours are arranged in this order; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. In the secondary bow, reckoning from the outside, the colours are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. So that the red, which is the outermost or highest colour in the primary bow, is the innermost or lowest colour in the secondary one.\n\nNow the violet rays, when they emerge so as to be...\nConcavity effectual after one reflection, make a less angle with the Sky, the incident rays than the red ones; consequently the violet rays make a less angle with the lines OP than the red ones. But, in the primary rainbow, the rays are only once reflected, and the angle which the effectual rays make with OP is the distance of the coloured drop from P the centre of the bow. Therefore the violet drops, or violet arc, in the primary bow, will be nearer to the centre of the bow than the red drops or red arc; that is, the innermost colour in the primary bow will be violet, and the outermost colour will be red. And, for the same reason, through the whole primary bow, every colour will be nearer the centre P, as the rays of that colour are more refrangible.\n\nBut the violet rays, when they emerge so as to be effectual after two reflections, make a greater angle with the incident rays than the red ones; consequently the violet rays will make a greater angle with the line OP, than the red ones. But in the secondary rainbow the rays are twice reflected, and the angle which the effectual rays make with OP is the distance of the coloured drop from P the centre of the bow. Therefore the violet drops or violet arc in the secondary bow will be farther from the centre of the bow, than the red drops or red arc; that is, the outermost colour in the secondary bow will be violet, and the innermost colour will be red. And, for the same reason, through the whole secondary bow, every colour will be farther from the centre P, as the rays of that colour are more refrangible.\n\nSect. II. Of Coronas, Parhelia, &c.\n\nUnder the articles Corona and Parhelion, a pretty full account is given of the different hypotheses concerning these phenomena, and likewise of the method by which these hypotheses are supported, from the known laws of refraction and reflection. To these articles therefore, in order to avoid repetition, we must refer.\n\nSect. III. Of the Concave Figure of the Sky.\n\nThe apparent concavity of the sky is only an optical deception founded on the incapacity of our organs of vision to take in very large distances. Dr Smith has demonstrated, that, if the surface of the earth were perfectly plane, the distance of the visible horizon from the eye would scarcely exceed the distance of 5000 times the height of the eye above the ground: beyond this distance, all objects would appear in the visible horizon. For, let OP be the height of the eye above the line PA drawn upon the ground; and if an object AB = PO, be removed to a distance PA equal to 5000 times that height, it will hardly be visible by reason of the smallness of the angle AOB. Consequently any distance AC, however great, beyond A, will be invisible. For since AC and BO are parallel, the ray CO will always cut AB in some point D between A and B; and therefore the angle AOC, or AOD, will always be less than AOB, and therefore AD or AC will be invisible. Consequently all objects and clouds, as CE and FG, placed at all distances beyond A, if they be high enough to be visible, or to subtend a bigger angle at the eye than AOB, will appear at the horizon AB; because the distance AC is invisible.\n\nHence, if we suppose a long row of objects, or a long wall ABZY, built upon this plane, and its perpendicular distance OA from the eye at O to be equal to or greater than the distance Oa of the visible horizon, it will not appear straight, but circular, as if it were built upon the circumference of the horizon a e g y: and if the wall be continued to an immense distance, its extreme parts YZ will appear in the horizon at yz, where it is cut by a line Oy parallel to the wall. For, supposing a ray YO, the angle YOy will become infinitely small. Imagine this infinite plane OAYy, with the wall upon it, to be turned about the horizontal line O like the lid of a box, till it becomes perpendicular to the other half of the horizontal plane LMy, and the wall parallel to it, like a vast ceiling overhead; and then the wall will appear like the concave figure of the clouds overhead. But though the wall in the horizon appear in the figure of a semicircle, yet the ceiling will not, but much flatter. Because the horizontal plane was a visible surface, which suggested the idea of the same distances quite round the eye: but in the vertical plane extended between the eye and the ceiling, there is nothing that affects the sense with an idea of its parts but the common line Oy; consequently the apparent distances of the higher parts of the ceiling will be gradually diminished in ascending from that line.\n\nNow when the sky is overcast with clouds of equal gravities, they will all float in the air at equal heights above the earth, and consequently will compose a surface resembling a large ceiling, as flat as the visible surface of the earth. Its concavity therefore is only apparent: and when the heights of the clouds are unequal, since their real shapes and magnitudes are all unknown, the eye can seldom distinguish the unequal distances of those clouds that appear in the same directions, unless when they are very near us, or are driven by contrary currents of the air. So that the visible shape of the whole surface remains alike in both cases. And when the sky is either partly overcast or partly free from clouds, it is matter of fact that we retain much the same idea of its concavity as when it was quite overcast.\n\nThe concavity of the heavens appears to the eye, why which is the only judge of an apparent figure, to be a concavity less portion of a spherical surface than a hemisphere. Dr Smith says, that the centre of the concavity is appears less than a hemisphere. Several observations, he found the apparent distance of its parts at the horizon to be generally between three and four times greater than the apparent distance of its parts overhead. For let the arch ABCD represent the apparent concavity of the sky, O the place of the eye, OA and OC the horizontal and vertical apparent distances, whose proportion is required. First observe when the sun or the moon, or any cloud or star, is in such a situation at B, that the apparent arches BA, BC, extended on each side of this object towards the horizon and zenith, seem equal to the eye; then taking the altitude of the object B with a quadrant, or a cross staff, or finding it by astronomy from the given time of observation, the angle AOB is known. Drawing therefore the line OB in the position thus determined, and taking in it any point B1 in the vertical line CO produced downwards, find the centre E of a circle ABC, whose arches BA, EC, intercepted between B and the legs of the right angle AOC, shall be equal to each other; then will this arch ABCD represent...\nBlue colour present the apparent figure of the sky. For by the eye of the sky we estimate the distance between any two objects in the heavens by the quantity of sky that appears to lie between them; as upon each we estimate it by the quantity of ground that lies between them. The centre E may be found geometrically by constructing a cubic equation, or as quickly and sufficiently exact by trying whether the chords BA, BC, of the arch ABC drawn by conjecture are equal, and by altering its radius BE till they are so. Now in making several observations upon the sun, and some others upon the moon and stars, they seemed to our author to bisect the vertical arch ABC at B, when their apparent altitudes or the angle AOB was about 23 degrees; which gives the proportion of OC to OA as 3 to 10 or as 1 to 3\u00bd nearly. When the altitude of the sun was 30\u00b0, the upper arch seemed always less than the under one; and, in our author's opinion, always greater when the sun was about 18 or 20 degrees high.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Blue Colour of the Sky, and of Blue and Green Shadows.\n\nThe opinions of ancient writers concerning the colour of the sky merit no notice. The first who gave any rational explanation was Fromondus. He supposed that the blueness of the sky proceeded from a mixture of the white light of the sun with the black space beyond the atmosphere, where there is neither refraction nor reflection. This opinion very generally prevailed, and was maintained by Otto Guerick and all his contemporaries, who asserted, that white and black may be mixed in such a manner as to make a blue. M. Bouguer had recourse to the vapours diffused through the atmosphere, to account for the reflection of the blue rays rather than any other. He seems however to suppose, that it arises from the constitution of the air itself, from which the fainter-coloured rays are incapable of making their way through any considerable tract of it. Hence he is of opinion, that the colour of the air is properly blue; to which opinion Dr Smith seems also to have inclined.\n\nTo this blue colour of the sky is owing the appearance of blue and green shadows in the mornings and evenings.\u2014These were first observed by M. Buffon in 1742, when he noticed that the shadows of trees which fell upon a white wall were green. He was at that time standing upon an eminence, and the sun was setting in the cleft of a mountain, so that he appeared considerably lower than the horizon. The sky was clear, excepting in the west, which, though free from clouds, was lightly shaded with vapours, of a yellow colour, inclining to red. Then the sun itself was exceedingly red, and was apparently at least four times as large as he appears to be at mid-day. In these circumstances he saw very distinctly the shadows of the trees, which were 30 or 40 feet from the white wall, coloured with a light green inclining to blue. The shadow of an arbour which was three feet from the wall, was exactly drawn upon it, and looked as if it had been newly painted with verdigris. This appearance lasted near five minutes; after which it grew fainter, and vanished at the same time with the light of the sun.\n\nThe next morning at sunrise, he went to observe by him other shadows, upon another white wall; but instead of finding them green as before, he observed that they were of the colour of lively indigo. The sky was serene, except a slight covering of yellowish vapours in the east; and the sun rose behind a hill, so that it was elevated above his horizon. In these circumstances, the blue shadows were only visible three minutes; after which they appeared black, and in the evening of the same day he observed the green shadows exactly as before. On another day at sunset he observed, that the shadows were not green, but of a beautiful sky-blue. He also observed, that the sky was in a great measure free from vapours at that time, and that the sun set behind a rock, so that it disappeared before it came to his horizon. Afterwards he often observed the shadows both at sunrise and sunset; but always perceived them to be blue, though with a great variety of shades.\n\nThe first person who attempted to explain this phenomenon was the Abb\u00e9 Mazeas. He observed, that when an opaque body was illuminated by the moon and a candle at the same time, and the two shadows were cast upon the same white wall, that which was enlightened by the candle was reddish, and that which was enlightened by the moon was blue. He supposed, however, the change of colour to be occasioned by the diminution of the light; but M. Melville, and M. Bouguer, both independent of one another, seem to have hit upon the true cause of this curious appearance, and which has been already hinted at. The former of these gentlemen, in his attempts to explain the blue colour of the planetarium, observes, that since it is certain that no body assumes any particular colour, but because it reflects one sort of rays more abundantly than the rest; and since it cannot be supposed that the constituent parts of pure air are gross enough to separate any colours of themselves; we must conclude with Sir Isaac Newton, that the violet and blue making rays are reflected more copiously than the rest, by the finer vapours diffused through the atmosphere, whose parts are not big enough to give them the appearance of visible opaque clouds. And he shows that in proper circumstances, the bluish colour of the sky light may be actually seen on bodies illuminated by it, as, he says, it is objected should always happen upon this hypothesis. For that if, on a cloudless day, a sheet of white paper be exposed to the sun's beams, when any opaque body is placed upon it, the shadow which is illuminated by the sky only will appear remarkably bluish compared with the rest of the paper, which receives the sun's direct rays.\n\nM. Bouguer, who has taken the most pains with this subject, observes, that as M. Buffon mentions the shadows appearing green only twice, and that at all other times they were blue, this is the colour which they regularly have, and that the blue was changed into green by some accidental circumstance. Green, he says, is only a composition of blue and yellow, so that this accidental change may have arisen from the mixture of some yellow rays in the blue shadow; and that perhaps the walls might have had that tinge, so that the blue is the only colour for which a general reason is required. This, he says, must be derived from the colour of pure air, which always appears blue, and which always reflects that colour upon all objects without diffusion; but which is too faint to be perceived when our eyes are strongly affected by the light of the sun, reflected from other objects around us.\nTo confirm this hypothesis, he adds some interesting observations of his own, in which this appearance is agreeably diversified. Being at the village of Boucholtz in July 1764, he observed the shadows projected on the white paper of his pocket-book when the sky was clear. At half an hour past six in the evening, when the sun was about 4\u00b0 high, he observed that the shadow of his finger was of a dark gray, while he held the paper opposite to the sun; but when he inclined it almost horizontally, the paper had a bluish cast, and the shadow upon it was of a beautiful bright blue.\n\nWhen his eye was placed between the sun and the paper laid horizontally, it always appeared of a bluish cast; but when he held the paper thus inclined between his eye and the sun, he could distinguish, upon every little eminence occasioned by the inequality of the surface of the paper, the chief prismatic colours. This multitude of coloured points, red, yellow, green, and blue, almost effaced the natural colour of the objects.\n\nAt 6h 45' the shadows began to be blue, even when the rays of the sun fell perpendicularly. The colour was the most lively when the rays fell upon it at an angle of 45\u00b0; but with a less inclination of the paper, he could distinctly perceive, that the blue shadow had a border of a stronger blue on that side which looked towards the sky, and a red border on that side which was turned towards the earth. To see these borders, it was necessary to place the body that made the shadow very near the paper; and the nearer it was, the more sensible was the red border. At the distance of three inches, the whole shadow was blue. At every observation, after having held the paper towards the sky, he turned it towards the earth, which was covered with verdure; holding it in such a manner, that the sun might shine upon it while it received the shadows of various bodies; but in this position he could never perceive the shadow to be blue or green at any inclination with respect to the sun's rays.\n\nAt seven o'clock, the altitude of the sun being still about two degrees, the shadows were of a bright blue, even when the rays fell perpendicularly upon the paper, but were brightest when it was inclined 45\u00b0. At this time he was surprised to observe, that a large tract of sky was not favourable to the production of this blue colour, and that the shadow falling upon the paper placed horizontally was not coloured, or at least the blue was very faint. This singularity, he concluded, arose from the small difference between the light of that part of the paper which received the rays of the sun and that which was in the shade in this situation. In a situation precisely horizontal, the difference would vanish, and there could be no shadow. Thus too much or too little of the sun's light produced, but for different reasons, the same effect; for they both made the blue light reflected from the sky become insensible. This gentleman never saw any green shadows; but supposes that the cause of those seen by Buffon might be the mixture of yellow rays, reflected from the vapours, which he observes were of that colour.\n\nThese blue shadows, our author observes, are not confined to the times of the sunrise and sunsetting; on the 10th of July, when the sun has the greatest force, he observed them at three o'clock in the afternoon, but the sun at that time shone through a mist.\n\nIf the sky be clear the shadows begin to be blue, when, if they be projected horizontally, they are eight times as long as the height of the body that produces them, that is, when the altitude of the sun's centre is 7\u00b0 8'. This observation, he says, was made in the beginning of August.\n\nBesides these coloured shadows, which are produced by the interception of the direct rays of the sun, our author observed others similar to them at every hour of the day, in rooms into which the light of the sun was reflected from some white body, if any part of the clear sky could be seen from the place, and all unnecessary light was excluded as much as possible. He remarks, that the blue shadows may be seen at any hour of the day, even with the direct light of the sun; and that this colour will disappear in all those places of the shadow from which the blue sky cannot be seen.\n\nAll the observations that our author made upon the yellow or reddish borders of shadows above mentioned, led him to conclude, that they were occasioned by the interception of the sky light, whereby part of the shadow was illuminated either by the red rays reflected from the clouds, when the sun is near the horizon, or from some terrestrial bodies in the neighbourhood. This conjecture is favoured by the necessity he was under of placing any body near the paper, in order to produce this bordered shadow, as he says it is easily demonstrated, that the interception of the sky light can only take place when the breadth of the opaque body is to its distance from the white ground on which the shadow falls, as twice the fine of half the amplitude of the sky to its cosine.\n\nAt the conclusion of his observations on these blue shadows, he gives a short account of another kind of them, which he supposes to have the same origin. These shadows, he often saw early in the spring when reading by the light of a candle in the morning, and consequently with the twilight mixed with that of his candle. In these circumstances, the shadow made by intercepting the light of his candle, at the distance of about five feet, was of a beautiful and clear blue, which became deeper as the opaque body which made the shadow was brought nearer to the wall, and was exceedingly deep at the distance of a few inches only. But where the day light did not come, the shadows were all black without the least mixture of blue.\n\nThe explanations of the blue colour of the sky given by Newton and Bouguer are far from satisfactory, and we presume that the following method of accounting for that phenomenon affords the true explanation. The light which flows from any portion of the blue sky is obviously reflected light, which is thrown out into the atmosphere in all directions by the earth, and the clouds and vapours which surround it. The red or least refrangible rays of this light having a greater momentum than the blue or most refrangible rays, penetrate much farther into the atmosphere, and though a few may be reflected, yet almost all of them will be absorbed or lost before they can return to the earth's surface. On the contrary, the blue rays, having less momentum, are not capable of penetrating so far into a reflecting medium, and are therefore reflected to the earth's surface, and give a blue colour to the expanse of the heavens. The blue colour of the sky is exactly the converse of the red colour which is perceived at great depths in the sea, and of the red hue of the morning and evening clouds. These phenomena\nIrradiations being produced by transmitted or refracted light; the red rays make their way through the medium to the observer's eye, while the blue ones are reflected or absorbed.\n\nSect. V. Of the Irradiations of the Sun's Light appearing through the interstices of the Clouds.\n\nThis is an appearance which every one must have observed when the sky was pretty much overcast, and the clouds have many breaks or openings. At that time several large beams of light, something like the appearance of the light of the sun admitted into a smoky room, will be seen generally with a very considerable degree of divergence, as if the radiant point was situated at no great distance above the clouds. Dr Smith observes that this appearance is one of those which serve to demonstrate that very high and remote objects in the heavens do not appear to us in their real shapes and positions, but according to their perspective projections in the apparent concavity of the sky. He acquaints us, that though these beams are generally seen diverging, as represented in fig. 11, it is not always the case. He himself, in particular, once saw them converging towards a point diametrically opposite to the sun; for, as near as he could conjecture, the point to which they converged was situated as much below the horizon as the sun was then elevated above the opposite part of it. This part is represented by the line \\( D_1 \\), and the point below it in opposition to the sun is \\( E \\); towards which all the beams \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots \\) appeared to converge.\n\nPerceiving that the point of convergence was opposite to the sun, he suspected that this unusual phenomenon was but a case of the usual apparent divergence of the beams of the sun from his apparent place among the clouds, as represented in fig. 11; for though nothing is more common than for rays to diverge from a luminous body, yet the divergence of these beams in such large angles is not real, but apparent. Because it is impossible for the direct rays of the sun to cross one another at any point of the apparent concavity of the sky, in a greater angle than about half a degree. For the diameter of the earth being so very small, in comparison to the distance of the sun, as to subtend an angle at any point of its body of about 20 seconds; and the diameter of our visible horizon being extremely smaller than that of the earth; it is evident, that all the rays which fall upon the horizon from any given point of the sun, must be inclined to each other in the smallest angles imaginable: the greatest of them being as much smaller than that angle of 20\" as the diameter of the visible horizon is smaller than that of the earth. All the rays that come to us from any given point of the sun may therefore be considered as parallel; as the rays \\( eB_1g \\) from the point \\( e \\), or \\( fB_2h \\) from the opposite point \\( f \\); and consequently the rays of these two pencils that come from opposite points of the sun's real diameter, and cross each other in the sun's apparent place \\( B \\) among the clouds, can form no greater an angle with each other than about half a degree; this angle of their intersection \\( eB_1f \\) being the same as the sun would subtend to an eye placed among the clouds at \\( B_1 \\), or (which is much the same) to an eye at \\( O \\) upon the ground. Because the sun's real distance \\( OS \\) is inconceivably greater than his apparent distance \\( OB \\). Therefore the rays of the sun, as \\( B_1g, B_2h \\), do really diverge from his apparent place \\( B \\) in no greater angles \\( gB_1h \\) than about half a degree. Nevertheless they appear to diverge from the place \\( B \\) in all possible angles, and even in opposite directions. Let us proceed then to an explanation of this apparent divergence, which is by no means self-evident; though at first sight we are apt to think it is, by not distinguishing the vast difference between the true and apparent distances of the sun.\n\nSupposing all the rays of the sun to fall accurately parallel to each other upon the visible horizon, as they do very nearly, yet in both cases they must appear to diverge in all possible angles. Let us imagine the heavens to be partly overcast with a spacious stratum of broken clouds, \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots \\), parallel to the plane of the visible horizon, represented by the line \\( AOD \\); and when the sun's rays fall upon these clouds in the parallel lines \\( s v_1, s v_2, \\ldots \\), let some of them pass through their interstices in the lines \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\), and fall upon the plane of the horizon at the places \\( t_1, t_2, \\ldots \\). And since the rest of the incident rays \\( s v_1, s v_2, \\ldots \\) are supposed to be intercepted from the place of the spectator at \\( O \\) by the cloud \\( x \\), and from the intervals between the transmitted rays \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\) by the clouds \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots \\), a small part of these latter rays \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\), when reflected every way from some certain kind of thin vapours floating in the air, may undoubtedly be sufficient to affect the eye with an appearance of lights and shades, in the form of bright beams in the places \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\), and of dark ones in the intervals between them; just as similar beams of light and shade appear in a room by reflections of the sun's rays from smoke or dust flying within it; the lights and shades being here occasioned by the transmission of the rays through some parts of the window, and by their interruption at other parts.\n\nNow, if the apparent concavity of this stratum of clouds \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots \\) to the eye at \\( O \\), be represented by the arch \\( ABCD \\), and be cut in the point \\( B \\) by the line \\( OBx \\) parallel to the beams \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\); it will be evident by the rules of perspective, that these long beams will not appear in their real places, but upon the concave \\( AB CD \\) diverging every way from the place \\( B \\), where the sun himself appears, or the cloud \\( x \\) that covers his body, as represented separately in full view in fig. 11.\n\nAnd for the same reason, if the line \\( BO \\) be produced towards \\( E \\), below the plane of the horizon \\( AOD \\), and the eye be directed towards the region of the sky directly above \\( E \\), the lower ends of the same real beams \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\), will now appear upon the part \\( DF \\) of this concave; and will seem to converge towards the point \\( E_1 \\), situated just as much below the horizon as the opposite point \\( B \\) is above it: which is separately represented in full view in fig. 12.\n\nFor if the beams \\( v_1t, v_2t, \\ldots \\) be supposed to be visible throughout their whole lengths, and the eye be directed in a plane perpendicular to them, here represented by the line \\( OF \\); they and their intervals will appear broadest in and about this plane, because these parts of them are the nearest to the eye; and therefore their remoter parts and intervals will appear gradually narrower towards the opposite ends of the line \\( EE' \\). As a farther illustration of this subject, we may conceive the spectator at \\( O \\) to be situated upon the top of a large descent \\( OH \\) towards a remote valley \\( IK \\), and the sun to be so very low, that the point \\( E_1 \\), opposite to him, may be seen above the horizon of this shady vale.\nIn this case it is manifest, that the spectators at O\nof the Sun's would now see these beams converging so far as to meet\neach other at the point E in the sky itself.\n\nThis phenomenon is not seen in moonlight, probably\nbecause her light is too weak after reflections from any\nkind of vapours, to cause a sensible appearance of lights\nand shades so as to form these beams. And in the\nphenomenon of fig. 12, the converging sunbeams towards\nthe point below the horizon were not quite so bright\nand strong as those usually are that diverge from him;\nand the sky beyond them appeared very black (several\nflowers having passed that way), which certainly\ncontributed to this appearance. Hence it is probable\nthat the thinness and weakness of the reflected rays\nfrom the vapours opposite the sun, is the chief cause\nthat this appearance is so very uncommon in com-\nparison to that of diverging beams. For as the re-\ngion of the sky round about the sun is always brighter\nthan the opposite one, so the light of the diverging\nbeams ought also to be brighter than that of the con-\nverging ones. For, though rays are reflected from\nrough unpolished bodies in all directions, yet more of\nthem are reflected forwards obliquely, than are reflected\nmore directly backwards. Besides, in the present case,\nthe incident rays upon the opposite region to the sun,\nare more diminished by continual reflections from a\nlonger tract of the atmosphere, than the incident rays\nupon the region next the sun.\n\nThe common phenomenon of diverging beams is\nmore frequent in summer than in winter, and also when\nthe sun is lower than when higher up; probably because\nthe lower vapours are denser, and therefore more strongly\nreflective than the higher; because the lower sky\nlight is not so bright as the upper; because the air is\ngenerally more quiet in the mornings and evenings than\nabout noon-day; and lastly, because many sorts of va-\npours are more plentifully exhaled in summer than in\nwinter, from many kinds of volatile vegetables; which\nvapours, when the air is cooled and condensed in the\nmornings and evenings, may become dense enough to\nreflect a sensible light.\n\nSect. VI. Of the Illumination of the Earth's Shadow\nin Lunar Eclipses.\n\nThe ancient philosophers, who knew nothing of the\nrefractive power of the atmosphere, were much perplexed\nto account for the body of the moon being visible\nwhen totally eclipsed. At such times she generally ap-\npears of a dull red colour, like tarnished copper. This,\nthey thought, was the moon's native light, by which she\nbecame visible when hid from the brighter light of the\nsun. Plutarch, indeed, attributes this appearance to the\nlight of the fixed stars reflected to us by the moon; but\nthis is too weak to produce the effect. The true cause\nof it is the scattered beams of the sun bent into the\nearth's shadow by refractions through the atmosphere in\nthe following manner.\n\nLet the body of the sun be represented by the circle\nab, and that of the earth by cd; and let the lines ace\nand bde touch them both, and meet in e beyond the\nearth; then the angular space ced will represent the\nconical figure of the earth's shadow, which would be to-\ntally dark, were none of them bent into it by the re-\nfraction of the atmosphere. The rays ah and bi,\nwhich touch its opposite sides, will proceed unrefracted,\nand meet each other at k. Then the two nearest rays illumi-\nnating to these that flow within them, from the same points a\nand b, being refracted inwards through the margin of shadow of\nthe atmosphere, will cross each other at a point l, some-\nwhat nearer to the earth than k; and in like manner,\ntwo opposite rays next within the two last will cross\neach other at a point m, somewhat nearer to the earth\nthan l, having suffered greater refractions, by passing\nthrough longer and denser tracts of air lying somewhat\nnearer to the earth. The like approach of the succes-\nsive intersections k, l, m, is to be understood of innumer-\nable couples of rays, till you come to the intersection n\nof the two innermost; which we may suppose just to\ntouch the earth at the points o and p. It is plain then,\nthat the space bounded by these rays on, np, will be\nthe only part of the earth's shadow wholly unenlightened.\nLet fmg be part of the moon's orbit when it is\nnearest the earth, at a time when the earth's dark shadow\non p, is longest; in this case, the ratio of fm to tn is about\n4 to 3; and consequently the moon, though centrally\neclipsed at m, may yet be visible by means of the scattered\nrays, first transmitted to the moon by refraction through\nthe atmosphere, and thence reflected to the earth.\n\nFor let ab incident and emergent parts ag, rn, of Fig. 2.\nthe ray ag or rn, that just touches the earth at o, be\nproduced till they meet at u, and let ag produced\nmeet the axis st produced in x; and joining u and\num, hence the refractions of a horizontal ray passing\nfrom o to r, or from o to q, would be alike and equal,\nthe external angle nu x is double the quantity of the\nusual refraction of a horizontal ray; and the angle a u s\nis the apparent measure of the sun's semidiameter seen\nfrom the earth; and the angle u s t is that of the earth's\nsemidiameter tu seen from the sun (called his horizontal\nparallax); and lastly, the angle u m t is that of the\nearth's semidiameter seen from the moon (called her hori-\nzontal parallax); because the elevation of the point\nu above the earth is too small to make a sensible error\nin the quantity of these angles; whose measures by\nastronomical tables are as follow;\n\nSun's least app. semidiam. = a u s = 15\u00b0-50'\nSun's horizontal parallax = u s t = 80\u00b0-10'\nTheir difference * is = t x u = 15\u00b0-40' * Eucl. I.\nTwice horizontal refraction = n u x = 67\u00b0-30' Prop. xxxii.\nTheir sum \u2020 is = t n u = 83\u00b0-10'\nMoon's greatest horiz. parallax = t m u = 62\u00b0-10' \u2020 ibid.\n\nTherefore (by a preceding prop.) we have t m : n u =\n(ang. t n u : ang. t m u = 83\u00b0-10' : 62\u00b0-10') = 3 : 2\nin round numbers; which was to be proved. It is\neasy to collect from the moon's greatest horizontal pa-\nrallax of 62\u00b0-10', that her least distance tm is about\n55\u00bd semidiameters of the earth; and therefore the\ngreatest length tn of the dark shadow, being three\nquarters of tm, is about 41\u00bd semidiameters.\n\nThe difference of the last-mentioned angles t n u,\nt m u is mun = 21', that is, about two thirds of 31\u00b0-\n40', the angle which the whole diameter of the sun\nsubtends at u. Whence it follows, that the middle\npoint m of the moon centrally eclipsed, is illuminated\nby rays which come from two-thirds of every diameter\nof the sun's disk, and pass by one side of the earth; and\nalso by rays that come from the opposite two-thirds of\nPart II.\n\nIllumination of the Shadow of the Earth.\n\nEvery one of the said diameters, and pass by the other side of the earth. This will appear by conceiving the ray \\( q \\) to be inflexible, and its middle point \\( a \\) to slide upon the earth, while the part \\( r n \\) is approaching to touch the point \\( m \\); for then the opposite part \\( q a \\) will trace over two thirds of the sun's diameter. The true proportion of the angles \\( n u m, a u s \\), could not be preserved in the scheme, by reason of the sun's immense distance and magnitude with respect to the earth.\n\nHaving drawn the line \\( a t a \\), it may be observed, that all the incident rays, as \\( a q, a z \\), flowing from any one point of the sun to the circumference of the earth, will be collected to a focus \\( a \\), whose distance \\( t a \\) is less than \\( t m \\) in the ratio of 62 to 67 nearly; and thus an image of the sun will be formed at \\( a \\), whose rays will diverge upon the moon. For the angle \\( t a u \\) is the difference of the angles \\( x u a, u a t \\) found above; and \\( t a : t m = \\text{ang. } t m u : \\text{ang. } t a u = 62' - 10'' : 67' - 30'' \\).\n\nThe rays that flow next above \\( a q \\) and \\( a z \\), by passing through a rarer part of the atmosphere, will be united at a point in the axis \\( t a \\) farther from the earth than the last focus \\( a \\); and the same may be said of the rays that pass next above these, and so on; whereby an infinite series of images of the sun will be formed, whose diameters and degrees of brightness will increase with their distances from the earth.\n\nHence it is manifest why the moon eclipsed in her perigee appears always duller and darker than in her apogee. The reason why her colour is always of the copper kind, between a dull red and orange, seems to be this: The blue colour of a clear sky shows that the blue rays are more copiously reflected from pure air than those of any other colour; consequently they are less copiously transmitted through it among the rest that come from the sun, and so much the less as the tract of air through which they pass is the longer. Hence the common colour of the sun and moon is whitest in the meridian, and grows gradually more inclined to diluted perigee yellow, orange, and red, as they descend lower, that is, apogee, as the rays are transmitted through a longer tract of air; which tract being still lengthened in passing to the moon and back again, causes a still greater loss of the blue rays in proportion to the rest; and so the resulting colour of the transmitted rays must lie between a dark orange and red, according to Sir Isaac Newton's rule for finding the result of a mixture of colours. The circular edge of the shadow in a partial eclipse appears red; because the red-making rays are the least refracted of all others, and consequently are left alone in the conical surface of the shadow, all the rest being refracted into it.\n\nDr Herschel, who believes that the moon is phosphorescent, and that she shines by her native light, when totally eclipsed by the sun, has endeavoured to show, by calculation, that the light refracted by the atmosphere cannot in some cases fall upon the moon.\n\nPart III. On the Construction of Optical Instruments.\n\nChap. I. Description of Optical Instruments.\n\nOf the mechanism of optical instruments, particular accounts are given in this work under their respective names. There it would be improper to repeat; but as it belongs to the science of optics to explain, by the laws of refraction and reflection, the several phenomena which those instruments exhibit, we must here enumerate the instruments themselves, omitting entirely, or stating very briefly, such facts as are given at large in other places.\n\nSect. I. The Multiplying Glass.\n\nThe multiplying glass is made by grinding down the convex side \\( h i e \\) of a plano-concave glass \\( A B \\), into several flat surfaces, as \\( h b, b l d, d k \\). An object \\( C \\) will not appear magnified when seen through this glass by the eye at \\( H \\); but it will appear multiplied into as many different objects as the glass contains plane surfaces. For, since rays will flow from the object \\( C \\) to all parts of the glass, and each plane surface will reflect these rays to the eye, the same object will appear to the eye in the direction of the rays which enter it through each surface. Thus, a ray \\( g i H \\), falling perpendicularly on the middle surface, will go through the glass to the eye without suffering any refraction; and will therefore show the object in its true place at \\( C \\); whilst a ray \\( a b \\) flowing from the same object, and falling obliquely on the plane surface \\( b h \\), will be refracted in the direction \\( h e \\), by passing through the glass; and, upon leaving it, will go on to the eye in the direction \\( c H \\); which will make the same object \\( C \\) appear also at \\( E \\), in the direction of the ray \\( H e \\), produced in the right line \\( H c n \\).\n\nAnd the ray \\( c d \\), flowing from the object \\( C \\), and falling obliquely on the plane surface \\( d k \\), will in the same way be refracted to the eye at \\( H \\); which will cause the same object to appear at \\( D \\), in the direction \\( H f m \\).\n\nIf the glass be turned round the line \\( g / H \\), as an axis, the object \\( C \\) will keep its place, because the surface \\( b l d \\) is not removed; but all the other objects will seem to go round \\( C \\), because the oblique planes, on which the rays \\( a b c d \\) fall, will turn round by the motion of the glass.\n\nSect. II. Mirrors.\n\nIt has been already observed, that there are three kinds of mirrors principally used in optical experiments (See CATOPTRICS, Sect. I.); the plane mirror, the spherical convex mirror, and the spherical concave mirror. Of these the plane mirror first claims our attention, as it is more common, and of greater antiquity, than the other two. We have shown that the image reflected by this mirror appears as far behind the surface as the object is before it; that the image will appear of the same size and in the same position with the object; that every plane mirror will reflect an image of twice its own length and breadth; and that in certain circumstances it will reflect several images of the same object. These phenomena we shall now explain by the laws of reflection.\n\nLet \\( A B \\) be an object placed before the reflecting surface \\( g h i \\) of the plane mirror \\( C D \\); and let the eye \\( e \\) be at \\( o \\). Let \\( A h \\) be a ray of light flowing from the top \\( A \\) of the object, and falling upon the mirror at \\( h \\), and \\( h m \\) be a perpendicular to the surface of the mirror at \\( h \\); the ray \\( A h \\) will be reflected from the mirror to the eye at \\( o \\), making an angle \\( m h o \\) equal to the angle \\( L 1 2 \\).\nthen will the top of the image E appear to the eye in the direction of the reflected ray oh produced to E, where the right line APE, from the top of the object, cuts the right line oHE, at E. Let Bi be a ray of light issuing from the foot of the object at B to the mirror at i; and ni a perpendicular to the mirror from the point i, where the ray Bi falls upon it; this ray will be reflected in the line io, making an angle nio equal to the angle Bin, with that perpendicular, and entering the eye at o; then will the foot F of the image appear in the direction of the reflected ray ai, produced to F, where the right line BF cuts the reflected ray produced to F. All the other rays that flow from the intermediate points of the object AB, and fall upon the mirror between h and i, will be reflected to the eye at o; and all the intermediate points of the image EF will appear to the eye in the direction of these reflected rays produced. But all the rays that proceed from the object and fall upon the mirror above h, will be reflected back above the eye at o; and all the rays that flow from the object, and fall upon the mirror below i, will be reflected back below the eye at o; so that none of the rays that fall above h, or below i, can be reflected to the eye at o; and the distance between h and i is equal to half the length of the object AB.\n\nHence it appears, that if a man sees his whole image in a plane looking-glass, the part of the glass that reflects his image must be just half as long and half as broad as himself, let him stand at any distance from it whatever; and that his image must appear just as far behind the glass as he is before it. Thus, the man AB viewing himself in the plane mirror CD, which is just half as long as himself, sees his whole image as at EF, behind the glass, exactly equal to his own size. For a ray AC proceeding from his eye at A, and falling perpendicularly upon the surface of the glass at C, is reflected back to his eye, in the same line CA; and the eye of his image will appear at E, in the same line produced to E, beyond the glass. And a ray BD, flowing from his foot, and falling obliquely on the glass at D, will be reflected as obliquely on the other side of the perpendicular abD, in the direction DA; and the foot of his image will appear at F, in the direction of the reflected ray AD, produced to F, where it is cut by the right line BGF, drawn parallel to the right line ACE; just the same as if the glass were taken away, and the real man stood at F, equal in size to the man standing at B: For to his eye at A, the eye of the other man at E would be seen in the direction of the line ACE; and the foot of the man at F would be seen by the eye A, in the direction of the line ADF.\n\nIf the glass be brought nearer the man AB, suppose to cb, he will see his image at CDG: for the reflected ray CA (being perpendicular to the glass) will throw the eye of the image at C; and the incident ray Bb, being reflected in the line bA, will throw the foot of his image at G; the angle of reflection abA being always equal to the angle of incidence Bba; and so of all the intermediate rays from A to B. Hence, if the man AB advances towards the glass CD, his image will approach towards it; and if he recedes from the glass, his image will also recede from it.\n\nIf the object be placed before a common looking-glass, and viewed obliquely, three, four, or more images of it, will appear behind the glass.\n\nTo explain this, let ABCD represent the glass; and optical instruments. Let EF be the axis of a pencil of rays flowing from E, a point in an object situated there. The rays of this pencil will in part be reflected at F, suppose into the line FG. What remains will (after refraction at F, which we do not consider here) pass on to H; from whence (on account of the quicksilver which is spread over the second surface of the glass) they will be strongly reflected to K, where part of them will emerge and enter an eye at L. By this means one representation of the point E will be formed in the line LK produced, supposing M: Again, Another pencil, whose axis is EN, Why three first reflected at N, then at O, and afterwards at P, will form a second representation of the same point at Q: objects are And, thirdly, Another pencil, whose axis is ER, after ten successive reflections at the several points R, S, H, T, V, plane mirror will exhibit a third representation of the same point at X; and so on ad infinitum. The same being true of each point in the object, the whole will be represented in the like manner; but the representations will be faint, in proportion to the number of reflections which the rays suffer, and the length of their progress within the glass. We may add to these another representation of the same object in the line LO produced, made by such of the rays as fall upon O, and are thence reflected to the eye at L. This experiment may be tried by placing a candle before the glass as at E, and viewing it obliquely, as from L.\n\n2. Of Concave Mirrors. The effects of these in magnifying and diminishing objects, have in general been already explained; but in order to understand the nature of reflecting telescopes, it will still be proper to subjoin the following particular description of the effects of concave mirrors.\n\nWhen parallel rays, as df a, cm b, e l c, fall upon a concave mirror AEB, they will be reflected back from that mirror, and meet in a point m, at half the distance of the surface of the mirror from C the centre of its concavity; for they will be reflected at as great an angle from a perpendicular to the surface of the mirror, as they fell upon it with regard to that perpendicular, but on the other side thereof. Thus, let C be the centre of concavity of the mirror AEB; and let the parallel rays df a, cm b, and e l c, fall upon it at the points a, b, and c. Draw the lines Ca a, cm b, and Ch c, from the centre C to these points; and all these lines will be perpendicular to the surface of the mirror. Make the angle Ca h = da a, and draw the line am h, which will be the direction of the ray df a, after it is reflected from the point a of the mirror; so that the angle of incidence da C = Ca h, the angle of reflection; the rays making equal angles with the perpendicular Ca a on its opposite sides.\n\nDraw also the perpendicular Ch c to the point c, where the ray e l c touches the mirror; and having made the angle Cc i = Cc e, draw the line cm i, which will be the course of the ray e l c, after it is reflected from the mirror. The ray cm b passing through the centre of concavity of the mirror, and falling upon it at b, is perpendicular to it; and is therefore reflected back from it in the same line bm C. All these reflected rays meet in the point m; and in that point the image of the body which emits the parallel rays da, cb, and ec, will be formed; which point is distant from the mirror equal to half the radius bm C of its concavity.\nAs the rays which proceed from any celestial object may be esteemed parallel, the image of that object will be formed at \\( m \\), when the reflecting surface of the concave mirror is turned directly to the object. Hence the focus \\( m \\) of parallel rays is not in the centre of the mirror's concavity, but half way between the mirror and that centre.\n\nThe rays which proceed from any remote terrestrial object are not strictly parallel, but come diverging to it, in separate pencils, from each point of the side of the object next the mirror; and therefore they will not be converged to a point at the distance of half the radius of the mirror's concavity from its reflecting surface, but into separate points at a little greater distance from the mirror. The nearer the object is to the mirror, the farther these points will be from it; and an inverted image of the object will be formed in them, which will seem to hang in the air, and will be seen by an eye placed beyond it (with regard to the mirror) in all respects similar to the object, and as distinct as the object itself.\n\nLet \\( A c B \\) be the reflecting surface of a mirror, whose centre of concavity is at \\( C \\); and let the upright object \\( D E \\) be placed beyond the centre \\( C \\), and send out a conical pencil of diverging rays from its upper extremity \\( D \\), to every point of the concave surface of the mirror \\( A c B \\). But to avoid confusion, we only draw three rays of that pencil, as \\( D A, D c, D B \\).\n\nFrom the centre of concavity \\( C \\), draw the three right lines \\( C A, C c, C B \\), touching the mirror in the same points where the three rays touch it; and all these lines will be perpendicular to the surface of the mirror. Make \\( C A d = DAC \\), and draw the right line \\( A d \\) for the course of the reflected ray \\( DA \\); make \\( C c d = D c C \\), and draw the right line \\( c d \\) for the course of the reflected ray \\( Dc \\); make also \\( C B d = D B C \\), and draw the right line \\( B d \\) for the course of the reflected ray \\( DB \\).\n\nAll these reflected rays will meet in the point \\( d \\), where they will form the extremity \\( d \\) of the inverted image \\( e d \\) similar to the extremity \\( D \\) of the upright object \\( DE \\).\n\nIf the pencil of rays \\( E f, E g, E h \\), be also continued to the mirror, and their angles of reflection from it be made equal to their angles of incidence upon it, as in the former pencil from \\( D \\), they will all meet at the point \\( e \\) by reflection, and form the extremity \\( e \\) of the image \\( e d \\), similar to the extremity \\( E \\) of the object \\( DE \\).\n\nAnd as each intermediate point of the object, between \\( D \\) and \\( E \\), sends out a pencil of rays in like manner to every part of the mirror, the rays of each pencil will be reflected back from it, and meet in all the intermediate points between the extremities \\( e \\) and \\( d \\) of the image; and so the whole image will be formed in an inverted position not at \\( i \\), half the distance of the mirror from its centre of concavity \\( C \\), but at a greater distance between \\( i \\) and the object \\( DE \\).\n\nThis being well understood, the reader will easily understand how the image is formed by the large concave mirror of the reflecting telescope, when he comes to the description of that instrument.\n\nWhen the object is more remote from the mirror than its centre of concavity \\( C \\), the image will be less than the object, and between the object and mirror; when the object is nearer than the centre of concavity, the image will be more remote and bigger than the object. Thus, if \\( ED \\) be the object, \\( de \\) will be its image: For, as the object recedes from the mirror, the image approaches nearer to it; and as the object approaches nearer to the mirror, the image recedes farther from it; on account of the lesser or greater divergency of the pencils of rays which proceed from the object: for the less they diverge, the sooner they are converged to points by reflection; and the more they diverge, the farther they proceed before they meet.\n\nIf the radius of the mirror's concavity, and the distance of the object after refraction, be known, the distance of the image from the mirror is found by this rule: Divide the product of the distance and radius by double the distance made less by the radius, and the quotient is the distance required.\n\nIf the object be in the centre of the mirror's concavity, the image and object will be coincident, and equal in bulk.\n\nIf a man place himself directly before a large concave mirror, but farther from it than its centre of concavity, he will see an inverted image of himself in the air, between him and the mirror, and of a less size than himself. If he holds out his hand towards the mirror, the hand of the image will come out towards his hand, and coincide with it, of an equal bulk, when his hand is in the centre of concavity; and he will imagine he may shake hands with his image. If he reaches his hand farther, the hand of the image will pass by his hand, and come between his hand and his body; and if he moves his hand towards either side, the hand of the image will move towards the other; so that whatever way the object moves, the image will move the contrary. All the while a bystander will see nothing of the image, because none of the reflected rays that form it enter his eyes.\n\n**SECT. III. Camera Obscura.**\n\nThe camera obscura having already been fully described under the word DIOPTRICS, we shall at present only direct the reader's attention to an improvement which has lately been made upon this amusing instrument.\n\n\"The improvements (says Dr Brewster) which have been made upon the camera obscura since its first invention, regard chiefly its external form; and no attempts have been made to increase the brilliancy and distinctness of the image. When we compare the picture of external objects, which is formed in a dark chamber by the object-glass of a common refracting telescope, with that which is formed with an achromatic object-glass, we shall find the difference between their distinctness much less than we should have at first expected. Although the achromatic lens forms an image of the minutest parts of the landscape, yet when this image is received on paper, these minute parts are obliterated by the small hairs and imperfections on its surface, and the effect of the picture is very much impaired. In the Royal Observatory at Greenwich the image is received upon a large concave piece of stucco; but this substance does not seem to be more favourable for the reception of images than a paper ground. In order to obviate these imperfections, I tried a number of white substances of different degrees of smoothness, and several metallic surfaces with different degrees of polish, but did not succeed in finding any surface superior to paper. It happened, however, to receive the image on the silvered back of a looking glass, and was surprised at the brilliancy and distinctness with which external objects were represented. The little spherical protuberances, how-\never, which arise from the roughness of the tinfoil have a tendency to detract from the precision of the image, and certainly injure it considerably when examined narrowly with the eye. In order to remove these small eminences, I ground the surface carefully with a bed of stones which I had used for working the plane specula of Newtonian telescopes. By this operation, which is exceedingly delicate, and may be performed without injuring the mirror, I obtained a surface finely adapted for the reception of images. The minute parts of the landscape, when received on this substance, are formed with so much precision, and the brilliance of the colouring is uncommonly fine, as to equal, if not surpass the images formed in the air by means of concave specula. Notwithstanding the bluish colour of the metallic ground, white objects are represented in their true colour, and the verdure of the foliage is so rich and vivid, that the image seems to surpass in beauty even the object itself. On account of the metallic lustre of the surface, the distinctness of the image will always be greatest when the eye of the observer is placed in the direction of the reflected rays.\n\nThe common portable camera obscura, which has already been described (see Dioptrics), is necessarily on a small scale, and has many disadvantages. These disadvantages are completely remedied in the camera obscura, invented by the Rev. Mr Thomson of Duddington, which is represented in figures 1. and 2. of Plate CCCLXXXIX. In fig. 1. A is a metallic or wooden ring, in which the four wooden bars AF, AI, AG, AH, move by means of joints at A, and are kept together by the cross pieces BC, DE, which move round B and D as centres, and fold up along BA and DA, when the instrument is not used. The surface FIGH, on which the image is received, consists of a piece of silk covered with paper. It is made to roll up at IH, which moves in a joint at I, so that the whole surface FIHG, when wound upon IH, can be folded upon the bar IA. By this means the instrument, which is covered with green silk covered with a black substance, may be put together and carried as an umbrella. It is shown more fully in fig. 2. where A is the aperture for placing the lens, and BC a semicircular opening for viewing the image. A black veil may be fixed to the circumference of BC, and thrown over the head of the observer to prevent the admission of any extraneous light.\"\n\nSect. IV. Microscopes.\n\nUnder the article Microscope a full account has been given of the external construction of those instruments as they are now made by the most eminent artists.\n\nIt did not fall within the plan of that article to explain the way in which an enlarged picture of the object is formed upon the retina by means of the microscope, and the means of ascertaining its magnifying power; but we shall now direct the reader's attention to this interesting subject.\n\n1. The Single Microscope, the simplest of all microscopes, is nothing more than a small globe of glass, or a convex lens whose focal distance is extremely short. The magnifying power of this microscope is thus ascertained by Dr Smith. \"A minute object pq, seen distinctly through a small glass AE by the eye put close to it, appears so much greater than it would to the naked eye, placed at the least distance qL, from whence it appears sufficiently distinct, as this latter distance qL is greater than the former qE. For having put your eye close to the glass EA, in order to see as much of the object as possible at one view, remove the object pq to and fro till it appear most distinctly, suppose at the distance qE. Then conceiving the glass AE to be removed, and a thin plate, with a pin-hole in it, to be put in its place, the object will appear distinct and as large as before, when seen through the glass, only not so bright. And in this latter case it appears so much greater than it does to the naked eye at the distance qL, either with a pin-hole or without it, as the angle pEg is greater than the angle pLq, or as the latter distance qL is greater than the former qE. Since the introduction of the glass has no other effect than to render the appearance distinct, by helping the eye to increase the refraction of the rays in each pencil, it is plain that the greater apparent magnitude is entirely owing to a nearer view than could be taken by the naked eye. As the human eye is so constructed, as, for reasons already assigned, to have distinct vision only when the rays which fall upon it are parallel or nearly so; it follows that if the eye be so perfect as to see distinctly by pencils of parallel rays falling upon it, the distance E.g, of the object from the glass, is then the focal distance of the glass. Now, if the glass be a small round globule, of about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) th of an inch diameter, its focal distance E.g, being three quarters of its diameter, is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) th of an inch; and if qL be eight inches, the distance at which we usually view minute objects, this globule will magnify in the proportion of 8 to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\), or of 160 to 1.\n\nMr Gray's Water Microscope is represented in Plate CCCLXXXIX. fig. 4. The drop of water taken up by the point of a pin is introduced into the small hole D, \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) th of an inch in diameter, in the piece of brass DE, about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) th of an inch thick. The hole D is in the middle of a spherical cavity, about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) th of an inch in diameter, and a little deeper than half the thickness of the brass; on the opposite side of the brass is another spherical cavity, half as broad as the former, and so deep as to reduce the circumference of the small hole to a sharp edge. The water being placed in these cavities, will form a double convex lens with unequal convexities. The object, if it is solid, is fixed upon the point C of the supporter AB, and placed at its proper distance from the water lens by the screw FG. When the object is fluid, it is placed in the hole A, but in such a manner as not to be spherical; and this hole is brought opposite the fluid lens by moving the extremity G of the screw into the slit GH.\n\n2. The Double or Compound Microscope, consists of Fig. 8. an object-glass cd, and an eye-glass ef. The small object ab is placed at a little greater distance from the glass cd than its principal focus; so that the pencils of rays flowing from the different points of the object, and passing through the glass, may be made to converge, and unite in as many points between g and h, where the image of the object will be formed; which image is viewed by the eye through the eye-glass ef. For the eye-glass being so placed, that the image gh may be in its focus, and the eye much about the same distance on the other side, the rays ef each pencil will be parallel after going out of the eye-glass, as at e and f, till they come to the eye at k, where they will begin to converge by the refractive power of the humours; and af-\nBy this combination of lenses, the aberration of the large inverted image \\(AB\\).\n\nThis appeared so evidently to be the case, even to former opticians, that they very soon began to make the addition of another lens. For, says Mr Martin, it is not only evident from the theory of this aberration, that the image of any point is rendered less confused by refraction through two lenses than by an equal refraction through one; but it also follows, from the same principle, that the same point has its image still less confused when formed by rays refracted through three lenses than by an equal refraction through two; and therefore a third lens added to the other will contribute to make the image more distinct, and consequently the instrument more complete. At the same time the field of view is amplified, and the use of the microscope rendered more agreeable, by the addition of the other lens. Thus also we may allow a somewhat larger aperture to the object lens, and thus increase the brightness of objects, and greatly heighten the pleasure of viewing them. For the same reason, Mr Martin has proposed a four-glass microscope, which answers the purposes of magnifying and of distinct vision still more perfectly.\n\nThe magnifying power of double microscopes is easily understood; thus: The glass \\(L\\) next the object \\(PQ\\) is very small, and very much convex, and consequently its focal distance \\(LF\\) is very short; the distance \\(LQ\\) of the small object \\(PQ\\) is but a little greater than \\(LF\\). Greater it must be, that the rays flowing from the object may converge after passing through the glass, and crooking one another, form an image of the object; and it must be but a little greater, that the image \\(pq\\) may be at a great distance from the glass, and consequently may be much larger than the object itself. This picture \\(pq\\) being viewed through a convex glass \\(AE\\), whose focal distance is \\(qE\\), appears distinct as in a telescope. Now the object appears magnified for two reasons; first, because, if we viewed its picture \\(pq\\) with the naked eye, it would appear as much greater than the object, at the same distance, as it really is greater than the object, or as much as \\(Lq\\) is greater than \\(LQ\\); and secondly, because this picture appears magnified through the eye-glass as much as the least distance at which it can be seen distinctly with the naked eye, is greater than \\(qE\\), the focal distance of the eye-glass. If this latter ratio be five to one, and the former ratio of \\(Lq\\) to \\(LQ\\) be 20 to 1; then, upon both accounts, the object will appear 5 times 20, or 100 times greater than to the naked eye.\n\nThe action of a compound microscope with three lenses is represented in fig. ro. By the middle one \\(GK\\) the pencil of rays coming from the object-glass are refracted so as to tend to a focus at \\(O\\); but being intercepted by the proper eye-glass \\(DF\\), they are brought together at \\(I\\), which is nearer to that lens than its proper focus at \\(L\\); so that the angle \\(DIF\\), under which the object now appears, is larger than \\(DLF\\), under which it would have appeared without this additional glass; and consequently the object is more magnified in the same proportion. Dr Hooke informs us, that, in most of his observations, he made use of a double mi-optical microscope with this broad middle glass when he wanted to see much of an object at one view, and taking it out when he would examine the small parts of an object more accurately; for the fewer refractions there are, the more bright and clear the object appears.\n\nThe following rule for finding the magnifying power of compound microscopes with three lenses, has been given by Dr Brewster in his Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 468. \"Divide the difference between the distance of the two first lenses, or those next the object, and the focal distance of the second or amplifying compound glass, by the focal distance of the second glass, and with these quotients will be a final number. Square the distance between the two first lenses, and divide it by the difference between that distance, and the focal distance of the second glass, and divide this quotient by the focal distance of the third glass, or that next the eye, and a second number will be obtained. Multiply together the first and second numbers, and the magnifying power of the object glass, (as found by one of the following tables), and the product will be the magnifying power of the compound microscope.\"\n\nHaving in the historical part of this article given a short account of the construction of Dr Smith's double reflecting microscope, it may not be improper in this place to point out the method of ascertaining its magnifying power. This we shall do from the author himself, because his symbols, being general, are applicable to such microscopes of all dimensions.\n\nBetween the centre \\(E\\) and principal focus \\(T\\) of a concave speculum \\(ABC\\), whose axis is \\(EQTC\\), place an object \\(PQ\\); and let the rays flowing from it be reflected from the speculum \\(AB\\) towards an image \\(pq\\); but before they unite in it, let them be received by a convex speculum \\(abc\\), and thence be reflected, through a hole \\(BC\\) in the vertex of the concave, to a second image \\(\\pi x\\), to be viewed through an eye-glass \\(I\\).\n\nThe object may be situated between the specula \\(C\\), or, which is better, between the principal focus \\(T\\) and vertex \\(c\\) of the convex one, a small hole being made in its vertex for the incident rays to pass through.\n\nIn both cases we have \\(TQ\\), \\(TE\\), \\(Tq\\), continual proportions in some given ratio, suppose of 1 to \\(n\\); and also \\(tg\\), \\(tc\\), \\(tx\\), continual proportions in some other given ratio, suppose of 1 to \\(m\\). Then if \\(d\\) be the usual distance at which we view minute objects distinctly with the naked eye, and \\(x\\) the focal distance of the least eye-glass, through which the object appears sufficiently bright and distinct, it will be magnified in the ratio of \\(m\\) to \\(x\\).\n\nFor the object \\(PQ\\), and its first image \\(pq\\), are terminated on one side by the common axis of the specula, and on the other by a line \\(PLp\\), drawn through the centre \\(E\\) of the concave \\(ABC\\). Likewise the images \\(pq\\) and \\(\\pi x\\) are terminated by the common axis and by the line \\(epx\\), drawn through the centre \\(e\\) of the convex \\(abc\\), (Euclid, v. 12.). Hence, by the similar triangles \\(\\pi x e\\), \\(pq e\\), and also \\(pq E\\), \\(PQE\\), we have \\(\\pi x : pq = e : q = m : 1\\), and \\(pq : PQ = q : QE = n : 1\\); and consequently \\(\\pi x : PQ = mn : 1\\), whence \\(\\pi x = mn \\times PQ\\). Now if \\(x\\) be the focal distance of the eye-glass \\(I\\), the points \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) of the object, are seen through it by the rays of two pencils emerging parallel to the lines \\(pq\\).\nOptical Instruments.\n\nOptical Instruments.\n\nThat is, PQ appears under an angle equal to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{x} \\), which is as \\( \\frac{mPQ}{x} = \\frac{mPQ}{x} \\); and to the naked eye at the distance d from PQ, it appears under an angle \\( \\frac{PQ}{d} \\), and therefore is magnified in the ratio of these angles, that is, of \\( mnd \\) to \\( x \\).\n\nCor. Having the numbers \\( m, n, d \\), to find an eyeglass which shall cause the microscope to magnify M times in diameter, take \\( x = \\frac{mnd}{M} \\). For the apparent magnitude is to the true as \\( M : 1 = mnd : x \\).\n\nWe shall conclude this part of our subject with the following easy method of ascertaining the magnifying power of such microscopes as are most in use.\n\nThe apparent magnitude of any object, as must appear from what has been already said, is measured by the angle under which it is seen; and this angle is greater or smaller according as the object is nearer to or farther from the eye; and of consequence the less the distance at which it can be viewed, the larger it will appear. The naked eye is unable to distinguish any object brought exceedingly near it: but by looking through a convex lens at an object placed in its focus, however near the focus of that lens be, an object may be distinctly seen; and the smaller the lens is, the nearer will be its focus, and in the same proportion the greater will be its magnifying power. From these principles it is easy to find the reason why the first or greatest magnifiers are so extremely minute; and also to calculate the magnifying power of any convex lens employed in a single microscope: For as the focal distance of the lens is to the distance at which we see objects distinctly with the naked eye, so is 1 to the magnifying power.\n\nIf the focal length of a convex lens, for instance, be one inch, and the distance at which we look at small objects eight inches, which is the common standard, an object may be seen through that lens at one inch distance from the eye, and will appear in its diameter eight times larger than it does to the naked eye; but as the object is magnified every way, in length as well as in breadth, we must square this diameter to know how much it really is enlarged; and we then find that its superficies is magnified 64 times.\n\nAgain, Suppose a convex lens whose focal distance is only one tenth of an inch; as in eight inches, the common distance of distinct vision with the naked eye, there are 80 tenths, an object may be seen through this glass 80 times nearer than with the naked eye. It will, of consequence, appear 80 times longer, and as much broader, than it does to common sight; and is therefore magnified 6400 times. If a convex glass be so small that its focus is only \\( \\frac{1}{25} \\)th of an inch distant, we find that eight inches contain 160 of these twentieth parts; and consequently the length and breadth of any object seen through such a lens will be magnified 160 times, and the whole surface 25,600 times. As it is easy to melt a drop or globule of a much smaller diameter than a lens can be ground, and as the focus of a globule is no farther off than one-fourth of its own diameter, it must therefore magnify to a prodigious degree. But this excessive magnifying power is much more than counterbalanced by its admitting so little light, want of distinctness, and showing such a small portion of the object to be examined; for which reason, these globules, though greatly valued some time ago, are now almost entirely rejected. According to Mr Folkes's description of the single microscopes of convex lenses which Leeuwenhoek left to the Royal Society, they were all exceedingly clear, and showed the object very bright and distinct; which Mr Folkes considered as owing to the great care this gentleman took in the choice of his glasses, his exactness in giving it the true figure, and afterwards referring only such for his use as upon trial he found to be most excellent. Their powers of magnifying are different, as different objects may require; and as on the one hand, being all ground glasses, none of them are so small, or consequently magnify to so great a degree, as some of the globules frequently used in other microscopes; yet the distinctness of these very much exceeds those which are commonly used.\n\nIn order to find the magnifying power of a single microscope, no more is necessary than to bring it to its true focus, the exact place of which will be known by an object's appearing perfectly distinct and sharp when placed there. Then, with a pair of small compasses, measure, as nearly as possible, the distance from the centre of the glass to the object which is viewed, and how many parts of an inch that distance is. When this is known, compute how many times those parts of an inch are contained in eight inches, and the result will give the number of times the diameter is magnified: squaring the diameter will give the superficies; and if the solid content is wanted, it will be shown by multiplying the superficies by the diameter.\n\nThe superficies of one side of an object only can be seen at one view; and to compute how much that is magnified, is most commonly sufficient; but sometimes it is satisfactory to know how many minute objects are contained in a larger; as suppose we desire to know how many animalcules are contained in the bulk of a grain of sand: and to answer this, the cube, as well as the surface, must be taken into the account. For the satisfaction of those who are not much versed in these subjects, we shall here subjoin the following tables taken from the Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures.\n\nThe first column contains the focal length of the convex lens in hundredths of an inch. The second contains the number of times which such a lens will magnify the diameter of objects. The third shows the number of times that the surface is magnified; and the fourth the number of times that the cube of the object is magnified. A table of a similar kind, though upon a much finer scale, has already been published; but the nearest distance at which the eye can see distinctly, is there supposed to be eight inches, which we are confident from experience, is too large an estimate for the generality of eyes. Table I. is therefore computed upon the supposition that the distance alluded to is seven inches.\n\n\"When we consider however (says the editor of the work now quoted) that the eye examines very minute objects at a less distance than it does objects of a greater magnitude, we shall find that the magnifying power of lenses ought to be deduced from the distance at which the eye examines objects really microscopic. This circumstance has been overlooked by every writer on optics, and merits our attentive consideration. We have now before us two specimens of engraved characters.\nPart III.\n\nOptical Instruments. The one is so large that it can be easily read at the distance of ten inches; and the other is so exceedingly minute that it cannot be read at a greater distance than five inches. Now we maintain that if these two kinds of engraving are seen through the same microscope, the one will be twice as much magnified as the other. This indeed is obvious; for as the magnifying power of a lens is equal to the distance at which the object is examined by the naked eye divided by the focal length of the lens, we shall have \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\) for the number of times which the minute engraving is magnified, and \\( \\frac{10}{x} \\) for the number of times that the large engraving is magnified, \\( x \\) being the focal length of the lens. It follows, therefore, that the number of times that any lens magnifies objects really microscopic should be determined, by making the distance at which they are examined by the naked eye about five inches.\n\nUpon this principle we have computed Table II., which contains the magnifying power of convex lenses when employed to examine microscopic objects.\n\n### Table I.\n\nA NEW TABLE of the magnifying power of small convex lenses or single microscopes, the distance at which the eye sees distinctly being seven inches.\n\n| Focal distance of the lens or microscope. | Number of times that the diameter of an object is magnified. | Number of times that the surface of an object is magnified. | Number of times that the cube of an object is magnified. |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inches and 100ths parts of an inch.      | Dec.

greatest magnifier in Mr Leeuwenhoek\u2019s cabinet of microscopes, presented to the Royal Society, has its focus nearly at one-twentieth of an inch distance from its centre; and consequently magnifies the diameter of an object 160 times, and the superficies 25,600. But the greatest magnifier in Mr Wilson\u2019s single microscopes, as they are now made, has usually a focal length only of the 50th part of an inch; whereby it has a power of enlarging the diameter of an object 400, and its superficies 160,000 times.\n\nThe magnifying power of the solar microscope must be calculated in a different manner; for here the distance of the screen or sheet on which the image of the object is cast, divided by the focal length of the lens, gives its magnifying power. Suppose, for instance, the calculated lens made use of has its focus at half an inch, and the distant screen is placed at the distance of five feet, the object from that will then appear magnified 20 times, and the superficies 14,400 times; and, by putting the screen at a greater distance, you may magnify the object almost as much as you please: but the screen should be placed just at that distance where the object is seen most distinctly and clear.\nWith regard to the double reflecting microscope, Mr Baker observes, that the power of the object-lens is indeed greatly increased by the addition of two eye-glasses; but as no object-lens can be used with them of so minute a diameter, or which magnifies itself near so much as those that can be used alone, the glasses of this microscope, upon the whole, magnify little or nothing more than those of Mr Wilson's single one; the chief advantage arising from a combination of lenses being the sight of a larger portion of the object.\n\nSect. V. Telescopes.\n\nI. The Refracting Telescope.\n\n1. The Astronomical Telescope.\u2014From what has been said concerning the compound microscope, the nature of the common astronomical telescope will easily be understood: for it differs from the microscope only in this, that the object is placed at so great a distance from it, that the rays of the same pencil, flowing from the object, may be considered as falling parallel upon the object-glass; and therefore the image made by that lens is considered as coincident with its focus of parallel rays.\n\nThis will appear very plain from fig. 4., in which A B is the object emitting the several pencils of rays A c d, B c d, &c. but supposed to be at so great a distance from the object-glass c d, that the rays of the same pencil may be considered as parallel to each other; they are therefore supposed to be collected into their respective foci at the points m and p, situated at the focal distance of the object-glass c d. Here they form an image E, and crossing each other proceed diverging to the eye-glass h g f, which being placed at its own focal distance from the points m and p, the rays of each pencil, after passing through that glass, will become parallel among themselves; but the pencils themselves will converge considerably with respect to one another, even so as to cross at e, very little farther from the glass g h than its focus; because, when they entered the glasses, their axes were almost parallel, as coming through the object-glass at the point k, to whose distance the breadth of the eye-glass in a long telescope bears very small proportion. So that the place of the eye will be nearly at the focal distance of the eye-glass, and the rays of each respective pencil being parallel among themselves, and their axes crossing each other in a larger angle than they would do if the object were to be seen by the naked eye, vision will be distinct, and the object will appear magnified.\n\nThe magnifying power in this telescope is as the focal length of the object-glass to the focal length of the eye-glass.\n\nIn order to prove this, we may consider the angle A k B as that under which the object would be seen by the naked eye; for in considering the distance of the object, the length of the telescope may be omitted, as bearing no proportion to it. Now the angle under which the object is seen by means of the telescope is g e h, which is to the other A k B, or its equal g k h, as the distance from the centre of the object-glass to that of the eye-glass. The angle, therefore, which an object subtends to an eye affixed by a telescope of this kind, is to that under which it subtends to the naked eye, as the focal length of the object-glass to the focal length of the eye-glass.\n\nIt is evident from the figure, that the visible area, or space which can be seen at one view, when we look through this telescope, depends on the breadth of the eye-glass, and not of the object-glass; for if the eye-glass be too small to receive the rays g m, p h, the extremities of the object could not have been seen at all: a larger breadth of the object-glass conduces only to the rendering each point of the image more luminous, by receiving a larger pencil of rays from each point of the object.\n\nIt is in this telescope as in the compound microscope, where we see not the object itself, but only its image through it CED: now that image being inverted with respect to the object, because the axis of the pencils that flow from the object cross each other at k, objects seen through a telescope of this kind necessarily appear inverted.\n\nThis is a circumstance not at all regarded by astronomers: but for viewing objects upon the earth, it is convenient that the instrument should represent them in their natural posture; to which use the telescope with three eye-glasses, as represented fig. 13, is peculiarly adapted.\n\nAB is the object sending out the several pencils A c d, B c d, &c. which, after passing through the object-glass c d, are collected into their respective foci in CD, where they form an inverted image. From this they proceed to the first eye-glass e f, whose focus being at refraction l, the rays of each pencil are rendered parallel among themselves, and their axes, which were nearly parallel before, are made to converge and cross each other; the second eye-glass g h, being so placed that its focus shall fall upon m, renders the axes of the pencils which diverge from thence parallel, and causes the rays of each, which were parallel among themselves, to meet again at its focus EF on the other side, where they form a second image inverted with respect to the former, but erect with respect to the object. Now this image being seen by the eye at a b through the eye-glass i k, affords a direct representation of the object, and under the same angle that the first image CD would have appeared, had the eye been placed at l, supposing the eye-glasses to be of equal convexity; and therefore the object is seen equally magnified in this as in the former telescope, that is, as the focal distance of the object-glass to that of any one of the eye-glasses, and appears erect.\n\n2. The Galilean Telescope with the concave eye-glass Galilean telescope.\n\nAB is an object sending forth the pencils of rays g h i, k l m, &c. which, after passing through the object-glass c d, tend towards e E f (where we shall suppose the focus of it to be), in order to form an inverted image there as before; but in their way to it are made to pass through the concave glass n o, so placed that its focus may fall upon F, and consequently the rays of the several pencils which were converging towards those respective focal points e, E, f, will be rendered parallel; but the axes of those pencils crossing each other at F, and diverging from thence, will be rendered more diverging, as represented in the figure. Now these rays entering the pupil of an eye, will form a large and distinct image a b upon the retina, which will be inverted with\nOptical In- with respect to the object, because the axis of the pen-\ncils crofs in F. The object of course will be seen erect,\nand the angle under which it will appear will be equal\nto that which the lines a F, b F, produced back through\nthe eye-glas, form at F.\n\nIt is evident, that the lefs the pupil of the eye is,\nthe lefs is the visible area seen through a telescope of\nthis kind; for a lefs pupil would exclude fuch pencils\nas proceed from the extremities of the object AB, as is\nevident from the figure. This inconvenience renders\nthis telescope unfit for many u\u017fes; and is only to be re-\nmedied by the telescope with the convex eye-glasses,\nwhere the rays which form the extreme parts of the\nimage are brought together in order to enter the pupil\nof the eye, as explained above.\n\nIt is apparent also, that the nearer the eye is placed\nto the eye-glas of this telescope, the larger is the area\nseen through it; for, being placed close to the glas,\nas in the figure, it admits rays that come from A and\nB, the extremities of the object, which it could not if\nit was placed farther off.\n\nThe degree of magnifying in this telescope is in the\nfame proportion with that in the other, viz. as the fo-\ncal diftance of the object-glas is to the focal diftance\nof the eye-glas.\n\nFor there is no other difference but this, viz. that\nas the extreme pencils in that telescope were made to\nconverge and form the angle g e h or i n k (fig. 13),\nthele are now made to diverge and form the angle a F b\n(fig. 1); which angles, if the concave glas in one has\nan equal refractive power with the convex one in the\nother, will be equal, and therefore each kind will exhi-\nbit the object magnified in the same degree.\n\nThere is a defect in all thele kinds of telephones,\nnot to be remedied in a fingle lens by any means what-\never, which was thought only to arife from the sph\u00e9-\nrical aberration of the object-glas. But it was dis-\ncovered by Sir Isaac Newton, that the imperfection\nof this fort of telescope, fo far as it arifes from the spherical\nform of the glasles, bears little proportion to that which\nis owing to the different refrangibility of light. This\ndiverity in the refraction of rays is about a 28th part\nof the whole; lo that the object-glas of a telescope\ncannot collect the rays which flow from any one point\nin the object into lefs space than a circle whose diame-\nter is about the 56th part of the breadth of the\nglas.\n\nPlate cccLXXXVII.

Measuring Light.\n\nThe ingenious author's experiments all conspired to show that the resistance of the air to light is too inconsiderable to be perceptible, and that the assumed law of the diminution of the intensity of light may be dependent upon with safety. He admits, however, that means may be found for rendering the air's resistance to light apparent; and he seems to have thought of the very means which occurred for this purpose to M. de Saufure.\n\nThat eminent philosopher, wishing to ascertain the transparency of the atmosphere, by measuring the distances at which determined objects cease to be visible, perceived at once that his end would be attained, if he should find objects of which the disappearance might be accurately determined. Accordingly, after many trials, he found that the moment of disappearance can be observed with much greater accuracy when a black object is placed on a white ground, than when a white object is placed on a black ground; that the accuracy was still greater when the observation was made in the sun than in the shade; and that even a still greater degree of accuracy was obtained, when the white space surrounding a black circle, was itself surrounded by a circle or ground of a dark colour. This last circumstance was particularly remarkable, and an observation quite new.\n\nIf a circle totally black, of about two lines in diameter, be fastened on the middle of a large sheet of paper or pasteboard, and if this paper or pasteboard be placed in such a manner as to be exposed fully to the light of the sun, if you then approach it at the distance of three or four feet, and afterwards gradually recede from it, keeping your eye constantly directed towards the black circle, it will appear always to decrease in size the farther you retire from it, and at the distance of 33 or 34 feet will have the appearance of a point. If you continue still to recede, you will see it again enlarge itself; and it will seem to form a kind of cloud, the darkness of which decreases more and more according as the circumference becomes enlarged. The cloud will appear still to increase in size the farther you remove from it; but at length it will totally disappear. The moment of the disappearance, however, cannot be accurately ascertained; and the more experiments were repeated the more were the results different.\n\nM. de Saufure, having reflected for a long time on the means of remedying this inconvenience, saw clearly, that, as long as this cloud took place, no accuracy could be obtained; and he discovered that it appeared consequence of the contrast formed by the white parts which were at the greatest distance from the black circle. He thence concluded, that if the ground was left white near this circle, and the parts of the pasteboard at the greatest distance from it were covered with a dark colour, the cloud would no longer be visible, or at least almost totally disappear.\n\nThis conjecture was confirmed by experiment. M. de Saufure left a white space around the black circle equal in breadth to its diameter, by placing a circle of black paper a line in diameter on the middle of a white circle three lines in diameter, so that the black circle was only surrounded by a white ring a line in breadth. The whole was pasted upon a green ground. A green colour was chosen, because it was dark enough to make the cloud disappear, and the easiest to be procured.\n\nThe black circle, surrounded in this manner with white on a green ground, disappeared at a much less distance than when it was on a white ground of a large size.\n\nIf a perfectly black circle, a line in diameter, be pasted on the middle of a white ground exposed to the open light, it may be observed at the distance of from 44 to 45 feet; but if this circle be surrounded by a white ring a line in breadth, while the rest of the ground is green, all sight of it is lost at the distance of only 15 feet.\n\nAccording to these principles M. de Saufure delineated several black circles, the diameters of which increased in a geometrical progression; the exponent of which was 3. His smallest circle was \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) or 0.2 of a line in diameter; the second 0.3; the third, 0.45; and so on to the sixteenth, which was 87.527, or about 7 inches 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lines. Each of these circles was surrounded by a white ring, the breadth of which was equal to the diameter of the circle, and the whole was pasted on a green ground.\n\nM. de Saufure, for his experiments, selected a straight road or plain of about 1200 or 1500 feet in circumference, which towards the north was bounded by trees or an ascent. Those who repeat them, however, must pay attention to the following remarks: When a person retires backwards, keeping his eye constantly fixed on the pasteboard, the eye becomes fatigued, and soon ceases to perceive the circle; as soon therefore as it ceases to be distinguishable, you must suffer your eyes to rest; not, however, by shutting them, for they would when again opened be dazzled by the light, but by turning them gradually to some less illuminated object in the horizon. When you have done this for about half a minute, and again directed your eyes to the pasteboard, the circle will be again visible, and you must continue to recede till it disappear once more. You must then let your eyes rest a second time in order to look at the circle again, and continue in this manner till the circle becomes actually invisible.\n\nIf you wish to find an accurate expression for the want of transparency, you must employ a number of circles, the diameters of which increase according to a certain progression; and a comparison of the distances at which they disappear will give the law according to which the transparency of the atmosphere decreases at different distances. If you wish to compare the transparency of the atmosphere on two days, or in two different places, two circles will be sufficient for the experiment.\n\nAccording to these principles, M. de Saufure caused to be prepared a piece of white linen cloth eight feet square. In the middle of this square he sewed a perfect circle, two feet in diameter, of beautiful black wool; around this circle he left a white ring two feet in breadth, and the rest of the square was covered with pale green. In the like manner, and of the same materials, he prepared another square; which was, however, equal to only \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the size of the former, so that each side of it was 8 inches; the black circle in the middle was two inches in diameter, and the white space around the circle was 2 inches also.\n\nIf two squares of this kind be suspended vertically\nApparatus and parallel to each other, so that they may be both illuminated in an equal degree by the sun; and if the atmosphere, at the moment when the experiment is made, be perfectly transparent, the circle of the large square, which is twelve times the size of the other, must be seen at twelve times the distance. In M. de Saufure's experiments the small circle disappeared at the distance of 314 feet, and the large one at the distance of 3588 feet, whereas it should have disappeared at the distance of 3768. The atmosphere, therefore, was not perfectly transparent. This arose from the thin vapors which at that time were floating in it. M. de Saufure calls his instrument a daphanometer; but it serves one of the purposes of a photometer.\n\nFrom a number of experiments made with the photometer, Count Rumford found, that, by passing through a pane of fine, clear, well polished glass, such as is commonly made use of in the construction of looking-glasses, light loses \\( \\frac{1}{973} \\) of its whole quantity, i.e., of the quantity which impinges on the glass; that when light is made to pass through two panes of such glass standing parallel, but not touching each other, the loss is \\( \\frac{1}{3184} \\) of the whole; and that in passing through a very thin, clear, colourless pane of window-glass, the loss is only \\( \\frac{1}{1263} \\). Hence he infers, that this apparatus might be very usefully employed by the optician, to determine the degree of transparency of glass, and direct his choice in the provision of that important article of his trade. The loss of light when reflected from the very best plain glass mirror, the author ascertained, by five experiments, to be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the whole which fell upon the mirror.\n\nAn ingenious photometer has also been invented by Professor Leslie, and fully described in his celebrated work on Heat, to which we must refer the reader for a complete description of this instrument. It measures the calorific effect of heat, and is founded upon this principle, \"that if a body be exposed to the sun's rays, it will, in every possible case, be found to indicate a measure of heat exactly proportional to the quantity of light which it has absorbed.\" See Essay on Heat, p. 103.\n\n**CHAP. II. On the method of forming the Lens and Specula, of Refracting and Reflecting Telescopes.**\n\n**Sect. I. On the Method of grinding and polishing Lenses.**\n\nHaving fixed upon the proper aperture and focal distance of the lens, take a piece of sheet copper, and strike a fine arch upon its surface, with a radius equal to half that distance, if it is to be plano-convex, and let the length of this arch be a little greater than the given aperture. Remove with a file that part of the copper which is without the circular arch, and a convex gage will be formed. Strike another arch with the same radius, and having removed that part of the copper which is within it, a concave gage will be obtained. Prepare of the two circular plates of brass, about \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch thick, and half an inch greater in diameter than the breadth of the lens, and folder them upon a cylinder of lead of the same diameter, and about an inch high. These formation tools are then to be fixed upon a turning lathe, and one of them turned into a portion of a concave sphere, so as to suit the convex gage; and the other into a portion of a convex sphere, so as to answer the concave gage. After the surfaces of the brass plates are turned as accurately as possible, they must be ground upon one another, alternately, with flour emery; and when the two surfaces exactly coincide, the grinding tools will be ready for use.\n\nProcure a piece of glass whose dispersive power is as small as possible, if the lens is not for achromatic instruments, and whose surfaces are parallel; and by means of a pair of large feelers or pincers, cut it into a circular shape, so that its diameter may be a little greater than the required aperture of the lens. When the roughness is removed from its edges by a common grindstone (A), it is to be fixed with black pitch to a wooden handle of a smaller diameter than the glass, and about an inch high, so that the centre of the handle may exactly coincide with the centre of the glass.\n\nThe glass being thus prepared, it is then to be ground with fine emery upon the concave tool, if it is to be convex, and upon the convex tool, if it is to be concave. To avoid circumlocution, we shall suppose that the lens is to be convex. The concave tool, therefore, which is to be used, must be firmly fixed to a table or bench, and the glass wrought upon it with circular strokes, so that its centre may never go beyond the edges of the tool. For every 6 circular strokes, the glass should receive 2 or 3 cross ones along the diameter of the tool, and in different directions. When the glass has received its proper shape, and touches the tool in every point of its surface, which may be easily known by inspection, the emery is to be washed away, and finer kinds (B) successively substituted in its room, till by the same alternation of circular and transverse strokes, all the scratches and imperfections are removed from its surface. After the finest emery has been used, the roughness which remains may be taken away, and a slight polish superinduced by grinding the glass with pounded pumice-stone, in the same manner as before. While the operation of grinding is going on, the convex tool should, at the end of every five\n\n(A) When the focal distance of the lens is to be short, the surface of the piece of glass should be ground upon a common grindstone, so as to suit the gage as nearly as possible; and the plates of brass, before they are foldered on the lead, should be hammered as truly as they can be done into their proper form. By this means much labour will be saved both in turning and grinding.\n\n(B) Emery of different degrees of fineness may be made in the following manner. Take five or six clean vessels, and having filled one of them with water, put into it a considerable quantity of flour emery. Stir it well with a piece of wood, and after standing for 5 seconds pour the water into the second vessel. After it has stood about 12 seconds, pour it out of this into a third vessel, and so on with the rest; and at the bottom of each vessel will be found emery of different degrees of fineness, the coarsest being in the first vessel, and the finest in the last.\nMethod of five minutes, be wrought upon the concave one for a few seconds, in order to preserve the same curvature to the polishing tools and the glass. When one side is finished off with the pumice-stone, the lens must be separated from its handle by inserting the point of a knife between it and the pitch, and giving it a gentle stroke. The pitch which remains upon the glass may be removed by rubbing it with a little oil, or spirits of wine; and after the ground side of the glass is fixed upon the handle, the other surface is to be wrought and finished in the very same manner.\n\nWhen the glass is thus brought into its proper form, the next and the most difficult part of the operation is to give it a fine polish. The best, though not the simplest way of doing this, is to cover the concave tool with a layer of pitch, hardened by the addition of a little rosin, to the thickness of one-fifteenth of an inch. Then having taken a piece of thin writing paper, press it upon the surface of the pitch with the convex tool, and pull the paper quickly from the pitch before it has adhered to it; and if the surface of the pitch is marked everywhere with the lines of the paper, it will be truly spherical, having coincided exactly with the surface of the convex tool. If any paper remains on the surface of the pitch, it may be removed by soap and water; and if the marks of the paper should not appear on every part of it, the operation must be repeated till the polisher, or bed of pitch, is accurately spherical. The glass is then to be brought on the polisher by circular and cross strokes, with the oxide of tin, called the flowers of putty in the shops, or with the red oxide of iron, otherwise called colcothar of vitriol, till it has received on both sides a complete polish (c). The polishing will advance slowly at first, but will proceed rapidly when the polisher becomes warm with the friction. When it is nearly finished, no more putty or water should be put upon the polisher, which should be kept warm by breathing upon it; and if the glass moves with difficulty from its adhesion to the tool, it should be quickly removed, lest it spoil the surface of the pitch. When any particles of dust or pitch infuse themselves between the glass and the polisher, which may be easily known from the very unpleasant manner of working, they should be carefully removed, by washing both the polisher and the glass, otherwise the lens will be scratched, and the bed of pitch materially injured.\n\nThe operation of polishing may also be performed by covering the layer of pitch with a piece of cloth, and giving it a spherical form by pressing it with the convex tool when the pitch is warm. The glass is wrought as formerly, upon the surface of the cloth, with putty or colcothar of vitriol, till a sufficient polish is induced. By this mode the operation is slower, and the polish less perfect; though it is best fitted for those who have but little experience, and would therefore be apt to injure the figure of the lens by polishing it on a bed of pitch.\n\n(c) As colcothar of vitriol is obtained by the decomposition of martial vitriol, it sometimes retains a portion of this salt. When this portion of martial vitriol is decomposed by dissolution in water, the yellow ochre which results penetrates the glass, forms an incrustation upon its surface, and gives it a dull and yellowish tinge, which is communicated to the image which it forms.\n\n(d) The finest land which we have met with in this country, is to be found at Roxburgh castle, in the neighbourhood of Kelso.\n\nIn this manner the small lenses of simple and compound microscopes, the eye-glasses and the object-glasses of telescopes, are to be ground. In grinding concave lenses, Mr Imison* employs leaden wheels with the same radius as the curvature of the lens, and with their circumferences as the convexity of the lens is to be concave. These spherical zones are fixed upon a turning lathe, and the lens, which is held steadily in Improperly the hand, is ground upon them with emery, while they are revolving on the spindle of the lathe. In the same way convex lenses may be ground and polished, by fixing the concave tool upon the lathe; but these methods, however simple and expeditious they may be, should never be adopted for forming the lenses of optical instruments, where an accurate spherical figure is indispensible. It is by the hand alone that we can perform with accuracy those circular and transverse strokes, the proper union of which is essential to the production of a spherical surface.

On the Method of Casting, Grinding, and Polishing the Specula of Reflecting Telescopes.\n\nThe metals of reflecting telescopes are generally composed of 32 parts of copper, and 15 of grain tin, of the metal with the addition of two parts of arsenic, to render the composition more white and compact. The Reverend Mr Edwards found, from a variety of experiments, that if one part of brass, and one of silver, be added to the preceding composition, and only one part of arsenic used, a most excellent metal will be obtained, which is the whitest, hardest, and most reflective, that he ever met with. The superiority of this composition, indeed, has been completely evinced by the excellence of Mr Edwards' telescopes, which excel other reflectors in brightness and distinctness, and show objects in their natural colours. But as metals of this composition are extremely difficult to cast, as well as to grind and polish, it will be better for those who are inexperienced in the art, to employ the composition first mentioned.\n\nAfter the flasks of fund (d) are prepared, and a mould made for the metal by means of a wooden or metallic pattern, so that its face may be downwards, and a few small holes left in the sand at its back, for the free escape of the included air\u2014melt the copper in a crucible by itself, and when it is reduced to a fluid state, fuse the tin in a separate crucible, and mix it with the melted copper, by stirring them together with a wooden spatula. The proper quantity of powdered arsenic, wrapped up in a piece of paper, is then to be added, the operator retaining his breath till its noxious fumes are completely dissipated; and when the scoria is removed from the fluid mass, it is to be poured out as quickly as possible into the flasks. As soon as the metal is become solid, remove it from the flask into some hot ashes or coals, for the purpose of annealing.\nMethod of annealing it, and let it remain among them till they are completely cold. The ingate is then to be taken from the metal by means of a file; and the surface of the speculum must be ground upon a common grindstone, till all the imperfections and asperities are taken away. When Mr Edwards' composition is employed, the copper and tin should be melted according to the preceding directions, and, when mixed together, should be poured into cold water, which will separate the mals into a number of small particles. These small pieces of metal are then to be collected and put into the crucible, along with the silver and bras, after they have been melted together in a separate crucible; the proper quantity of arsenic is to be added, and a little powdered rosin thrown into the fluid metal before it is poured into the flasks.\n\nWhen the metal is cast, and prepared by the common grindstone for receiving its proper figure, the gages and grinding tools are to be formed in the same manner as for convex lenses, with this difference only, that the radius of the gages must always be double the focal length of the speculum. In addition to the convex and concave bras tools, which should be only a little broader than the metal itself, a convex elliptical tool of lead and tin should also be formed with the same radius, so that its transverse may be to its conjugate diameter as 10 to 9, the latter being exactly equal to the diameter of the metal. On this tool the speculum is to be ground with flour emery, in the same manner as lenses, with circular and cross strokes alternately, till its surface is freed from every imperfection, and ground to a spherical figure. It is then to be wrought with great circumspection, on the convex bras' tool, with emery of different degrees of fineness, the concave tool being sometimes ground upon the convex one, to keep them all of the same radius; and when every scratch and appearance of roughness is removed from its surface, it will be fit for receiving the final polish. Before the speculum is brought to the polisher, it has been the practice to smooth it on a bed of stones, or a convex tool made of common blue stones. This additional tool, indeed, is absolutely necessary, when silver and bras enter into the composition of the metal, in order to remove that roughness which will always remain after the finest emery has been used; but when these metals are not ingredients in the speculum, there is no occasion for the bed of stones. Without the intervention of this tool I have finished several specula, and given them as exquisite a lustre as they could possibly have received. Mr Edwards does not use any bras tools in his process, but transfers the metal from the elliptical leaden tool to the bed of stones. By this means the operation is simplified, but we doubt much if it is, in the least degree, improved. As a bed of stones is more apt to change its form than a tool of brass, it is certainly of great consequence that the speculum should have as true a figure as possible before it is brought to the stones; and we are persuaded, from experience, that this figure may be better communicated on a bras' tool, which can always be kept at the same curvature by its corresponding tool, than on an elliptical block of lead. We are certain, however, that when the speculum is required to be of a determinate focal length, this length will be obtained more precisely with the bras tools than without them. But Mr Edwards has observed, that these tools are not only unnecessary, but 'really detrimental.' That Mr Edwards found them unnecessary, we cannot doubt, from the excellence of the specula which he formed without their affluence; but it seems inconceivable how the bras tools can be in the least degree detrimental. If the mirror is ground upon 20 different tools before it is brought to the bed of stones, it will receive from the last of these tools a certain figure, which it would have received even if it had not been ground on any of the rest; and it cannot be questioned, that a metal wrought upon a pair of bras tools, is equally, if not more, fit for the bed of stones, than if it had been ground merely on a tool of lead.\n\nWhen the metal is ready for polishing, the elliptical leaden tool is to be covered with black pitch, about polishing one-twentieth of an inch thick, and the polisher formed the metal in the same way as in the case of lenses, either with the concave bras tool, or with the metal itself. The colochar of vitriol should then be triturated between two surfaces of glass, and a considerable quantity of it applied at first to the surface of the polisher. The speculum is then to be wrought in the usual way upon the polishing tool till it has received a brilliant lustre, taking care to use no more of the colochar, if it can be avoided, and only a small quantity of it, if it should be found necessary. When the metal moves fluidly on the polisher, and the colochar assumes a dark muddy hue, the polish advances with great rapidity. The tool will then grow warm, and would probably stick to the speculum, if its motion were discontinued for a moment. At this stage of the process, therefore, we must proceed with great caution, breathing continually on the polisher, till the friction is so great as to retard the motion of the speculum. When this happens, the metal is to be flipped off the tool at one side, cleaned with soft leather, and placed in a tube for the purpose of trying its performance; and if the polishing has been conducted with care, it will be found to have a true parabolic figure.\n\nAppendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 457.","sp":301,"ep":334},{"h":"OPTIO","t":"an officer in the Roman army, being an assistant or lieutenant to every centurion.

Dr Hiekes observes, that the mode of reckoning money by marks and oras was never known in England till after the Danish settlements; and by examining the old nummulary climates among the principal Gothic states upon the Baltic, it appears, that the ora and solidus were synonymous terms, and that the ora was the eighth part of the mark. From several of the Danish laws, it likewise appears, that the Danish ora, derived by corruption from aureus, was the same as the Frank solidus of twelve pence. As a weight, the ora was regarded as the mina or unit, by which the Danish mark was divided; and in Doomsday book the ora is used for the ounce, or the twelfth part of the nummulary Saxon pound, and the fifteenth of the commercial: as a coin, it was an aureus, or the Frank solidus of twelve pence. And from the accidental coincidence of the Frank aureus with the eighth part of their mark, the Danes probably took occasion to give it the new name of ora. There was another ora mentioned in the rolls of the 27th of Henry III. the value of which was sixteen pence; and this was probably derived from the half mancus of the Saxons. Such, in all appearance, was the original of these two oras; as there were no aurei of that period, to which these two denominations of money of sixteen and twelve pence can possibly be ascribed. It is observed farther, that the name ora distinguishes the gold coins in several parts of Europe to this day. The Portuguese moideira is nothing else but moeda d'oro, from the Latin moneta de auro; the French Louis d'ors come from the same use of the word, and owe their appellation to the ora.

It is also used for the god who was thought to give the answer, and for the place where it was given.\n\nThe credit of oracles was so great, that in all doubts and disputes their determinations were held sacred and inviolable: whence vast numbers flocked to them for advice about the management of their affairs; and no business of any consequence was undertaken, scarce any peace concluded, any war waged, or any new form of government instituted, without the advice and approbation of some oracle. The answers were usually given by the intervention of the priests or priestesses of the god who was consulted; and generally expressed in such dark and unintelligible phrases, as might be easily wrested to prove the truth of the oracle whatever was the event. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that the priests who delivered them were in the highest credit and esteem, and that they managed this reputation so greatly to promote their own particular advantage. They accordingly allowed no man to consult the gods, before he had offered costly sacrifices, and made rich presents to them. And to keep up the veneration for their oracles, and to prevent their being taken unprepared, they admitted persons to consult the gods only at certain stated times; and sometimes they were so cautious, that the greatest performances could obtain no answer at all. Thus Alexander himself was peremptorily denied by the Pythia, or priestess of Apollo, till she was by downright force obliged to ascend the tripod; when, being unable to resist any longer, she cried out, Thou art invincible: and these words were accepted instead of a farther oracle.\n\nOf the ambiguity of oracles, the following, out of a great many examples, may be mentioned. Croesus having received from the Pythianess this answer, That by palling the river Halys, he would destroy a great empire; he understood it to be the empire of his enemy, whereas he destroyed his own.\u2014The oracle consulted by Pyrrhus gave him an answer, which might be equally understood of the victory of Pyrrhus, and the victory of the Romans his enemies:\n\nAio te, \u00c6acida, Romanos vincere posse.\n\nThe equivocation lies in the construction of the Latin tongue, which cannot be rendered in English.\u2014The Pythones advised Croesus to guard against the mule. The king of Lydia understood nothing of the oracle, which denoted Cyrus descended from two different nations; from the Medes, by Mandana his mother, the daughter of Astyages; and from the Persians, by his father Cambyses, whose race was by far less grand and illustrious.\u2014Nero had for answer, from the oracle of Delphos, that seventy-three might prove fatal to him. He believed he was safe from all danger till that age; but, finding himself deserted by every one, and hearing Galba proclaimed emperor, who was 73 years of age, he was sensible of the deceit of the oracle.\n\nWhen men began to be better instructed by the lights philosophy had introduced into the world, the false oracles infinibly lost their credit. Chrysippus filled an entire volume with false or doubtful oracles. Oenomaus, to be revenged of some oracle that had deceived him, made a compilation of oracles, to show their ridiculous vanity. Eusebius has preserved some fragments of this criticism on oracles by Oenomaus. \"I might (says Origen) have recourse to the authority of Aristotle and the Peripatetics, to make the Pythones much suspected; I might extract from the writings...\"\nwritings of Epicurus and his sectors an abundance of things to discredit oracles; and I might shew that the Greeks themselves made no great account of them.\"\n\nThe reputation of oracles was greatly lessened when they became an artifice of politics. Themistocles, with a design of engaging the Athenians to quit Athens, and to embark, in order to be in a better condition to resist Xerxes, made the Pythones d'Ever an oracle, commanding them to take refuge in wooden walls. Demoithenes said, that the Pythones Philip-pized; to signify that he was gained over by Philip's pretexts.\n\nThe cessation of oracles is attested by several profane authors; as Strabo, Juvenal, Lucan, and others. Plutarch accounts for it, by saying, that the benefits of the gods are not eternal as themselves are; or that the genii, who presided over oracles, are subject to death; or that the exhalations of the earth had been exhausted. It appears that the last reason had been alleged in the time of Cicero, who ridicules it in his second book of Divination, as if the spirit of prophecy, supposed to be excited by subterraneous effluvia, had evaporated by length of time, as wine or pickle by being long kept.\n\nSuidas, Nicephorus, and Cedrenus, relate, that Augustus, having consulted the oracle of Delphos, could obtain no other answer but this: \"The Hebrew child whom all the gods obey, drives me hence, and sends me back to hell: get out of this temple without speaking one word.\" Suidas adds, that Augustus dedicated an altar in the Capitol, with this inscription, \"To the eldest Son of God.\" Notwithstanding these testimonies, the answer of the oracle of Delphos to Augustus seems very suspicious. Cedrenus cites Eusebius for this oracle, which is not now found in his works; and Augustus's peregrination into Greece was 18 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nSuidas and Cedrenus give an account also of an ancient oracle delivered to Thulis, a king of Egypt, which they say is well authenticated. The king having consulted the oracle of Serapis, to know if there ever was, or would be, one so great as himself, received this answer: First, God, next the Word, and the Spirit with them. They are equally eternal, and make but one, whose power will never end. But thou, mortal, go hence, and think that the end of the life of man is uncertain.\"\n\nVan Dale, in his treatise of oracles, does not believe that they ceased at the coming of Christ. He relates several examples of oracles consulted till the death of Theodosius the Great. He quotes the laws of the emperors Theodosius, Gratian, and Valentinian, against those who consulted oracles, as a certain proof that the superstition of oracles still subsisted in the time of those emperors.\n\nAccording to others, the opinion of those who believe that demons had no share in the oracles, and that the coming of the Messiah made no change in them, and the contrary opinion of those who pretend that the incarnation of the Word imposed a general silence on all oracles, should be equally rejected. They allege, that two sorts of oracles ought to be distinguished: the one dictated by the spirits of darkness, who deceived men by their obscure and doubtful answers; the other, the pure artifice and cheat of the priests of false divinities. As to the oracles given out by demons, the reign of Satan was destroyed by the coming of the Saviour; truth that the mouth of lies; but Satan continued his old craft among idolaters. All the devils were not forced to silence at the same time by the coming of the Messiah; it was on particular occasions that the truth of Christianity, and the virtue of Christians, imposed silence on the devils. St. Athanasius tells the Pagans, that they have been witnesses themselves that the sign of the cross puts the devils to flight, silences oracles, and dissipates enchantments. This power of silencing oracles, and putting the devils to flight, is also attested by Arnobius, Lactantius, Prudentius, Minutius Felix, and several others. Their testimony is a certain proof that the coming of the Messiah had not imposed a general silence on oracles.\n\nPlutarch relates, that the pilot Thamus heard a voice in the air, crying out, \"The great Pan is dead;\" whereupon Eusebius observes, that the accounts of the death of the demons were frequent in the reign of Tiberius, when Christ drove out the wicked spirits.\n\nThe same judgment, it is said, may be passed on oracles as on predictions. It was on particular occasions, by the divine permission, that the Christians cast out devils, or silenced oracles, in the presence, and even by the confession, of the Pagans themselves. And thus it is we should, it seems, understand the palliages of St Jerome, Eusebius, Cyril, Theodore, Prudentius, and other authors, who said that the coming of Christ had imposed silence on the oracles.\n\nAs to the second sort of oracles, which were pure artifices and cheats of the priests of false divinities, and which probably exceeded the number of those that immediately proceeded from demons, they did not cease till idolatry was abolished, though they had lost their credit for a considerable time before the coming of Christ. It was concerning this more common and general sort of oracles that Minutius Felix said, they began to discontinue their responses, according as men began to be more polite. But, however oracles were decreed, impostors always found dupes, the greatest cheats having never failed.\n\nDaniel discovered the imposture of the priests of Bel, who had a private way of getting into the temple to take away the offered meats, and who made the king believe that the idol confirmed them.\u2014Mundus, being in love with Paulina, the eldest of the priestesses of Isis, went and told her, that the god Amibus, being passionately fond of her, commanded her to give him a meeting. She was afterwards shut up in a dark room, where her lover Mundus, whom she believed to be the god Amibus, was concealed. This imposture having been discovered, Tiberius ordered those detestable priests and priestesses to be crucified, and with them Idea, Mundus's free woman, who had conducted the whole intrigue. He also commanded the temple of Isis to be levelled with the ground, and her statue to be thrown into the Tiber; and, as to Mundus, he contented himself with sending him into banishment.\n\nTheophilus, bishop of Alexandria, not only destroyed the temples of the false gods, but discovered the cheats of the priests, by showing that the statues, some of which were of brass, and others of wood, were hollow within, and led into dark palliages made in the wall.\nLucian, in discovering the impostures of the false prophet Alexander, says, that the oracles were chiefly afraid of the subtleties of the Epicureans and Chritians. The false prophet Alexander sometimes feigned himself seized with a divine fury, and by means of the herb popowort, which he chewed, frothed at the mouth in an extraordinary manner, that the ignorant people attributed it to the strength of the god he was possessed by. He had long before prepared a head of a dragon made of linen, which opened and shut its mouth by means of a horse hair. He went by night to a place where the foundations of a temple were digging; and having found water, either of a spring, or rain that had settled there, he hid in it a goose egg, in which he had enclosed a little serpent that had been just hatched. The next day, very early in the morning, he came quite naked into the street, having only a scarf about his middle, holding in his hand a scythe, and tossing about his hair as the priests of Cybele; then getting atop of a high altar, he said, that the place was happy to be honoured by the birth of a god.\u2014Afterwards, running down to the place where he had hid the goose egg, and going into the water, he began to sing the praises of Apollo and Aesculapius, and to invite the latter to come and show himself to men. With these words, he dips a bowl into the water, and takes out the mysterious egg, which had a god enclosed in it; and when he had it in his hand, he began to say that he held Aesculapius. Whilst all were eager to have a sight of this fine mystery, he broke the egg, and the little serpent starting out, twisted itself about his fingers.\n\nThese examples show clearly, that both Christians and Pagans were so far agreed as to treat the greater number of oracles as purely human impostures. That, in fact, all of them were so, will be concluded by those who give equal credit to demoniacal inspiration, and demoniacal possession. The most ancient oracle was that of Dodona (see Dodona); but the most famous was that of Delphi, to which article we also refer for further particulars on this subject, so famous in Pagan antiquity. Another celebrated one was the oracle of Trophonius, in the neighbourhood of Lebada, a city of Boeotia, which was held in high estimation. It received its name from Trophonius, brother of Agamedes, who lived in a subterranean dwelling near Lebada, and pretended to the faculty of foretelling future events. He died in his cave, and was deified as an oracular god. This oracle owed its reputation to one Saon.\n\nThose who repaired to this cave for information, were required to offer certain sacrifices, to anoint themselves with oil, and to bathe in a certain river: They were then clothed in a linen robe, took a honeyed cake in their hands, and defended into the subterraneous chamber by a narrow passage. Here it was that futurity was unfolded to them, either by visions or extraordinary sounds. The return from the cave was by the same passage, but the persons consulting were obliged to walk backwards. They generally came out astonied, melancholy, and dejected; hence the proverb us Tepaionos psuchisth. The priests on their return placed them on an elevated seat, called the seat of Mnemosyne, where an account was taken of what they had seen and heard. They were then conducted to the chapel of good Genius by their companions, where, by degrees, they recovered their usual composure and cheerfulness.\n\nBesides these three principal oracles of Greece, it is proper to take notice of that of Amphiarous at Oropus in Attica. It was so called from Amphiarous, the son of Oicleus, a man skilled in magic, the interpretation of dreams, &c. and who after his death was deified and delivered oracles in a temple erected to his divinity. (See Amphiarous). They who applied to them for information, were to purify themselves, offer sacrifice, fast twenty-four hours, abstain from wine two days, and make an offering of a ram to Amphiarous; on the skin of which they were to sleep, and see their destiny in a dream. Near the temple was Amphiarous\u2019s fountain, which was sacred, and the waters of it forbidden to be used for ordinary purposes.\n\nAt Delos also there was an oracle of the Delian Apollo; in Mileia was that of the Branchidae, with others of less note, which require not a particular description, such as that of the camp at Lacedemon, that of Nabarcha, that of Chrylopolis, that of Clares in Ionia, that of Mallos, that of Patara, that of Pella, that of Phaselides, that of Sinope, that of Orpheus\u2019s head, &c.\n\nThough the Romans consulted the Grecian oracles upon many occasions, and had few oracles in their own country; yet we must not omit mentioning the Cumaean oracles, which were delivered by the Sibyl of Cumae. For an account of the Sibyls, see the article SIBYL. See also Daemon and Demoniac.\n\nWe have hitherto only considered the oracles of false gods, of which there was a far greater number than our limits permit us to observe, and before either Greeks or Romans had risen to any distinction. Oracle is in sacred history sometimes used for the mercy seat, or the cover of the ark of the covenant; and by others it is taken for the sanctuary, or for the most holy place, wherein the ark was deposited.\n\nAmong the Jews we may distinguish several sorts of real oracles. They had first oracles that were delivered viva voce; as when God spake to Moses face to face, and as one friend speaks to another, (Numb. xii. 8.). Secondly, Prophetic dreams sent by God; as the dreams which God sent to Joseph, and which foretold his future greatness. (Gen. xxxvii. 5, 6.). Thirdly, Visions; as when a prophet in an ecstasy, being neither properly asleep nor awake, had supernatural revelations, (Gen. xv. 1. xlvi. 2.). Fourthly, The oracle of Urim and Thummim, which was accompanied with the ephod or the pectoral worn by the high priest, and which God had endued with the gift of foretelling things to come, (Numb. xii. 6. Joel. ii. 28.). This manner of inquiring of the Lord was often made use of, from Joshua\u2019s time to the erection of the temple at Jerusalem. Fifthly, After the building of the temple, they generally consulted the prophets, who were frequent in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. From Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who are the last of the prophets that have any of their writings remaining, the Jews pretend that God gave them what they call Bathcol, the daughter of the voice, which was a supernatural manifestation of the will of God, which was performed either by a strong inspiration or internal voice, or else by a sensible and\nOracle, and external voice, which was heard by a number of persons sufficient to bear testimony of it. For example, such was the voice that was heard at the baptism of Jesus Christ, saying, This is my beloved Son, &c. (Matt. iii. 17.)\n\nThe Scripture affords us examples likewise of profane oracles. Balaam, at the instigation of his own spirit, and urged on by his advice, fearing to lose the recompense that he was promised by Balak king of the Moabites, suggests a diabolical expedient to this prince, of making the Israelites fall into idolatry and fornication (Num. xxiv. 14-xxvi. 16.), by which he assures him of a certain victory, or at least of considerable advantage against the people of God.\n\nMicahiah the son of Imnah, a prophet of the Lord, says (1 Kings xxii. 21, &c.), that he saw the Almighty sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven round about him; and the Lord said, who shall tempt Ahab king of Israel, that he may go to war with Ramothgilead, and fall in the battle? One answered after another manner, and another in another. At the same time an evil spirit presented himself before the Lord, and said, I will seduce him. And the Lord asked him, How? To which Satan answered, I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets. And the Lord said, Go and thou shalt prevail. This dialogue clearly proves these two things: firstly, that the devil could do nothing by his own power; and, secondly, that with the permission of God, he could inspire the false prophets, sorcerers, and magicians, and make them deliver false oracles.\n\nReflecting the cessation of profane oracles there have been a variety of opinions; some of which we have already remarked. It has been generally held, indeed, that oracles ceased at the birth of Jesus Christ: Yet some have endeavoured to maintain the contrary, by showing that they were in being in the days of Julian, commonly called the Apollate, and that this emperor himself consulted them; nay, farther, say they, history makes mention of several laws published by the Christian emperors Theodosius, Gratian, and Valentinian, to punish persons who interrogated them, even in their days; and that the Epicureans were the first who made a jest of this superstition, and exposed the roguery of its priests to the people. As we suspect most of the facts here asserted should be understood in a qualified sense, we shall endeavour to discuss this point of controversy in as few words as possible, although it is undoubtedly a matter of some consequence.\n\n1st, The question, properly stated, is not, Whether oracles became extinct immediately upon the birth of Christ, or from the very moment he was born; but, If they fell gradually into disrepute and ceased, as Christ and his gospel became known to mankind. And that they did so, is most certain from the concurrent testimonies of the fathers, which, whoever would endeavour to invalidate, may equally give up the most respectable traditions and relations of every kind.\n\n2ndly, But did not Julian the apollate consult these oracles? We answer in the negative: he had indeed recourse to magical operations, but it was because oracles had already ceased; for he bewailed the loss of them, and assigned pitiful reasons for it; which St Cyril has vigorously refuted, adding, that he never could have offered such, but from an unwillingness to acknowledge, that when the world had received the light of Christ, the dominion of the devil was at an end.\n\n3rdly, The Christian emperors do indeed seem to condemn the superstition and idolatry of those who were still for consulting oracles; but the edicts of those princes do not prove that oracles actually existed in their times, any more than that they ceased in consequence of their laws. It is certain that they were for the most part extinct before the conversion of Constantine.\n\n4thly, Some Epicureans might make a jest of this superstition: however the Epicurean philosopher Celsus, in the second century of the church, was for crying up the excellency of several oracles, as appears at large from Origen's seventh book against him.","sp":340,"ep":343},{"h":"ORAE","t":"certain solemn sacrifices of fruits which were offered in the four seasons of the year, in order to obtain mild and temperate weather.

The wall was in 1682 entirely demolished by order of Louis XIV. and the inhabitants were exposed to the fury of the soldiery. The town was restored to King William by the treaty of Ryswick; but after his death the French took it again, and expelled the Protestant inhabitants. By the treaty of Utrecht it was confirmed to the crown of France, though the title is still retained in the house of Nassau. The title was first introduced into the family of Nassau, by the marriage of Claude de Chalons, the prince of Orange's father, with the count of Nassau, 1530. The principality is a very small district, it being only twelve miles in length and nine in breadth, and the revenue amounts to about 500l. a-year. The country is pleasant, and abounds with corn and fruit, but is exposed to violent winds. E. Long. 4. 49. N. Lat. 44. 9.\n\nMaurice Prince of ORANGE. See Maurice.\n\nORANGE River, also known by the name of the Great\nGreat river, is situated in southern Africa, and is of considerable extent. It seems to take its rise about S. Lat. 30\u00b0, and E. Long. 28\u00b0 from Greenwich, and joins the sea, after a west by north course for a number of leagues, between the great and little Namaquas, two tribes supposed to be of the same origin with the Hottentots. There are high cataracts in it, and it is subject to inundations like the Nile. Carcelians, calcareous, agates and variolites are found upon the shores.\n\nThe rains in the great mountains along the foot of which the Orange river runs, collecting their streams in its passage, commence in the month of November, and cause the inundations to take place towards the Namaqua country in the month of December. The nauseous custom of greasing the skin, from the great scarcity of water in many parts of South Africa, is rendered unnecessary among the people who inhabit the banks of this grand river; and of consequence they exhibit none of that filthy appearance which is characteristic of the Hottentots on the skirts of the colony.\n\n**Orange-Tree**, in Botany. See Citrus, Botany Index.\u2014Orange flowers are justly esteemed one of the finest perfumes; and though little used in medicine, yet the water distilled from them is accounted stomachic, cordial, and carminative. The fruit is cooling, and good in feverish disorders, and particularly in diarrhoeas. Orange-peel is an agreeable aromatic, proper to repair and strengthen the stomach, and gives a very grateful flavour to any infusions or tinctures into whole compositions it enters. It is particularly useful in preparations of the bark: gives an agreeable warmth to the infusion; and, according to Dr Percival, considerably increases its virtue.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions, No. 114, there is a very remarkable account of a tree standing in a grove near Florence, having an orange stock, which had been so grafted upon, that it became in its branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit, three-formed: some emulating the orange, some the lemon or citron, and some partaking of both forms in one; and what was very remarkable, was, that these mixed fruits never produced any perfect seeds: sometimes there were no seeds at all in them, and sometimes only a few empty ones.\n\n**Orange-Dew**, a kind of dew which falls in the spring time from the leaves of orange and lemon trees, which is extremely fine and subtile. M. de la Hire observing this, placed some flat pieces of glass under the leaves to receive it; and having procured some large drops of it, was desirous of discovering what it was. He soon found that it was not merely an aqueous fluid, because it did not evaporate in the air; and that it was not a resin, because it readily and perfectly mixed with water: it was natural then to suppose it a liquid gum; but neither did this, on examination, prove to be the case; for being laid on paper, it did not dry as the other liquid gums do. Its answering to none of these characters, and its being of the consistence of honey, and of a sweet sugar-like taste, gave a suspicion of its being a kind of manna; and whatever in the other trials had proved it not a resin, a gum, &c. all equally tends to prove that it is this substance.\n\n**Orange, Sea**, in Natural History, a name given by Count Marigli to a very remarkable species of marine substance, which he denominates a plant. It is tough and firm in its structure, and in many things resembles the common fucus; but instead of growing in the Orange, branched form which the generality of those substances have, it is round and hollow, and in every respect resembles the shape of an orange. It has, by way of root, some exceeding fine filaments, which fall on themselves to the rocks, or to shells, stones, or anything else that comes in the way. From these there grows no pedicle; but the body of the orange, as it is called, is fastened by them to the rock, or other solid substance. The orange itself is usually of about three or four inches in diameter; and while in the sea, is full of water, and even retains it when taken up. In this state it frequently weighs a pound and a half; but when the water is let out, and it is dried, it becomes a mere membrane, weighing scarce any thing. It is best preserved, by rubbing it with cotton as soon as the water is let out of it, and then hanging it up to dry. Its surface is irregular and rough, and its colour a dusky green on the outside, and a clearer but somewhat bluish green within; and its thickness is about an eighth part of an inch. When viewed by the microscope, it is seen to be all over covered with small glandules, or rather composed of them; for they stand so thick one by another as to leave no space between, and seem to make up the whole substance; so that it appears very like the rough flaggreen skin used to cover toys. There are indeed so many hollow ducts, through which the sea-water finds a passage into the globe formed by this skin, and by this means it is kept always full and distended; on cutting it with a pair of scissors, the water immediately runs out, and the skins collapse; but there is something extremely remarkable in this, for the whole substance, near the wounded place, is in motion, and seems as if alive, and sensible of the wound. The glandules are found full of water, and resembling small transparent bottles; and what goes to the structure of the plant beside these, is an assemblage of a vast number of filaments, all which are likewise hollow, and filled with a clear and transparent fluid.\n\nThere is another substance of this kind, mentioned and described by Count Marigli, Triumphetti, and others, and called the romafe or branched orange. This is very much of the nature of the former; but, instead of consisting of one round globule, it is formed of several oblong ones, all joined together, and representing the branches of some of the fucuses, only they are shorter; and these are all hollow and full of water, in the same manner as the single globes of the common kind. This has, by way of root, certain fine and slender filaments, which fall on it to the stones or shells near which it is produced; and it is of a dusky greenish colour on the surface, and of a fine bluish green within. The surface, viewed by the microscope, appears rough, as in the other, and the glandules are of the same kind, and are always found full of clear water.\n\n**Oration**, in Rhetoric, a speech or harangue, composed according to the rules of oratory, but spoken in public. Orations may be reduced to three kinds; viz. the demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial. To the demonstrative kind belong panegyrics, genealogies, epithalamia, congratulations, &c. To the deliberative kind belong persuasion, exhortation, &c. And to the judicial kind belong accusation, confutation, &c.\n\nFuneral.","sp":343,"ep":344},{"h":"ORATOR","t":"among the Romans, differed from a patronus: The latter was allowed only to plead causes on behalf of his clients; whereas the former might quit the forum and ascend the rostra or tribunal, to harangue the senate or the people. The orators had rarely a profound knowledge of the law, but they were eloquent, and their style was generally correct and concise. They were employed in causes of importance, instead of the common patrons. Orators in the violence of elocution used all the warmth of gesture, and even walked backwards and forwards with great heat and emotion. This it was which occasioned a witticism of Flavius Virginia, who asked one of those walking orators, *Quot milia passuum declamasti?* \"How many miles he had declaimed?\" Similar to the Roman orators were the Grecian Rhetors. See RHETORS.\n\nPublic ORATOR, an office of very considerable dignity, and of some emolument, in the English universities.\n\nThe public orator is the principal, and in many cases the only officiating agent for the university in all those matters or forms which are merely external. He carries on or superintends all correspondences which are calculated to promote the dignity, or raise the utility, of the seminary which constitutes him. He has little to do, indeed, with the internal government of the body, for which a variety of officers in different departments are appointed; but in all public affairs he is, as it were, the mouth of the whole; putting their deliberations into proper form, and communicating or publishing them, according to the intention of the university. Thus, if the whole university, or a committee appointed by them, or by statute, or by the will of any particular benefactor, have, after a comparative trial, adjudged a prize to any person or persons, it is the business of the public orator to inform the successful parties of the issue of the trial. Again, if for singular learning, or for any remarkable good will shown to the university by any person or persons, the senate or convocation are pleased to declare their grateful sense of it either by conferring degrees, or otherwise, as they think fit, the public orator is to notify this intention to the person or persons concerned; and so in other cases.\n\nAnother part of the public orator's business is to present young noblemen, or those who take honorary degrees, *tangquam nobilis*, to the vice chancellor; this he does in a Latin speech, which, according to circumstances, is either short or long; and of which the subject is generally a defence of that particular statute which allows the sons of noblemen, and some few others, to proceed to degrees before what is called the *statutable time*. In doing this, encomiums, often stronger than just, are made upon the learning and virtue of the noble candidate; a view is taken of the dignity of his ancient house; the honour is mentioned which has accrued to the university from the accession of such a member; and the oration concludes with promising great credit from his future conduct, as well as benefit from the influence of his rank in the state. These circumstances are deemed sufficient grounds for exempting the sons of noblemen from that tedious course of study, through which the duller sons of commoners must all pass before they be thought worthy of academical honours.","sp":344,"ep":345},{"h":"ORATORIO","t":"in the Italian music, a sort of sacred drama of dialogues; containing recitativos, ductos, trios, ritornellos, choruses, &c. The subjects of these pieces are usually taken from Scripture, or the life of some saint, &c. The music for the oratorios should be in the finest taste and best chosen strains. These oratorios are greatly used at Rome in the time of Lent, and of late in England.\n\nMenestrier attributes the origin of oratorios to the crusades, and says that the pilgrims returning from Jerusalem and the Holy Land, &c., composed songs reciting the life and death of the Son of God, and the mysteries of the Christian faith, and celebrating the achievements and constancy of saints and martyrs. Others, with more probability, observe, that the oratorio was an avowed imitation of the opera, with only this difference, that the foundation of it was always some religious or at least some moral subject. Crescimbeni ascribes its origin to San Filippo Neri, who was born at Florence in 1515, and who, in his chapel, after sermons, and other devotions, in order to allure young people to pious offices, had hymns, psalms, and such like prayers, sung by one or more voices. Among these spiritual songs were dialogues; and these entertainments becoming more frequent, and improving every year, were the occasion that in the seventeenth century oratorios were first invented, so called from the place of their origin. See Hawkins's History of Music.\n\nORATORY;","sp":345,"ep":345},{"h":"ORATORY","t":"Disposition. His oration for the Marian law; his repetition is very short. He proposed in the partition to speak to three things: The nature of the war against King Mithridates, the greatness of it, and what sort of general was proper to be intrusted with it. And when he has gone through each of these heads, and treated upon them very largely, he reduces the substance of what he has said to this general and short account: \"Since therefore the war is so necessary, that it cannot be neglected; and so great, that it requires a very careful management; and you can intrust it with a general of admirable skill in military affairs, of fingirable courage, the greatest authority, and eminent success; do you doubt to make use of this so great a blessing, conferred and bestowed upon you by heaven, for the preservation and enlargement of the Roman state?\" Indeed this repetition is made by Cicero, before he proceeds to the conclusion; and not at the end of his discourse, where it is usually longer and more particular; however, this may serve to show the nature of such a recital.\n\nBut sometimes a repetition is made, by running a comparison between the speaker's own arguments and those of the adverse party; and placing them in opposition to each other. And this method Cicero takes in the conclusion of his third oration upon the Agrarian law. And here sometimes the orator takes occasion to find fault with his adversary's management, in these and such like expressions: \"This part he has entirely dropt. To that he has given an invidious turn, or a false colouring. He leaves arguments, and flies to intreacies; and not without good reason, if we consider the weakness of his cause.\"\n\nBut when the discourse is very long, and the arguments insisted on have been many, to prevent the hearers growing out of patience by a more particular recital, the orator sometimes only just mentions such things, which he thinks of least consequence, by saying, that he omits or passes over them, till he comes to what is of greater moment, which he represents more fully. This method Cicero has taken in his defence of Cluentius; where, having run over several lesser heads in the manner now described, he then alters his expression, and introduces what was of more importance, by saying, \"What I first complain of, is that wickedness, which is now discovered.\" And so he proceeds more particularly to recite those things which immediately related to Cluentius. And this is what the writers upon this art call preterition. But this much may serve for repetition or recapitulation.\n\n2. We now proceed to the other part of the conclusion, which consists in an address to the passions. Indeed the orator sometimes endeavours occasionally to work upon the passions of his hearers in other parts of his discourse, but more especially in the conclusion, where he is warmest himself, and labours to make them so. For the main design of the introduction is to conciliate the hearers, and gain their attention; of the narration, proposition, and confirmation, to inform them; and of the conclusion, to move them. And therefore, to use Quintilian's words, \"Here all the springs of eloquence are to be opened. It is here we secure the minds of the hearers, if what went before was well managed. Now we are past the rocks and shallows, all the sails may be hoisted. And as the greatest part of the conclusion consists in illustration, the most pompous language and strongest figures have place here.\" Now the passions, to which the orator more particularly addresses, differ according to the nature of the discourse. In demonstrative orations, when laudatory\u2014love, admiration, and emulation, are usually excited; but in invectives\u2014hatred, envy, and contempt. In deliberative subjects, either the hope of gratifying some desire is set in view, or the fear of some impending evil. And in judicial discourses, almost all the passions have place, but more especially resentment and pity; inasmuch that most of the ancient rhetoricians mention only these two. But having treated upon the nature of the passions, and the methods suited both to excite and allay them, in a former chapter, we shall at present only add a few general observations, which may not be improper in this place, where the skill of the orator in addressing to them is more especially required.\n\nThe orator will observe what circumstances either of things, or persons, or both, will furnish him with motives proper to apply to those passions he desires to excite in the minds of his hearers. Thus Cicero, in his orations for Plancus and Sylla, moves his hearers from the circumstances of the men; but in his accusation of Verres, very frequently from the barbarity and horrid nature of his crimes; and from both, in his defense of Quintius.\n\nBut the same passion may be excited by very different methods. This is plain from the writings of those Roman satirists which are yet extant; for they have all the same design, and that is to engage men to a love of virtue, and hatred of vice: but their manner is very different, fitted to the genius of each writer. Horace endeavours to recommend virtue, by laughing vice out of countenance; Persius moves us to an abhorrence and detestation of vice, with the gravity and severity of a philosopher; and Juvenal, by open and vehement invectives. So orators make use of all these methods in exciting the passions; as may be seen by their discourses, and particularly those of Cicero. But it is not convenient to dwell long upon the same passion. For the image thus wrought up in the minds of the hearers does not last a great while; but they soon return to reflection. When the emotion, therefore, is once carried as high as it well can be, they should be left under its influence, and the speaker proceed to some new matter, before it declines again.\n\nMoreover, orators sometimes endeavour to raise contrary passions to each other, as they are concerned for opposite parties. So the accuser excites anger and resentment, but the defendant pity and compassion. At other times, one thinks it sufficient to allay and take off that passion which the other has raised, and bring the hearers to a calm and sedate consideration of the matter before them.\n\nBut this especially is to be regarded, that the orator expresses the same passion himself with which he endeavours to affect others; and that not only in his action and voice, but likewise in his language: and therefore his words, and manner of expression, should be suited to that perturbation and disorder of mind which he deigns to represent. However, a decency and propriety of character is always carefully to be observed; for, as Cicero very well remarks, \"A neglect of this is not only very culpable in life, but like-\nwide in discourse. Nor do the same things equally become every speaker, or every audience; nor every time, and every place.\" And therefore he greatly commends that painter, who, delineating to represent in a picture the sacrifice of Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, drew Calchas the priest with a sad countenance; Ulysses, her father's great friend, more dejected; and her uncle Menelaus, most disconsolate; but threw a veil over the face of Agamemnon himself, as being unable to express that excess of sorrow which he thought was proper to appear in his countenance. And this justness of character is admirably well observed by Cicero himself, in his defence of Milo; for as Milo was always known to be a man of the greatest resolution, and most undaunted courage, it was very improper to introduce him (as the usual method then was in capital cases) moving pity, and begging for mercy. Cicero therefore takes this part upon himself; and what he could not do with any propriety in the person of Milo, he performs in his own, and thus addresses the judges: \"What remains, but that I intreat and beseech you, that you would show that compassion to this brave man, for which he himself does not solicit, but I, against his inclination, earnestly implore and request. Do not be less inclined to acquit him, if in this our common sorrow, you see no tear fall from Milo's eyes; but perceive in him the same countenance, voice, and language, as at other times, steady and unmoved. Nay, I know not whether for this reason, you ought not much sooner to favour him: For if, in the contests of gladiators (persons of the lowest condition and fortune in life), we are wont to be displeased with the timorous and suppliant, and those who beg for their life; but interpose in favour of the brave and courageous, and such as expose themselves to death; and we show more compassion to those who do not sue for it, than to those who do: with how much greater reason ought we to act in the same manner towards the bravest of our fellow citizens?\" And as these words were agreeable to his own character, while soliciting behalf of another; so, immediately after, he introduces Milo speaking like himself, with a generous and undaunted air: \"These words of Milo (says he) quite sink and dispirit me, which I daily hear from him. Farewell, farewell, my fellow citizens, farewell! may you be happy, flourish, and prosper; may this renowned city be preserved, my most dear country, however it has treated me; may it continue in peace, though I cannot continue in it, to whom it owes its peace. I will retire, I will be gone.\"\n\nBut as persons are commonly more affected with what they see than with what they hear, orators sometimes call in the affluence of that sense in moving the passions. For this reason it was usual among the Romans, in judicial cases, for accused persons to appear with a dejected air and a sordid garb, attended by their parents, children, or other relations and friends, with the like dress and aspect; as likewise to show their scars, wounds, bloody garments, and other things of the like nature, in open court. So when, upon the death of Caesar, Mark Antony harangued the populace, he at the same time exposed to their view the garment in which he was stabbed, fixed upon a pole; at which sight they were so enraged, that immediately they ran with lighted torches to set fire to the houses of the conspirators. But this custom at last became so common, and was sometimes too ill conducted, that the force of it was greatly abated, as we learn from Quintilian. However, if the Romans proceeded to an excess on the one hand, the strictness of the Areopagites at Athens may perhaps be thought too rigid on the other; for in that court, if the orator began to say anything which was moving, an officer immediately stood up and bade him be silent. There is certainly a medium between these two extremes, which is sometimes not only useful, but even necessary; for, as Quintilian very justly says, \"It is necessary to apply to the passions, when those things which are true, just, and of common benefit, cannot be come at any other way.\"\n\nCHAP. VII. Of Digression, Transition, and Amplification.\n\nThe number, order, and nature of the parts which digression constitute a complete and regular oration, we have endeavoured to explain in several preceding chapters. But there are two or three things yet remaining, very necessary and likely to be known by an orator, which seem most properly to come under the second branch of his art. And these are, Digression, Transition, and Amplification.\n\nI. Digression, as defined by Quintilian, is, \"A going off from the subject we are upon to some different thing, which may however be of service to it.\" We have a very beautiful instance of this in Cicero's defence of Coriolanus, who was accused of having first borrowed money of Clodia, and then engaging her servants to poison her. Now, as the proof of the fact depended upon several circumstances, the orator examines them separately; and shows them to be all highly improbable. \"How (says he) was the design of this poison laid? Whence came it? how did they get it? by whose assistance, to whom, or where, was it delivered?\" Now to the first of these queries he makes the accuser give this answer: \"They say Coriolanus had it at home, and tried the force of it upon a slave provided on purpose, whose sudden death proved the strength of the poison.\" Now as Cicero represents the whole charge against Coriolanus as a fiction of Clodia, invented out of revenge for some slights he had put upon her; to make this the more probable, he intimates that she had poisoned her husband, and takes this opportunity to hint it, that he might show how easy it was for her to charge another with poisoning a servant, who had done the same to her own husband. But not contented with this, he steps out of his way, and introduces some of the last words of her husband Metellus, to render the fact more barbarous and shocking, from the admirable character of the man. \"O immortal gods! why do you sometimes wink at the greatest crimes of mankind, or delay the punishment of them to futurity! For I saw, I myself saw (and it was the most doleful scene of my whole life) when Q. Metellus was taken from the bosom of his country; and when he, who thought himself born to be serviceable to this state, within three days after he had appeared with such advantage in the senate, in the forum, and everywhere in public, was snatched from us in the flower of his age, and prime of his strength and vigour. At which time,\nDisposition when he was about to expire, and his mind had lost\nthe sense of other things, still retaining a concern for\nthe public, he looked upon me, as I was all in tears,\nand intimated in broken and dying words, how great\na storm hung over the city and threatened the whole\nstate; often striking the wall which separated his\nhouse from that of Quintus Catulus, and frequently\ncalling both upon him and me, and seeming to grieve\nnot so much at the approach of his own death, as that\nboth his country and I should be deprived of his al-\nfiance. Had he not been wickedly taken off on a\nsudden, how would he after his confusilip have with-\nstood the fury of his kinsman Publius Clodius, who,\nwhile in that office, threatened, in the hearing of the\nsenate, to kill him with his own hand, when he first\nbegan to break out? And will this woman dare to\ncome out of those doors, and talk of the force of poi-\nson? will not she fear, lest the house itself should\nspeak the villany? will not she dread the conscious\nwalls, nor that sad and mournful night? But I re-\nturn to the accusation.\" And then he proceeds to\nconsider and refute the several circumstances of the\naccusation. All this was no part of his argument;\nbut having mentioned the charge of poison, he im-\nmediately takes occasion to introduce it, in order to\nexcite the indignation of the hearers against Clodia,\nand invalidate the prosecution as coming from a person\nof her character. Digression cannot properly be said\nto be a necessary part of a discourse; but it may some-\ntimes be very convenient, and that upon several ac-\ncounts.\n\nAs first, when a subject is of itself flat and dry, or\nrequires close attention, it is of use to relieve and un-\nbend the mind by something agreeable and entertain-\ning. For which reason Quintilian observes, that the\norators of his time generally made an excursion in their\nharangues upon some pleasing topic, between the nar-\nration and the proof. But he condemns the practice\nas too general; for while they seemed to think it ne-\ncessary, it obliged them sometimes to bring in things\ntrifling and foreign to the purpose. Besides, a digre-\nssion is confined to no one part of a discourse, but may\ncome in anywhere, as occasion offers; provided it fall\nin naturally with the subject, and be made some way\nsubservient to it. We never meet with it in Cicero,\nwithout some evident and good reason. So in his pro-\nsecution of Verres for his barbarous and inhuman out-\nrages against the Sicilians, he takes an occasion to\nlaunch out in a beautiful description of the island, and\nto recount the advantages which accrued from it to the\nRomans. His subject did not necessarily lead him to\nthis, but his view in it was to heighten and aggravate\nthe charge against Verres.\n\nAgain, as a digression ought not to be made with-\nout sufficient reason, so neither should it be too fre-\nquent. And he who never does it but where it is\nproper and useful, will not often see occasion for it.\nFrequently to leave the subject, and go off to other\nthings, breaks the thread of the discourse, and is apt\nto introduce confusion. Indeed some kinds of writing\nadmit of a more frequent use of digressions than others.\nIn history they are often very serviceable. For as\nthat consists of a series of facts, and a long continued\nnarrative without variety is apt to grow dull and te-\ndious; it is necessary at proper distances to throw in\nsomething entertaining, in order to enliven it, and Disposition\nkeep up the attention. And accordingly, we find the\nbest historians often embellish their writings with de-\nscriptions of cities, rivers, and countries, as likewise\nwith the speeches of eminent persons upon important\noccasions, and other ornaments, to render them the\nmore pleasing and delightful. Poets take a still greater\nliberty in this respect; for as their principal view\nis most commonly to please, they do not attend so\nclosely to connection; but as an image offers itself,\nwhich may be agreeably wrought up, they bring it in,\nand go off more frequently to different things, than\nother writers.\n\nAnother property of a digression is, that it ought not\nto be too long, lest the hearers forget what preceded,\nbefore the speaker returns again to his subject.\n\nFor a digression being no principal part of a dis-\ncourse, nor of any further use than as it serves some\nway or other to enforce or illustrate the main subject;\nit cannot answer this end, if it be carried to such a\nlength, as to cause that either to be forgotten or ne-\nglected. And every one's memory will not serve him\nto connect together two parts of a discourse, which\nlie at a wide distance from each other. The better\ntherefore to guard against this, it is not unusual with\norators, before they enter upon a digression of any con-\nsiderable length, to prepare their hearers by giving\nthem notice of it, and sometimes desiring leave to di-\nvert a little from the subject. And so likewise at the\nconclusion they introduce the subject again by a short\ntransition. Thus Cicero in the example cited above,\nwhen he has finished his digression concerning the death\nof Metellus, proceeds to his subject again with these\nwords: \"But I return to the accusation.\"\n\nIndeed we find orators sometimes, when forc pre-\nceded, and the cause will not bear a close scrutiny, arti-\nfully run into digressions with a design to divert the\nattention of the hearers from the subject, and turn\nthem to a different view. And in such cases, as they\nendeavour to be unnoticed, so they do it tacitly\nwithout any transition or intimation of their design;\ntheir business being only to get clear of a difficulty,\ntill they have an opportunity of entering upon some\nfresh topic.\n\nII. Transitions are often used not only after a di-\ngressions, but likewise upon other occasions. A tran-\nsition is, \"A form of speech, by which the speaker\non various\noccasions,\nin a few words tells his hearers both what he has said\nalready, and what he next designs to say.\" Where a\ndiscourse consists of several parts, this is often very\nproper in passing from one to another, especially when\nthe parts are of a considerable length; for it affords\nthe hearers to carry on the series of the discourse in\ntheir mind, which is a great advantage to the memo-\nry. It is likewise a great relief to the attention, to\nbe told when an argument is finished, and what is to\nbe expected next. And therefore we meet with it\nvery frequently in history. But we consider it at pre-\nsent only as made use of by orators. Cicero, in his se-\ncond oration against Catiline, who had then left Rome,\nhaving at large described his conduct and designs, he\nadds: \"But why do I talk so long concerning one\nenemy, and such an one; who owns himself an ene-\nmy, and whom I do not fear, since, what I always de-\nsired, there is now a wall between us; and say nothing\nDiffusion, of those, who conceal themselves, who remain at Rome, and among us?\" And then he proceeds to give an account of the other conspirators.\n\nBut sometimes, in passing from one thing to another, a general hint of it is thought sufficient to prepare the hearers, without particularly specifying what has been said, or is next to follow. Thus Cicero in his second Philippic says, \"But those things are old, this is yet fresh.\" And again: \"But I have insisted too long upon trifles; let us come to things of greater moment.\" And at other times, for greater brevity, the transition is imperfect, and mention made only of the following head, without any intimation of what has been said already. As in Cicero's defence of Murcia, where he says: \"I must now proceed to the third part of my oration concerning the charge of bribery.\" And soon after: \"I come now to Cato, who is the support and strength of this charge.\"\n\nIII. The third and last head is, Amplification. Now by amplification is meant, not barely a method of enlarging upon a thing: but so to represent it in the fullest and most comprehensive view, as that it may in the liveliest manner strike the mind and influence the passions. Cicero, speaking of this, calls it the greatest commendation of eloquence; and observes, \"that it consists not only in magnifying and heightening a thing, but likewise in extenuating and lessening it.\" But though it consists of these two parts, and may be applied either way; yet to amplify, is not to set things in a false light, but to paint them in their just proportion and proper colours, suitable to their nature and qualities. Rhetoricians have observed several ways of doing this.\n\nOne is to ascend from a particular thing to a general. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Archias, having commended him as an excellent poet, and likewise observed, that all the liberal arts have a connection with each other, and a mutual relation between them, in order to raise a just esteem of him in the minds of his hearers, takes occasion to say many things in praise of polite literature in general, and the great advantages that may be received from it. \"You will ask me (says he), why we are so delighted with this man? Because he supplies us with those things which both refresh our minds after the noise of the forum, and delight our ears when wearied with contention. Do you think we could either be furnished with matter for such a variety of subjects, if we did not cultivate our minds with learning; or bear such a constant fatigue, without affording them that refreshment? I own I have always pursued these studies; let those be ashamed, who have so given up themselves to learning, as neither to be able to convert it to any common benefit, nor discover it in public. But why should it shame me, who have so lived for many years, that no advantage or ease has ever diverted me, no pleasure allure me, nor sleep retarded me from this pursuit. Who then can blame me, or who can justly be displeased with me, if I have employed that time in reviewing these studies, which has been spent by others in managing their affairs, in the celebration of festivals, or other diversions, in refreshments of mind and body, in unseasonable banquets, in dice, or tennis? And this ought the rather to be allowed me, because my ability as an orator has been improved by those pursuits, which, such as it is, was never wanting to assist my diffusion friends. And if it be effectuated but small, yet I am sensible from what spring I must draw those things which are of the greatest importance.\" With more to the same purpose; from which he draws this inference: \"Shall I not therefore love this man? shall I not admire him? shall I not by all means defend him?\"\n\nA contrary method to the former is, to descend from a general to a particular. As if any one, while speaking in commendation of eloquence, should illustrate what he says from the example of Cicero, and show the great services he did his country, and the honours he gained to himself, by his admirable skill in oratory. Our common way of judging of the nature of things is from what we observe in particular instances, by which we form general notions concerning them. When therefore we consider the character of Cicero, and the figure he made in the word, it leads us to conclude, there must be something very admirable in that art by which he became so celebrated. And this method he has taken himself in his oration for the Marian law, where having first intimated the scarcity of good generals at that time among the Romans, he then describes the virtues of a complete commander as a proof of it, and shows how many and great qualifications are necessary to form such a character, as courage, prudence, experience, and success: all which he afterwards applies to Pompey.\n\nA third method is by an enumeration of parts. So when Cicero, upon the defeat of Mark Antony before Mutina, proposed that a funeral monument should be erected in honour of the soldiers who were killed in that battle, as a comfort to their surviving relations; he does it in this way, to give it the greater weight: \"Since (says he) the tribute of glory is paid to the best and most valiant citizens by the honour of a monument, let us thus comfort their relations, who will receive the greatest consolation in this manner; their parents who produced such brave defenders of the state; their children who will enjoy these domestic examples of fortitude; their wives, for the loss of such husbands, whom it will be more fitting to extol than lament; their brethren, who will hope to resemble them no less in their virtues than their aspect. And I wish we may be able to remove the grief of all these by our resolutions.\" Such representations greatly enlarge the image of a thing, and afford the mind a much clearer view of it than if it were contracted into one single proposition.\n\nAgain, another method not much unlike the former is, when any thing is illustrated from a variety of causes. Thus Cicero justifies his behaviour in retiring, and not opposing his enemies, when they spirited up the mob in order to banish him, from the following reasons, which at that time determined him to such a conduct: \"When (says he) unless I was given up, so many armed fleets seemed ready to attack this single ship of the state, tooted with the tempests of seditions and discords, and the senate was now removed from the helm; when banishment, murder, and outrage, were threatened; when some, from an apprehension of their own danger, would not defend me; others were incited by an inveterate hatred to all good men, others thought I stood in the way, others took this opportunity to express their resentment, others envied the peace and tranquillity\nPart II.","sp":383,"ep":387},{"h":"ORATORY","t":"Disposition tranquillity of the state; and upon all these accounts I was particularly struck at: should I have chosen rather to oppose them (I will not say to my own certain destruction, but to the greatest danger both of you and your children), than alone to submit to and undergo what threatened us all in common?\" Such a number of reasons brought together, must set a thing in a very strong and clear light.\n\nThe like may be said of a number and variety of effects. Thus Cicero describes the force and excellence of oratory from its great and surprising effects, when he says, \"Nothing seems to be more excellent, than by discourse to draw the attention of a whole assembly, delight them, and sway their inclinations different ways at pleasure. This, in every free state, and especially in times of peace and tranquillity, has been always in the highest esteem and reputation. For what is either so admirable, as for one only, or a very few, out of a vast multitude, to be able to do that which all have a natural power of doing? or so delightful to hear, as a judicious and solid discourse in florid and polite language? or so powerful and grand, as to influence the populace, the judges, the senate, by the charms of eloquence? Nay, what is so noble, so generous, so magnificent, as to afford aid to supplicants, to support the afflicted, give safety, deliver from dangers, and preserve from exile? Or what is so necessary as to be always furnished with arms to guard yourself, assert your right, or repel injuries? And, not to confine our thoughts wholly to the courts of justice or the senate, what is there in the arts of peace more agreeable and entertaining than good language and a fine way of speaking? For it is in this especially wherein we excel other animals, that we can discourse together, and convey our thoughts to each other by words. Who therefore would not esteem, and in a particular manner endeavour to surpass others in that wherein mankind principally excels brute beasts? But to proceed to its chief advantages: What else would have drawn men into societies, or taken them off from a wild and savage life, and soften them into a polite and civilized behaviour; or, when settled in communities, have restrained them by laws?\" Who but, after such a description, must conceive the strongest passion for an art attended with so many great and good effects?\n\nA thing may likewise be illustrated by its opposite. So the blessings and advantages of peace may be recommended from the miseries and calamities of war; and thus Cicero endeavours to throw contempt upon Catiline and his party, by comparing them with the contrary side: \"But if, omitting all these things with which we abound, and they want, the senate, the knights, the populace, the city, treasury, revenues, all Italy, the provinces, and foreign nations; if, I say, omitting these things, we compare the causes themselves in which each side is engaged, we may learn from thence how despicable they are.\u2014For on this side meekness is engaged, on that impudence; on this chastity, on that lewdness; on this integrity, on that fraud; on this piety, on that profaneness; on this constancy, on that fury; on this honour, on that baseness; on this moderation, on that unbridled passion: In a word, equity, temperance, fortitude, prudence, and all virtues, contend with injustice, luxury, cowardice, rashness, and all vices; plenty with want; reason with folly; sobriety with madness; and, lastly, good hope with despair. In such a contest, did men desert us, would not heaven ordain that so many and so great vices should be defeated by these most excellent virtues?\"\n\nGradation is another beautiful way of doing this. So when Cicero would aggravate the cruelty and barbarity of Verres for crucifying a Roman citizen, which was a sort of punishment only inflicted upon slaves, he chooses this way of doing it. \"It is a crime (says he) to bind a Roman citizen, wickedness to whip him, and a sort of parricide to kill him; what then must I call it to crucify him? No name can sufficiently express such a villainy.\" And the images of things may be thus heightened, either by ascending, as in this instance; or descending, as in that which follows, relating to the same action of Verres: \"Was I not to complain of or bewail these things to Roman citizens, nor the friends of our state, nor those who had heard of the Roman name; nay, if not to men, but beasts; or, to go yet further, if in the most distant wilderness, to stones and rocks; even all mute and inanimate creatures would be moved by so great and heinous cruelty.\"\n\nAnd, to name no more, facts may be amplified from their circumstances; as time, place, manner, event, and the like. But instances of this would carry us too far; and therefore we shall only add, that as the design of amplification is not barely to prove or evince the truth of things, but also to adorn and illustrate them, it requires a florid and beautiful style, consisting of strong and emphatical words, flowing periods, harmonious numbers, lively tropes, and bright figures. But the consideration of these things comes under the Third Part of Oratory, upon which we are now to enter.\n\nPart III. Of Elocution.\n\nELOCUTION directs us to suit both the words and expressions of a discourse to the nature of the subject, or to speak with propriety and decency. This faculty is in one word called eloquence; and those persons who are possessed of it are therefore styled eloquent.\n\nElocution is twofold, general and particular. The former treats of the several proprieties and ornaments of language in common; the latter considers them as they are made use of to form different sorts of style.\n\nI. GENERAL ELOCUTION.\n\nThis, according to rhetoricians, consists of three parts; General Elegance, Composition, and Dignity. A discourse which elocution has all these properties suitably adjusted, must, with re-defined speech to the language, be perfect in its kind, and delightful to the hearers.\nElegance consists in two things, Purity and Perspicuity: And both these, as well with respect to single words, as their construction in sentences. These properties in language give it the name of elegant, for a like reason that we call other things so which are clean and neat in their kind. But in the common use of our tongue, we are apt to confound elegance with eloquence; and say, a discourse is elegant, when we mean by the expression, that it has all the properties of fine language.\n\n\u00a7 I. Purity.\n\nBy this we are to understand the choice of such words and phrases as are suited and agreeable to the use of the language in which we speak. And so grammarians reduce the faults they oppose to it to two sorts, which they call barbarism and solecism; the former of which respects single words, and the latter their construction. But we shall consider them jointly, and in a manner different from grammarians; for with them all words are esteemed pure which are once adopted into a language, and authorized by use. And as to phrases, or forms of expression, they allow them all the same claim, which are agreeable to the analogy of the tongue. But in oratory, neither all words nor all expressions are so called which occur in language; but such only as come recommended by the authority of those who speak or write with accuracy and politeness. Indeed it is a common saying that we should think with the learned, and speak with the vulgar. But the meaning of that expression is no more than that we should speak agreeably to the common usage of the tongue, that every one may understand us; and not choose such words or expressions as are either difficult to be understood, or may carry in them an appearance of affectation and singularity. But in order to set this matter in a clearer light, we shall here recount the principal things which vitiate the purity of language.\n\nAnd first, it often happens, that such words and forms of speaking as were introduced by the learned are afterwards dropped by them as mean and foolish, from a seeming benefit contracted by vulgar use. For polite and elegant speakers distinguish themselves by their discourse, as persons of figure do by their garb; one being the dress of the mind, as the other is of the body. And hence it comes to pass, that both have their different fashions, which are often changed; and as the vulgar affect to imitate those above them in both, this frequently occasions an alteration when either becomes too trite and common. But beside these forbidden words and expressions, which are rendered so by the use of the vulgar, there is another sort first introduced by them, which is carefully to be avoided by all those who are desirous to speak well. For the vulgar have their peculiar words and phrases, suited to their circumstances, and taken from such things as usually occur in their way of life. Thus in the old comedians, many things are spoken by servants, agreeable to their character, which would be very unbecoming from the mouth of a gentleman. And we cannot but daily observe the like instances among ourselves.\n\nAgain, this is common to language with all other human productions, that it is in its own nature liable to a constant change and alteration. For, as Horace has justly observed,\n\nAll human works shall waste;\nThen how can feeble words pretend to last?\n\nNothing could ever please all persons, or at least for any length of time. And there is nothing from which this can least be expected than language. For as the thoughts of men are exceedingly various, and words are the signs of their thoughts, they will be constantly inventing new signs to express them by, in order to convey their ideas with more clearness, or greater beauty. If we look into the different ages of the Latin writers, what great alterations and changes do we find in their language? How few now understand the remaining fragments of the twelve tables? Nay, how many words do we meet with even in Plautus, the meaning of which has not yet been fixed with certainty by the skill of the best critics? And if we consider our own language, it will appear to have been in a manner entirely changed from what it was a few ages since. To mention no others, our celebrated Chaucer is to most persons now almost unintelligible, and wants an expositor. And even since our own memory, we cannot but have observed, that many words and expressions, which a few years ago were in common use, are now in a manner laid aside and antiquated; and that others have constantly succeeded, and daily do succeed in their room. So true is that observation of the same poet:\n\nSome words that have or else will feel decay\nShall be refor'd, and come again in play;\nAnd words now fam'd shall not be fancied long;\nThey shall not please the ear, nor move the tongue:\nAs use shall these approve, and those condemn;\nUse, the sole rule of speech, and judge supreme.\n\nWe must therefore no less abstain from antiquated or obsolete words and phrases, than from forlorn ones, though all old words are not to be thought antiquated. By the former we mean such as, though of an ancient standing, are not yet entirely diffused nor their signification lost. And from the use of these we are not to be wholly debarred, especially when they appear more significant than any others we can fix upon. But as to phrases or expressions, greater caution seems still necessary: and such as are old should doubtless, if at all, be used more sparingly. The Latin tongue was brought to its greatest perfection in the reign of Augustus, or somewhat sooner; and he himself studied it very carefully. For, as Suetonius tells us, \"He applied himself to eloquence, and the study of the liberal arts, from his childhood, with great diligence and labour. He chose a manner of speaking which was smooth and elegant; he avoided the ill favour, as he used to call it, of antiquated words; and he was wont to blame Tiberius for his affectation of them.\" In our own language, such words are to be esteemed antiquated, which the most polite persons have dropped, both in their discourse and writings; whose example we should follow, unless we would be thought to converse rather with the dead than the living.\n\nBut further: As on the one hand we must avoid obsolete words and phrases; so, on the other, we should refrain\nElocution refrains from new ones, or such whose use has not yet been sufficiently established, at least among those of the best taste. Words may be considered as new in two respects; either when they are first brought into a language, or when they are used in a new sense. As the former of these may sometimes leave us in the dark by not being understood, so the latter are most apt to mislead us; for when we hear a word that has been familiar to us, we are presently led to fix that idea to it with which it has usually been attended. And therefore, in both cases, some previous intimation may be necessary. Cicero, who perhaps enlarged the furniture of the Roman tongue more than any one person besides, appears always very cautious how he introduces anything new, and generally gives notice of it when he attempts it, as appears in many instances scattered through his works. What bounds we are now to fix to the purity of the Latin tongue, in the use of it, the learned are not well agreed. It is certain, our furniture is much less than when it was a living language, and therefore the greater liberty must of necessity be sometimes taken. So that their opinion seems not unadvisable, who direct us to make choice principally of what we are furnished with from the writers of the Augustan age; and where we cannot be supplied from them, to make use of such authors as lived nearest to them, either before or since. And as to our own tongue, it is certainly prudent to be as careful how we admit anything into it that is uncouth or disagreeable to its genius, as the ancient Romans were into theirs; for the perfection of a language does in a great measure consist in a certain analogy and harmony running through the whole, by which it may be capable of being brought to a standard.\n\nBut besides those things already mentioned, any mistake in the sense of words, or their construction, is opposed to purity. For to speak purely, is to speak correctly. And such is the nature of these faults in elocution, that they are often not so easy to be observed by hearing as by reading. Whence it is, that many persons are thought to speak better than they write; for while they are speaking, many slips and inaccuracies escape disregarded, which in reading would presently appear. And this is more especially the case of persons unacquainted with arts and literature; who, by the affluence of a lively fancy and flow of words, often speak with great ease and freedom, and by that means please the ear; when, at the same time, what they say, would not so well bear reading.\n\nWe shall only add, that a distinction ought likewise to be made between a poetical diction and that of prose writers. For poets in all languages have a sort of peculiar dialect, and take greater liberties, not only in their figures, but also in their choice and disposition of words; so that what is a beauty in them would often appear unnatural and affected in prose.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of Perspicuity.\n\nPerspicuity, as well as purity, consists partly in single words, and partly in their construction.\n\n1. As to single words, those are generally clearest and best understood which are used in their proper sense. But it requires no small attention and skill to be well acquainted with the force and propriety of words; which ought to be duly regarded, since the perspicuity of a discourse depends so much upon it. Caesar seems plainly to have been of this mind, when he tells us, \"The foundation of eloquence consists in the choice of words.\" It may not be amiss, therefore, to lay down some few observations, by which the distinct notions of words and their peculiar force may more easily be perceived. All words may be divided into proper words and tropes. Those are called proper words, which are expressed in their proper and usual sense. And tropes are such words as are applied to some other thing than what they properly denote, by reason of some similitude, relation, or contrariety between the two things. So, when a subtle artful man is called a fox, the reason of the name is founded in a similitude of qualities. If we say, Cicero will always live, meaning his works, the cause is transferred to the effect. And when we are told, Caesar conquered the Gauls, we understand that he did it with the assistance of his army; where a part is put for the whole, from the relation between them. And when Cicero calls Antony a fine guardian of the state, every one perceives he means the contrary. But the nature and use of tropes will be explained more fully hereafter in their proper place. All words must at first have had one original and primary signification, which, strictly speaking, may be called their proper sense. But it sometimes happens, through length of time, that words lose their original signification, and assume a new one, which then becomes their proper sense. So loxus in the Latin tongue at first signified a stranger; but afterwards that sense of the word was entirely laid aside, and it was used to denote a public enemy. And in our language, it is well known, that the word knave anciently signified a servant. The reason of the change seems to be much the same, as in that of the Latin word latro; which first signified a soldier, but afterwards a robber. Besides, in all languages, it has frequently happened, that many words have gradually varied from their first sense to others somewhat different; which may, notwithstanding, all of them, when rightly applied, be looked upon as proper. Nay, in process of time, it is often difficult to say which is the original, or most proper sense. Again, sometimes two or more words may appear to have the same signification with each other, and may therefore be used indifferently; unless the beauty of the period, or some other particular reason, determine to the choice of one rather than another. Of this kind are the words ensis and gladius in the Latin tongue; and in ours, pity and compassion. And there are other words of no near an affinity to each other, or at least appear so from vulgar use, that they are commonly thought to be synonymous. Such are the words mercy and pity; though mercy in its strict sense is exercised towards an offender, and pity respects one in distresses. As this peculiar force and distinction of words is carefully to be attended to, so it may be known several ways. Thus the proper signification of substantives may be seen by their application to other substantives. As in the instance just now given, a person is said to show mercy to a criminal, and pity to one in distress. And in the like manner, verbs are distinguished, by being joined to some certain nouns, and not to others. So a person is said to command an inferior, to treat a superior, and to desire an equal. Adjectives also, which denote the properties...\nproperties of things, have their signification determined by those subjects to which they most properly relate. Thus we say, an honest mind, and a healthy body; a wise man, and a fine house. Another way of distinguishing the propriety of words, is by their use in gradations. As if one should say, Hatreds, grudges, quarrels, tumults, seditions, wars, spring from unbridled passions. The proper sense of words may likewise be known by observing to what other words they are opposed, or used as equivalent. So in that passage of Cicero, where he says, \"I cannot perceive why you should be angry with me; if it be because I defend him whom you accuse, why may not I be displeased with you for accusing him whom I defend? You say, I accuse my enemy; and I say, I defend my friend.\" Here the words accuse and defend, friend and enemy, are opposed; and to be angry and displeased, are used as terms equivalent. Lastly, the derivation of words contributes very much to determine their true meaning. Thus because the word manners comes from the word man, it may properly be applied either to that or any other put for it. And therefore we say, the manners of men, and the manners of the age, because the word age is there used for the men of the age. But if we apply the word manners to any other animal, it is a trope. By these and such like observations we may perceive the proper sense and peculiar force of words, either by their connection with other words, distinction from them, opposition to them, equivalency with them, or derivation. And by thus fixing their true and genuine signification, we shall easily see when they become tropes. But though words, when taken in their proper signification, generally convey the plainest and clearest sense; yet some are more forcible, honorous, or beautiful, than others. And by these considerations we must often be determined in our choice of them. So whether we say, he got, or he obtained, the victory, the sense is the same; but the latter is more full and honorous. In Latin, timeo signifies I fear; pertineo is more full and significant; and pertinacissimo more honorous than either of the former. The Latin and Greek languages have much the advantage of ours in this respect, by reason of their compositions; by the help of which they can often express that in one word for which we are obliged to put two words, and sometimes more. So pertineo cannot be fully expressed in our language by one word; but we are forced to join one or two particles to the verb, to convey its just idea, and say, I greatly, or very much fear; and yet even then we scarce seem to reach its full force. As to tropes, though generally speaking they are not to be chosen where plainness and perspicuity of expression is only designed, and proper words may be found; yet through the penury of all languages, the use of them is often made necessary. And some of them, especially metaphors, which are taken from the multitude of things, may, when custom has rendered them familiar, be considered as proper words, and used in their stead. Thus, whether we say, I see your meaning, or, I understand your meaning, the sense is equally clear, though the latter expression is proper, and the former metaphorical, by which the action of seeing is transferred from the eyes to the mind.\n\nII. But perspicuity arises not only from a choice of single words, but likewise from the construction of them in sentences. For the meaning of all the words in a sentence, considered by themselves, may be very plain and evident; and yet, by reason of a disorderly placing them, or confusion of the parts, the sense of the whole may be very dark and obscure. Now it is certain that the most natural order is the plainest; that is, when both the words and parts of a sentence are so disposed, as best agrees with their mutual relation and dependence upon each other. And where this is changed, as is usually done, especially in the ancient languages, for the greater beauty and harmony of the periods; yet due regard is had by the best writers to the evidence and perspicuity of the expression.\n\nBut to set this subject in a clearer light, on which the perfection of language so much depends, we shall mention some few things which chiefly occasion obscurity; and this either with respect to single words, or their construction.\n\nAnd first, all ambiguity of expression is one cause of obscurity. This sometimes arises from the different senses in which a word is capable of being taken. So we are told, that upon Cicero's addressing himself to Octavius Caesar, when he thought himself in danger from his resentment, and reminding him of the many services he had done him, Octavius replied, He came the last of his friends. But there was a designed ambiguity in the word last, as it might either respect the time of his coming, or the opinion he had of his friendship. And this use of ambiguous words we sometimes meet with, not only in poetry, where the turn and wit of an epigram often rest upon it; but likewise in prose, either for pleasantry or ridicule. Thus Cicero calls Sextus Clodius the light of the senate, which is a compliment he pays to several great men, who had distinguished themselves by their public services to their country. But Sextus, who had a contrary character, was a relation of P. Clodius, whose dead body, after he had been killed by Milo, he carried in a tumultuous manner into the senate-house, and there burnt it with the senators' benches, in order to inflame the populace against Milo. And it is in allusion to that riotous action, that Cicero, using this ambiguous expression, calls him the light of the senate. In such instances, therefore, it is a beauty, and not the fault we are cautioning against: as the same thing may be either good or bad, as it is differently applied.\u2014Though even in such designed ambiguities, where one sense is aimed at, it ought to be sufficiently plain, otherwise they lose their intention. And in all serious discourses they ought carefully to be avoided. But obscurity more frequently arises from the ambiguous construction of words, which renders it difficult to determine in what sense they are to be taken. Quintilian gives us this example of it: \"A certain man ordered in his will, that his heir should erect for him a statue holding a spear made of gold.\" A question arises here, of great consequence to the heir from the ambiguity of the expression, whether the words made of gold are to be applied to the statue or the spear; that is, whether it was the design of the testator by this appointment, that the whole statue, or only the spear, should be made of gold. A small note of distinction, differently placed between the parts of this sentence, would clear up the doubt, and determine the sense either way.\nElocution way. For if one comma be put after the word flate, and another after spear, the words made of gold must be referred to the statue, as if it had been said, a statue, made of gold, holding a spear. But if there be only the first comma placed after statue, it will limit the words made of gold to the spear only; in the same sense as if it had been said, A statue holding a golden spear. And either of these ways of expression would in this case have been preferable, for avoiding the ambiguity, according to the intention of the tellator. The ancient heathen oracles were generally delivered in such ambiguous terms. Which, without doubt, were so contrived on purpose, that those who gave out the answers might have room left for an evasion. See Oracle.\n\nAgain, obscurity is occasioned either by too short and concise a manner of speaking, or by sentences too long and prolix; either of these extremes have sometimes this bad consequence. We find an instance of the former in Pliny the Elder, where speaking of heliobore, he says, \"They forbid it to be given to aged persons and children, and less to women than men.\" The verb is wanting in the latter part of the sentence, and less to women than men: which in such cases being usually supplied from what went before, would here stand thus; and they forbid it to be given less to women than men. But this is directly contrary to the sense of the writer, whose meaning is, either that it is ordered to be given in a less quantity to women than men, or not so frequently to women as men. And therefore the word order is here to be supplied, which being of a contrary signification to forbid, expressed in the former part of the sentence, occasions the obscurity. That long periods are often attended with the same ill effect, must be so obvious to every one's experience, that it would be entirely needless to produce any examples in order to convince the truth of it. And therefore we shall only observe, that the best way of preventing this seems to be by dividing such sentences as exceed a proper length into two or more; which may generally be done without much trouble.\n\nAnother cause of obscurity, not inferior to any yet mentioned, is parenthesis, when it is either too long or too frequent. This of Cicero, in his oration for Sylla, is longer than we usually find in him: \"O immortal gods! (for I must attribute to you what is your own; nor indeed can I claim so much to my own abilities, as to have been able of myself to go through so many, so great, such different affairs, with that expedition, in that boisterous tempest of the state), you inflamed my mind with a desire to save my country.\" But where any obscurity arises from such sentences, they may frequently be remedied by much the same means as was just now hinted concerning long and prolix periods; that is, by separating the parenthesis from the rest of the sentence, and placing it either before or after. So in this sentence of Cicero, the parenthesis may stand last, in the following manner:\u2014 \"O immortal gods! you inflamed my mind with a desire to save my country: for I must attribute to you what is your own; nor indeed can I claim so much to my own abilities, as to have been able of myself to go through so many, so great, such different affairs, with that expedition, in that boisterous tempest of the state.\"\n\nThis order of the sentence is very plain, and less involved than the former.\n\nChap. II. Of Composition.\n\nComposition, in the sense it is here used, gives rules for the structure of sentences, with the several members, words, and syllables, of which they consist, divided in such a manner as may best contribute to the force, beauty, and evidence of the whole.\n\nComposition consists of four parts, which rhetoricians call period, order, juncture, and number. The first of these treats of the structure of sentences; the second, of the parts of sentences, which are words and members; and the two last, of the parts of words, which are letters and syllables. For all articulate sounds, and even the most minute parts of language, come under the cognizance of oratory.\n\n\u00a7. 1. Of Period.\n\nIn every sentence or proposition, something is said of something. That of which something is said, logicians call the subject, and that which is said of it, the predicate; but in grammatical terms, the former is a noun substantive of the nominative case, and the latter a finite verb, denoting affirmation, and some state of being, acting, or suffering. These two parts may of themselves constitute a sentence: As when we say, The sun shines, or the clock strikes, the word sun and clock are the subject in these expressions, shines and strikes imply each the copula and predicate. Most commonly, however, the noun and the verb are accompanied with other words, which in grammatical construction are said either to be connected with or to depend upon them; but in a logical consideration they denote some property or circumstance relating to them. As in the following sentence: a good man loves virtue for itself. The subject of this sentence is a good man: and the predicate, or thing affirmed of him, that he loves virtue for itself. But the two principal or necessary words, on which all the rest depend, are man and loves. Now a simple sentence consists of one such noun and verb, with whatever else is joined to either or both of them. And a compound sentence contains two or more of them; and may be divided into so many distinct propositions, as there are such nouns and verbs, either prefixed or underflood. So in the following sentence, Compliance gains friends, but truth procures hatred, there are two members, each of which contains in it an entire proposition. For, Compliance gains friends is one complete sentence, and Truth procures hatred is another; which are connected into one compound sentence by the particle but. Moreover, it frequently happens, that compound sentences are made up of such parts or members, some if not all of which are themselves compounded, and contain in them two or more simple members. Such is that of Sallust: \"Ambition has betrayed many persons into deceit; to say one thing, and to mean another; to found friendship and enmity, not upon reason, but interest; and to be more careful to appear honest, than really to be so.\" This sentence consists of four members; the last of which three, consisting of opposite parts, are all compounded, as will appear.\nappear by expressing them at length in the following manner; Ambition has betrayed many persons into deceit; [that is, ambition] has betrayed them to say one thing, and to mean another; it has betrayed them to found friendship and enmity, not upon reason, but interest; and it has betrayed them to be more careful to appear honest, than really to be so. The three last of these members, beginning with the words it betrays, are all of them compounded, and consist of two opposite members; which might each of them be expressed at length in the same manner, by supplying the ellipsis. As, Ambition has betrayed many persons to say one thing, and it has betrayed them to mean another. And so of the rest. From this instance we see how much is left to be supplied by the mind in all discourse, which if expressed would both destroy its harmony and render it exceedingly tedious. But still regard must be had to that which is omitted, so as to render what is said consistent with it; otherwise there can be no propriety in what is spoken. Nor can the members of a sentence be distinguished and duly ranged in their proper order, without this.\n\nBut to proceed: Some sentences consist either wholly, or in part, of such members as contain in them two or more compound ones, which may therefore, for distinction's sake, be called decomposed members.\u2014Of this kind is that of Cicero, in his defence of Milo: \"Great is the force of conscience, great either way: that those persons are not afraid who have committed no offence; and those who have offended always think punishment present before their eyes.\" The latter member of this sentence, which begins with the word that, contains in it two compound members, which represent the different state of mind between innocent and guilty persons. And it is in the proper distinction and separation of the members in such complex sentences that the art of pointing chiefly consists. For the principal use of a comma is to divide the simple members, a semicolon the compound ones, a colon such as are decomposed, and a period the whole from the following sentence. We mention this rather, to show the different acceptation of these terms by grammarians, from that of the ancient writers upon oratory. For these latter apply them to the sense, and not to any points of distinction. A very short member, whether simple or compound, with them is a comma, and a longer a colon; for they have no such term as a semicolon. Besides, they call a very short sentence, whether simple or compound, a comma, and one of somewhat a greater length, a colon. And therefore if a person expressed himself either of these ways in any considerable number of sentences together, he was said to speak by commas or colons. But a sentence containing more words than will consist with either of these terms, they call a simple period; the least compound period with them requiring the length of two colons. However, this way of denominating sentences, and the parts of them, rather from their length than the nature of them, appearing not so suitable, we have chosen rather to make use of the terms simple and compound members; and to call all those compound periods, which contain two or more members, whether simple or compound.\n\nBut to proceed: Sentences, with respect to their form or composition, are distinguished into two sorts, called by Cicero tradi, \"straight or direct;\" and Elocution contorta, \"bent or winding.\" By the former are meant those whose members follow each other in a direct order, without any inflection; and by the latter, those which strictly speaking are called periods. For \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 in Greek signifies a circuit or circle. And so the Latins call it circulatus and ambitus. By which both of them mean a sentence consisting of correspondent parts, so framed, that the voice in pronouncing them may have a proper elevation and cadency, and distinguish them by its inflection; and as the latter part returns back, and unites with the former, the period, like a circle, surrounds and incloses the whole sense. This elevation of the voice in the former part of the period, is by the Greeks called \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, and by the Latins propositio; and the depression of it in the latter part, by the one \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, and by the other reddito.\n\nNow as simple sentences have not these correspondent parts, which require any inflection of the voice; nor a circular form, by reason of their brevity; they are not properly periods; in the strict sense of the word: though, in common speech, the words sentence and period are often used as equivalent terms. Thus, if we say, Generous minds are incited to the performance of noble exploits from motives of glory; here is no distinction of parts, nor inflection of the voice in this sentence. And indeed there is not anything which relates to the structure of these sentences, but what will more properly be taken notice of in the second part of composition, which is order.\n\nAnd as to those compound sentences, whose members follow each other in a direct order, without any inflection, there is little art required in their composition. We shall produce one example of this kind from Cicero: \"Natural reason inclines men to mutual concurrence and society; and implants in them a strong affection for those who spring from them; and excites them to form communities, and join in public assemblies; and, for these ends, to endeavour to procure both the necessaries and conveniences of life; and that not for themselves only, but likewise for their wives, children, and others who are dear to them, and have a right to their assistance.\" Here are five short members in this sentence, placed in a series, without any inflection of the parts, or orbit of the whole. And as such sentences have no other boundary but the conclusion of the sense, suited to the breath or the speaker, he may either contract or lengthen them at pleasure, without offending the ear. So, should the sentence last mentioned conclude with the first member in this manner, Natural reason inclines men to mutual concurrence and society; the sense would be perfect, and the ear satisfied. The case would be the same at the end of the second member, thus: Natural reason inclines men to mutual concurrence and society, and implants in them a strong affection for those who spring from them. And the like may be said of the rest. Since such sentences therefore may be thus limited at pleasure, it seems more convenient both for the speaker and hearers to confine them to a moderate length.\n\nBut because the principal art relating to this part of composition lies in the frame and structure of such compound sentences as are properly called periods, we shall treat upon these somewhat more largely. In the formation\nElocution. tion of these periods, two things are chiefly to be re-\ngarded; their length and cadency. As the length ought\nto be suited to the breath of the speaker, the ancient\nrhetoricians scarce admit of more than four columns; by\nwhich we may here understand compound members of a\nmoderate size, which will be generally found a suitable\nand proportionate length. For to extend them farther\nthan the voice can well manage, must be painful to the\nspeaker and of consequence unpleasing to the hearers. As\nto the cadency, what Cicero has observed, is found true by\nexperience, that the ears judge what is full and what is\ndeficient; and direct us to fill up our periods, that no-\nthing be wanting of what they expect. When the\nvoice is raised at the beginning of a sentence, they are\nin suspense till it be finished; and are pleased with a\nfull and just cadency, but are sensible of any defect, and\nare displeased with redundancy. Therefore care must\nbe taken that periods be neither deficient, and as it were\nmaimed, that is, that they do not drop before their time,\nand defraud the ears of what seemed to be promised\nthem; nor, on the other hand, offend them by too\nlong and immoderate excursions. This rise and caden-\ncy of the voice in pronunciation, depend on the na-\nture and situation of the members, as we shall endea-\nvour to show by particular instances; in the explication\nof which, by the word members, are to be understood\nsuch as are uncompounded. In a period of two members,\nthe turn of the voice begins with the latter member.\nOf this kind is the following sentence of Cicero: \"If\nimpudence prevailed as much in the forum and courts\nof justice, as insolence does in the country and places\nof less resort; Aulus Caecina would submit as much to\nthe impudence of Sextus Eubutius in this cause, as he\ndid before his insolence when affronted by him.\"\nHere the cadency begins at the words Aulus Caecina.\nIf a sentence consist of three members, the inflection is\nbest made at the end of the second member: for if it\nbegin immediately after the first, the voice will be either\napt to sink too low, and not be heard, before it reach\nthe end; or else be precipitated, in order to prevent it.\nCicero begins his oration for Milo with a sentence of\nthis form: \"Although I fear, it may be a shame to be\ndismayed at the entrance of my discourse in defence of\na most valiant man; and that it nowise becomes me,\nwhile Milo is more concerned for the safety of the state\nthan for himself, not to show the same greatness of mind\nin his behalf: yet this new form of prosecution terrifies\nmy eyes, which, whatever way they turn, want the an-\ncient custom of the forum, and former manner of trials.\"\nHere the cadency, beginning at the third member with\nthe word yet, makes a proper division of the sentence,\nand easy for the speaker. But a period of four members\nis reckoned the most complete and perfect, where the in-\nflection begins at the middle, that is, with the third\nmember. Nor is it the same case here, as if, in a sen-\ntence of three members, the cadency be made at the se-\ncond. For in proportion to the time of raising the voice\nmay the space be allowed for its sinking. The follow-\ning sentence of Cicero gives us an instance of this, where\nhe speaks to his son: \"Although, son Mark, having\nnow been an hearer of Cratinus for a year, and this at\nAthens, you ought to abound in the precepts and doc-\ntrines of philosophy, by reason of the great character\nboth of your instructor and the city; one of which can\nfurnish you with knowledge, and the other with exam-\nples: yet, as I always to thy advantage joined the La-\ntin tongue with the Greek, and have done it not only\nin oratory, but likewise in philosophy; I think you ought\nto do the same, that you may be equally conversant in\nboth languages.\" The turn in this period begins at the\nword yet; which standing near the middle, the voice is\nraised to that pitch in pronouncing the former part, as\nto admit of a gradual cadency, without being lost be-\nfore the conclusion of the sentence. But where the\nsentence does not suit with this division at the entrance upon\nthe third member, it is best made at the fourth. Such\nis the following sentence of Cicero: \"If I have any\ngenius, which I am sensible is very small; or any readi-\nness in speaking, wherein I do not deny but I have been\nmuch conversant; or any skill in oratory, from an ac-\nquaintance with the best arts, to which I confess I have\nbeen always inclined; no one has a better right to de-\nmand of me the fruit of all these things than this Aul-\nus Caecina.\" The cadency of this sentence does not\nbegin till the words no one; yet it ends handsomely,\nand without disappointing the ear. Though indeed the\nthree first members having each of them an inflection,\ncheck the elevation of the voice, and by that variety in\nthe pronunciation add to the harmony of the sentence.\nAn equality of the members should likewise be attended\nto in the composition of a period, the better to adjust\ntheir rise and cadency. And for this reason, in sen-\ntences of three members, where the cadency begins with\nthe third; or in those of four members, where it begins\nat the fourth; it promotes the harmony to make the\nlast member longest. This is properly the nature of\nrhetorical periods, which when rightly formed have\nboth an equal beauty and dignity in their composi-\ntion.\n\nBut as all discourse is made up of distinct sen-\ntences, and whenever we express our thoughts it is in\nsome of the forms above mentioned; so the use of\nthem is not promiscuous, but suited to answer different\ndesigns in speaking. And in this view they are con-\nsidered and made use of by the orator, as will be shown\nhereafter.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of Order.\n\nBy order, rhetoricians mean the placing each word\nand member of a sentence in such a manner as will\ntend and most contribute to the force, beauty, or evidence of the\nwhole.\n\nOrder is of two kinds, natural and artificial. And\neach of these may be considered with respect to the\nparts either of simple or compound sentences.\n\nAs to simple sentences, we may call that order natu-\nral, when all the words in a sentence are so placed, as\nthey are connected with or follow each other in a gram-\nmatical construction. And it may properly enough ad-\nmit of this name, as it is founded in the nature of a\nproposition, and the relation of the several words of\nwhich it consists to each other. This we explained in\nthe last chapter, and illustrated by proper examples; and\nshall therefore only give one instance of it here, to in-\ntroduce the subject we are now upon. And it is this:\nThe fame of Ifocrates excited Arisbole to the profession\nof oratory. Here these words, the fame of Ifocrates,\ncontain the subject of this sentence, with what relates to\nit; and all those which follow, excited Arisbole to the\nprofession of oratory, make up the predicate and its de-\npendents.\nElocution, pendants. And in both parts each word grammatically considered stands in its proper order of construction. And this seems agreeable to the natural way of conveying our thoughts, which leads us first to express the subject or thing of which some other thing is said, before the predicate or that which is said concerning it; and with respect to both, as every idea succeeds another in the order of our conceptions, to range it in the same order when we communicate them to others. Our language in the general keeps pretty much to this method. But in one thing particularly it recedes from it; and that is, in placing adjectives, which denote the properties of things, before their substantives or subjects, whose properties they are: As when it is said, Evil communication corrupts good manners. And this we always do except something follows which depends upon the adjective. So we say, He was a man eminent for his virtue: not an eminent man.\n\nArtificial order, as it respects simple sentences, has little or no regard to the natural construction of words; but disposes them in such a manner as will be most agreeable to the ear, and best answer the design of the speaker. The Latins take a much greater liberty in this respect than we do, or than the nature of our language will permit. Quintilian says, it is best for the verb to stand last, when there is no particular reason to the contrary. And he gives this reason for it, because the force of the sentence lies in the verb. So that, according to him, they seem to have had this view in putting the verb at the end; that as the whole sentence is imperfect without the verb, the mind being thus held in suspense might receive the deeper impression from it at last. They likewise separate such words as have an immediate relation between them or dependence one upon another, and place any of them first or last as they please. In short, their order seems in a manner arbitrary, if it does not break in upon perspicuity, to which they usually attend. But most of these things are unsuitable to the genius of our language. One might say indeed, Convince him, you cannot: instead of saying, You cannot convince him: Or, With my own eyes I saw it; or, I saw it with my own eyes. And again: In proportion to the increase of luxury the Roman state declined: for, The Roman state declined in proportion to the increase of luxury. But this inversion of words is proper in English composition only when it gives force to the expression; as in the higher style it often does. It serves to impress known truths upon the mind, but is unfit for communicating the first principles of knowledge.\n\nAs to compound sentences, that is, such as consist of two or more members, either simple or compounded; what relates to the words in each member separately is the same as in simple sentences. But with regard to the disposition of the several members, that may be called the natural order, which so places them as they mutually depend on each other. Thus the antecedent member naturally precedes the relative; as in this expression, Men are apt to forgive themselves what they blame in others. In hypothetical sentences the conditional member naturally stands first. Thus: If Socrates be a rational creature, he is a man. That member which expresses the effect of an action naturally comes last; as, Though you offer ever so good reasons, you will not prevail with him. The like may be said of time, with regard to things done in it; as, The Roman eloquence soon declined when Cicero was dead. And to name no more, the reason of a thing naturally follows that of which it is the reason; as thus: All the pleasures of life must be uncertain, since life itself is not secure.\n\nWhen this order is inverted, it may be styled artificial. So to keep to the instances already given, the two members in the first sentence may be thus inverted: What they blame in others, men are apt to forgive themselves. In the second, in this manner: Socrates is a man, if he be a rational creature. In the third, thus: You will not prevail with him, though you offer ever so good reasons. And so in the rest: As, When Cicero was dead, the Roman eloquence soon declined; and, Since life itself is not secure, all the pleasures of life must be uncertain. The variety of inversion in a sentence may generally be greater or less in proportion to the number of its members. In the following sentence of Cicero, the natural order seems to be this: If that greatness of mind be void of justice, which shows itself in dangers and labours, it is blamable. Which may be varied by changing the place of the first and third member, in the following manner: That greatness of mind is blamable which shows itself in dangers and labours, if it want justice. Or by altering the place of all the three members, thus: That greatness of mind is blamable, if it be void of justice, which shows itself in dangers and labours. But oftentimes one member may be included in another, as in the instance here given: If that greatness of mind, which shows itself in dangers and labours, be void of justice, it is blamable. Here the relative member is included in the conditional, which is placed first, and the antecedent member follows both. But in Cicero it stands thus: That greatness of mind, which shows itself in dangers and labours, if it want justice, is blamable; where the relative and conditional members are both included in the antecedent member. The Latin tongue commonly admits of a much greater variety in the transposition of members, as well as in that of single words, than suits with our idiom. In the following sentence the natural order is much preferable, as it best suits with the proper elevation and cadency of the voice in its pronunciation: I am willing to remit all that is past, provided it may be done with safety. But should we invert the members, and say, Provided it may be done with safety, I am willing to remit all that is past; the harmony of the cadency would be lost. And if the latter member be included in the former, the alteration will still be worse; as, I am willing, provided it may be done with safety, to forgive all that is past. Here the inflection of the voice falls upon the same member as before, and destroys the beauty of the period by its elevation afterwards. Some sentences admit of no involution of their members. Such are those whose members are connected by conjunctive or disjunctive particles. As, Virtue furnishes the mind with the truest pleasure in prosperity, and affords it the greatest comfort in adversity. And, A wise man is neither elated by prosperity, nor depressed by adversity. And the like may be said of those where the latter member begins with some illative or reditive particle. As in these instances: The chief thing to be regarded in life is virtue, for all other things are vain and uncertain. And, Though fortune is always inconstant, yet she has many votaries. Neither of the members in any of these ways of expression,\nElocution, and some others which might be named, can be included one in the other. In all the examples hitherto given, the sentences consist only of simple members; and indeed compound members are not so often inverted, nor included one in another, by reason of their length. However, we shall here produce one instance of each:\n\nWhoever considers the uncertainty of human affairs, and how frequently the greatest hopes are frustrated; he will see just reason to be always on his guard, and not place too much dependence upon things so precarious.\n\nThis sentence consists of two compound members, which here stand in their natural order, but may be thus inverted: He will see just reason to be always on his guard, and not place too much dependence on things so precarious; whoever considers the uncertainty of human affairs, and how often the greatest hopes are frustrated.\n\nIn the following sentence one compound member is included in another: Let us not conclude while dangers are at a distance, and do not immediately approach us, that we are secure; unless we use all necessary precaution to prevent them. Here the natural order would be: While dangers are at a distance, and do not immediately approach us; let us not conclude that we are secure, unless we use all necessary precaution to prevent them.\n\nBut there are some other considerations relating to order, which, being taken from the nature of things, equally suit all languages. So, in amplifying, there should be a constant gradation from a less to a greater; as when Cicero says, Ambition creates hatreds, feuds, dissensions, seditions, and wars. On the contrary, in extenuating, we should descend from a greater to a less; as if, speaking of the ancient laws of Rome, one should say, They were so far from suffering a Roman citizen to be put to death, that they would not allow him to be whipped, or even to be bound. In constituting any whole, we put the parts first; as, Invention, disposition, elocution, and pronunciation, make up the art of oratory. But in separating any whole, the parts follow: as, The art of oratory may be divided into these four parts; invention, disposition, elocution, and pronunciation. In every enumeration care must be taken not to mix the whole with the parts; but if it be mentioned at all, it must either be put first or last. So it would be wrong to say, He was a man of the greatest prudence, virtue, justice, and modesty: for the word virtue here contains in it the other three, and therefore should not be inserted among them. See Language, No. 17.\n\n\u00a7 3. Of Juncture and Number.\n\nQuintilian, speaking of composition, represents a discourse as very happy in that respect, when the order, juncture, and number, are all just and proper. The first of these, which gives rules for the due placing of the words and members of a sentence, has been already explained. We now proceed to the other two, which relate to letters and syllables; the former treating of their connection, and the latter of their quantity.\n\nI. As to juncture. A due attention is to be paid to the nature and use of the vowels, consonants, and syllables in the connection of words, with regard to the sound.\n\nAs to the first, when a word ends with a vowel, and the next begins with either a different vowel, or the same repeated, it usually renders the pronunciation hollow and unpleasant. For, as Quintilian has justly observed, \"This makes a chasm in the sentence, and stops the course of it.\" For there must be some pause, in order to pronounce them both, or otherwise the sound of one will be lost. So, for instance, in pronouncing these words, the other day, unless you stop a little after the word the, the sound of e will not be heard; and if it is dropped, it will occasion a rougher sound, from the aspiration of th twice repeated so near together, as tho' other day. Therefore to prevent both these inconveniences, we usually say, tho' other day. But the different consonants, which together with the vowels make up those syllables, often cause a considerable difference in the pronunciation, so as to render it more or less agreeable. As, if we say, he overdid it, the words he over have not so harsh a sound as the other; though still they require some pause to keep them distinct. Besides, some vowels meet more amicably, and admit of a softer pronunciation than others. Those which have the weakest and smallest sound, follow best; because they occasion the least alteration of the organ in forming the two sounds. Such are e and i; and therefore, without any chasm in the sound, or hesitation of the voice, we say he is. But where the action of the organs is greater, and the sound stronger, the pronunciation is more difficult: as when we say, tho' all. For here is a contrary motion of the lips, which are first put forward in founding the o, and then drawn backward to pronounce the a; and therefore the sound is much softer to say, tho' every, where their action is less. And the like ill effect commonly happens from the repetition of the same vowel: as if we say, go on, or, usually act thus. There is a considerable difference between these two expressions, in repeating the sound of the vowel, and where either of them is doubled in a single word. For then the sound found only is protracted by one continued motion of the organ; as in the words good, and deem. But here the sound is repeated again by a new action of the organ; which, if precipitated, obscures the sound of one of the vowels; and, if too much retarded, makes a chasm in the pronunciation; either of which is unpleasant to the ear.\n\nBut as the coalition of two vowels occasions an hollow and obscure sound, so the meeting of some consonants renders it very harsh and rough. Thus the words king Xerxes, and public good, when so placed have not only a roughness, but likewise a difficulty in their pronunciation, from the contrary action of the lips; which in the former are first drawn back and then forwards, but in the latter the contrary way; and in both of them with some considerable force. But this may very easily be avoided, by saying, with a little alteration in the words, Xerxes the king, and the good of the public. So likewise the words ill company, have a softer sound than bad company, for the same reason. To multiply instances of this kind seems unnecessary, which so frequently occur in all discourses.\n\nThe repetition of the same syllable at the end and beginning of words, is the last thing to be considered. And a little observation will convince us, that where this happens, it generally renders the sound either confused or unpleasant. Cicero was often rallied on account of this verse:\n\nO fortunatam natam me consule Romam.\n\nEvery one will easily perceive a disagreeable sound in the\nthe following expression: \"A man many times does that unadvifedly, of which he afterwards repents.\" The chime of the words *man* *many* both seems affected, and displeases the ear. But this will soon be remedied, if we separate these two words, and say, \"A man does that many times unadvifedly.\"\n\nFrom the short account here given of this part of composition, it is easy to perceive what things are necessary to render it most complete and accurate; which are these following. If a word end with a vowel, the next ought to begin with a consonant, or such a vowel whose sound may agree well with the former. But if a word conclude with a consonant, either a vowel should follow, or such a consonant whose pronunciation will suit with it. And lastly, the same syllable ought not to be repeated at the end of one word, and the beginning of the next. It has been observed by some critics, that the following verse at the beginning of Virgil's *\u00c6neid* has all these properties:\n\n*Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris.*\n\nWhere any word in this verse ends with a vowel, the next begins with a consonant; and where any one ends with a consonant, the next begins with a vowel; and there is no repetition of the same sound throughout the whole. But this is what rarely happens, especially in our language, which abounds with consonants. And what Quintilian says of the coalition of vowels, in treating upon this subject, seems applicable to the whole.\n\n\"This (says he) is a thing not much to be dreaded; and I know not whether the neglect of it, or too great a concern about it, be worse. It necessarily checks the vigour of the mind, and diverts it from matters of greater importance. And therefore, as it shows negligence to permit it, so to be in constant fear of it discovers a low genius.\" This was the opinion of that judicious writer. And as these things cannot always be attended to, it may be sufficient to avoid them, where they prove very offensive to the ear, and it may be done without some greater inconvenience. So in this sentence, *Honey is the best policy*, the coalition of *i* and *p* in the two last words *best policy* produces a roughness in their pronunciation; but as the expression is strong, and cannot perhaps be well altered for the better, the sound here ought to give way to the tenle.\n\nII. Number. This respects the quantity of syllables, as *Juncture* does their quality. In the Greek and Roman languages every syllable has its distinct quantity; and is either long, short, or common: two or more of which joined together in a certain order make a foot, and a determinate number of these in a different order constitute their several sorts of metre. This variety of sounds gives a much greater harmony to their poetry, than what can arise only from the seat of the accent, and the similitude of sound at the end of two verses, which chiefly regulate our metre. And although their prose was not so confined with regard to feet, either as to the kind or place of them, as their metrical compositions; yet it had a sort of measure, more especially in the rise and cadency of their periods. They call *rhetorical number*. And accordingly the ancient writers upon this art acquaint us what feet are best suited to the beginning, middle, or conclusion of a sentence. Such rules are not applicable to our language, which has not that accurate distinction of quantity in its syllables.\n\nFor we are apt to confound accent with quantity, and pronounce those syllables longest on which we lay the accent, though in their nature they are not so. As in the word *admirable*, where none but the first syllable *a* is pronounced long; though that is only rendered so by position, and the two following are so by nature. And again, in the word *avarice*, we found the first *a* long for the same reason, and the second short; contrary to the nature of both these vowels. However, we shall offer a few things that may be of some use to modulate our periods and adjust their cadency.\n\nA great number of monosyllables do not stand well together. For as there ought to be a greater distance in the pronunciation between one word and another, than between the syllables of the same word; such pauses, though short, yet, when too frequent, make the sound rough and uneven, and by that means spoil its harmony. And this may seem more necessary to be attended to, because the English language abounds so much with monosyllables. On the contrary, a continuation of many long words makes a sentence move too slow and heavily. And therefore such periods generally run best, which have a proper mixture of words of a different length. Besides, as every word has its accent, which with us stands for quantity, a number either of monosyllables, or long words, coming together, so far abates the harmony, as it lessens the variety.\n\nAgain, several words of the same ending do not stand well together, especially where the accent falls upon the same syllable in each of them. For this creates too great a jingle by the similitude of sound; and is apt to displease, from an appearance of affectation. Of this kind is the following sentence: *Nothing is more welcome, delightful, or wholesome, than rest to a wearied man*. In such expressions therefore, if the order of the words cannot well be altered, some other word should be substituted in the room of one of them at least, to diversify the sound. So in the example here given, the sound might be varied by saying, *Nothing is more welcome, pleasant, or wholesome*.\n\nBut to add no more, if a sentence end with a monosyllable, it is apt to hurt the cadency, and disappoint the ear; whereas words of a moderate length carry a greater force with them, by the fulness of their sound, and afford the ear what it expected. And there is one sort of monosyllables more especially, which never stand well at the conclusion of a period, though we frequently find them there; and these are the signs of cafes. Thus we say, *Avarice is a crime, which wise men are too often guilty of*. But the cadency would doubtless be more agreeable if it was altered thus: *Avarice is a crime, of which wise men are too often guilty*. Every one must perceive, when the accent falls upon the last syllable in the sentence, as it does if it end with *of*, the sound is not so pleasant as when it rests upon the preceding syllable in the word *guilty*. Nor are very long words well fitted either to the beginning or conclusion of a period; for they retard the pronunciation at first, and fall too heavy at the end.\n\n**Chap. III. Of Dignity.**\n\nDignity consists in the right use of tropes and figures. It is not sufficient for an orator to express himself in an self-oration.\nElocution itself with propriety and clearness, or in smooth and harmonious periods; but his language must likewise be suited to the nature and importance of the subject. And therefore, as elegance gives rules for the first of these, and composition for the second; so does dignity for the last of them. It is very evident, that different subjects require a different style and manner of expression; hence, as Quintilian says, \"What is magnificent in one discourse would be turgid in another; and those expressions which appear low upon a sublime subject, would suit lesser matters: and as in a florid harangue a mean word is remarkable, and like a blemish; so anything lofty and bright upon a trivial argument is disproportionate, and like a tumour upon an even surface.\"\n\nNow this variety in the manner of expression arises in a great measure from tropes and figures, which not only enliven and beautify a discourse, but give it likewise force and grandeur; for which reason this part of elocution seems to have been called dignity.\n\nTropes and figures are distinguished from each other in several respects. Tropes mostly affect single words, but figures whole sentences. A trope conveys two ideas to the mind by means of one word; but a figure throws the sentence into a different form from the common and usual manner of expression. Besides, tropes are chiefly designed to represent our thoughts, but figures our passions.\n\n\u00a7 I. Of Tropes.\n\nA trope, which is a figure of words, has been usually defined to be the change of a word from its proper signification to some other with advantage, either as to beauty or strength. The words, with advantage, are added in the definition, because a trope ought not to be chosen unless there is some good reason for using it rather than the proper word. But in what manner, or how far, it can be said of all tropes in general, that they change the proper signification of words, will best appear by considering the nature of each kind of them separately. Now in every trope a reference is had to two things, which occasions two ideas; one of the thing expressed, and another of that thing to which it has a respect, and is supplied by the mind. For all tropes are taken either from things internally related, as the whole and a part; or externally, as cause and effect, subject and adjunct; or from some similitude that is found between them; or from a contrariety. The first of these is called synecdoche, the second metonymy, the third metaphor, and the last irony. We shall endeavour to illustrate this by examples. When we say, Hannibal beat the Romans; the meaning is, that Hannibal and his army did this. So that although in some sense a part may here be said to stand for the whole, which makes it a synecdoche; yet, strictly speaking, the word Hannibal does not alter its sense, but there is an ellipsis in the expression, Hannibal being put for himself and his army. But if we say, Cicero should be read by all lovers of eloquence; here indeed the word Cicero appears to be changed from its proper sense, and to signify the books of Cicero; which is a metonymy, the author being put for his works; and therefore such expressions need not be deemed elliptical. Again, if any one, speaking of a subtle and crafty man, should say he is a fox; the meaning is, he is like a fox; which is a metaphor; where the word fox retains its proper sense, and denotes that animal, to which the man is compared on account of his craft. Lastly, if a person say to another, Well done; meaning that the thing was ill done, the word well keeps its own sense; but from the manner of its pronunciation, or some other circumstance attending the expression, it will be evident that the contrary is intended; which is called an irony. From these instances it may appear in what latitude we must understand the common definition of a trope, which makes it to consist in the change of a word from its proper sense into some other. But though in reality there are but four kinds of tropes, which are distinguished by so many different respects which things bear one to another; yet as these several respects are found in a variety of subjects, and attended with different circumstances, the names of tropes have from hence been greatly multiplied; which, however, may all be referred to some or other of those already mentioned, as will be shown when we come to treat of them in their order. And for distinction sake we shall call the former primary, and the latter secondary, tropes.\n\nWe now proceed to consider the reasons which have occasioned the introduction of tropes. And these, as Quintilian observes, are three; necessity, emphasis, and beauty.\n\n1. Tropes were first introduced from necessity, deriving their origin unquestionably in a considerable degree from the barrenness of language, because no language which we know contains a sufficient number of proper words to express all the different conceptions of our minds: but the principal cause of their introduction seems to be that extensive influence which imagination possesses over every kind of speech. The mind considers the same thing various ways; views it in different lights; compares it with other things; and observes their several relations and affections; wherein they agree, and in what they differ. From all which reflections it is furnished with almost an infinite number of ideas; which cannot all of them be distinguished and expressed by proper words, since new ones occur daily. And were this possible, yet would it be impracticable, because the multitude of words must be so vastly great that the memory could not retain them, nor be able to recall them as occasion required. Tropes have in a good measure redressed both these inconveniences; for by means of them the mind is not burdened with a numberless stock of different words, and yet nothing seems to want a name. Thus sometimes where a word is wanting to express any particular thing, it is clearly enough represented by the name of some other thing, by reason of the similitude between them. At other times, the cause is signified by the effect, the subject by the adjunct; or the contrary. And the whole is often understood by a part, or a part by the whole. And thus by the use of tropes the mind is helped to conceive of something not expressed, from that which is expressed. It is much the same case, as when we have occasion to speak of a person, whose name we are either unacquainted with, or have forgot; for by describing his person, abode, or some other circumstances relating to him, those we converse with as well understand whom we mean, as if we mentioned his name. So the shepherd in Virgil,\nElocution when he could not think of the name of Archimedes, describes him by his works:\n\nAnd what's his name who form'd the sphere,\nAnd show'd the fensons of the sliding year?\n\nBesides, it sometimes happens in a discourse, that those things are necessary to be said, which, if expressed in their proper terms, would be offensive; but being clothed with metaphors, may be conveyed to the mind with decency. Thus then the imagination never contemplates any one idea single and alone, but always along with other ideas, which may be called its accessories, and which often operate more forcibly upon the mind than the principal idea itself does. In their nature they are often more agreeable, and frequently also more familiar, to our conceptions; or perhaps they remind us of a greater variety of important circumstances. Hence the name of the accessory is often preferred, as, e.g., when we want to point out the time in which a state enjoyed its chief reputation, &c. The proper words might do\u2014but the imagination suggests the flourishing period of a plant or tree; and we say \"the Roman empire flourished most under Augustus:\" Catiline, we say, was the head instead of the leader of his party, because the head is the principal part of the human figure.\n\n2. A second reason above mentioned for the use of tropes was emphasis. Tropes do many times express things with greater force and evidence than can be done by proper words. We receive much the greater part of our knowledge by our senses. And similitudes taken from sensible things, as in metaphors, very much assist the mind in its reflections upon those things which do not come under the cognizance of the senses. For it is certain, that we are sooner and more strongly affected with sensible objects, than with things of which we can have no ideas but from the internal operations of our own minds. Nay, sometimes one bright and lively trope shall convey a fuller and more just idea of a thing than a large periphrasis. So when Virgil calls the Scipios two thunderbolts of war, he gives a more lively image of the rapid force and speedy succeds of their arms, than could have been conveyed by a long description in plain words. And in many cases the tropical use of words is so emphatical, and suited to the idea we design to excite, that in this respect it may be justly esteemed the most proper. So, incensed with anger, inflamed with desire, fallen into an error, are all metaphorical expressions, used in a way of similitude; and yet perhaps no proper words can be made use of, which will convey a more lively image of the thing we design to represent by them.\n\nBut beauty and ornament, as was observed before, have been another cause of the use of tropes. Some subjects require a more florid and elegant drefs than others. When we describe or applaud, ornaments of speech and a gaiety of expression are requisite. And it is the business of an orator to entertain his hearers at the same time that he instructs them. Now Cicero, who was an admirable judge of the force and power of eloquence, has observed, that tropical expressions give the mind the greatest delight and entertainment. \"I have often wondered (says he) why tropes should give greater pleasure than proper words. I imagine the reason must be, either that there is an appearance of wit in neglecting what is at hand, and making choice of something at a distance; or that the hearer is furnished with a different thought, without being led into a mistake, which affords a very agreeable pleasure; or that a whole similitude is conveyed to the mind by a single word; or that, particularly in the best and most lively metaphor, the image is presented to our sight, which is the quickest of our senses.\" And therefore he supposes, that \"as garments were first invented from necessity, to secure us from the injuries of the weather, but improved afterwards for ornament and distinction; so the poverty of language first introduced tropes, which were afterwards incurred for delight.\" Besides, a variety of expression is pleasing in a discourse. It is many times necessary that the same thing should be repeated; and if this be done in the same words, it will grow tiresome to the hearers, and sink their esteem of the speaker's ability. Therefore, to prevent this, it is proper the expression should be varied, that although the sense be the same, it may give the mind a new pleasure by its different dres.\n\nWe come now, in the last place, to lay down some directions proper to be observed in the choice of tropes.\n\nAnd first, as every trope gives us two ideas; one, of the word expressed; and another, which, by means of that, the mind connects with it; it is necessary, that the relation between these two appear very plain and evident. For an obscure trope is always faulty, unless where some particular reason makes it necessary. And therefore tropes ought not to be too far-fetched, lest that should render them dark. For which reason Cicero says, he should not choose to call any thing destructive to a person's fortune, the Syrtes of his patrimony, but rather the rock of it; nor the Charybdis of his estate, but the gulf of it. For those who either did not know that the Syrtes were two quicksands upon the coast of Africa, or that Charybdis was a gulf in the strait of Sicily, both of them very destructive to mariners, would be at a loss to understand the meaning of the metaphor. Besides, metaphors taken from things we have seen, affect the mind more forcibly than those which are taken from such things as we have only heard of. Now there is scarcely any one who has not seen a rock or a gulf; but there are very few persons, comparatively, who have been either at Charybdis or the Syrtes. It is necessary therefore in a good trope, not only that there be a near affinity between the two ideas, but likewise that this affinity be very obvious and generally known, so that the word be no sooner pronounced but both images do immediately present themselves to the mind.\n\nAgain, as a trope ought to be very plain and evident, so likewise it should bear a due proportion to the thing it is designed to represent, so as neither to heighten nor diminish the just idea of it. Indeed, sometimes when we speak of things indefinitely, we say too much, lest we should seem to say too little. And this manner of speaking is called an hyperbole; which is not uncommon in the sacred writings. So, for instance, Saul and Jonathan are said to be swifter than eagles, and stronger than lions. But even in this way of expression a proportion is to be observed. For some very considerable and unusual excess of the thing in its kind is at least designed by it; which, perhaps, cannot, or however is not necessary to be defined. And therefore Quintilian blames Cato for calling the top of a hill a wave; because\nElocution. cause the proportion between the two ideas is nowise adequate. And so on the contrary Aritotles censures Euripides for calling rowing the empire of the oar. Poets indeed are allowed a greater liberty in this respect; but an orator should be modest in his expressions, and take care that he neither so heighten nor diminish the natural ideas of things by tropes, as to lead his hearers into mistakes.\n\nBut further: as a moderate use of tropes, justly applied, beautifies and enlivens a discourse; so an excess of them causes obscurity, by running it into abstruse allegories and riddles. Tropes are not the common and ordinary dyes of our thoughts, but a foreign habit: and therefore he who fills his discourse with a continued series of them, seems to act like one who appears in public in a strange dye: which no man of character would choose to do.\n\nMoreover, as one use of tropes is pleasure and entertainment, we should endeavour to make choice of such as are smooth and easy. But if at any time we think it necessary to use a harsh trope, it is proper to soften it by some precaution. For, as Cicero very handsomely says, a trope should be modeft, since it stands in a place which does not belong to it; for which reason it should seem to come thither by permission, and not by force. And therefore when he thought it harsh to say, The death of Cato made the senate an orphan; he guards the expression by saying, The death of Cato has (if I may be allowed to say so) rendered the senate an orphan.\n\nAnd, to add no more, care should be taken how we transfer tropes from one language into another. For as they are frequently taken not only from natural things, or such notions as are common to the generality of mankind, but likewise from the manners, customs, and occurrences of particular nations; so they may be very plain and obvious to those among whom they took their rise, but altogether unintelligible to others who are unacquainted with the reason of them. It was customary for the Roman soldiers to carry their money in their girdles: hence it was the same thing with them to say, a person had lost his girdle, as that he had lost his money. And because the Romans wore the toga, which was a long gown, in time of peace, and a different garb when engaged in war, their writers sometimes use the word toga to signify peace. But as neither of these customs is in use among us, so neither would the tropes suit our language, or be generally understood by us. And even in such tropes as are taken from the common nature of things, languages very much differ. There is a very beautiful trope in the account of St Paul's shipwreck, where it is said, The ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind. The original word, that we translate bear up, is \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9; and properly signifies, to look or keep its eyes against it; which is a very strong and lively image, taken from animate beings, and when applied to men, often signifies to withdraw or repulse: as, \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, to repulse an enemy; and Plutarch says of Demosthenes, that he could not \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03bd\u03b7\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff7, look against or repulse the power of money. Nothing is more common with Latin writers, than to call men of a public spirit and true patriots, lumina et ornamenta reipublicae, that is, the lights and ornaments of the state. And we have borrowed from them the use of both these metaphors. But because tropes and figures illustrate and heighten the style, they call them also\n\nlumina orationis, or the lights of a discourse. It sometimes happens, that only the tropical sense of a word is taken from one language into another, and not the proper signification of the same word. So scrupulus in Latin properly signifies a little stone, which getting into the shoe hurts a person as he walks; hence it is applied to the mind, and used to express a doubt, or uneasy thought that gives it pain. We have borrowed this latter sense of the word, but not the former.\n\nArt. I. PRIMARY TROPES.\n\nI. Metaphor. A metaphor, as usually defined, is a trope, which changes words from their proper signification to another different from it, by reason of some similitude between them. But that a word, when used metaphorically, does not alter its signification, but retains its proper sense, was shown above. However, it may not be amiss to explain this matter more fully, and set it in a clearer light. Every metaphor, then, is nothing else but a short similitude. Cicero calls it a similitude reduced to a single word. And Quintilian to the same purpose says, that \"a metaphor is a short similitude, and differs from it only in this, that the former is compared to the thing we design to express, and the latter is put for it.\" If it is a similitude, when I say of a man, he has acted like a lion; and a metaphor, when I say, he is a lion.\" Thus far Quintilian. Now in every similitude three things are requisite; two things that are compared together, and a third in which the similitude and likeness between them consists. And therefore, to keep to this example, when Horace calls a Roman soldier a lion, if the word lion did not retain its proper sense, there could be no similitude; because there would not be two things to be compared together with respect to a third, which is necessary in every similitude, and was designed by this expression. The sense of which is plainly this: That as a lion seizes his prey with the greatest fierceness, so a Roman soldier with like rage and fury attacked his enemies. In the same manner, when Cicero calls Pilo the vulture of the province, his meaning is, that he was like a vulture, or acted in such a manner as a vulture acts, that is, rapaciously. So that the real difference between a metaphor and a similitude consists in this; that a metaphor has not those signs of comparison which are expressed in a similitude. But some persons have run into mistakes in reasoning from tropes of this kind. For they have so argued from metaphorical words, as if all the affections and properties of the things expressed by them might be attributed to those other things to which they are applied, and by that means have strained the comparison (which has usually, but one particular view), in order to make it tally in other respects, where there is not that similitude of ideas. We will endeavour to make this evident by another example from Cicero, where he calls Mark Antony the torch of the state. The similitude between Antony and a torch lay in this: That as a torch burns and destroys every thing within its reach, so Antony brought devastation and ruin wherever he came. Now a torch has not only a property to burn, but also to give light; but the similitude would not hold in this respect, nor was it at all designed. For Cicero never calls a wicked profligate man, as Antony was, the light of the state; though he often gives that character to good and virtuous\nA second kind of metaphors lies between inanimate things, whether natural or artificial, which bear some similitude to each other. And this head is very extensive. Thus we say, floods of fire, and clouds of smoke, for large quantities. And so likewise, to inflame an account, that is, to heighten or increase it; with innumerable others of the like sort. In the two first of these instances, the terms proper to one element are applied to another; and as those elements of fire and water are opposite to each other, they show the extensiveness of this trope, that there are no things in nature so contrary, but may come within the limits of it, and be accommodated to each other in a way of similitude. In the last example, a natural action is applied to what is artificial.\n\nA third sort of metaphors is, when inanimate things are applied to animals, on account of some like properties between them. Thus Homer calls Ajax, the bulwark of the Greeks, on account of his valour, which like a wall defended them from the Trojans. And nothing is more common with Cicero, than to brand ill men with the character of being the pest of the state, by reason of the mischief which they bring to the public. So likewise he calls Zeno the philosopher an acute man, for his great discernment and quick perception of things; fetching the allusion from metals when brought to an edge or a point. As, on the contrary, old Chremes in Terence calls himself a stone, for want of apprehension. And we say, a gay person, and a bright genius, by this kind of metaphor.\n\nThe fourth and last kind of metaphors is that by which the actions and other attributes of animals are accommodated to inanimate things. Thus Cicero, speaking of Clodius, says: \"The very altars, when they saw that monster fall, seemed to move themselves and assert their right against him.\" Here the words saw, move, and assert, are all metaphors taken from the properties of animals. And Virgil, when he would represent the impetuous force and rapidity of the river Araxes, says, it did disdain a bridge. And it is a very usual epithet, which Homer gives to words, to call them \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1, or winged, to intimate the swiftness of speech.\n\nLastly, as to the choice of metaphors, those are effectuated the finest and strongest, which give life and action to inanimate things. The reason of which is, because they do as it were invigorate all nature, introduce new forms of beings, and represent their images to the sight, which of all the senses is the quickest, most active, and yet most unwearyed. What can be more moving, or in stronger terms express the villany of Clodius, than when Cicero says, \"The very altars of the gods seemed to exult at his death.\" And the same great orator particularly commends those metaphors, for their sprightliness and vivacity, which are taken from the sense of seeing; as when we say a bright thought, or a gay expression.\n\nHowever, care must be taken not to venture upon too bold and daring metaphors. Poets indeed claim greater liberty in this respect, whose view is often to amuse, terrify, or delight, by heightening the just and natural images of things. But it is expected the orator should reason coolly; though strongly and forcibly; and not by theatrical representations to transport the mind, as to take it off from reflection, unless perhaps on some particular...\nBut there is a very great difference in the choice of metaphors, as they are designed either to praise or dispraise. One thing may be compared to another in a great variety of respects. And the same thing may be made to appear either noble or base, virtuous or vicious, by considering it in a different light. Such metaphors, therefore, as are chosen to commend, must be taken from great and laudable things; and on the contrary, those which are designed to discommend, from things vile and contemptible. Aristotle gives us a very pleasant example of this in the poet Simonides. A certain person, who had carried the prize at a race of mules, offered him a reward to write a poem in honour of that action. Simonides thought he did not bid high enough; and therefore put him off with saying, the subject was too mean to write in praise of mules, which were the offspring of asses. But upon his being offered a larger sum, he undertook the task; and, as Aristotle observes, when he has occasion to speak of the mules in that poem, he does not mention them by that name, but calls them the daughters of fleet and generous horses, though he might with as much propriety have called them the daughters of dull asses. But it was the poet's business, in praising, to take the most advantageous part of the character. Where things are capable of such different turns, metaphorical expressions are generally most beautiful. And sometimes the same metaphor may be applied contrary ways, both in praise and dispraise, as it will suit different properties of the thing to which it refers. So a dove, in a metaphorical sense, may represent either innocence or fear; and an iron heart may denote either courage or cruelty; as a hard head, strength or weaknesses of thought. And this ambiguity in the application of metaphorical words often affords occasion for jests and concise wit. We observed before, that Cicero never calls ill men, lights of the state. But he once in this manner calls Sextius Clodius the light of the senate. For when his kinsman Publius Clodius had been killed by Milo, and his corpse was brought to Rome, Sextius raised the mob, and in a tumultuous manner carried it into the senate-house, where they burnt it, and by that means set the building on fire: For which seditious act Cicero passes that joke upon him, under the metaphor of light, which elsewhere he always uses in a good sense.\n\nBut to proceed: All forced and harsh metaphors should be avoided; the one being no less disagreeable to the mind than the other to the ear. Nor should they come too thick in a discourse. In a word, they ought not to be used, but either where a proper word is wanting, or they are more significant or beautiful than the proper word.\n\nII. Metonymy. This, as defined by Quintilian, is, the putting one word for another. But Voithus describes it more fully, when he calls it, \"A trope, which changes the name of things that are naturally united, but in such a manner as that the one is not of the essence of the other.\" That a metonymy is thus distinguished from the other tropes, has been sufficiently shown already in the two last chapters. When it is said, to put one word for another, or, to change the names of things, the meaning is, that the word so used changes its sense, and denotes something different from its proper signification. Thus, when Mars is put for war, and Ceres for corn, they lose their personal sense, and stand for the effects of which those deities were said to be the cause. So likewise, when Virgil says,\n\nHe drank the frothing bowl,\nthe word bowl must necessarily signify the liquor in the bowl. And when in another place, describing the temple of Juno at Carthage, in which the actions of the Trojan war were represented, and the images of the heroes, he makes \u00c6neas, upon discovering that of Priam among the rest, cry out,\n\nLo here is Priam;\n\nit is plain the word Priam there must stand not for his person, but his image or figure. And this property of changing the sense of the word appears peculiar to metonymy. In treating upon a metaphor, we observe the mistake of those who teach, that a word used metaphorically loses its proper signification; whereas it only changes its place, but not its sense; being applied to a thing to which it does naturally belong, by way of similitude. And as the not attending to this has run some persons into very great absurdities, in treating upon metaphorical expressions, and reasoning from them in the tropical sense; so the like has happened to others in some instances of a metonymy, where, by misapprehending their true nature, they have reasoned from them in the literal sense, as we shall show presently. A metonymy is not so extensive as a metaphor, nor altogether so necessary; because nothing is said by a metonymy, which cannot be expressed in proper words; whereas metaphors are often used for want of proper words to express some ideas. However, metonyms are very useful in language; for they enrich a discourse with an agreeable variety, and give both force and beauty to an expression. And what we observed with relation to a metaphor, is true also of this tropic: that some metonyms, even in common discourse, are more frequently made use of than the proper words in whose room they are put. So, pale death, a blind way, and a happy fate, are very common expressions with us. And it is more usual to say, This is such a person's hand, or I know his hand, than his writing, when we intend this latter sense of the word.\n\nWe now proceed to the division of metonyms; which are commonly distinguished into four kinds, from the different manner in which things are naturally, but externally, united to one another. Now things are thus united, or one thing depends upon another, either with respect to its production, or in the manner of its existence when produced. In the former way the effect depends upon its cause, and in the latter the adjunct upon its subject. And hence arise four sorts of metonyms, which receive their names from the cause and effect, the subject and the adjunct.\n\nIt is called a metonymy of the cause, when the external cause is put for the effect. The external cause is twofold, the agent and end, which are usually called the efficient and final cause. Of the former kind are such metonyms, where the inventor or author is put for what was invented or effected by him. Thus as,\nwe said before, Ceres is sometimes put for corn, the use of which she was said first to have introduced; and Mars for war, over which he was thought to preside. And by this way of speaking, any artist or writer is put for his work. So Juvenal, blaming the luxury and profuseness of the Romans, says, There are few tables without Mentor: that is, which were not made by him, or after his manner. And our Saviour says, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, They have Moses and the prophets, meaning the books of Moses and the prophets. But under this sort of metonymy is included not only the agent, strictly so called, but also any means or instrument's made use of in the doing of a thing, when put for the thing done. Thus, polite literature, is called humanity, because it cultivates and improves the human mind. And in that expression of Cicero, Words move nobody but him who understands the tongue; the word tongue, which is the instrument of speech, is put for speech or language. And in the like sense, arms are sometimes put for war, and the sword for slaughter. By the same kind of metonymy likewise any affection or quality is put for its effect. As when it is said, the end of government is to maintain justice; that is, such mutual offices among men as are the effects of justice. And so likewise in that of Cicero, It is the business of magistrates to check the levity of the multitude, by which he means tumults occasioned by their levity.\n\nMoreover, as human affections are attributed to the Deity in a metaphorical sense, so several parts of the human body are likewise ascribed to him by this kind of metonymy. Thus, his hand and his arm are used to express his power, as his ear and eye, his care and providence, these being the instruments of such effects in mankind. Metonyms of the final cause are those by which the end in doing a thing is put for the thing done. As when we say, The watch is set, meaning the watchmen, who are appointed for that purpose. And so likewise that expression, to make an example, as it signifies, to punish, in order to deter others from the like crimes by such an example. As also that of Virgil,\n\nPhilis should garlands crop:\nby which are meant flowers to make garlands.\n\nThe second kind of metonymy puts the effect for the efficient cause, whether the agent, or only the means and instrument. So Virgil calls the two Scipios the destruction of Libya, because they were the agents who effected it. And Horace compliments his patron Maecenas with the titles of being his guard and honour; that is, his guardian, and the author of his honour. But when Cicero tells the citizens of Rome, that the death of Clodius was their safety, he means the occasion only of their safety. And elsewhere he calls that a dark hope and blind expectation, the effect of which was dubious and uncertain to those who entertained it. And in like manner, the sons of the prophets, when they were eating the pottage which Elisha had ordered to be set before them, cried out, There is death in the pot; that is, some deadly thing, as is presently after explained. And thus sweat, which is the effect of labour, is sometimes put for labour. As in the threat denounced against Adam, In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, that is, by labour in cultivating the ground. And, in allusion to this way of speaking, Antony the orator tells Crassus, \"the improvement of the style by constant exercise, as he preferr'd, was a thing of much sweat.\" And virtue is said to be gained by sweat, that is, continued care and exercise in subduing the passions, and bringing them to a proper regulation. But in these two expressions there is likewise a metaphor, the effect of bodily labour being applied to that of the mind. In all these instances, the effect is put for the efficient cause.\n\nThe third kind of metonymy is, when the subject is put for the adjunct. By subject here, in a large sense of the word, may be understood that wherein some other thing is contained, or about which it is conversant; as likewise the possession with respect to the thing he possesses; and the thing signified, when put for the sign of it. Now, by the first of these ways of speaking, the feet of any faculty or affection is used for the faculty or affection itself. So it is usual to say, a man of a clear head, when we mean a clear mind or understanding; the feet of the mind being supposed to be in the head. And a person is said to have a warm heart, because the heart has been thought the seat of the affections. In like manner, the place where any actions are performed is put for the actions done in it. As when Cicero says, \"Do not always think of the forum, the benches, the rostra, and the senate;\" meaning the discourses which were usually made in those places. So likewise the country, or place of residence, is put for the inhabitants, as in that passage of Cicero: \"And to omit Greece, which always claimed the pre-eminence for eloquence, and Athens, the inventress of all sciences, where the art of speaking was invented and perfected; in this city of ours, (meaning Rome), no studies have prevailed more than that of eloquence:\" where the words Greece and Athens stand to denote the inhabitants of those places. And hither may also be referred those expressions in which the time is put for the persons living in it; as, the degeneracy of the present age, the virtue of former times. In the second way above-mentioned, the object is used for the person or thing employed about it: As when Cicero says, \"In time of battle the laws are silent; where by laws he intends the judges, who pronounce sentence according to law. By the third of these ways, in which the possessor is put for the thing he possesses, we say, to devour, destroy, or ruin a man, meaning not his person but his estate. And mythologists explain the fable of Aetna by this trope, who is said to have been devoured by his dogs; for by dogs they understand flatterers and parasites, who consumed his estate and brought him to beggary. By the last way before recited, which puts the thing signified for the sign, statues and pictures are called by the names of the persons which they represent: as in that jest of Cicero upon his brother Quintus, when, as Macrobius relates, \"being in the province which his brother had governed, and seeing a large portrait of part of his body, holding a shield, though Quintus was but a little man, he said, My half brother is bigger than my whole brother.\" The Popish doctrine of transubstantiation is founded upon an abuse of this trope. For when our Saviour, speaking of the bread and wine at that time before him, says, \"This is my body, and this is my blood,\" his plain meaning is, they were the signs of his body and blood, the thing signified being put for the sign by this sort of metonymy. But the Papists take the expression literally, which must doubtless be very absurd:\nElocution, absurd: since the words relate to the time then present, while Christ was yet living, and spoke them; when it was impossible for the bread and wine to be converted into his body and blood, it being evident to all who were present, that those elements, and his body, existed separately at the same time. But if the words are explained by this trope, the sense is plain and easy, and the way of speaking familiar to all writers. Whereas they who plead for the literal sense might with equal reason assert that those expressions above-mentioned are to be taken literally, in which several parts of the human body, as the hand, the arm, the ear, and the eye, are ascribed to the Deity; or that, when our Saviour in a metaphorical sense calls himself a vine, and a door, these words were designed to be applied to him strictly and properly, and not by way of similitude only, as is the case in all metaphors.\n\nThe fourth kind of metonymy is that wherein the adjunct is put for the subject, which is done in the same variety of ways as the former. It is therefore a metonymy of the adjunct, when the thing contained is put for that which contains it. As when Virgil says, \"They lie down upon purple;\" that is, upon couches dyed with purple. And again, \"They crown the wine;\" meaning the bowl which contained the wine, it being the custom of the ancients to deck their bowls with garlands at their entertainments. By these tropes likewise virtues and vices are put for the persons in whom they are found. As in that beautiful passage of Cicero, where, comparing the profligate army of Catiline with the forces of the state, he says, \"On this side modestly engaged, on that impudence; on this chastity, on that lewdness; on this integrity, on that deceit; on this piety, on that profaneness; on this constancy, on that fury; on this honour, on that baseness; on this moderation, on that unbridled passion; in a word, equity, temperance, fortitude, prudence, and all virtues, engage with injustice, luxury, cowardice, rashness, and all vices.\" And to this trope those expressions are to be referred, in which any thing is put for the object about which it is conversant. As in that saying of the wise man, \"Hope deferred makes the heart sick;\" where hope is put for the thing hoped for. And thus Suetonius calls the emperor Titus the love and delight of mankind, whose mild and obliging temper rendered him the object of those agreeable affections to all persons under his government. A third use of this trope is putting a thing for the time in which it was done. Thus we say of a person he has served so many campaigns, meaning so many summers, that being the usual time in which armies are drawn out into the field. Lastly, by this metonymy, the sign is put for the thing it signifies; as, the sceptre for the regal dignity, and the sword for the authority of the magistracy.\n\nIII. Synecdoche. This is a trope by which either the whole of a thing is put for a part of it, or a part for the whole, so that the two things, whose ideas are presented to the mind in this trope, are internally related to each other: by which, as has been shown already, it is distinguished from all the other tropes. In a synecdoche the word retains its proper sense, and the expression is elliptical, as will appear by the several species of it, wherein the ellipsis in most of the examples is very obvious, and may with no great difficulty be supplied. Now a thing may be considered as a whole in three different respects, which logicians call an universal, essential, and integral whole. An universal whole is any genus with regard to its several species: as, an animal with respect to mankind and brutes, or philosophy with respect to the several arts and sciences comprised under it. An essential whole consists of matter and form; as, a man of body and soul. And an integral whole is any body or quantity, with respect to the several parts of which the matter of it is composed, and into which it may be divided: as, an human body with respect to its several members; or a year, as divisible into months, weeks, and days. And thus rhetoric is an integral whole in respect to the four parts that compose it; namely, invention, disposition, elocution, and pronunciation. So likewise any aggregate body, as a civil community, which is divisible into those who govern and are governed; or any army, consisting of the general and his soldiers. As a whole therefore, in each of these acceptations of the word, is frequently put for a part, and a part for the whole; hence arise six species or forms of synecdoche.\n\nThe first of these puts the genus for the species. Thus, virtue in general is sometimes used to denote some particular sort of virtue. As when Cicero mentions virtue as one of the four qualifications necessary in a general, he means greatness of mind. And persons are often commended for instances of virtue shown in their conduct, which respect only some single virtue, as justice, temperance, or the like: And in this sense Cicero calls Clodius a deadly animal. So when our Saviour commissions his apostles to preach the gospel to every creature, the meaning is, every rational creature. And thus likewise, to talk to a person sometimes denotes the same thing as to blame him, which is one way of talking.\n\nThe second kind of synecdoche puts the species for the genus. Thus, bread denotes any kind of food; as when a person is said to get his bread by his labour. In the same way of speaking, money is put for any kind of wealth in general. And it is an usual expression to say, that wine destroys more than the sword; that is, than any hostile arms. And the legal form of banishment among the Romans was, to prohibit persons the use of fire and water; that is, the most common and ordinary necessaries of life, in which all others were included.\n\nThe third species of this trope is, when the essential whole is put for one of its parts; that is, either for the matter or form. Thus, in the evangelist, Mary Magdalen says, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him, meaning his body. So it is usual to say of a deceased person, He was buried at such a time. And in the inscriptions of sepulchral monuments we frequently meet with this expression, Here lies such a one; that is, his corpse. Nor are instances uncommon in which the whole being is put for the form. Thus when Cicero says, Those persons, live who have fled from the confinement of the body, as from a prison; by persons must necessarily be understood their souls, which are here distinguished from and set in opposition to their bodies. And so Virgil represents \u00c6neas as meeting with Dido and some of his Trojan friends in the infernal regions; by which are meant their ghosts.\n\nThe fourth kind of synecdoche is, when either the matter or form is put for the whole being. Thus, fiber and\nand gold are used to signify money made of those metals; as when we say, *I have so much silver, or so much gold*. And the word *soul*, both in our own and other languages, is put for the whole person. So with us, a merry soul, and a dull soul; in Cicero, dear souls; and in Horace, candid souls, are all used in this tropical sense. But this way of speaking occurs nowhere more frequently than in the sacred writings. Thus, for instance, it is said, *All the souls which came with Jacob into Egypt*, meaning the persons. And again, *The soul that finneth it shall die*; from which expression, and others of the like import, some persons, by not attending to the nature of this trope, have been erroneously led to infer that the soul is naturally mortal. But sometimes only part of the matter stands to express the whole essence or being. So we imitate the Latins in using the word *caput* or *head* to denote either a person or thing. For, as with them *lepidum caput*, so with us a witty head, signifies the same as a man of wit. And in the same sense, *so many head of cattle* means so many entire cattle.\n\nBy the fifth sort of synecdoche, the whole of any material thing or quantity, whether continued or discrete, is put for a part of it. So when Cicero says, *A war is kindled through the whole world*, in compliment to his country, he calls the Roman empire the world. And this expression is also used by historians. Thus Cornelius Nepos, speaking of the quarrel between Mark Antony and Augustus, tells us, *that each of them desired to be lord of the world*. And in like manner St Luke says, *There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed*. So in St Paul's shipwreck, it is said, *They ran the ship aground*, that is, the head of her, for it is plain by what follows, that the stern was loose. And as to discrete quantity, our Savior, using this trope, said he should be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Though he did not continue three whole days and nights in the grave, but only part of the first and third day, and the whole second day, with the two whole nights between the first and third day, according to our way of reckoning. For he was buried on Friday in the afternoon, and refted in the grave that night, with the following day, which was the Jewish Sabbath, and was risen on the morning of the next day. So that we must necessarily have recourse to this synecdoche, which puts the whole for the part, to clear up that event.\n\nBy this kind of synecdoche, also, the plural number is sometimes put for the singular. Thus St Matthew says, *The thieves who were crucified with our Saviour reviled him*: though it is plain from St Luke, that only one of them did so. It may also be referred to this trope, when a certain number is put for an uncertain one. So it is an usual way of expression to say, *I have seen or done such a thing an hundred or a thousand times*: when perhaps so many are not really intended, but only in general some considerable number.\n\nThe sixth and last kind of synecdoche puts a part of any material thing or quantity for the whole of it. So we say of a man, *He shelters himself under such an one's roof*: that is, in his house. And of a fleet, that it consists of so many sail; meaning, so many ships. And by this trope, that is ascribed to a single person which was done by the assistance of others, and in conjunction with elocution.\n\nAs when it is said, *Hannibal killed forty thousand Romans at the battle of Cannae*: For an army is an aggregate body, of which the general is the head, and consequently the chief part of it. And to this kind of synecdoche may also be referred such expressions in which the singular number is put for the plural: as if one should say, *A man is liable to be misled by the influence of irregular passions*: meaning all men, or mankind in general. Or when less than the real number is put for any round number: Thus some ancient writers, when they speak of the Grecian armada that came against Troy, call it a fleet of a thousand ships; though according to Homer's list, it contained 1186. And so likewise the Greek interpreters of the Old Testament are usually called the Seventy; whereas, in reality, they were seventy-two.\n\nIV. Irony. This is a trope in which one contrary is signified by another: As if any one should say, *Well done*: and indeed when at the same time his design is to intimate that the thing was ill done. So that, by this manner of expression, the speaker appears to mean something contrary to the tenor of the word he makes use of. Not that the word is changed from its usual signification; but by the circumstances attending the expression, we perceive the contrary to what is spoken is intended. Quintilian observes, that an irony may be known one of these three ways: \u201cBy the manner of pronunciation, or from the nature of the person or the thing. For (as he adds) where any of these does not suit with the words, it is plain the speaker intends the contrary.\u201d The irony is very plain from the manner of pronunciation in that passage of Terence, where Simo speaking to his servant by way of reproof, says, \u201cYou have taken great care indeed.\u201d From the circumstances of the person, when Cicero, addressing to Catiline, says, \u201cHe went to your companion, that excellent man, Marcus Marcellus.\u201d When he calls him an excellent man, it is evident he means the contrary: because no good man would be a companion of Catiline. And when he begins his oration for Ligarius with saying, \u201cCaesar, this is a new crime, and never heard of till now,\u201d the thing he is speaking of flows it to be an irony; for it was not new, as all who were present very well understood.\n\nThe subjects of irony are vices and follies of all kinds. And this way of exposing them is often more effectual than serious reasoning: For many persons, who, either from temper or want of reflection, cannot be moved by the force of an argument, are not proof against the poignancy of wit and railery. And therefore we find the most grave and serious persons have not declined the use of this trope upon proper occasions. Socrates, whom the oracle pronounced the wisest man of his age, gave so much into it, that he got the name of *sophos*, that is, the *droll*. In the sacred writings we have a remarkable instance of it in the prophet Elijah, where he challenges the priests of Baal to prove the truth of their deity: For it is said expressly, \u201cHe mocked them, and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.\u201d And Solomon takes the like method to expose the follies of youth by this ironical apostrophe, \u201cRejoice, O young man, in thy youth,\u201d with\nwhat follows, which is all ironical. Nay, our Saviour himself thought fit thus to reprove the Jewish doctors, when he says, \"Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition: Where, by the words full well, or, as it is in the original, \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c2, it is very evident that a severe reprimand was intended.\n\nAn irony is used on a variety of occasions, as we shall show from some instances in Cicero. Sometimes he applies it in a way of jest and banter: As when he says, \"We have much reason to believe the modest man would not ask him for his debt, when he purifies his life.\" At other times by way of insult and derision: Thus when he would represent the forces of Catiline as mean and contemptible, \"O terrible war, (says he), in which this band of rakes are to march under Catiline! Draw out all your garrisons against this formidable body.\" Again, at other times, to give the greater force to his argument, he would seem, as it were, by this trope to recall and correct what he had said before; as in his oration for Milo: \"But it is foolish in us to compare Drusus, Africanus, Pompey, and ourselves, with Clodius; all our calamities were tolerable, but no one can patiently bear the death of Clodius.\" Now the character of Clodius was so well known, that all who were present must be sensible he meant the contrary. And, to name no more, an irony is never used to greater advantage, than when it is followed immediately by something very striking. Thus, speaking of Piso, he says, \"You have heard this philosopher: he denies that he was ever furious of a triumph.\" And then addressing himself to him, he immediately adds, \"O wretch! when you destroyed the senate, took its authority, subjected your consulate to the tribune, overturned the state, betrayed my life and safety for the reward of a province; if you did not desire a triumph, what can you pretend you did not desire?\" This must effectually confound the false gravity at that time assumed by Piso.\n\nArt. II. Secondary Tropes.\n\nSecondary tropes are so called, because they are all of the same nature with the former, and may be referred to some or other of them, though they have received different names.\n\nThey are chiefly eight in number; Autonomasia, Communication, Litotes, Enthymem, Catachresis, Hyperbole, Metalepsis, and Allegory. The three first of these are simple tropes, and may all be referred to a Synecdoche. But the five last are of a mixed or complex nature, and not confined to any one of the primary tropes; as will appear in treating upon them in order.\n\nI. A common or general word is sometimes used for the proper name of some particular thing or person which upon any account is eminent and remarkable. So we say, He is gone to the city, or he came from the city, that is, London. And by the Scriptures, we mean the Bible. So likewise, in speaking of persons, the orator is used for Cicero, the poet for Homer or Virgil, and the philosopher for Aristotle: and it is not unusual to say the apostle, when we mean St Paul. On the contrary, the proper names of things or persons are sometimes applied to any other of the same character. Thus we use the word gospel for any certain and undoubted truth. And Carthaginian faith proverbially stood for the greatest falsehood and deceit among the Romans. With the Greeks, Hercules signified a strong man, Nestor a wise man, and Iris a beggar; and the names of Samson, Solomon, and Job, now answer the like characters. Both these ways of expression are often very emphatical, and heighten the idea more than where things are expressed by their own name. To call a good orator Cicero, or an excellent poet a second Virgil, includes not only an encomium upon the arts themselves, but leads the mind to what is most perfect in them, and was peculiar to those persons. These forms of speech are called autonomasia, and come properly under a synecdoche; for in the former the whole is put for a part, and in the latter a part for the whole.\n\nII. Nothing is more common with orators than a change of persons. Sometimes, to avoid envy, and prevent the imputation of pride, in affuming to themselves the praise of any laudable action, they ascribe it to their hearers, and do not say, we, but ye did so and so. At other times, when it is necessary to remind them of something which they have done amiss, or to caution them against some wrong step for the future; to prevent giving offence, they take it upon themselves, or at least join themselves with them, and do not say, you have done this, or do not you do this; but, we have done it, or let us not do it. And again, at other times, in compliment to their hearers, they join them as partners in the commendable actions or virtues of other persons; as when the whole body of the people is brought in to share the praise arising from the success of wise counsels or victorious arms. Such ways of speaking often occur both in Demosthenes and Cicero. They are called communication, and come properly under a synecdoche of the whole.\n\nIII. On the contrary, there is a mode of speech, Litotes, in which, by denying the contrary, more is intended where, by the words expresses. This way of speaking is called litotes; and is often used for sake of modesty where more is a person is led to say any thing in his own praise, or meant than to soften an expression which in direct terms might be expressed; found harsh or give offence. As if one should say, I do not commend you for that; meaning, I greatly discommend, or blame you for it: where more being underflowed than the words expressly denote, it is properly a synecdoche of the part. Not that this manner of speaking is always to be so interpreted; but where it is not, there is no trope; which must be judged of by the circumstances of the discourse. But that it frequently is so used, might be easily shown from many instances; though it will be sufficient to mention two or three. Cicero speaking of Cotta, calls him no mean orator, whom he had just called a very great orator. And he says of Varro that \"he purified his studies not without industry; and afterwards gives him the character \"of a man of the greatest application.\" Which passages, compared together, plainly show the import of those negative expressions. And a friend of Cicero, writing to him, begins his letter thus: \"Although I am sensible the news I send you will not be very pleasant.\" This news was concerning the death of another friend of Cicero's; and there by the words not very pleasant, must, to be sure, be meant very unpleasant and melancholy; but he chose that expression in the beginning.\nElocution. beginning of his letter, as the softest and least shocking, the better to prepare him for the following account of what that news was. And in this way interpreters explain that passage in St Matthew: *And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah; where, by not the least, they understand the greatest, or very great, upon account of the honour it received by the birth of our Saviour*, as the words immediately following plainly intimate.\n\nIV. When any displeasing or ungrateful thing is expressed by a more soft and agreeable word, it is called euphemism. And as the word made use of is either contrary to the proper word, or only different from it, it may be referred to different tropes. The Latins have a soft way of expressing their disregarad to a person, by saying *waste*; which we have borrowed from them, and say, *fare him well*. When the contrary being intended to what is expressed, it comes properly under an irony. And as the word death carries in it an idea that is disagreeable to human nature, instead of saying a person is dead, we often say he is deceased, or departed; which we have also taken from the Latins who use the words decease and obit in the same sense. So that in both languages it comes under a synecdoche of the whole; to depart out of life being one sort of departure. But when the evangelist speaking of Stephen, who was stoned to death, expresses it by saying, that he fell asleep; this is a beautiful metaphor, taken from the similitude between the death of a good man and sleep.\n\nV. Catachresis signifies in general any harsh trope, though it is most commonly found in metaphors. It is principally used by poets, who make choice of it for novelty, or to enforce an expression, where the proper word does not seem strong enough. As when Milton, in describing the angel Raphael's descent from heaven, says, he\n\n*Sails between worlds and worlds;*\n\nwhere the novelty of the word enlivens the image more than if he had said *flies*. But it is sometimes found in the grave authors, and even in the sacred writings. So we read of the blood of the grape. And Solomon says, *the horse-leech hath two daughters*. In all these instances the trope is a metaphor. But when St John says in the Revelations, *I turned to see the voice that spake to me*, it is here a metonymy of the adjunct; the word voice being put for the person who uttered it. In St Matthew we read of Simon the leper; not that he was then a leper, but had been so, and was cured; which is a synecdoche of the part. And when a criminal is said to have had his reward, that is, his punishment, it is an irony.\n\nVI. Hyperbole is the boldest of all tropes; for it exceeds the strict bounds of truth, and represents things either greater or less, better or worse, than they really are. But the representation is made in such a manner as not to impose on the hearers. For an hyperbole is not used to define or describe anything accurately, but only to magnify or depress it in a considerable degree, when we either cannot or do not choose to represent it exactly. The excess in this trope is called auscult; as when we say of any thing that is very high, *it reaches to the skies*. The defect, or contrary extreme, is termed micros. So we say of a very lean person, *he is nothing but skin and bones, or a mere skeleton*. It is principally metaphorical, but sometimes taken from other tropes. When Saul and Jonathan are said to have been swifter than eagles, and stronger than lions, the expression is founded in similitude, and is therefore a metaphor. When, instead of saying Cato was a very virtuous man, the historian calls him the image of virtue; it is an hyperbolical metonymy of the adjunct for the subject. And when we read in the Mosaic history of cities fenced up to heaven, there is a synecdoche. But if a man of weak sight be said to be eagle-eyed, it is an irony. Those hyperboles which are expressed comparatively, are commonly most emphatical, because they show a peculiarity in the excess. To say a thing is as light as a feather, carries the idea very far; but to say it is lighter, not only carries it still farther, but also heightens it, by leaving the mind at an uncertainty where to fix the limits.\n\nVII. Sometimes two or more tropes and those of metalepsis, a different kind, are contained under one word; so where two that several gradations, or intervening senses, come or more between the word that is expressed, and the thing designed by it. And this is called a metalepsis. The first one contests between Sylla and Marius proved very fatal word to the Roman state. Julius Caesar was then a young man. But Sylla observing his aspiring genius, said of him, *In one Caesar there are many Mariuses.* Now in this expression there is a metalepsis. For the word Marius, by a synecdoche, or antonomasia, is put for any ambitious and turbulent person; and this again, by a metonymy of the cause, for the ill effects of such a temper to the public. So that Sylla's meaning, divested of these tropes, was, that Caesar would prove the most dangerous person to the Roman state that ever was bred in it; which afterwards proved true in the event. So when Virgil, describing that part of the African coast where \u00c6neas arrived with his ships, says, *A dark wood hung over it*; the word dark, by a metonymy of the effect, is put for shady, and that again by the same trope for thick; his meaning is, a thick wood. But the words of Dido, in the same poet, contain a larger gradation, when she says,\n\n*Happy, oh truly happy, had I been,\nIf Trojan ships our coasts had never seen.*\n\nIn which expression, first by a metonymy of the adjunct, the ships are put for the Trojans in the ships; and these, by a synecdoche of the whole, for \u00c6neas, who was one of them; and again his arriving on the coast, by a metonymy of the cause, for her seeing him; and lastly, her seeing him, by the same trope, for the passion she had for him. So that her meaning is, she had been happy, if she had never entertained a passion for \u00c6neas. This trope is more frequently to be met with in poets than in orators, as they take greater liberty in using distant allusions than is suited to the perspicuity of expression which is required in oratory. But as Quintilian has well observed, all the intermediate links of the chain in this trope are of no further use than to lead the mind gradually from the first to the last, the better to perceive their connection. As in the example last mentioned, relating to Dido, if we drop all the intervening steps, and connect the words expressed with what is directly intended, they will be found to contain a very remote cause put for the effect, which comes under\nElocution. der a metonymy. On the contrary, in the second example, where dark stands for thick, the effect is put for a remote cause. And the first, which is founded in a similitude of temper between C\u00e6sar and Marius, belongs to a metaphor.\n\nVIII. Allegory. As a metalepsis comprises several tropes in one word, so this is a continuation of several tropes in one or more sentences. Thus Cicero says, \"Fortune provided you no field, in which your virtue could run and display itself;\" where the words field and run are metaphors taken from corporeal things, and applied to the mind. And in another passage, speaking of himself, he says, \"Nor was I so timorous, that after I had fleered the ship of the state through the greatest storms and waves, and brought her safe into port, I should fear the cloud of your forehead, or your colleague's pestilent breath. I saw other winds, I perceived other storms, I did not withdraw from other impending tempests; but exposed myself singly to them for the common safety.\" Here the state is compared to a ship, and all the things said of it under that image are expressed in metaphors made use of to signify the dangers with which it had been threatened. And indeed allegories generally consist of metaphors; which being the most beautiful trope, a number of them well chosen and put together is one of the finest and brightest ornaments in language, and exceeds a single metaphor in lustre, as a constellation does a separate star. It is true, that allegories are sometimes found in other tropes; but this is very rare. In that known expression of Terence, the tropes are all metonyms: Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus grows cold; that is, divested of the tropes, Without meat and drink, love dies. And Samson's riddle is made up of synecdoches: \"Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.\" But there is no small skill required in the right management of allegories. For care should be taken that the same kind of trope be carried through the whole, so as to compose one uniform and consistent set of ideas: otherwise they dress up a chimera, a thing that has no existence, and of which the mind can form no perception. And, as Quintilian says very justly, \"to begin with a tempest and end with a fire, would be very ridiculous and unnatural.\" It is likewise very necessary that the allusions be all plain and evident, especially where the name of the thing alluded to is not expressed. These are called pure allegories. As that of Cicero: \"So it happens, that I, whose buffets it is to repel the darts, and heal the wounds, am obliged to appear before the adversaries have thrown any dart; and they are allowed a time to attack us, when it will not be in our power to avoid the assault; and if they throw a poisonous dart, which they seem prepared to do, we shall have no opportunity to apply a remedy.\" The tropes here are all taken from military affairs, without any intimation what they are applied to. But that is plain from the context of the discourse. For he is speaking of the disadvantages he laboured under in defending his client against those of the opposite side, and so applies to the bar those terms which were proper to the field. But where the reference is not evident, it becomes a riddle: which is nothing else but an obscure allegory. To avoid this, therefore, the best writers generally use what they call mixed allegories; that is, such wherein the proper name Elocution, of the thing is expressed, which the whole multitude respects. Of this kind is that in the speech of King Philip of Macedon, given us by Justin, where he says, \"I perceive that cloud of a dreadful and bloody war arising in Italy, and a thunder-form from the sea, which will fill all places with a large shower of blood, wherever the tempest of victory shall carry it.\" The proper words war, blood, and victory, being joined to the tropes cloud, shower, and tempest, in this sentence, render the several parts of the similitude plain and evident. Quintilian thinks those allegories most beautiful, where the whole similitude is expressed, and those words, which in their proper sense relate to one of the two things between which the comparison is made, are allegorically applied to the other: As when Cornelius Nepos says of Atticus, \"If that pilot gain the greatest reputation who preserves his ship in a boisterous and rocky sea; ought not he to be thought a man of singular prudence, who arrived in safety through so many and so great civil tempests?\" These are the allegories with which orators are chiefly concerned.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of Figures.\n\nThis term seems have been borrowed from the stage, where the different habits and gestures of the actors, suitable to the several characters they sustained, were by the Greeks called \u1fe5\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, and by the Latins from the figure: And it is not unusual with us to say of a person, both with respect to his dress and action, that he makes a very bad, or a very graceful, figure. And as language is the dress, as it were of our thoughts, in which they appear and are represented to others; so any particular manner of speaking, may, in a large sense of the word, be called its figure, in which latitude writers sometimes use it. But rhetoricians have refrained the sense of the word to such forms of speech as differ from the more common and ordinary ways of expression; as the theatrical habits of actors, and their deportment on the stage, are different from their usual garb and behaviour at other times. A figure therefore, in the sense it is used by rhetoricians, is A mode of speaking different from, and more beautiful and emphatical than, the ordinary and usual way of expressing the same sense; or, in other words, That language which is juggled either by the imagination or the passions. Now as the habits and gestures of our bodies are in a manner infinitely variable, so it is plain that the different forms of speech are almost innumerable. But every alteration from the common manner ought not to be esteemed a figure, nor deserves that character. It must contain some beauty, or express some passion, to merit a place among rhetorical figures, and be marked out for imitation.\n\nThe subject of figure seems to have been one of the last things which was brought into the art of oratory, in order to complete it. Aristotle, who treats so accurately upon other parts, says very little of this. But the Greek writers who came after him have abundantly supplied that deficiency. It is to them we owe the chief observations that have been made on this subject. They took notice of the several modes and turns of expression, observed their force and beauty, and gave them particular names by which they might be known and distinguished from each other. And indeed\nindeed they have treated the matter with such minute-\nness and subtlety, that Quintilian seems, not without\nreason, to think they have multiplied figures to an ex-\ncess. But though it was so late before they were taken\nnotice of, and introduced into the art of speaking, yet\nthe use of them in discourse was doubtless very ancient.\nThe author of Homer's life, which some have ascribed\nto Plutarch, has shown, by examples taken out of him,\nthat there is scarce a figure mentioned by rhetoricians,\nbut is to be met with in that most ancient poet. And,\nif we consider the nature of speech, we shall easily per-\nceive that mankind must have been under a necessity\nvery early to introduce the use of tropes for supplying\nthe want of proper words to express their simple ideas:\nso the like necessity must have put them upon the use of\nfigures to represent their different passions; though both\nof them were afterwards increased, and improved in\nsuch a manner as to become the chief ornaments of\nlanguage. The passions of men have been always the\nsame; they are implanted in us by nature, and we are\nall taught to discover them by the same ways. When\nthe mind is disturbed, we show it by our countenance,\nby our actions, and by our words. Fear, joy, anger,\nalter the countenance, and occasion different emotions\nand gestures of the whole body. And we know with\nwhat passion a man is affected, by hearing his words,\nthough we do not see him. He does not express him-\nself as he usually does at other times when cool and\nsedate. Objects appear to him in a different view,\nand therefore he cannot but speak of them in a diffe-\nrent way. He interrogates, he exclaims, he admires,\nhe appeals, he invokes, he threatens, he recalls his\nwords, repeats them, and by many other different turns\nof expression varies his speech no less than his counte-\nnance, from his common or ordinary manner. Now\nas nature seems to teach us by these figurative ex-\npressions how to represent the different commotions of\nour minds, hence some have thought fit to call figures\nthe language of the passions. And as these are given us,\namong other gifts, to excite us the better to pro-\nvide for our preservation and safety, this is done some-\ntimes by force of arms, and at other times by discourse.\nAnd therefore Cicero very handsomely compares the\nconduct of an orator to the exercises of the palaestra:\nin which, as each combatant endeavours not only to\ndefend himself, and attack his adversary, but likewise\nto do both with decency; so the principal weapons of\nan orator, as he represents them, are figures, which\nbeing no less the ornaments of language than images\nof our passions, answer all these purposes. Besides,\nfigures chiefly distinguish the different kinds of style,\nfurnish it with an agreeable variety, and often serve to\nrepresent things in a clear and forcible manner.\n\nFrom this short account of the nature of figures, the\nadvantage of them to an orator is very evident. They\nare a sort of natural eloquence, which every one falls\ninto without attending to it, suitably to that temper\nof mind with which he is affected himself, and is\ndisposed to affect others. In a cool and sedate dis-\ncourse, such figures as convey our sentiments with the\ngreatest strength and evidence are most proper. And\nthere are others, which are suited to brighten and en-\nliven more gay and sprightly subjects. Others again\nare more peculiarly adapted to express the disorders\nand perturbations of the mind. To repeat the same\nthing again would many times be deemed a tautology\nand impertinent; but to do this when the mind is\nruffled, is not only allowable, but the repetition ren-\nders it more strong and affecting. So likewise to in-\nterrogate, exclaim, or admire, under the influence of\na pallion, impresses the hearers, and dispose them to\nattention; whereas at another time perhaps such ways\nof speaking would scarce be consistent with prudence.\nThere is a natural sympathy in men's minds, which\ndisposes them to receive impressions from those with\nwhom they converse. Thus one gay and pleasant\ncompanion gives a cheerfulness and vivacity to a\nwhole company; whereas, on the contrary, one who\nis dull and phlegmatic damps the spirits of all about\nhim, and affects them with the same gloomy temper.\nFigures are peculiarly serviceable to an orator for an-\nswering these different intentions. And as he finds\nthem in life, from thence he must copy them; as a\npainter does the features of the countenance, and the\nseveral parts of the body; figures being to the one what\nlines and colours are to the other. The design of\nCatiline to destroy the Roman state and burn the city,\nis a story well known. There was an army drawn to-\ngether at a proper distance to favour the undertaking;\nand others were left in Rome, who had their parts\nassigned them for burning the city, and destroying\nthose who should escape the flames. And, in a word,\nevery thing was ready for putting in execution this\nhorrid and barbarous scheme. So that nothing re-\ntarded it but the taking off Cicero, who was then\nconfused, which was thought necessary to be done first.\nCicero, upon information of the design against his\nlife, finds means to prevent it, and the same day calls\ntogether the senate. And Catiline, who was a man of\nconsummate boldness, had the confidence to appear in\nthat assembly. Upon their meeting, Cicero opens\nto them the whole affair of the conspiracy, and the\ndesign against himself, in a most warm and pathetic\nharangue. In which he had two things in view;\nto rouse the indignation of the senate against the con-\nspirators, and particularly against Catiline; and, either\nby terrifying or exasperating him, to oblige him to\nleave the city. Now he does not begin this speech in\nhis usual manner at other times, by addressing to his\naudience, bespeaking their favour and attention, or let-\nting them gradually into the design of what he was\nabout to say; but as Catiline was present, he immediate-\nly falls upon him with vehemence, in the following\nmanner: \"How far, Catiline, will you abuse our pa-\ntience? How long will your fury insult us? What\nbounds will you set to your unbridled rage? Does\nneither the night-guard of the palace, nor the city-\nwatch, nor the people's fear, nor the agreement of all\ngood men, nor the meeting of the senate in this fortifi-\ned place, nor the countenances and looks of this as-\nsembly, at all move you? Do not you perceive your\ndesigns are discovered, and that all who are present\nknow of your conspiracy? Who of us, do you think, is\nignorant of what you did the last night, and the night\nbefore, where you was, who was with you, and what\nyou resolved on? O times, O manners! The senate\nknows this, the confidant fees it; and yet this man lives!\n\u2014lives? may, comes into the senate, joins in the public\ncounsels, observes and marks out each of us for destruc-\ntion!\" And in the same impetuous strain he proceeds\nElocution through his whole speech, interspersing a great variety of the like strong and moving figures. And the discourse had its desired effect: for when Catiline stood up afterwards to make his defence, the whole senate was so inflamed, and their resentments against him rose so high, from what Cicero had said, that they had not patience to hear him speak; upon which he left both them and the city. Had Cicero, instead of venting his just indignation against the author of so barbarous and inhuman a design, in the manner he did, by figures suited to strike the passions of his hearers; had he, instead of this, attempted to reason with him, and told the story in a cold and lifeless manner, he would have exposed himself to the contempt of Catiline; and by leaving the senate little or nothing moved at what he said, prevented perhaps their coming to those speedy and vigorous resolutions which were necessary at so critical a juncture. Let us suppose him to have expostulated with Catiline in much the same words as before, but thrown into a different form, and divested of those pathetic figures. As thus: \"Catiline, you have really abused our patience to a great degree. You have insulted us with your furious proceedings a long while. You seem to have fixed no bounds to your unbridled rage. Neither the night-guard of the palace, nor the city-watch, nor the people's fear, nor the agreement among good men, nor the calling together of the senate in this fortified place, nor the countenances and looks of this assembly, appear to move you in the least. I assure you we are all of us apprised of what you did the last night, and the night before, where you was, and who were with you, and what resolutions you came to. These are sad times, the age is very degenerate; that the senate should know all this, the confute it; and yet that this man should live, come into the senate, hear all our debates, and mark us out to destroy us.\" You see the sense is entirely the same, and the words too in a great measure; so that there is little more than an alteration in the form of them. And yet who does not perceive how flat and languid such a way of talking must have appeared at that time? and how much it loses of that spirit and energy, which shows itself in Cicero's manner of expression? Had he delivered himself thus, it might indeed have made the senate look upon Catiline as an abandoned wretch, loath to all virtue and goodness, and perhaps have moved some to pity him on that account; as we are easily induced to compassionate persons in such circumstances, especially when descended from noble and virtuous ancestors, which was his case. But sure it would have been ill fitted to fire their minds with that generous regard for their country, and the necessary precautions for its security, which the circumstances of the state then required. Nor would Catiline have been at all deterred by it, but rather encouraged in the prosecution of his designs, from the little effect a speech so managed must probably have had upon the minds of the senators. But Cicero knew very well that the passions of mankind are the springs of action: that it is many times not sufficient for an orator to convince their minds, by setting the truth in a clear light; but he must also raise their hopes, alarm their fears, inflame their anger, or excite some other suitable passion, before they will be brought to act with that zeal and fervour which the cause may require. And as he was admirably well skilled in this art of touching the passions, he seldom fails to fix upon the proper methods of doing it, and makes choice of such figures and modes of speaking as in the strongest manner represent the emotions of his own mind. For every passion is not to be expressed by the same figures, any more than it is drawn by the same lines, or painted with the same colours. When Dido finds that \u00c6neas is about to leave her, she uses all her arts to detain him. And as persons in great distress are seldom at a loss to express their condition in the most affecting way; she discovers her fear, anger, revenge, with the whole crowd of disorders which then possessed her mind, in a variety of moving figures, suited to raise the contrary passions in his breast, as is finely represented by Virgil in that artful speech he has made for her, which we forbear to recite for no other reason but the length of it. But what particular figures are most accommodated to answer the several ends proposed by them, will best appear when we come to treat of them separately.\n\nWe shall therefore now proceed to lay down a few directions for the proper use of figures. And first they should always be accommodated to the sentiments, and rise in proportion to the images designed to be conveyed by them. So far as they are founded in reason, they are suited to impress the mind; but where the language outruns the thought, though it may please the ear, and some weak persons may be carried away with a pomp of words, yet an intelligent hearer will soon see through the thin and airy drefs. It is the sense which gives weight to the figure, as that by striking the imagination awakens the mind, and excites it to act in conformity to reason. Again, in the use of pathetic figures, it is generally better to be nervous than copious, that the images, by their closer union, may impress the mind with greater force and energy; though in such figures as are designed for ornament or illustration; a more diffusive way of painting is sometimes agreeable. But farther, the too frequent use of figures ought to be avoided. For what was observed in relation to tropes, is also true with respect to these; that a great number of them is apt to darken and obscure the style. And besides, Cicero's reflection in this case is very just, That \"it is hard to say, what should be the reason, that those things, which most affect us with a sensible pleasure, and at first sight soonest move us, do likewise soonest cloy and satiate us.\" But that it is so, we find by common experience. Lastly, figures should be so interwoven in a discourse, as not to render the style rough and uneven, sometimes high and at other times low; now dry and jejune, then pompous and florid. In a word, they should rather seem to arise from nature than art; to offer themselves, than to be the effect of study; and to appear not like patches upon a face, but the agreeable beauty of a sound and healthful complexion. But of this we shall have occasion to speak more at large hereafter, in treating upon the different kinds or characters of style.\n\nAs to the division of figures, which is what remains to be considered, they are usually divided into two sorts, figures of words, and figures of sentences. The difference between them consists in this; that in the former, if you alter the words, or sometimes only the situation of them, you destroy the figure; but in the latter the figure remains, whatever words are made use of,\nElocution, or in what mannersoever the order of them is changed. Thus when the name of a person or thing is repeated, to intimate some known property or quality belonging thereto, it is a verbal figure called place. Cicero was a true patriot and hearty lover of his country. And therefore we shall use this figure in saying, that at the time of Catiline's conspiracy Cicero appeared like Cicero. The sense would remain the same, but the figure would be lost, if we should alter the words, and say, at that time Cicero appeared like himself. So when two or more sentences, or members of a sentence, end with the same word, it is called epistrophos; as when we say, To lose all relish of life, is in effect to lose life. But if only the order of the words be changed in the latter clause thus, To lose all relish of life, is to lose life in effect; the figure vanishes. And this is the nature of the verbal figures. But it is not so in figures of sentences: they continue the same, whatever alterations are made in the words. An orator sometimes thinks it proper to change the form of his discourse, and address himself to his audience, or an absent person, or else perhaps to introduce some other person as speaking to them whose words may be supposed to carry greater weight and authority with them than his own. The former of these is called apophoros, and the latter prosopoeia or imagery; which require no certain words or order of expression.\n\nArt. I. Verbal Figures.\n\nThese may be distinguished into three sorts, as they consist in a deficiency of words, a redundancy, or a repetition.\n\nI. Of the first sort are ellipsis and asyndeton.\n\nEllipsis, is when one or more words are wanting in a sentence to complete the construction, and fully express the sense. This figure is often used in proverbial speeches: as when we say, Many men, many minds; that is, have many minds; and, The more danger, the more honour; that is, gains more honour. But where more is intended by such expressions than mere brevity, and especially when they are the effect of some passion, the figure receives another name, and is called apophoros, which is placed among the figures of sentences, where we shall consider it.\n\nAsyndeton, is when the particles that connect the members of a sentence one with another are left out, to represent either the celerity of an action, or the haste and eagerness of the speaker. Thus Caesar expresses his speedy conquest of Pharnaces: I came, I saw, I conquered. If he had inserted the copulatives, and said, I came, and I saw, and I conquered, it would have retarded the expression, and not given so full and just an idea of the swiftness of the action. In the last article we took notice of the vehement and impetuous manner in which Cicero attacked Catiline in his first oration, where his design was to fire the minds of the senate against him, and oblige him to leave the city, both which points he gained by that speech. The next day, therefore, when Catiline was gone, he calls together the body of the citizens, and makes a speech to them, which in a sort of rapture or transport of mind he thus begins, by acquainting them with the departure of Catiline, He is gone, departed, elapsed, broke out; intimating at the same time both the excessive rage in which Catiline left Rome, and the great pleasure with which he was himself affected on that account. This concise way of speaking adds likewise a considerable emphasis to an expression, and by bringing the several parts of a thing nearer together affects the mind with greater force. Thus Cicero sets Cato's character in a very strong and beautiful light by the use of this figure. \"Nature itself (says he) has made you a great and excellent man for integrity, gravity, temperance, magnanimity, justice, in a word, for all virtues.\"\n\nII. The second sort of verbal figures is contrary to these, and consists in a redundancy or multiplicity of words; which are likewise two, pleonasmos and polysyndeton.\n\nWhen we use more words than are necessary to express a thing, it is called pleonasmos. This is done sometimes for greater emphasis, as when we say, Where in the world is he? At other times it is designed to ascertain the truth of what is said: So the servant in Terence, when the truth of what he had related was called in question, replies, It is certainly so; I saw it with these very eyes.\n\nWhen the several parts of a sentence are united by proper particles, it is called polysyndeton. This adds a weight and gravity to an expression, and makes what is said to appear with an air of solemnity; and by retarding the course of the sentence, gives the mind an opportunity to consider and reflect upon every part distinctly. We often meet with this figure in Demosthenes, which very well suits with the gravity of his style. So he encourages the Athenians to prosecute the war against King Philip of Macedon, from this consideration, that now \"they had ships and men, and money, and stores, and all other things which might contribute to the strength of the city, in greater number and plenty than in former times.\" Every article here has its weight, and carries in it a proper motive to animate them to the war. But if you remove the copulatives, the sentence will lose much of its force.\n\nIII. The third kind of verbal figures consists in a repetition. And either the same word in sound or sense, is repeated; or one of a like sound, or signification, or both.\n\nOf the former sort there are ten, called antanaclasis, place, epizeuxis, climax, anaphora, epistrophos, synecdoche, anadiplosis, and epanodos. The two first of these agree in sound, but differ in sense; the eight following agree in both.\n\nWhen the same word in sound but not in sense is repeated, it is called antanaclasis. This figure sometimes carries a poignancy in it; and when it appears natural and easy, discovers a ready turn of thought. As when a son, to clear himself of suspicion, assured his father he did not wait for his death; his father replied, But I desire you would wait for it. Here the word wait is taken in two different senses. It is likewise used on serious occasions, as in grave and moral precepts, which are apt to affect the mind with greater pleasure when delivered in an agreeable dress. As this: Care for those things in your youth, which in old age may free you from care: Where the word care in the former place signifies to provide, and in the latter anxiety of mind. And even our Saviour himself once uses this figure, when he says to one of his disciples, who\nElocution who desired to be dismissed from attending him that he might go and bury his father; Follow me, and lead the dead bury their dead: Where dead in one place denotes a natural death, and in the other a moral or spiritual death.\n\nSometimes the name of some person or thing is repeated again, to denote some particular character or property designed to be expressed by it; and then it is called place. Thus Cicero says, Young Cato wants experience, but yet he is Cato; meaning he had the steady temper of the family. And so in the proverbial expression, An ape is an ape, dries him ever so fine.\n\nWhen a word is repeated again with vehemence in the same sense, it is called epizeuxis. This figure shows the earnestness of the speaker, and his great concern of mind about what he says; and therefore has a natural tendency to excite the attention of the audience. It is fitted to express anger, surprize, sorrow, and several other passions. As when Cicero would express his indignation against Antony for having been the chief instrument in bringing on the civil war, he says to him: You, you, Antony pulsed Caesar upon the civil war. And thus he tells Catiline in his first invective against him: You live; and live, not to lay aside, but to pursue, your wicked design. And when our Saviour would express his great concern and sorrow for the wickedness of the Jews, he does it in this pathetic manner: O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who killest the prophets.\n\nClimax is a beautiful kind of repetition, when the word, which ends the first member of a period, begins the second, and so through each member, till the whole is finished. There is a great deal of strength as well as beauty in this figure, where the several steps rise naturally, and are closely connected with each other. As in this example: There is no enjoyment of property without government, no government without a magistrate, no magistrate without obedience, and no obedience where every one acts as he pleases. But, as Quintilian observes, this figure lies so open, that it is apt to look too much like art; for which reason he advises not to use it often. To prevent this, therefore, orators sometimes disguise it, by not repeating the same word which stood in the former member, but some other equivalent to it. As in the following instance of Cicero for Milo: Nor did he commit himself only to the people, but also to the senate; nor to the senate only, but likewise to the public forces; nor to these only, but also to his power with whom the senate had entrusted the whole commonwealth.\n\nWhen several sentences, or members of a sentence, begin with the same word, it is called anaphora. This is a lively and elegant figure, and serves very much to engage the attention. For by the frequent return of the same word the mind of the hearer is held in an agreeable suspense, till the whole is finished. \"You do nothing (says Cicero to Catiline), you attempt nothing, you think nothing, but what I not only hear, but also see, and plainly perceive.\" It is frequently used by way of question; which renders it not only beautiful, but likewise strong and nervous. As at the beginning of the same speech: Does neither the night-guard of the palace, nor the city-watch, nor the people's fear, nor the agreement of all good men, nor the meeting of the senate in this fortified place, nor the countenances and looks of this assembly, at all move you?\" And in another of his orations: \"What is so popular as peace, which seems to afford a pleasure, not only to beings endowed with senses, but even to inanimate nature? What is so popular as liberty, which even beasts as well as men seem to covet and prefer above all things? What is so popular as ease and leisure, for the enjoyment of which you and your ancestors have undergone the greatest labours?\"\n\nEpiphrase is contrary to the former, and makes the repetition at the end of each member or sentence. As thus: \"Since concord was lost; friendship was lost; fidelity was lost; liberty was lost; all was lost.\" And Cicero, in the charge which he brings against Mark Antony before the senate, makes use of this figure, when he says, \"Do you lament the destruction of three Roman armies? The author of that destruction was Antony. Do you bewail the loss of most eminent citizens? They have been taken from you by Antony. Is the authority of this order weakened? It is weakened by Antony.\"\n\nSyncope takes in both these last figures. As in that of Cicero: \"You would pardon and acquit him, whom the senate hath condemned, whom the people of Rome have condemned, whom all mankind have condemned.\" Here the several members both begin and end with the same word. We have a beautiful instance of it in St Paul, when he says, \"Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.\"\n\nWhen a sentence concludes with the word with which it began, it is called epanalepsis. As in that expression of Plautus, \"Virtue contains all things, he wants no good thing who has virtue.\" The figure is the same, but the principle not so honest, in the advice which we find given by the miser in Horace, when he says, \"Get money, if you can, honestly; but however, get money.\" This figure adds a force to an expression, when the principal thing designed to be conveyed is thus repeated, by leaving it last upon the mind. And it heightens the beauty of it, when the sentence has an agreeable turn arising from two opposite parts. As in Cicero's compliment to Caesar: \"We have seen your victory terminated by the war; your drawn sword in the city we have not seen.\" Hermogenes calls this a circle, because the sentence returns again to the same word, as that geometrical figure is formed by the orbicular motion of a line to the same point.\n\nWhen the following sentence begins with the same word with which the former concluded, it is termed anadiplosis. As in the following instance: Let us think no price too great for truth; truth cannot be bought too dear. So in that passage of St John: He came to his own, and his own received him not. This figure generally suits best with grave and solemn discourses.\n\nEpanothis is the inversion of a sentence, or repeating it backwards, so that it takes in the two last figures; for it both begins and ends with the same word, and the same word is likewise repeated in the middle. This turn of expression has a beauty in it, and shows a readiness of thought. We have the following example\nElocution of it in Minutius Felix, where he is exposing the folly of the Egyptian superstition. \"Ifis (says he), with Cynocephalus and her priests, laments, bemoans, and seeks her lost son; her attendants beat their breasts, and imitate the grief of the unhappy mother; in a little time the son is found, upon which they all rejoice. Nor do they cease every year to lose what they find, or to find what they lose. And is it not ridiculous to lament what you worship, or to worship what you lament?\" It serves likewise to illustrate and enforce the sense, by setting it in two opposite views. As in that expression of the prophet: \"Wo unto them who call good evil, and evil good; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness!\"\n\nThose figures which consist in a repetition of words of a like sound or signification, or both, are four: paronomasia, homoiopoton, synonymia, and derivatio; the two first of which respect words that are similar in sound only, the third in sense, and the last in both.\n\nWhen two words very near in sound, but different in sense, respect each other in the same sentence, it is called paronomasia. As when we say, After a feast comes a fast; and, A friend in need is a friend indeed. We usually call it a pun, which when new, and appropriately used, passes for wit, and serves to enliven conversation. Nor is it wholly to be excluded from grave and serious discourse: for a witty jest has many times had a better effect than a solid argument, and prevailed with those who could not be moved by close reasoning. And therefore Cicero and the best speakers have sometimes recourse to it upon weighty and solemn occasions, as will be shown hereafter in its proper place.\n\nWhen the several parts of a sentence end with the same case, or tense of a like sound, this also is considered as a figure, and named homoiopoton. As thus: No marvel though, wisdom complain that she is either wilfully despised, or carelessly neglected; either openly scorned, or secretly abhorred. This figure is esteemed most beautiful when the parts are all of the same length, or pretty near it; as it adds to the harmony of the period, and renders the cadence of the several members more musical from the just proportion between them. The Greek rhetoricians were much addicted to this figure, and Diocrates is particularly celebrated for it. But some of the best orators seem to have judiciously avoided it, as carrying in it too much the appearance of art. And it is remarkable, that this figure appears nowhere so much in all the works of Demosthenes, as in an oration which he did not speak himself, but wrote for his friend Diodorus, a man of that taste, who was to pronounce it as his own.\n\nThe next figure above-mentioned is synonymia. Now strictly speaking, synonymous words are those which have exactly the same sense. But there being few such, the use of the term is so far extended as to comprehend words of a near affinity in their signification, which in discourse are frequently put for one another. So, to desire, and intreat, are sometimes used as equivalent terms; whereas to desire is no more than to wish for a thing, and to intreat is to express that inclination in words. In like manner, esteem and honour are often taken for synonymous words, though they have not precisely the same sense, but one is the usual consequence of the other; for esteem is the good opinion we entertain of a person in our mind, and honour the outward expression of that opinion. When two or more such words come together, they constitute this figure. As when Cicero, speaking of Piilo, says, \"His whole countenance, which is the tacit language of the mind, has drawn men into a mistake, and deceived, cheated, imposed on those who did not know him.\" This figure sometimes adds force to an expression, by enlivening the idea; and it often promotes the harmony and just cadency of a sentence, which otherwise would drop too soon, and disappoint the ear.\n\nWhen such words as spring from the same root, as justice, just, injustice, unjust, and the like, come together in the same sentence, they make the figure called derivatio. Cicero, observing the vanity of the philosophers who affected praise, at the same time that they derided it, uses this figure, when he says of them, \"The philosophers set their names to those very books which they write for the contempt of glory; and are desirous to be honoured and applauded, even for what they lay in contempt of honour and applause.\" This figure receives an additional beauty when repeated, especially in two opposite members; as, He wished rather to die a present death, than to live a miserable life.\n\nArt. II. Figures of Sentences.\n\nOf these, some are principally adapted for reasoning, and others to move the passions.\n\n1. Those suited for proof, Which are fix: Prolepsis, hypolepsis, anacoinosis, epitrope, parabole, and antithesis.\n\nProlepsis, or anticipation, is so called, when the orator first starts an objection, which he foresees may be raised against his conduct or cause, and then answers for himself. Its use is to forestall an adversary, and prevent moving his exceptions, which cannot afterwards be introduced passively, with too good grace. Though it has likewise a farther advantage, as it serves to conciliate the audience, while the speaker appears disfavourable to represent matters fairly, and not to conceal any objection which may be made against him. The occasions of this figure are various; and the manner of introducing it very different. Sometimes the orator thinks it necessary to begin with it, in order to justify his conduct, and remove any exceptions which may be made against his design. Cicero, for several years together, after he first began to plead, had always been for the defendant in criminal cases. And therefore, when he was prevailed with to undertake the accusation of Verres, he begins his oration with this apology for himself: \"If any one present should wonder, that when for several years past I have conducted myself as to defend many and accuse none, I now on a sudden alter my custom, and undertake an accusation; when he shall have heard the occasion and reason of my design, he will both approve of it, and think no person so proper to manage this affair as myself.\" And then he proceeds to give an account of the reasons which moved him to engage in it. At other times the objection is admitted as an exception to what has been said, but not so as to affect it in general. Thus, when Cicero has represented the advantages of literature and the polite arts, he starts this objection to what himself had said, \"But some one will ask, whether those great men, the memory of whose glorious actions is delivered down to posterity, were acquainted with that sort of learning...\"\nTo which he replies, \"Indeed this can scarce be said of them all. However, the answer is easy. I have known several persons of excellent abilities, who, without learning, by the force of an extraordinary genius have been men of great virtue and fidelity. Nay, I will add, that nature without learning has oftener produced these qualifications, than learning without a genius. But yet it must still be owned, that where both these meet, they form something very excellent and singular.\" Again, at other times, the orator artfully represents the objection as something considerable and important, to give the greater weight to his answer when he has confuted it. Cicero, in his celebrated oration for the Manilian law, could not omit to take notice, that Lucullus had already gained several very considerable advantages over Mithridates. And therefore, having before described the war as very great and dangerous, apprehending these two accounts might appear somewhat inconsistent, and be liable to an objection, he puts it thus artfully himself: \"But now, after what I have said of Lucullus, it may probably be asked, How then can the war be so great? be pleaded to hear, for there seems to be very just reason for this question.\" And then he proceeds to show, from the power of King Mithridates at that time, his great abilities, long experience in military affairs, and fresh alliances, that the war was yet very great and dangerous. But sometimes, when the orator is sensible that what he has advanced lies open to an objection, he omits to make it in express terms; and yet proceeds to vindicate what he had said, as if it had been made. Thus, when Cicero had charged Verres with having plundered the inhabitants of Sicily of all their plate, jewels, and other valuable moveables, which he thought worth while to carry away; as the audience might imagine this to be scarce credible, he takes it for granted they thought so, and therefore immediately adds, \"As strange as this is, I affirm it positively, without any intention to aggravate the crime.\" And so he goes on to the proof of his assertion. But this figure is likewise made use of to guard against some objection, which the speaker apprehends may be made against what he designs to say. And thus Cicero uses it in his oration for Sextius. \"My province (says he), as I speak last, seems to call for affection to my friend, rather than his defense; complaint, rather than eloquence; expressions of grief, rather than art. And therefore, if I shall express myself with more warmth, or greater freedom, than those who have spoke before me, I hope you will grant me all that liberty of speech which you judge reasonable to be allowed to an affectionate sorrow and just resentment.\" This figure requires great prudence and discretion in the management of it. The speaker must consider well the temper, bias, and other circumstances of his hearers, in order to form a right judgment what parts of his discourse may be most liable to exception. For to object such things, which the hearers would never have thought of themselves, is to give himself a needless trouble; and to start such difficulties, which he cannot afterwards fairly remove, will expose both himself and his cause. But as nothing gives an audience greater pleasure and satisfaction, than to have their scruples fully answered as they rise in their thoughts; so, on the contrary, be a discourse otherwise ever so entertaining and agreeable, if there be any doubt left upon the minds of the hearers, it gives them a pain that continues with them till it be removed.\n\nThe figure hypobole or subjection, is not much unlike the former; and is, when several things are mentioned that seem to make for the contrary side, and each of them refuted in order. It consists of three parts, when complete; a proposition, an enumeration of particulars with their answers, and a conclusion.\u2014Thus Cicero, upon his return from banishment, vindicates his conduct in withdrawing so quietly, and not opposing the faction that ejected him. \"My departure (says he) is objected to me; which charge I cannot answer without commending myself. For what must I say? That I fled from a consciousness of guilt? But what is charged upon me as a crime, was so far from being a fault, that it is the most glorious action since the memory of man, (he means his punishing the associates of Catiline.) That I feared being called to an account by the people? That was never talked of; and if it had been done, I should have come off with double honour. That I wanted the support of good and honest men? That is false. That I was afraid of death? That is a calumny. I must therefore say, what I would not, unless compelled to it, that I withdrew to preserve the city.\" When the objections are put by way of question, as in the example here given, they add a brilliancy and poignancy to the figure. All the parts of it are not constantly expressed. For thus Cicero in his defence of Plancius introduces his adversary objecting, and himself answering, \"The people judged ill, but they did judge; they should not have done it, but they had a power; I cannot submit to it, but many very great and wise men have.\"\u2014Both the proposition and conclusion are here omitted.\n\nThe next figure in order is anaecopisis, or communication; by which the speaker deliberates either with the judges, the hearers, or the adversary himself. Thus Cicero addresses the judges in his accusation of Verres: \"Now I desire your opinion what you think I ought to do. And I know your advice will be, though you do not declare it, what appears to me necessary to be done.\" In another place we find him reasoning in this manner with the adverse party: \"What could you have done in such a case, and at such a time; when to have sat still, or withdrawn, would have been cowardice? When the wickedness and fury of Saturninus the tribune had called you into the capitol; and the consuls, to defend the safety and liberty of your country; whose authority, whose voice, which party would you have followed, and whose command would you have chosen to obey?\" This figure carries in it an air of modesty and condescension, when the speaker seems unwilling to determine in his own cause, but refers it to the opinion of others. It likewise shows a persuasion of the equity of his cause, that he can leave it to their arbitration; and serves very much to conciliate their minds, while he joins them, as it were with himself, and makes them of his party. And when the appeal is made to the adverse party, it is of considerable advantage, either to extort a confession, or at least to silence him. And therefore the sacred writers sometimes very beautifully introduce God himself thus expostulating with mankind; as the prophet Malachi.\nMalachi, A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master. If then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear?\n\nAnother figure that comes under this head, is epistle or conception; which grants one thing, to obtain another more advantageous. It is either real or feigned; and either the whole of a thing, or a part only, is granted. We shall consider each of these separately, and illustrate them with proper examples. Nothing more confounds an adversary, than to grant him his whole argument; and at the same time either to show that it is nothing to the purpose, or to offer something else which may invalidate it. I allow, says the claimant by will against the heir at law, that nobody was more nearly related to the deceased than you; that he was under some obligations to you; that you were in the army together; but what is all this to the swill? And thus Cicero in his defence of Ligarius, who was accused by Tubero for having joined with Pompey in the civil war between him and Caesar: \"You have, Tubero, what an accuser would most desire, the accused person confessing the charge; but so as to affirm, that he was of the same party with you and your excellent father. Therefore own first that it was a crime in yourself, before you charge it as such upon Ligarius.\" Sometimes the orator gives up some particular point that would well admit of a dispute, to gain something more considerable, which he thinks cannot fairly be denied him. In the affair of Roctius, where the proof depended upon circumstances, Cicero, who defended him, inquires what reason could be alleged for his committing so black a crime, as to kill his father. And after he has shown there was no probable reason to be assigned for it, he adds, \"Well, since you can offer no reason, although this might be sufficient for me, yet I will recede from my right; and upon the assurance I have of his innocence, I will grant you in this cause what I would not in another. I do not therefore insist upon your telling me why he killed his father, but ask how he did it?\" This appearance of candour and ingenuity in such conceptions removes the suspicion of art, and gives greater credit to what is denied. We have an example of a feigned or ironical conception in Cicero's defence of Flaccus: where, interceding for him on the account of his former good services in the time of Catiline's conspiracy, he says in a way of irony, If such things are to be overlooked, \"let us appease the ghosts of Lentulus and Cethegus; let us recall those who are in exile; and let us be punished for our too great affection and love for our country.\" By this artful intimation, the orator, after he has used all his arguments to persuade his hearers, does as it were set them at liberty, and leave them to their own election; it being the nature of man to adhere more steadfastly to what is not violently imposed, but referred to his own free and deliberative choice. And to these feigned conceptions may be referred such ways of reasoning, by which the orator both justifies a charge brought against him upon the supposition of its being true, and also proves that the charge itself is false. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Milo, represents the taking off Clodius, with which Milo was accused, as a glorious action; after he has shown that Milo's servants did it without the knowledge of their master.\n\nParabole or similitude, illustrates a thing by comparing it with some other, to which it bears a resemblance. Similitudes are indeed generally but weak arguments, though often beautiful and fine ornaments. And where the design of them is not so much to prove what is doubtful, as to set things in a clear and agreeable light, they come properly under the notion of figures. They are of two sorts; simple and compound. Those are called simple, in which one thing only is likened or compared to another, in this manner: As swallows appear in summer, but in winter retreat; so false friends show themselves in prosperity, but all fly away when adversity approaches. Compound similitudes are such, wherein one thing is likened or compared to several others; as thus: What light is to the world, physic to the sick, water to the thirsty, and rest to the weary; that is knowledge to the mind. The more exact the agreement is between the things thus compared, they give the greater beauty and grace to the figure.\n\nAntithesis, or opposition, by which things contrary or different are compared, to render them more evident. Thus Cicero says, \"The Roman people hate private luxury, but love public grandeur.\" This is a very florid figure; and suited no less for amplification than proof. As in the following instance of Cicero, where, speaking of Pompey, he says, \"He waged more wars than others had read; conquered more provinces than others had governed; and had been trained up from his youth to the art of war, not by the precepts of others, but by his own commands; not by marches in the field, but by victories; not by campaigns, but triumphs.\" It is esteemed a beauty in this figure when any of the members are inverted, which some call antimetaphor. As where Cicero, opposing the conduct of Verres when governor of Sicily, to that of Marcellus who took Syracuse the capital city of that island, says, \"Compare this peace with that war, the arrival of this governor with the victory of that general, his profligate troops with the invincible army of the other, the luxury of the former with the temperance of the latter; you will say, that Syracuse was founded by him who took it, and taken by him who held it when founded.\" To this figure may also be referred oxymoron, or seeming contradiction; that is, when the parts of a sentence disagree in sound, but are consistent in sense. As when Ovid says of Althea, that she was impiously pious. And so Cato used to say of Scipio Africanus, that \"he was never less at leisure, than when he was at leisure; nor less alone, than when alone.\" By which he meant, as Cicero tells us, that \"Scipio was wont to think of himself in his retirement, and in his solitude to converse with himself.\" This is a strong and bold figure, which awakens the mind, and affords it an agreeable pleasure to find upon reflection, that what at first seemed contradictory, is not only consistent with good sense, but very beautiful.\u2014The celebrated Dr Blair, whom we have more than once quoted in this article, has these observations on antithesis, or the contrast of two objects. \"Contrast has always this effect, to make each of the contrasted objects appear in the stronger light. White, for instance, never appears so bright as when it is opposed to black, and when both are viewed together. Antithesis, therefore, may, on many occasions be employed to advantage, in order to strengthen the impression which we intend that any object should make. In order to render an antithesis more complete, it is\nElocution always of advantage that the words and members of the sentence, expressing the contrasted objects, be similarly constructed, and made to correspond to each other. This leads us to remark the contrast more, by setting the things which we oppose more clearly over against each other; in the same manner as when we contrast a black and a white object, in order to perceive the full difference of their colour, we would choose to have both objects of the same bulk, and placed in the same light. Their resemblance to each other, in certain circumstances, makes their disagreement in others more palpable. At the same time I must observe, that the frequent use of antithesis, especially where the opposition in the words is nice and quaint, is apt to render the style disagreeable. A maxim, or moral saying, properly enough receives this form; both because it is supposed to be the fruit of meditation, and because it is designed to be engraven on the memory, which recalls it more easily by the help of such contrasted expressions. But where a string of such sentences succeed each other, where this becomes an author's favourite and prevailing manner of expressing himself, his style is faulty; and it is upon this account Seneca has been often and justly censured. Such a style appears too studied and laboured; it gives us the impression of an author attending more to his manner of saying things, than to the things themselves which he says. There is still another kind of antithesis, which consists in surprising us by the unexpected contrasts of things which it brings together; but it is such as is wholly beneath the dignity of an orator, or of grave compositions of any sort, and is fit only for pieces of professed wit and humour, calculated only to excite laughter or create ridicule.\n\nII. Those fitted to move the passions. Which are 13; namely, opanorthosia, paraplysia, parrhelia, aparithmeia, exergasia, hypotupstis, aporia, polipoges, eratetis, ephonefia, epiphonema, agrophobia, and prospopopeta.\n\nOpanorthosia, or correction, is a figure, by which the speaker either recalls or amends what he had last said. It is used different ways. For sometimes one or more words are recalled by him, and others substituted in their room; at other times, without recalling what has been said, something else is substituted as more suitable. This is a very extensive figure, and made use of in addressing different passions. We have an instance of it in Terence's Self-tormentor, where the old man, whose extraordinary concern for the absence of his son gave occasion to the name of the play, thus bewails his condition to his neighbour. \"I have an only son, Chremes. Alas! did I say that I have? I had indeed; but it is now uncertain whether I have or not.\" Here, to aggravate his misfortune, he recalls a pleasing word, and substitutes another more affecting in its place. And Cicero, in his defence of Milo, speaking to the judges concerning Clodius, says, \"Are you only ignorant what laws, if they may be called laws, and not rather torches and plagues of the state, he was about to impose and force upon us?\" Again, in his defence of Plancius, he says, \"What greater blow could those judges, if they are to be called judges, and not parriicides of their country, have given to the state, than when they banished him, who when praetor freed the republic from a neighbouring war, and when confid from a civil one?\" He is speaking there of Optimus. But in commending the moderation of Lucius Mummius, who did not enrich himself, but his country, by demolishing the wealthy city of Corinth, he thus recalls his whole expression, and by giving it a new turn, heightens the compliment he designed him: \"He chose rather (says he) to adorn Italy than his own house; though by adorning Italy his house seems to have received the greatest ornament.\" And sometimes the correction is made by substituting something contrary to what had been said before; as in the following passage of Cicero: \"Caesar (meaning Augustus), though but a youth, by an incredible and surprising resolution and courage, when Antony was most enraged, and we dreaded his cruel and pernicious return from Brundusium, at a time when we neither asked, nor expected, nor desired it (because it was thought impossible), raised a very powerful army of invincible veterans; to effect which he threw away his whole estate: Though I have used an improper word; for he did not throw it away, but employed it for the safety of the government.\" At other times, as has been said, the correction is made by adding a more suitable word, without any repetition of the former. Thus Cicero, after he has inveighed against the crimes of Verres, breaks out into this pathetic exclamation: O the clemency, or rather wonderful and singular patience, of the Roman people! He did not think the word clemency strong enough, and therefore adds patience, as better answering his design. The sudden and unexpected turn of this figure gives a surprise to the mind, and by that means renders it the more pathetic.\n\nParalipsis, or omission, is another of these figures, when the speaker pretends to omit, or pass by, what at the same time he declares. It is used either in praise or dispraise. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Sextius, introduces his character in this manner, with a design to recommend him to the favour of the court: \"I might say many things of his liberality, kindness to his domestics, his command in the army, and moderation during his office in the province; but the honour of the state prefers itself to my view; and calling me to it, advises me to omit these lesser matters.\" But in his oration to the senate against Rullius the tribune, who had proposed a law to sell the public lands, he makes use of this figure to represent the pernicious effects of such a law, particularly with respect to the lands in Italy. \"I do not complain (says he) of the diminution of our revenues, and the woeful effects of this loss and damage. I omit what may give every one occasion for a very grievous and just complaint, that we could not preserve the principal estate of the public, the finest possession of the Roman people, the fund of our provisions, the granary of our wants, a revenue entrusted with the state; but that we must give up those lands to Rullius, which, after the power of Sylla, and the large estates of the Gracchi, are yet left us. I do not say, this is now the only revenue of the state, which continues when others cease, is an ornament in peace, fails us not in war, supports the army, and does not fear an enemy. I pass over all these things, and reserve them for my discourse to the people, and only speak at present of the danger of our peace and liberties.\" His view here was to raise the indignation of the senate against Rullius, and excite them to oppose the law. There is a beautiful instance of this figure in St Paul's epistle to Philemon, where, after he has earnestly intreated him to receive again Onesimus his servant, who had run from him, and promised that if\nElocution, he had wronged him, or owed him any thing, he would repay it, he adds, *That I may not say, you owe even yourself to me.* Nothing could be a stronger motive to soften his displeasure against his servant, from a sense of gratitude to the apostle. Hermogenes has observed, that the design of this figure is to poise the minds of the audience with more than the words express, and that it is principally made use of on three occasions: either when things are small, but yet necessary to be mentioned; or well known, and need not be enlarged on; or ungrateful, and therefore should be introduced with caution, and not set in too strong a light.\n\nThe next figure above-mentioned was *Parrhesia*, or reprehenfion: Not that whenever a person admonishes or reproves another it is to be esteemed a figure; but when it is done with art and address, and in such circumstances as render it difficult not to displease.\u2014The orator therefore sometimes prepares his hearers for this by commending them first, urging the necessity of it, representing his great concern for them as his motive, or joining himself with them. Thus Cicero charges the senate with the death of Servius Sulpicius, for sending him to Mark Antony, under a very ill state of health. And his design in it was to bring them more readily into a motion he was about to make, that both a statue and a sepulchral monument might be erected to his memory at the public expense. \"You (says he), it is a very severe expression, but I cannot help saying it; you, I say, have deprived Servius Sulpicius of his life. It was not from cruelty indeed (for what is there with which this assembly is less chargeable?), but when his temper pleaded his excuse more than his words, from the hopes you conceived that there was nothing which his authority and wisdom might not be able to effect, you vehemently opposed his excuse, and obliged him, who always had the greatest regard for your commands, to recede from his resolution.\" Sometimes, indeed, the orator assumes an air of reproof, with a view only to pass a compliment with a better grace. As Cicero in his address to Caesar, when he says, \"I hear that excellent and wise saying from you with concern, That you have lived long enough, either for the purposes of nature, or glory: for nature perhaps, if you think so: and, if you please, for glory: but, what is principally to be regarded, not for your country.\" It adds both a beauty and force to this figure, when it is expressed in a way of comparison. As in the following instance of Cicero: \"But since my discourse leads me to this, consider how you ought to be affected for the dignity and glory of your empire. Your ancestors often engaged in war to redress the injuries of their merchants or sailors: how ought you then to resent it, that so many thousand Roman citizens were murdered by one massacre, and at one time? Your forefathers destroyed Corinth, the principal city in Greece, for the haughty treatment of their ambassadors; and will you suffer that king to go unpunished, who has put to death a Roman legate, of consular dignity, in the most ignominious as well as most cruel manner? See, lest, as it was their honour to leave you the glory of so great an empire, it should prove your disgrace not to be able to maintain and defend what you have received from them.\" By this figure an address is made to the more tender passions, modesty, shame, and emulation, the attendants of an ingenuous temper, which is soonest touched, and most affected, by a just reproof.\n\nAnother of these pathetic figures is *Aparithmeis*, or Elocution-enumeration, when that, which might be expressed in general by a few words, is branched out into several particulars, to enlarge the idea, and render it the more affecting. Cicero, in pleading for the Manilian law, where his design is to conciliate the love and esteem of the people to Pompey, thus enlarges upon his character: \"Now, what language can equal the virtue of Cnecus Pompey? What can be said either worthy of him, or new to you, or which every one has not heard? For those are not the only virtues of a general which are commonly thought so; labour in affairs, courage in dangers, industry in acting, dispatch in performing, design in contriving; which are greater in him than in all other generals we have ever seen or heard of.\" And so likewise, when he endeavours to dispoise Pompey of the apprehension that Milo designed to affrighten him: \"If (says he) you fear Milo; if you imagine that either formerly, or at present, any ill design has been formed by him against your life; if the soldiers raised through Italy (as some of your officers give out), if these arms, if these cohorts in the Capitol, if the centuries, if the watch, if the guards which defend your person and house, are armed to prevent any attempt of Milo, and all of them appointed, prepared, and stationed on his account; he must be thought a person of great power, and incredible resolution, above the reach and capacity of a single man, that the most consummate general, and the whole republic are in arms against him only. But who does not perceive, that all the disordered and sinking parts of the state are committed to you, to rectify and support them by these forces?\" This might have been said in a few words, that such vast preparations could never be intended for so low a purpose. But the orator's view was to expose that groundless report, and flame it out of countenance. And soon after he endeavours to raise compassion for Milo under those prejudices by the same figure: \"See how various and changeable is the state of human life, how unsteady and volatile is fortune, what infidelity in friends, what disguises suited to the times, what flights, what fears, even of the nearest acquaintance, at the approach of dangers.\" Had no address to the passions been designed here, fewer of these reflections might have been sufficient. The use of this figure in amplification is very evident from the nature of it, which consists in unfolding of things, and by that means enlarging the conception of them.\n\n*Exergafia*, or exposition, has an affinity with the former figure: but it differs from it in this, that it consists of several equivalent expressions, or nearly such, in order to represent the same thing in a stronger manner; whereas the other enlarges the idea by an enumeration of different particulars. So that this figure has a near relation to synonymia, of which we have treated before under Verbal Figures. We have an instance of it in Cicero's defence of Sextius, where he says, \"Those who at any time have incited the populace to sedition, or blinded the minds of the ignorant by corruption, or introduced brave and excellent men, and such as deserved well of the public, have with us always been esteemed vain, bold, bad, and pernicious citizens. But those who repented the attempts and endeavours of such as, by their authority, integrity, constancy, resolution, and prudence, withstood their influence, have been always accounted men of solidity, the chiefs, the leaders, and supporters...\"\nElocution, supporters of our dignity and government.\" Nothing more is intended by this passage, but to set the opposite characters of factious persons and true patriots in the strongest light, with a view to recommend the one, and create a just hatred and detestation of the other. So elsewhere he represents the justice of self-defence in no less different terms: \"If reason (says he) precludes this to the learned, and necessity to barbarians, custom to nations, and nature itself to brutes, always to ward off all manner of violence, by all possible ways, from their body, from their head, from their life; you cannot judge this to be a criminal and wicked action, without judging at the same time that all persons who fall among robbers and assassins must either perish by their weapons, or your sentence.\"\u2014He is addressing here to the judges in favour of Milo. The warmth and vehemence of the speaker often runs him into this figure, when he is affected with his subject, and thinks no words, no expressions, forcible enough to convey his sentiments; and therefore repeats one after another, as his fancy suggests them. This flow of expression, under the conduct of a good judgment, is often attended with advantage; as it warms the hearers, and impresses their minds, excites their passions, and helps them to see things in a stronger light.\n\nHypotyposes, or imagery, is a description of things painted in such strong and bright colours, as may help the imagination of the hearers to conceive of them rather as present to their view, than described in words. It is peculiarly suited for drawing characters; and often affords the finest ornaments in poetry and history, as well as oratory. Nor is it less moving, but fitted to strike different passions, according to the nature of the subject, and artful management of the speaker. Cicero has thus drawn the picture of Catiline, consisting of an unaccountable mixture of contrary qualities. \"He had (says he) the appearance of the greatest virtues: he made use of many ill men to carry on his designs, and pretended to be in the interest of the best men; he had a very engaging behaviour, and did not want industry and application; he gave into the greatest looseness, but was a good soldier. Nor do I believe there was ever the like monster in the world, made of such jarring and repugnant qualities and inclinations. Who at one time was more acceptable to the best men, and who more intimate with the worst? Who was once a better patriot, and who a greater enemy to this state? Who more devoted to pleasures, who more patient in labours? Who more rapacious, and yet more profuse? He suited himself to the humours of all he converted with: was ferocious with the reverend, and pleasant with the jocose; grave with the aged, and facetious with the young; bold with the daring, and extravagant with the profligate.\" Such a character of a man, when accompanied with power and interest, must render him no less the object of fear than detestation, which was the design of Cicero in this description. And elsewhere, in order to prevail with the senate to direct the execution of those conspirators with Catiline who were then in prison, he paints the most dismal scene of that horrid design in the strongest colours. \"Methinks (says he) I see this city, the light of the world, and citadel of all nations, suddenly falling into one fire; I perceive heaps of miserable citizens buried in their ruined country; the countenance and fury of Cethegus raging in your slaughter, presents itself to my view.\" This figure is very serviceable in amplification, as we have formerly shown in treating upon Elocution, that subject. But no small judgement is required in the management of descriptions. Lesser circumstances should either be wholly omitted, or but slightly touched; and those which are more material drawn in their due proportion. Nature is as much the rule of the orator as of the painter, and what they both propose to imitate. And therefore, let a thought be ever so pleasing, and beautiful in itself, it must not be introduced when foreign to the purpose, or out of its place, any more than a painter should attempt to alter nature when he proposes to copy it. This figure requires likewise a vigorous and lively genius. For the images in description can rise no higher than the conception of the speaker, since the idea must first be formed in his own mind before he can convey it to others; and agreeably to the clearness with which he conceives it himself, he will be able to express it in words.\n\nAporia, or doubt, expresses the debate of the mind with itself upon a perplexing difficulty. A person in such a state is apt to hesitate, or start several things successively, without coming to any fixed resolution. The uneasiness arising from such a disorder of thought is naturally very moving. Of this kind is that of Cicero for Cluentius, when he says, \"I know not which way to turn myself. Shall I deny the scandal thrown upon him of bribing the judges? Can I say the people were not told of it? that it was not talked of in the court mentioned in the senate? Can I remove an opinion so deeply and long rooted in the minds of men? It is not in my power. You, judges, must support his innocence, and rescue him from this calamity.\" Orators sometimes choose to begin their discourse with this figure. A diffidence of mind at first is not unbecoming, but graceful. It carries in it an air of modesty, and tends very much to conciliate the affections of the hearers. Livy gives us a very elegant example of this in a speech of Scipio Africanus to his soldiers, when, calling them together after a scolding, he thus betrays them: \"I never thought I should have been at a loss in what manner to address my army. Not that I have applied myself more to words than things; but because I have been accustomed to the genius of soldiers, having been trained up in the camp almost from my childhood. But I am in doubt what or how to speak to you, not knowing what name to give you. Shall I call you citizens, who have revolted from your country? Soldiers, who have dishonoured the authority of your general, and broke your military oath? Enemies? I perceive the men, the aspect, and habit of citizens; but differ the actions, words, designs, and dispositions of enemies.\"\n\nSometimes a passion has that effect, not so much to render a person doubtful what to say, as to stop him in the midst of a sentence, and prevent his expressing the whole of what he designed; and then it is called Apofopepsis, or concealment. It denotes different passions; as anger, which, by reason of its heat and vehemence, causes persons to break off abruptly in their discourse. So the old man in Terence, when he was jealous that his servant obstructed his designs, uses this imperious but threatening expression, Whom, if I find. And Neptune, when described by Virgil as very angry that the winds should presume to disturb the sea without his permission, after he has called them to him to know the reason of it, threatens them in this abrupt manner:\n\"But Cicero, in writing to Atticus, applies it to express grief, where he says, 'I know nothing of Pompey, and believe he must be taken, if he is not got on shipboard. O incredible swiftness! But of our friend\u2014Though I cannot accuse him without grief, for whom I am in so much concern and trouble.' And in a letter to Caius he uses it to express fear, when he says to him, 'Brutus could scarce support himself at Mutina; if he is safe, we have carried the day. But if\u2014heaven avert the crown! all must have recourse to you.' His meaning is, 'If Brutus should be defeated.'\n\nThe next figure is *eroticis*, or interrogation. But every interrogation or question is not figurative. When we inquire about a thing that is doubtful, in order to be informed, this is no figure, but the natural form of such expressions. As if I ask a person, *Where he is going?* or *what he is doing?* But then it becomes figurative when the same thing may be expressed in a direct manner; but the putting it by way of question gives it a much greater life and spirit. As when Cicero says, 'Catiline, how long will you abuse our patience? do not you perceive your designs are discovered?' He might indeed have said, 'You abuse our patience a long while. You must be sensible your designs are discovered.' But it is easy to perceive how much this latter way of expression falls short of the force and vehemence of the former. And so when Medea says, 'I could save; and do you see if I can destroy?' Had he said, 'I could save, and I can destroy,' the sentence had been flat, and very unfit to express the rage and fury in which the poet there represents her. This figure is suited to express most passions and emotions of the mind, as anger, disdain, fear, desire, and others. It serves also to press and bear down an adversary. Cicero frequently makes this use of it. As in his defence of Plancius: 'I will make you this offer (says he), choose any tribe you please, and show, as you ought, by whom it was bribed; and if you cannot, as I believe you will not undertake it, I will prove how he gained it. Is this a fair contest? Will you engage on this foot? I cannot give you fairer play. Why do you hesitate? Why do you hesitate? I insist upon it, urge you to it, press it, require, and even demand it of you.'\n\nSuch a way of pushing an antagonist shows the speaker has great confidence in his cause; otherwise he would never lay himself so open, if he was not assured the other party had nothing to reply. This figure likewise diversifies a discourse, and gives it a beautiful variety, by altering the form of expression, provided it be neither too frequent, nor continued too long at once. And besides, the warmth and eager manner in which it is expressed, enlivens the hearers, and quickens their attention.\n\n*Ephorhesis*, or *exclamation*, is a vehement extension of the voice, occasioned by a commotion of mind, naturally venting itself by this figure, which is used by Cicero to express a variety of passions. It often denotes resentment or indignation. Thus, after his return from banishment, reflecting on those who had occasioned it, he breaks out into this moving exclamation: 'O mournful day to the senate, and all good men, calamitous to the state, afflictive to me and my family, but glorious in the view of posterity!' His design was to excite an odium against the authors of his exile, when recalled in so honourable a manner. And again, in his Elocution, defence of Caius: 'O the great force of truth; which easily supports itself against the wit, craft, subtlety, and artful designs of men!' He had been just showing the absurdity of the charge against Caius, and now endeavours to expose his accusers to the indignation of the court. At other times it is used to express disdain or contempt. As when speaking of Pompey's house, which was bought by Mark Antony, he says: 'O consummate impudence! dare you go within that house! dare you enter that venerable threshold, and show your audacious countenance to the tutelar deities which reside there.' Nor is it less suited to indicate grief, as when he says of Milo: 'O that happy country, which shall receive this man! ungrateful this, if it banish him! miserable if it lose him!' And sometimes it serves to express admiration: as when, in compliment to Caesar, he says, 'O admirable clemency! worthy of the greatest praise, the highest encomiums, and most lasting monuments!' It has its use also in ridicule and irony. As in his oration for Balbus, where he derides his accuser, by saying, 'O excellent interpreter of the law! master of antiquity! corrector and amender of our constitution! The sacred writers sometimes use it by way of intreaty or wish. As the royal Psalmist: 'O that I had the wings of a dove, that I might fly away, and be at rest!' And at other times in triumph and exultation, as in that of St Paul: 'O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?' It is frequently joined with the preceding figure *interrogation*; as appears in some of the instances here brought from Cicero. And it generally follows the representation of the thing which occasions it. Though sometimes it is made use of to introduce it, and then it serves to prepare the mind by exciting its attention. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Caius, to render the character of Clodia more odious, at whose instigation he was accused, infamizes that he had before poisoned his husband; and to heighten the barbarity of the fact, and make it appear the more shocking, he introduces the account of it with this moving exclamation: 'O heavens, why do you sometimes wink at the greatest crimes of mankind, or delay the punishment of them to futurity?'\n\n*Epiphonema*, or *acclamation*, has a great affinity with the former figure. And it is so called, when the speaker, at the conclusion of his argument, makes some lively and just remark upon what he has been saying, to give it the greater force, and render it the more affecting to his hearers. It is not so vehement and impetuous as exclamation, being usually expressive of the milder and more gentle passions. And the reflection ought not only to contain some plain and obvious truth, but likewise to arise naturally from the discourse which occasioned it, otherwise it loses its end. When Cicero has shown, that recourse is never to be had to force and violence, but in cases of the utmost necessity, he concludes with the following remark: 'Thus to think, is prudence; to act, fortitude; both to think and act, perfect and consummate virtue.' And elsewhere, after he has described a singular instance of cruelty and breach of friendship: 'Hence (says he) we may learn, that no duties are so sacred and solemn which covetousness will not violate.' This figure is frequently expressed in a way of admiration. As when Cicero has observed, that all men are desirous to live to an advanced age, but uneasy under it when...\nThe next figure in order is apostrophe, or address, when the speaker breaks off from the series of his discourse, and addresses himself to some particular person present or absent, living or dead; or to inanimate nature, as endowed with sense and reason. By this means he has an opportunity of saying many things with greater freedom than perhaps would be consistent with decency if immediately directed to the persons themselves. He can admonish, chide, or censure, without giving offence. Nor is there any passion, but may be very advantageously expressed by this figure. When an orator has been speaking of any particular person, on a sudden to turn upon him, and apply the discourse to that person himself, is very moving; it is like attacking an adversary by surprise, when he is off his guard, and where he least expects it. Thus Cicero: \"I define, senators, to be merciful, but not to appear negligent in so great dangers of the state; though at present I cannot but condemn myself of remissness. There is a camp formed in Italy, at the entrance of Etruria, against the state; our enemies increase daily; but we see the commander of the camp, and general of the enemies, within our walls, in the very senate, contriving some intestine ruin to the state. If now, Catiline, I should order you to be seized and put to death, I have reason to fear, that all good men would rather think I had deferred it too long, than charge me with cruelty. But I am prevailed with for a certain reason not to do that yet, which ought to have been done long since.\" This sudden turn of the discourse to Catiline himself, and the address to him in that unexpected manner, must have touched him very sensibly. So, in his defence of Milo, expressing his concern if he should not succeed in it, he says: \"And how shall I answer it to you, my brother Quintus, the partner of my misfortunes, who are now absent?\" And elsewhere addressing to the soldiers of the Martian legion, who had been killed in an engagement with Mark Antony, he thus befeats them: \"O happy death, which, due to nature, was paid to your country! I may esteem you truly born for your country, who likewise received your name from Mars; so that the same deity seems to have produced this city for the world, and you for this city.\" And in his oration for Balbus he thus calls upon dumb nature to witness for Pompey's virtues: \"I invoke you, mute regions; you, most distant countries; you seas, havens, islands, and shores. For what coast, what land, what place is there, in which the marks of his courage, humanity, wisdom, and prudence, are not extant?\" An appeal to heaven, or any part of inanimate nature, has something very sublime and solemn in it, which we often meet with in sacred writ. So the divine prophet: \"Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath spoken.\" And in like manner, the prophet Jeremy: \"Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this.\" See Apostrophe.\n\nProtopopos, or the fiction of a person: by which either an absent person is introduced speaking; or one who is dead, as if he was alive and present; or speech is attributed to some inanimate being. There is no figure, perhaps, which serves more or better purposes to an orator than this. For by this means he is enabled to call in all nature to his assistance, and can affect every thing such parts as he thinks convenient. There is scarce anything fit to be said, but may be introduced this way. When he thinks his own character is not of sufficient weight to affect his audience in the manner he desires, he substitutes a person of greater authority than himself to engage their attention. When he has severe things to say, and which may give offence as coming from himself; he avoids this, by putting them into the mouth of some other person from whom they will be better taken; or makes inanimate nature bring a charge, or express a resentment, to render it the more affecting. And by the same method he sometimes chooses to secure himself from a suspicion of flattery, in carrying a compliment too high. We meet with several very beautiful instances of this figure in Cicero; but an example of each sort may here suffice, beginning with that of an absent person, from his defence of Milo, whom he thus introduces as speaking to the citizens of Rome: \"Should he, holding the bloody sword, cry out, Attend, I pray, hearken, O citizens, I have killed Publius Clodius; by this sword, and by this right hand, I have kept off his rage from your necks, which no laws, no courts of judicature, could restrain; it is by my means, that justice, equity, laws, liberty, shame, and modesty, remain in the city. It is to be feared how the city would bear this action? Is there any one now, who would not approve and command it?\" And in his oration for Balbus, he introduces Marius, who was then dead, to plead in his defence: \"Can Balbus (says he) be condemned, without condemning Marius for a like fact? Let him be present a little to your thoughts, since he cannot be so in person; that you may view him in your minds, though you cannot with your eyes. Let him tell you, he was not unacquainted with leagues, void of examples, or ignorant of war.\" And again, in his first invective against Catiline, he presents his country as thus expolitating with himself, and upbraiding him for suffering such a criminal as Catiline to live. \"Should my country (says he), which is much dearer to me than my life, should all Italy, all the state, thus address me, Mark Tully what do you do? Do you suffer him, whom you have found to be an enemy, who you see is to be at the head of the war, whom you perceive your enemies wait for in their camp as their general, who has been the contriver of this wickedness, the chief of the conspiracy, the exciter of slaves and profligate citizens, to leave the city, which is rather to bring him in, than let him out? Will not you order him to be imprisoned, condemned, and executed? What prevents you? The custom of our ancestors? But private persons have often punished pernicious citizens in this state. The laws relating to the punishment of Roman citizens? But traitors never had the rights of citizens. Do you fear the censure of posterity? Truly you make a very handsome return to the people of Rome, who have advanced you from an obscure condition so early to the highest dignity; if you neglect their safety to avoid envy, or from the apprehension of any danger. And if you fear censure; which is most to be dreaded, that which may arise from justice and fortitude, or from cowardice and treachery? When Italy shall be wasted by a war, cities plundered, and houses burnt, do you think then to escape the severest censure?\" In the management of this figure, care should\nbe taken that what is said be always consistent with the character introduced, in which both the force and beauty of it consist.\n\nIn treating upon figures, we have hitherto considered them separately; but it may not be amiss to observe, that some expressions consist of a complication of them, and may come under the denomination of several figures, as well verbal as those of sentences, differently considered. Thus when Cicero says, \"What, Tiberio, did your drawn sword do in the Pharisaean battle? At whose side was its point directed? what was the intention of your arms?\" As he speaks to Tiberio, it is an apostrophe; as the expressions have much the same import, and are designed to heighten and aggravate the fact, it is exergaphia; and as they are put by question, it is interrogation. So likewise, in his second Philippic, where he says, \"What can I think? that I am contemned? I see nothing in my life, interests, actions, or abilities, as moderate as they are, which Antony can despise. Did he think he could easily lessen me in the senate? But they, who have commended many famous citizens for their good government of the state, never thanked any but me for preserving it. Would he contend with me for eloquence? This would be a favour indeed. For what could be a larger and more copious subject, than for me speak for myself against Antony? His design was really this: he thought he could not convince his associates, that he was truly an enemy to his country, unless he was so first to me.\" There are three figures in this passage; doubt, interrogation, and fulspection. And again, when he introduces Sicily thus addressing Verres in a way of complaint: \"Whatever gold, whatever silver, whatever ornaments in my cities, dwellings, temples, whatever right of any kind I possessed by the favour of the senate and people of Rome; you, Verres, have plundered and taken from me.\" Here is a prolepsis, joined with the verbal figure anaphora, as several members of the sentence begin with the same word. The like instances of complex figures frequently occur, and therefore we need not multiply examples of them here.","sp":387,"ep":420},{"h":"ORATORY","t":"and give it a cheerfulness; which is a thing so common and well known, that we need not stay to give any instances of it.\n\nAntithesis, or opposition, both in the words and sentence, has often the like beautiful effect. There is an agreeable contrast in that passage of Seneca: \"Caesar does not allow himself many things, because he can do all things: his watching defends all others sleep, his labour their quiet, his industry their pleasure, his business their ease; since he has governed the world he has deprived himself of it.\" Had he said no more than only in general, that Caesar does not allow himself many things, because he can do all things, it might have passed for a fine thought; but, by adding so many particulars, all in the same expression, and beginning each member with the same word, he has both enlarged the idea, and beautified the antithesis, by a bright verbal figure.\n\nThese, and such like florid figures, are sometimes found in historians, but oftener in orators; and indeed this middle character, in the whole of it, is best accommodated to the subjects of history and oratory.\n\nCHAP. VII. Of the Sublime Style.\n\nThe sublime is the most noble, as well as the most difficult part of an orator's province. It is this principally which Cicero requires in his perfect orator, whom he could not describe in words, but only conceive of in his mind. And indeed, the noblest genius and greatest art are both requisite to form this character. For where nature has been most liberal in furnishing the mind with lofty thoughts, bright images, and strong expressions; yet without the affluence of art there will sometimes be found a mixture of what is low, improper, or misplaced. And a great genius, like a too rich soil, must produce flowers and weeds promiscuously, without cultivation. But the justest propriety, joined with the greatest strength and highest elevation of thought, are required to complete the true sublime. Art, therefore, is necessary to regulate and perfect the taste of those who are desirous to excel in this character.\n\nIn explaining the nature and properties of this character, we shall, as in the two former, consider first the thoughts, and then the language; in each of which it is distinguished from them.\n\n\u00a7 I. Sublime, as it relates to Thoughts.\n\nLofty and grand sentiments are the basis and foundation of the true sublime. Longinus therefore advises those who aspire at this excellence, to accustom themselves to think upon the noblest subjects. A mind that always dwells upon low and common subjects can never raise itself sufficiently to represent things great and magnificent in their full extent and proper light. But he who inures himself to conceive the highest and most exalted ideas, and renders them familiar to his thoughts, will not often be at a loss how to express them; for where proper words are wanting, by metaphors and images taken from other things, he will be able to convey them in a just and adequate manner. What is more common than for two persons to conceive very differently of the same thing from the different manner of thinking to which they have been accustomed? After the great battle in Cilicia, between Alexander and Darius, in which the latter was routed, he sent ambassadors to Alexander with proposals of peace, offering him half his kingdom with his daughter in marriage. Parmenio, one of Alexander's chief captains, says to him upon this occasion, \"For my part, was I Alexander, I would accept of these conditions.\"\n\n\"And so would I (replies that aspiring monarch), was I Parmenio.\" The half of so vast a kingdom at present, and a right of succession to the whole by marriage, was the highest ambition to which the thoughts of Parmenio could rise. But Alexander had vastly higher views; he aimed at nothing less than universal monarchy; and therefore such a proposal seemed much beneath his regard. Noble and lofty thoughts are principally those which either relate to divine objects, or such things as among men are generally esteemed the greatest and most illustrious.\n\nOf the former sort is that of Homer, when describing the goddess Discord, he says, that she\n\nWalks on the ground, and hides her head in clouds.\n\nThis stretch of thought, says Longinus, as great as the distance between heaven and earth, does not more represent the stature of the goddess, than the measure of the poet's genius and capacity. But such images, however beautiful in poetry, are not so proper for an orator, whose business it is to make choice of those which are suited to the nature of things and the common reason of mankind. When Numa the second king of Rome was settled in his government, and at peace with his neighbours, in order to soften the fierce and martial temper of his subjects, who had been always accustomed to wars during the reign of his predecessor Romulus, he endeavoured to impress their minds with an awe of the Deity; and for that end introduced a number of religious ceremonies, which he pretended to have received from the goddess Egeria. This must be esteemed an artful piece of policy at that time. But that sentiment is far more just and noble, with which Cicero endeavours to inspire the members of a community, in his treatise Of Laws, when he says, that \"Citizens ought first to be persuaded, that all things are under the rule and government of the gods; that every affair is directed by their wisdom and power; that the highest regard is due to them from men, since they observe every one's conduct, how he acts and behaves himself, and with what temper and devotion he worships them; and that they make a difference between the pious and impious.\" Persons under the influence of such a persuasion, could not fail of behaving well in society. And what he says to Caesar is no less in this style, when, interceding for Ligarius, he tells him, that \"men in nothing approach nearer to deity, than in giving life to men.\" And Velleius Paterculus, speaking of Cato, gives him this sublime character, \"That he was more like the gods than men; who never did a good thing, that he might seem to do it.\"\n\nThe other kind of lofty thoughts mentioned above, are those which relate to power, wisdom, courage, benevolence, and such other things as are of the highest esteem among mankind. \"Your fortune (says Tully to Caesar) has nothing greater than a power, nor your nature...\"\nElocution, nature than a will, to have many.\" He subjoins this compliment to what we just now cited from him; and applies that to C\u00e6sar, which was before only expressed in general, leaving him to draw the inference of his similitude to deity from the clemency of his nature.\n\nAnd elsewhere, as in a sort of transport for his success in defeating the conspiracy of Catiline, he thus be-speaks the Roman senate: \"You have always decreed public thanks to others for their good government of the state, but to me alone for its preservation. Let that Scipio shine, by whose conduct and valour Hannibal was forced to leave Italy, and retire to Africa; let the other Scipio be greatly honoured, who destroyed Carthage and Numantia, two cities the most dangerous to this empire; let Lucius Paulus be in high esteem, whose triumphal chariot was adorned with Perseus, once a most powerful and noble prince; let Marius be in eternal honour, who twice delivered Italy from an invasion and the dread of servitude; let Pompey's name excel all these, whose actions and virtues are terminated by no other bounds but the course of the sun;\u2014yet among all their praises, there will still some place be left for my glory; unless indeed it be a greater thing to open for us new provinces to which we may resort, than to secure a place for our victorious generals to return in triumph.\" And Velleius Paterculus, as if he thought no encomium too high for this great orator, laments his unhappy fate in these lofty strains, addressed to M. Antony, by whose order he was put to death: \"You have taken from Cicero old age, and a life more miserable than death under your government; but his fame, and the glory of his actions and words, you have been so far from destroying, that you have increased them. He lives, and will live in the memory of all ages; and while this system of nature, however constituted, shall remain (which scarce any Roman but himself conceived in his mind, comprehended by his genius, and illustrated with his eloquence), the praise of Cicero shall accompany it; and all posterity, while it admires his writings against you, will curse your treatment of him; and sooner shall mankind be lost to the world than his name.\" It was a noble reply of Porus the Indian king, when, after his defeat by Alexander, being brought before him, and asked How he expected to be treated? he answered, Like a king. And Valerius Maximus, speaking of Pompey's treatment of Tigranes king of Armenia after he had vanquished him, expresses it in a manner suited to the dignity and beneficence of the action, when he says, \"He restored him to his former fortune, esteeming it as glorious to make kings as to conquer them.\"\n\nBut the true sublime is conjoined with the greatest plainness and simplicity of expression. And, generally speaking, the more plain and natural the images appear, the more they surprize us. How succinct, and yet how majestic, is that expression of C\u00e6sar upon his victory over Pharnaces? I came, I saw, I conquered. But there cannot be a greater or more beautiful example of this, than what Longinus has taken notice of from Moses. \"The legislator of the Jews (says he), no ordinary person, having a just notion of the power and majesty of the Deity, has expressed it in the beginning of his laws in the following words: And God said\u2014what? Let there be light; and there was light. Let the earth be made; and it was made.\" This image from the divine writer, and the character here given of him by that excellent critic, is the more remarkable, as he was himself a Pagan. And certainly no laboured description could raise in the mind a higher conception of the infinite power of the Deity, than this plain and short narration. To command nature itself into being by a sword, represents it at once altogether boundless and unlimited.\n\nIt sometimes very much contributes to heighten the image of a thing, when it is expressed in so undetermined a manner, as to leave the mind in suspense what bounds to fix to the thought. Of this kind is that of Cicero, when he first raises an objection against the necessity of an acquaintance with polite literature in order to form a great man, and then answers it. The objection is founded upon the examples of several great and excellent persons among the Romans, who had raised themselves to the highest pitch of honour and dignity, and been very serviceable to their country, by the help of a good genius, without the advantage of much learning. In reply to which, he allows, that, where these are not united, nature or genius is of itself much preferable, and will carry a person further in the pursuit of great and noble designs, than learning without a genius; but that both are necessary to complete and perfect a truly great man. But we shall give what he says himself on this head, by which that property of a sublime thought we are now endeavouring to explain, will appear from his manner of expression: \"I acknowledge (says he) that many persons of an exalted mind and virtue have, from a divine temper, without instruction, become moderate and grave; and I add likewise, that nature, without the affluence of learning, has frequently more contributed to honour and virtue, than learning where a genius has been wanting: But yet I must say, that where the direction and improvement of learning is added to a great and excellent genius, it is wont to produce something admirable and singular which I know not how to describe.\" He knew very well, that by leaving the minds of his hearers thus in suspense, they would form to themselves higher conceptions of what he intended, than from any idea he could convey to them in words. We may add to this another example from the same great orator, where he says, \"Truly, if the mind had no views to posterity, and all its thoughts were terminated by those bounds in which the space of life is confined, it would neither fatigue itself with so great labours, nor be disquieted with so many cares and watchings, nor so often expose itself to death. But there is a certain active principle in every good man, which constantly excites his mind by motives of glory; and reminds him, that the remembrance of his name is not to end with his life, but extend itself to all posterity.\" Of the like nature is that of Milton, when he describes Satan as flying from hell in quest of our earth, then newly formed. For having represented that his wings failed him in the vast vacancy, he thus describes his fall:\n\nDown he drops\nTen thousand fathom deep; and to this hour\nDown had been falling, had not by ill chance\nThe strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,\nInfected with fire and nitre, hurried him\nAs many miles aloft.\n\nThose\nElocution. Those words, by which his fall is expressed,\n\nAnd to this hour,\n\nDown had been falling,\n\nleave the mind in suspense, and unable to fix any bounds to the vacuity; and by that means raise a greater and more surprising idea of its space than any direct expression could have done. This image is very beautiful where it stands; but so much out of the common way of thinking, as to suit better with an epic poem than the discourse of an orator.\n\n\u00a7 2. The Sublime, with regard to Language.\n\nWhat we have to offer upon this subject will come under the three heads of Elegance, Composition, and Dignity; which comprehend all the properties of style.\n\nI. Elegance. Those words and expressions chiefly contribute to form the sublime, which are most sonorous, and have the greatest splendor, force, and dignity. And they are principally such as these. Long words, when equally expressive, are rather to be chosen than short ones, and especially monosyllables. So to conquer or vanquish an enemy, carries in it a fuller and grander sound, than to beat an enemy. For which reason, likewise, compound words are often preferable to simple ones. So if we say, C\u00e6sar's army, when he was present, was always invincible; this manner of expression has more of sublimity in it, than should we say, C\u00e6sar's army, when he was present, could never be conquered. But the ancient languages have much the advantage of ours in both these respects; for their words are generally longer, and they are abundantly more happy in their compositions. The use of proper epithets does also in a particular manner contribute to this character. For as they denote the qualities and modes of things, they are as it were short descriptions; so that being joined to their subjects, they often greatly enlarge and heighten their image. Thus when the character of divine poet is given to Homer or Virgil, or prince of orators to Demosthenes or Cicero, it conveys to the mind a more sublime idea of them, than the bare mention of their name.\n\nII. Composition: The force of which, as Longinus observes, is so great, that sometimes it creates a kind of sublime where the thoughts themselves are but mean, and gives a certain appearance of grandeur to that which otherwise would seem but common. But composition consists of several parts; the first of which, in the order we have hitherto considered them, is period. And here the case is much the same as with animal bodies, which owe their chief excellency to the union and just proportion of their parts. The several members, when separated from each other, lose both that beauty and force, which they have when joined together in a complete body. In like manner, sublimity arises from the several parts of a period so connected, as to give force, as well as beauty, to the whole. The periods therefore in this character should be of a proper length. If they are too short, they lose their just weight and grandeur, and are gone almost before they reach the ear; as, on the contrary, when they are too prolix, they become heavy and unwieldy, and by that means lose their force. But more especially, nothing superfluous ought to be admitted, which very much enervates the force of a sentence. We shall exemplify this in a passage from Herodotus, where he is giving an account of the famous battle at Thermopylae between the Persians and Lacedemonians. \"Dienceas (says he) the Spartan, being told by a Trachinian, before the engagement with the Medes, that when the barbarians came to shoot their arrows, they would fly so thick as to obscure the light of the sun; he was so far from being terrified at this, that despising their number, he replied, he was pleased with what his friend told him, since if the sun was obscured, they should fight in the shade, and not in the sun.\" The sense here is great and noble, but the sublimity of expression is spoiled in a great measure by those last words, and not in the sun, which are wholly superfluous. Cicero was sensible of this, and therefore he omits that member in relating the same story, and says only: \"A Spartan, hearing that one of the Persians should say in an insulting manner, that when they came to engage, they should not be able to see the sun, for the multitude of their darts and arrows, replies, Then we shall fight in the shade.\" By stopping here he gives the sentence much more life and emphasis. The next thing to be considered in composition, is the order and disposition of the several words and members of a sentence. The different placing but of one or two words will sometimes wholly destroy the grandeur of a sentence, and make it extremely flat. \"This public act (says Demosthenes) dispelled the danger which at that time, like a cloud, hung over the city.\" Let us vary the order a little, and read it thus: \"This public act dispelled the danger, which like a cloud hung over the city at that time.\" What a different turn does the expression receive for the worse! The spirit and majesty of it are entirely lost. And in placing the several parts or members, they ought to be so disposed, that what is most weighty and important should stand last. So Tully says of Catiline, \"We ought to return thanks to heaven, that we have so often escaped so odious, so frightful, so dangerous a plague of the state.\" A thing may be odious and frightful, and yet not dangerous; therefore he puts this in the last place, to give it the greater force, and make the deeper impression. Another thing to be attended to in composition, is the connection of the words with regard to the sound; that the pronunciation, in passing from one to another, may be most agreeable to the ear, and best suited to the nature of the subject. And as this is generally something grand and magnificent, such a contiguity of them as will give the greatest force and energy to the expression is most proper for the sublime. Soft and languid sounds are very unfitting to this character. They soothe and please the ear; but rather sink and depress the mind, than excite it to things great and noble. In this respect, therefore, our tongue, by its multitude of consonants, is more suitable for sublime discourses than some other modern languages, which abound with vowels.\n\nIII. The last head to be considered, is the proper use of tropes and figures, which is here so necessary, that the title of dignity seems to have been given to this part of elocution, from the affluence it more especially affords to this character. For if, as has been observed from Longinus, compositions will sometimes create\nElocution, a sort of sublimity; this much oftener happens from the force and efficacy of some lively tropes and strong figures.\n\nAnd as to tropes, bright metaphors are peculiarly suited to raise and animate the style. This is manifest from the nature of them, as they consist of contracted families, reduced to a single word; which, if taken from things lofty and grand, must of consequence give a sublimity to the style. What can suggest to us a greater idea of the valour of Ajax, than Homer's calling him the bulwark of the Greeks; or of the Scipios, when they are styled by Virgil, the two thunderbolts of war. A number of those, well chosen, contributes no less to the grandeur than to the beauty of discourse. Hyperbole sometimes gives the same force to an expression, it cautiously used; and so as not to exceed all appearance of truth. But the chief use of it is, where proper words will not express the just idea of the thing designed to be conveyed; and it may seem rather the offspring of necessity than choice. Of this nature is that of Herodotus, when speaking of the Lacedemonians at Thermopylae, he says, \"They defended themselves with the swords they had left, and even with their hands and teeth, till the barbarians buried them under their arrows.\" It cannot be supposed strictly true, that so many arrows were thrown at them as to bury them; but having in the former part of the sentence represented their resolute defence in the strongest terms, by saying, that naked and without arms, they engaged armed men with their hands and teeth, the following hyperbole seems not unnatural, and to intimate nothing more than what was necessary to quell such obstinate resolution and courage.\n\nAs to figures, whether verbal or those which consist in the sense, the nature of this character will easily direct to such as are most proper. But with respect to the latter, poets take greater liberties in the use of them than would be allowed in an orator. As their images are often formed for pleasure and delight, so they carry in them more of rapture and transport. But the orator's use of them being to see things in a stronger and clearer light, they are more sedate and moderate. Besides, an orator scarce ever has occasion for such fictitious images as we often meet with in poetry; though his ought to appear as natural, and its painting as strong and lively. We shall just mention some of the chief of those figures which seem best suited for this purpose; though they are no less suited to the middle style, as has been shown already, when taken from subjects of an inferior nature.\n\n1. Description. Of this Justin gives us a fine instance, in a speech of King Philip of Macedon, wherein he represents the necessity of falling upon the Romans, who at that time were engaged in a war with Hannibal. \"I behold (says he) a cloud of a most dreadful and bloody war rising in Italy. I see a storm of thunder and lightning from the west, which will overspread all places with a vast shower of blood, into whatever country the tempest of victory shall drive it. Greece has undergone many violent shocks in the Persian, Gallic, and Macedonian wars; but these would all be found unworthy of regard, if the armies now engaged in Italy should march out of that country. I view the terrible and cruel wars which involve those nations through the courage of their forces, and skill of their generals. This rage and fury cannot cease by the destruction of one party, without the ruin of their neighbours. Indeed, Macedon has less reason to dread the savage conquerors than Greece; because more prepared, and better able to defend itself; but I am sensible, those who attack each other so imprudently will not confine their victories within those bounds, and that it will be our lot to engage the conquerors.\" So lively a picture of imminent and threatening danger must needs alarm the most timorous, and excite them to a resolution to defend their country, and all that was dear to them. Such images give life and vigour to a discourse, and being artfully interwoven with proper arguments, influence the mind, and carry it away by an irresistible force, so that the hearer is not barely left to conclude the certainty of the thing, but moved by it, as it were, from ocular demonstration. The images therefore of the orator ought to be drawn from real things, or at least such as are probable; for if they are wholly fictitious and incredible, as many poetical images are, they may give pleasure, but will not convince the mind, nor sway the passions.\n\n2. Enumeration has some affinity with the former figure; by which, if the several parts have each something grand in them, the whole, when brought together, and disposed in a just order, very much contributes to the sublimity. We shall produce an example of this from an English writer, containing a description of our globe, upon a survey of it after the general conflagration, which he represents in this strong light: \"Such is the vanity and transient glory of this habitable world! By the force of one element breaking loose upon the rest, all the varieties of nature, all the works of art, all the labours of man, are reduced to nothing; and that we admired and loved before, as great and magnificent, is obliterated and vanished, and another form and face of things, plain, simple, and everywhere the same, overspreads the whole earth. Where are now the great empires of the world, and their great imperial cities? their pillars, trophies, and monuments of glory? Show me where they stood, read the inscription, tell me the victor's name. What remains, what imprestions, what difference or distinction, do you see in this mass of fire? Rome itself, eternal Rome, the great city, the empress of the world, whose domination or superstition, ancient or modern, make a great part of the history of the earth, what is become of her now? She laid her foundations deep, and her palaces were strong and sumptuous; she glorified herself, and lived deliciously, and said in her heart I sit a queen, and shall see no sorrow: but her hour is come, she is wiped away from the face of the earth, and buried in everlasting oblivion. But it is not cities only, and the works of men's hands; the everlasting hills, the mountains and rocks of the earth, are melted as wax before the sun, and their place is nowhere found. Here stood the Alps, the load of the earth, that covered many countries, and reached their arms from the ocean to the Black sea. This huge mass of stone is softened and dissolved, as a tender cloud into rain. Here stood the African mountains, and Atlas with his top above the clouds. There was frozen Caucasus, and Taurus, and Imaus, and the mountains of Asia; and yonder, towards the north, stood the Riphean hills, clothed in ice and snow; all these are vanished, dropped away as the snow upon their\nThese particulars considered separately are all truly great and noble, and every way suited to the nature of the subject; but as they are here disposed, and rise in order, they both enlarge the idea, and heighten the image, of that grand catastrophe.\n\n3. Similitude: which serves very much for beauty and ornament; and, when taken from great and sublime objects, adds a grandeur and magnificence to the things illustrated by it. We need go no farther for an example of this, than to the great critic so often mentioned already, who has treated upon the sublime in a style every way equal to the subject. He, then, comparing those two great works of Homer, his Iliad and Odyssey, thus describes them: \"Homer composed his Iliad when his mind was in its full strength and vigour; the whole body of the poem is dramatic, and full of action: whereas the best part of the Odyssey is taken up in narrations, which seem to be the genius of old age. So that one may compare him in this latter work to the setting sun, which still appears with the same magnificence, but has no longer the same heat and force.\" And soon after, speaking of the Odyssey, he says, \"That piece may be called the reflux of its genius, which like the ocean ebbs, and defers its shores.\" What nobler idea could possibly have been given of that great poet, than by those two similitudes of the sun and the ocean? And elsewhere, comparing those two great orators Demosthenes and Cicero, he shows the like sublimity of thought. \"Demosthenes (says he) is sublime, in that he is close and concise; Cicero, in that he is diffuse and extensive. The former, by reason of the violence, rapidity, strength, and fury, with which he rages and bears all before him, may be compared to a tempest, and thunder; but the latter, like a great conflagration, devours and consumes all he meets, with a fire that is never extinguished, but wherever it advances continually gathers new strength.\"\n\n4. Antithesis, or a sentence consisting of opposite parts, has often the same effect; as in the following instance of Cicero, where his view is to represent Pompey as a most consummate general. \"Who (says he) ever was, or need be more knowing than this man? who from his childhood, and instruction at school, went into the army of his father, and learned the military art, in a very great war against the fiercest enemies: who, while yet a boy, became a soldier under the greatest general; and when but a youth was himself commander of a very great army: who has oftener engaged with the enemy in battle, than any other person with his adversary in private contests: has waged more wars than others have read, and conquered more provinces than others have wished to govern: whose youth has been spent in acquiring the art of war, not by the precepts of others, but his own commands; not by defeats, but victories; not by campaigns but triumphs.\"\n\n5. Apophthegm. Among the articles charged against Demosthenes by his great adversary and rival Alcibiades, one was, that he had advised the Athenians to engage in a war against King Philip, wherein they had received a very great defeat. When Demosthenes comes to answer that part of the charge, he does not say, as he might, \"You have not been misled, my fellow-citizens, in exposing your lives for the liberties and safety of Greece; you are not without the most illustrious examples of such conduct: for who can say these great men were misled, who fought for the same cause in the plains of Marathon?\" But instead of expressing himself thus, he gives the matter quite a different turn; and in a sort of rapture, appealing to those brave defenders of their country, says, \"No, my fellow-citizens, you have not done wrong, you have not; I protest by the ghosts of those great men who fought for the same cause in the plains of Marathon.\" By this appeal to those ancient worthies whose memories were in the highest esteem at Athens, that it was the cause, and not the success, which rendered their actions so glorious, he artfully corroborates his assertion in a way which he knew must have the greatest weight with his audience.\n\nAs the proper subjects of this character are either divine things, or such as are in the highest esteem and regard among mankind, which often require laudatory discourses, or panegyric; these naturally admit of all the ornaments and affluence of eloquence. Which, however, must be used with discretion; for when the mind is wrapt up in thought, and stretched to the utmost of its powers in the pursuit of some noble and sublime idea, it cannot attend to all the lesser fineries and niceties of language; but from its own vigour, and lively conception of things, will be led to express them in terms the most emphatical, and best suited to their nature. In such cases, therefore, the sublimity must appear rather from the elevation of the thought, attended with a simplicity of expression, than from the ornaments and dress of the language. These things seem more natural when the mind is relaxed, and employed upon lower objects. Though, upon the whole, grandeur and majesty of expression is the proper mark of this character with relation to the language, as beauty and splendor is of the middle style.\n\nCHAP. VIII. Of the Style of an Orator.\n\nThe style of an orator comprehends all the characters already explained, of low, middle, and sublime, and as they are applied by him in the different parts of his province. For that the language must be suited to the nature of the subject, we have had occasion often to observe already; and the different view of the speaker or writer necessarily occasions a variety in the manner of expression. Now an orator has three things in his view; to prove what he affirms, to represent it in an agreeable light, and to move the passions. These are all necessary, we do not mean in the order wherein we have now mentioned them, but that the discourse may upon the whole have its desired effect upon the audience. For unless the mind be convinced of the truth of what is offered by solid and cogent arguments, neither will the most eloquent discourse afford a lasting pleasure, nor the most pathetic long influence the affections. Though, on the other hand, the hearers expect to be entertained at the same time they are informed; and, therefore, unless the language be agreeable to their taste, they will soon call off their attention, and think but meanly of the speaker. And unless both these are warmed and animated by a becoming pathos, the speaker may very probably miss of his end in bringing his audience over.\nover to his sentiments. For bare conviction is not sufficient with many persons to excite them to action. They will acquiesce in the truth of a thing which they cannot contradict, or will not give themselves the trouble to examine; and at the same time remain unconcerned to prosecute it. And the pleasure of a florid discourse will of itself soon vanish, like the harmony of music, or the charms of a fine poem. And therefore to captivate his audience, secure them in his interest, and push them upon action, it is necessary for the orator to engage their affections; these are, as it were, the springs of the soul, which, managed by a skilful hand, move and direct it at pleasure. Now each of these parts of an orator's province requires a different style. The low style is most proper for proof and information; because he has no other view here but to represent things to the mind in the plainest light, as they really are in themselves, without colouring or ornament. The middle style is most suited for pleasure and entertainment, because it consists of smooth and well-turned periods, harmonious numbers, with florid and bright figures. But the sublime is necessary in order to sway and influence the passions. Here the orator calls in all the assistance both of nature and art; the most raised and lofty thoughts, clothed with the brightest and strongest colouring, enter into this character.\n\nBut as an orator has frequently each of these views in the same discourse, we shall first give a summary description of the several characters of style, which we have formerly discussed on more at large; that, by placing them together in one view, the difference between them may be more plain and obvious: and then we shall proceed to show what particular parts of a discourse each of them is more especially to be applied.\n\nI. First, then, as shorter periods are proper in the low style, so less care is necessary in their turn and cadency. If a sentence now and then drop unexpectedly and disappoint the ear, or has something rough and harsh in its composition, it is no blemish in this character. For as it is suited to the manner of common discourse, an appearance of regard to the subject, rather than the form of expression, is more becoming than any beauties of art. But the words should be well chosen and proper, suited to the ideas they are designed to convey; the expressions plain and clear, and the artificial ornaments few and modest. By artificial ornaments, are here meant tropes and figures; and they are called artificial, because they vary from the natural drefs of language, either in the words or manner of expression: though they are often used by those who are wholly unacquainted with the rules of art; and particularly metaphors, which persons who have the least command of language frequently run into through mere necessity, for want of a sufficient stock of proper words to convey their ideas. The low style therefore admits of these: but care should be taken to choose such as have been rendered familiar by use, or at least where the similitude is very plain and evident. Bold or lofty metaphors, or where the allusion is dark and remote, ought to be avoided. Nor is the moderate use of the other tropes wholly disagreeable to this style. And the same thing is to be said with respect to verbal figures, or such as consist in the particular disposition of the sentence, so that if the form of it be changed, the figure is lost. Of these, such as come nearest to the natural way of expression are most proper for this style; and therefore those which consist in a jingle of words, arising from the same or a like sound, are to be avoided, as carrying in them too much the appearance of art. Those likewise which consist in a repetition of the same word have often too great a force and vehemence for this mild and gentle character. And as to figures of sentences, which do not depend on the construction of words, but lie in the sense, many of them are too gay and sprightly, and others too rapid and impetuous, for the simplicity of the low style; so that only the more moderate and sedate ones are to be allowed a place here. It is therefore no wonder if persons are often mistaken in their notions of this character: the beauty of which consisting in a certain plainness and simplicity, without anything in it but what seems natural and common, every one is apt to imagine he can readily be master of it, till by experience he finds the contrary. For the case is much the same here, as in persons of fashion and good breeding, whose behaviour and address is attended with that agreeable freedom and seeming negligence, which in appearance is very easy to express, but in reality is scarce imitable by others.\n\nAs the middle style is more adapted for pleasure and delight, it admits of all those beauties and ornaments which soothe and entertain the mind. It has more force and energy than the low style, but less than the sublime. Smooth and harmonious numbers, well turned periods, of a just length, delightful cadency, and accurate disposition of the words, are suited to this style. The most beautiful and shining tropes, which strike the fancy, and all those verbal figures which, by a repetition, similitude, or proportion of sounds, please and gratify the ear, help to form this character. The like is to be said as to figures of sentences: The most florid and beautiful, such as enumeration, description, similitude, and the like, are here the most proper.\n\nBut it is the sublime style which perfects the orator. This requires the most forcible and emphatical words, the boldest metaphors and strongest figures. In verbal figures, repetitions, synonyms, gradations, contraries, with others of a like force and energy, are chiefly employed here. But figures of sentences are the most considerable, and principally contribute to make up this character. Among these are similes taken from lofty subjects, prolepsis, apophysis, epiphanema, apophasis, and others of a like nature. But due care must likewise be taken of the form, construction, and harmony of the periods; which seem best disposed, when long and short ones are intermixed. For though round and swelling periods carry in them something grand and majestic, yet many times they move too slow to strike the passions; whereas short ones are more acute and pungent, and by returning quick, awaken the mind, and raise the passions. But to render it complete, it must be supported with strong reason, grandeur of thought, and sentiments every way equal to the expression; without which it will be very liable to swell into bombast, and end barely in amusement.\n\nII. Having given a short sketch of this part of the orator's furniture, we shall now go on to show where, and in what manner, he is to make use of it. This will\nElocution will best appear by considering his principal view in each part of his discourse. Now the parts of a justification (as we have formerly shown) are fix; Introduction, Narration, Proposition, Confirmation, Confutation, and Conclusion. Not that all these are necessary in every discourse, but it is proper they should all be mentioned, that we may consider what style is fittest for them when they are necessary.\n\nIn the Introduction, the orator has three things before him; to gain the esteem of his hearers, to secure their attention, and to give them some general notion of his subject. To let out modestly is undoubtedly the most likely way to recommend himself. For to attempt to inflame an audience, before they are prepared for it, or see the reason of much warmth, is highly improper. A prudent speaker will, like Demosthenes, begin with temper, and rise gradually, till he has insensibly warmed his hearers, and in some degree engaged their affections in his favour. So that this part scarcely rises above the middle style. And if it carry in it an air of pleasantry and good-humour, it is generally the more apt to engage the attention.\n\nThe introduction is usually followed by the narration, or a recital of such things as either preceded, accompanied, or followed upon the subject under consideration. Now, as the qualities that recommend a narration are clearness, brevity, and probability; these sufficiently point out the style. Perspicuity arises from the choice of proper words, and such tropes as have been rendered most familiar by use; brevity requires moderate periods, whose parts are but little transposed; and a plain and simple diction, without ornament or colouring, is best suited to represent things probable: all which are the properties of the low style. And therefore Cicero says, narrations come pretty near to our ordinary discourses. Indeed, sometimes it is necessary not only to relate the facts themselves, but likewise to describe the manner in which they were performed. And then a further degree of art may be requisite to represent them with all their circumstances, and paint them to the mind in their proper colours.\n\nThe next part in order is the proposition, or subject of the discourse, in which there can be no room for ornament. But as it is the basis and foundation of the orator's whole design, it ought to be laid down in the plainest and clearest terms, so as to leave no room for doubt or uncertainty what it is which he intends to discourse upon.\n\nThe next thing is confirmation, wherein the orator endeavours to maintain and defend his own cause, and to convince his hearers of the truth of it by reason and argument. Now the low style is certainly fittest for cool reasoning and debate. But the orator's method of reasoning often very much differs from that of the philosopher. The latter contents himself with the most plain and familiar manner of representing the truth, and thinks it sufficient if what he says be clearly understood. But the former, at the same time that he convinces the judgement, endeavours likewise to affect the passions, and that in a great variety of ways. So that in this part of the discourse the style is very different, according to the nature and circumstances of the case. Sometimes, while he is dwelling upon the proof of a thing, he talks cooly, and reasons with the fatigues of a philosopher; and where any part of his argument appears doubtful or obscure, he endeavours with the same even temper to explain and clear it up. But frequently he intermixes with his proofs all the arts of persuasion, and embellishes his reasons with the greatest ornaments and beauties of eloquence.\n\nConfirmation is usually followed by confutation, in which the orator endeavours to enervate and overthrow all that has been advanced in favour of the opposite side of the question. But as the style is much the same here as in the former part, what has been said upon that may be sufficient for this likewise.\n\nThe last part abovementioned is the conclusion. This consists of two branches, recapitulation, and address. Recapitulation is a short recital of the several arguments, at the least the chief of them, which were before advanced in support of the cause; that, being brought together into a narrow compass, they may appear in a stronger light. Wherefore the language here ought rather to be forcible and strong than florid, because brevity and conciseness is a necessary quality. The other branch of the conclusion consists in an address to the passions, and is wholly persuasive; for which the speaker is now entirely at leisure. Indeed, this is often done occasionally in other parts of the discourse, particularly in the introduction and confirmation: But, as in the former of these, his view is principally to secure the good opinion of the hearers, and excite their attention; and in the latter to defend his own side of the question by reason and argument; when these two points are gained, he has nothing left but to prevail with them to fall in with his design, and declare for him. And the best way to attain this is, by engaging their passions in his interest. Hence, then, to use Quintilian's words, \"All the springs of eloquence are to be opened. Now we are past the rocks and shallows, all the falls may be hoisted. And as the greatest part of the conclusion consists in illustration, the most pompous language and strongest figures have place here.\"\n\nAll the variety above mentioned, however, is not always necessary. Regard must be had to the nature of the subject, the time, place, persons, and other circumstances; by all which the style is to be regulated. To discourse in a lofty and grand way upon a common topic, or in a low and flat manner upon a sublime argument, are both equally injudicious. Cicero refers us to some discourses of his own, as instances of each kind. His oration for C\u00e6cina, he says, is written in the low style, that for the Manilian law in the middle style, and that for Rabirius in the sublime; and his Actions against Verres, with some others, are patterns of the variety here mentioned. And he gives us a very comprehensive description of a perfect orator in very few words, when he says, \"He is one who can speak upon a low subject acutely, upon a lofty subject with sublimity, and upon a moderate subject temperately.\" By which he means no more, than one who is master of the three characters here described, and knows when and how to use them. But although he mentions several among the Greeks, and some few among the Romans, who excelled in one or other of these different kinds; yet one who excelled in them all, he supposes never to have existed, except in the imagination. The reason, perhaps...\nperhaps may be, because each of them seems to require a very different genius, so that it is scarce possible for the same person to succeed in them all. Since therefore it is so rare and difficult a matter to gain the command of each in any good degree, it is better perhaps for every one to pursue that which nature seems most inclined to, and to excel in it, than to strive against their genius. For every kind has its perfections; and it is more commendable to be master of one thing, than to do several but indifferently.\n\n**Part IV. Of Pronunciation.**\n\n**Chap. I. Of Pronunciation in general.**\n\nPRONUNCIATION is also called *Actio* by some of the ancients. Though, if we attend to the proper signification of each of these words, the former respects the voice, and the latter the gestures and motions of the body. But if we consider them as synonymous terms, in this large sense pronunciation or action may be said to be a suitable conformity of the voice, and the several motions of the body, in speaking, to the subject matter of the discourse.\n\nThe best judges among the ancients have represented this as the principal part of an orator's province, from whence he is chiefly to expect success in the art of persuasion. When Cicero, in the person of Cato, has largely and elegantly discoursed upon all the other parts of oratory, coming at last to speak of this, he says: \"All the former have their effect as they are pronounced. It is the action alone that governs in speaking; without which the best orator is of no value, and is often defeated by one in other respects much his inferior.\" And he lets us know, that Demosthenes was of the same opinion, who, when he was asked what was the principal thing in oratory, replied, action; and being asked again a second and a third time, what was next considerable, he still made the same answer. By which he seemed to intimate, that he thought the whole art did in a manner consist in it. And indeed, if he had not judged this highly necessary for an orator, he would scarce have taken so much pains in correcting those natural defects, under which he laboured at first, in order to acquire it. For he had both a weak voice, and likewise an impediment in his speech, so that he could not pronounce distinctly some particular letters. The former of which defects he conquered, partly by speaking as loud as he could upon the shore, when the sea roared and was boisterous; and partly by pronouncing long periods as he walked up hill; both of which methods contributed to the strengthening of his voice. And he found means to render his pronunciation more clear and articulate, by the help of some little stones put under his tongue. Nor was he less careful in endeavouring to gain the habit of a becoming and decent gesture; for which purpose he used to pronounce his discourses alone before a large glass. And because he had got an ill custom of raising up his shoulders when he spoke; to amend that, he used to place them under a sword, which hung over him with the point downward. Such pains did this prince of the Grecian orators take to remove those difficulties, which would have been sufficient to discourage an inferior and less aspiring genius. And to how great a perfection he arrived in his action, under all these disadvantages, by his indefatigable diligence and application, is evident from the confession of his great adversary and rival in oratory, Aeschines. Who, when he could not bear the disgrace of being worsted by Demosthenes in the cause of Ctesiphon, retired to Rhodes. And being desired by the inhabitants to recite to them his own oration upon that occasion, which accordingly he did; the next day they requested of him to let them hear that of Demosthenes; which having pronounced in a most graceful manner, to the admiration of all who were present, \"How much more (says he) would you have wondered if you had heard him speak it himself?\" By which he plainly gave Demosthenes the preference in that respect. We might add to these authorities the judgement of Quintilian, who says, that \"it is not of so much moment what our compositions are, as how they are pronounced; since it is the manner of the delivery by which the audience is moved.\" And therefore he ventures to assert, that \"an indifferent discourse, assisted by a lively and graceful action, will have greater efficacy than the finest harangue which wants that advantage.\"\n\nThe truth of this sentiment of the ancients concerning the power and efficacy of pronunciation, might be proved from many instances; but one or two may here suffice. Hortensius, a contemporary with Cicero, and while living next to him in reputation as an orator, was highly applauded for his action. But his orations after his death, as Quintilian tells us (for we have none of them now remaining), did not appear answerable to his character; from whence he justly concludes, there must have been something pleasing when he spoke by which he gained his character, which was lost in reading them. But perhaps there is scarce a more considerable instance of this than in Cicero himself. After the death of Pompey, when Caesar got the government into his own hands, many of his acquaintance interceded with him in behalf of their relations and friends, who had been of the contrary party in the late wars. Among others, Cicero solicited for his friend Ligarius; which Tubero understanding, who owed Ligarius a grudge, he opposed it, and undertook to represent him to Caesar as unworthy of his mercy. Caesar himself was prejudiced against Ligarius; and therefore, when the cause was to come before him, he said, \"We may venture to hear Cicero display his eloquence; for I know the person he pleads for to be an ill man, and my enemy.\" But, however, in the course of his oration, Cicero so worked upon his passions, that by the frequent alteration of his countenance, the emotions of his mind were very conspicuous. And when he came to touch upon the battle of Pharsalia, which had given Caesar the empire of the world, he represented it in that moving and lively manner, that Caesar could no longer contain himself, but was thrown into such a fit of shivering, that he dropped the papers which\nPart IV.","sp":429,"ep":437},{"h":"ORATORY","t":"Pronunciation which he held in his hand. This was the more remarkable, because Caesar was himself one of the greatest orators of that age, knew all the arts of address, and avenues to the passions, and consequently was better prepared to guard against them. But neither his skill, nor resolution of mind, was of sufficient force against the power of oratory; but the conqueror of the world became a conquest to the charms of Cicero's eloquence; so that, contrary to his intention, he gave into his plea, and pardoned Ligarius. Now that oration is still extant, and appears exceedingly well calculated to touch the soft and tender passions and springs of the soul; but we believe it can scarce be discernible to any in reading it, how it should have had so surprising an effect; which must therefore have been chiefly owing to the wonderful address and conduct of the speaker.\n\nThe more natural the pronunciation is, it will of consequence be the more moving; since the perfection of art consists in its nearest resemblance to nature. And therefore it is not without good reason, that the ancients make it one qualification of an orator, that he be a good man; because a person of this character will make the cause he espouses his own, and the more sensibly he is touched with it himself, his action will be the more natural, and by that means the more easily affect others in the same manner. Cicero, speaking upon this subject, says, \"It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in every thing excels imitation; but if that was sufficient of itself in action, we should have no occasion for art.\" In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge), art, in this case as well as in many others, if well managed, will assist and improve nature. But that is not all; for sometimes we find the force of it so great and powerful, that where it is only counterfeit, it will for the time work the same effect as if it was founded in truth. This is well known to those who have been conversant with the representations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are sensible that everything we see and hear is feigned and counterfeit, yet such is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the same manner as if they were all realities. Anger and resentment at the appearance of cruelty, concern and solicitude for disfranchised virtue, rise in our breasts; and tears are extorted from us for oppressed innocence, though at the same time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at ourselves for being thus decoyed. If art then has so great an influence upon us, when supported only by fancy and imagination, how powerful must be the effect of a just and lively representation of what we know to be true and real?\n\nHow agreeable it is both to nature and reason, that a warmth of expression and vehemency of motion should rise in proportion to the importance of the subject and concern of the speaker, will further appear, by looking back a little into the more early and simple ages of the world. For the higher we go, the more we shall find of both. We shall give the observation of a very great man upon this head, in his own words. \"The Romans (says he) had a very great talent this way, and the Greeks a greater. The eastern nations excelled in it, and particularly the Hebrews. Nothing can equal the strength and vivacity of the figures they employed in their discourse; and the very actions they used to express their sentiments, such as putting ashes on their heads, and tearing their garments, and covering themselves with sackcloth under any deep distress and sorrow of mind. I do not speak of what the prophets did to give a more lively representation of the things they foretold, because such figurative actions were the effect of divine inspiration. But even in other cases we find those people understood much better than we do how to express their grief, and fear, and other passions. And hence, no doubt, arose those surprising effects of eloquence, which we never experience now.\" Thus far this excellent writer. And what he says here with respect to the actions of the eastern nations, was in a good measure customary among the Greeks and Romans; if not entirely of the same kind, yet perhaps as vehement and expressive. They did not think language of itself sufficient to express the height of their passions, unless enforced by uncommon motions and gestures. Thus, when Achilles had driven the Trojans into their city with the greatest precipitation and terror, and only Hector ventured to tarry without the gates to engage him; Homer represents both King Priam and his queen under the highest consternation for the danger of their son. And therefore, in order to prevail with him to come into the city, and not fight with Achilles, they not only intreat him from the walls in the most tender and moving language imaginable; but he tears off his grey locks with his hands; and she, in a flood of tears, exposes her breasts, and adjures him by those parts which shocked him, to comply with their request. The poet knew very well, that no words of themselves could represent those agonies of mind he endeavoured to convey, unless heightened by the idea of such actions as were expressive of the deepest sorrow. And indeed this was anciently esteemed so requisite in an orator, that in matters of importance he was scarce thought to be in earnest who wanted it. In one of Cicero's orations, he does not stick to argue in that manner with his adversary. \"Would you talk thus (says he) if you was serious? Would you, who are wont to display your eloquence so warmly in the danger of others, act so coldly in your own? Where is that concern, that ardour, which used to extort pity even from children? Here is no emotion either of mind or body: neither the forehead struck, nor the thigh, nor so much as a lump of the foot. Therefore, you have been so far from inflaming our minds, that you have scarce kept us awake.\"\n\nAs action therefore was judged so necessary a qualification in an orator among the ancients, so they made use of several methods and expedients for the better attaining it. The principal of which we shall briefly mention.\n\nDecency of pronunciation is an habit. And as all habits are gained by time, so the sooner they are learned, they are generally acquired with greater ease. For while persons are young, they are not only more flexible, and capable of any particular bent, but they are likewise free from the trouble of encountering and subduing contrary habits, which doubles the labour, and increases the difficulty of attaining any laudable quality. Quintilian was very sensible of this in the case here before us; and therefore, in order to have persons trained up to it, he begins with them in their childhood, and descends so low as even to give directions how they should be taught to pronounce when they first learn to read. And he advises, that they should then be instructed where to suspend their voice, and make the proper pauses.\nOratory\n\nPart IV.\n\nPronunciation, both in distinguishing the several parts of the same sentence, and in separating one sentence from another; likewise when to raise or sink their voice, or give it a proper inflection; to be slower or faster, more vehement or sedate, as the nature of the things may require; and that the tone of their voice be always manly and grave, but at the same time mixed with an agreeable sweetness. These things may perhaps appear in themselves small; but if duly attended to, they will be found of considerable service to bring us to a just and proper pronunciation. For in every thing that is to be attained by practice, it is a great advantage to set out right at first.\n\nThe ancients likewise had persons whom they called phonisci, whose proper business it was to teach them how to regulate and manage their voice; and others, who instructed them in the whole art of pronunciation, both as to their voice and gestures. These latter were generally taken from the theatre, being some eminent experienced actors. So Quintilian, treating of the province of these persons, says, \"The comedian ought to teach them how to relate facts, with what authority to advise, with what vehemence to express anger, and with what softness compassion.\" And speaking of gestures, he says, \"He should admonish them to raise their countenance, not distort their lips, or stretch their mouths.\" With several other directions of the like kind. And we are told concerning the emperor M. Antoninus, usually called the philosopher, that His first masters were Euphorius the grammarian, and Geminius the comedian.\n\nBut though they made use of actors to instruct their youth in forming their speech and gestures, yet the action of an orator was much different from that of the theatre. Cicero very plainly represents this distinction in the words of Crassus, when speaking of orators, he says, \"The motions of the body ought to be suited to the expressions, not in a theatrical way, mimicking the words by particular gesticulations, but in a manner expressive of the general sense, with a sedate and manly inflection of the sides; not taken from the stage and actors, but from the exercise of arms and the palestra.\" And Quintilian says to the same purpose, \"Every gesture and motion of the comedians is not to be imitated, nor to the same degree.\" They thought the action of the theatre too light and extravagant for the imitation of an orator; and therefore, though they employed actors to inform young persons in the first rudiments, yet they were afterwards sent to the palestra, or schools designed for purpose, to teach them a decent and graceful management of their bodies. And such schools, as Quintilian informs us, were in use both among the Greeks and Romans: Just as of later ages children learn to dance, in some measure with the same intention.\n\nBeing thus far prepared, they were afterwards sent to the schools of the rhetoricians. And here, as their business was to cultivate their style, and gain the whole art of eloquence; so particularly to acquire a just and accurate pronunciation by those exercises, in which for that end they were constantly employed. And as the Greeks were most celebrated for their skill in all the polite arts, and especially oratory; the Roman gentry and nobility generally sent their sons abroad, and placed them under the tuition of some Grecian master, to instruct them in the art of speaking, and by that means Pronunciation to fit them for the service of their country, either in the courts of judicature or the senate. Thus Cicero was sent to Rhodes, to study under the famous Molo, and Brutus under Pam\u00e6n\u00e6us; Caesar was going to the same place when taken by pirates; and Augustus afterwards studied there under Apollodorus.\n\nNor, after all this pains and industry, did they yet think themselves sufficiently qualified to take upon them the character of orators. But it was their constant custom to get together some of their friends and acquaintance who were proper judges of such performances, and declaim before them in private. The business of these persons was to make observations both on their language and pronunciation. And they were allowed the greatest freedom to take notice of anything they thought amiss, either as to inaccuracy of method, impropriety of style, or indecency of their voice or actions. This gave them an opportunity to correct any such defects at first, before they became habitual. What effects might not justly be expected from such an institution! Persons trained up in this manner, with all those advantages, joined to a good natural genius, could not fail of making very complete orators. Though even after they came to appear in public, they did not lay aside the custom of declaiming. For Quintilian tells us, that C. Carbo used to practise it daily in his tent. And Augustus is reported to have continued it during the war of Mutina against M. Antony. Nor is it to be supposed, that so constant an attendance to this practice was only servile to them in their public performances; but it must necessarily affect their whole conduct, give them a freedom of speech, easiness of address and behaviour, and render them in all respects fine gentlemen as well as excellent orators. And from hence, perhaps, we may see less reason to wonder at the surprising effects of some of their discourses, when we consider what pains they took to arrive at those abilities.\n\nHaving thus far treated on pronunciation in general, we shall now proceed to consider the parts of it separately; which are voice and gesture.\n\nChap. II. Of the Voice.\n\nVoice is one kind of sound. Now the influence of sounds, either to raise or allay our passions, is evident kind of from music. And certainly the harmony of a fine discourse, well and gracefully pronounced, is as capable to which always influence us, if not in a way to violent and ecstatic, yet not less powerful, and more agreeable to our rational faculties. As the business of this chapter is to offer some either by considerations for the just and decent management of raising or allaying the voice, it may not be improper in the first place to observe in general what nature does when free and unconstrained. As persons are differently affected when they speak; so they naturally alter the tone of their voice, though they do not attend to it. It rises, sinks, and has various inflections given it, according to the present state and disposition of the mind. When the mind is calm and sedate, the voice is moderate and even; when the former is depressed with sorrow, the latter is languid; and when that is inflamed by passion, this is raised and elevated. It is the orator's business, therefore, to follow nature, and to endeavour that the tone of his voice appear natural and unaffected. And for this\nPart IV.","sp":437,"ep":439},{"h":"ORATORY","t":"Pronunciation.\n\nThis end, he must take care to fit it to the nature of the subject; but still so as to be always grave and decent. Some persons continue a discourse in such a low and droning manner, that they can scarce be heard by their audience. Others again hurry on in too loud and boisterous a manner as if they imagined their hearers were deaf. But all the music and harmony of speech lies in the proper temperament of the voice between these extremes. In order to set this matter in a just light, it will be necessary to consider the principal affections or properties of the voice, and how they are to be regulated by an orator. Now these may all be referred either to quantity or quality.\n\nThe quantity of the voice consists in its height or lowness, sweetness or harshness, and the intermediate degrees between them.\n\nEvery person who speaks in public should endeavour, if he can, to fill the place where he speaks. But still he ought to be careful not to exceed the natural key of his voice. If he does, it will neither be soft nor agreeable, but either harsh and rough, or too shrill and squeaking. Besides, he will not be able to give every syllable its full and distinct sound; which will render what he says obscure, and difficult to be understood. He should therefore take care to keep his voice within reach, so as to have it under management, that he may raise or sink it, or give it any inflection he thinks proper; which it will not be in his power to do if he put a force upon it, and strain it beyond its natural tone.\n\nThe like caution is to be used against the contrary extreme, that the voice be not dropped, and suffered to sink too low. This will give the speaker pain in raising it again to its proper pitch, and be no less offensive to the hearers. For though the music of speech consists in the variations of the voice, yet they must be gradual to render them pleasant. Such sudden and great changes at once are rather to be esteemed clumsy in speaking than variations. Besides, as they often prevent the hearers from taking in the sense of what is said, it gives them no small uneasiness that they are obliged to stretch their attention. Many persons are too apt to be guilty of this, especially at the end of a sentence, by dropping the last word; which ought, in a particular manner, to be expressed distinctly, because the meaning of the whole sentence often depends upon it.\n\nThe medium between these two is a moderate and even voice. But this is not the same in all; that which is moderate in one would be high in another. Every person, therefore, must regulate it by the natural key of his own voice. A calm and sedate voice is generally best; as a moderate sound is most pleasing to the ear, if it be clear and distinct. But this quality of the voice must also be accompanied with a variety, otherwise there can be no harmony; since all harmony consists in variety. Nothing is less pleasing than a discourse pronounced throughout in one continued tone of the voice, without any change or alteration. Besides, a variation of the voice is an ease to the speaker; as the body is relieved by shifting its posture. The equality, therefore, we are here speaking of admits a variety of inflections and changes within the same pitch. And when that is altered, the gradations, whether higher or lower, should be so gentle and regular as to preserve a due proportion of the parts and harmony of the whole, which cannot be done when the voice is suddenly varied with too great a distinction. And therefore it should move from one key to another, so as rather to glide like a gentle stream, than pour down like a rapid torrent, as an ingenious writer has well expressed it: An even voice is best fitted to keep the mind to close attention. And therefore, in subjects designed only for instruction, without any address to the passions, there is little room for a variety of voice. For the voice ought to agree with the style; and as upon such subjects this should be equal, moderate, and smooth, so should the other. Every thing, as we say, is beautiful in its season; and there is a certain propriety in things which ought always to be regarded. And, therefore, an affected variety, ill-placed, is as disagreeable to a judicious audience as the want of it, where the subject requires it. We may find some persons, in pronouncing a grave and plain discourse, affect as many different tones, changes, and variations of their voice, as if they were acting a comedy; which is doubtless a very great impropriety. But the orator's province is not barely to apply to the mind, but likewise to the passions; which require a great variety of the voice, high or low, vehement or languid, according to the nature of the passions he designs to affect. So that for an orator always to use the same tone or degree of his voice, and expect to answer all his views by it, would be much the same thing as if a physician should propose to cure all distempers by one medicine. From hence it is evident, that although various inflections and tones of the voice are requisite to make it harmonious and pleasing to the ear; yet the degree of it should differ according to the nature of the subject, and design of the speaker. And, as a perfect monotony is always unpleasant, so it can never be necessary in any discourse.\n\nThe next property of the voice above-mentioned was sweetness. That force expressions ought to be pronounced falter and twitter than others, is very manifest. Gay and sprightly ideas should not only be expressed louder, but also falter, than such as are sad and melancholy. And when we press an adversary, the voice should be brisk and quick. But to hurry on in a precipitant manner, without pausing till stopped for want of breath, is certainly a very great fault. This destroys, not only the necessary distinction between sentence and sentence, but likewise between the several words of the same sentence; nay, and often occasions us to express our words by halves, while one is thrown so fast upon another, that we are not able to give each its full and just sound. By this means all the grace of speaking is lost, and in a great measure the advantage of hearing. For when the ears of the hearers cannot keep pace with the volubility of the speaker's tongue, they will be little the better for what he says. Besides, by not commanding his voice, and eating his breath at the proper pauses and points of distinction, he is often obliged to stop in the middle of a sentence; and so divides what should be continued, and joins what should be separated; which must necessarily destroy the sense, and confound his discourse. Young persons are very liable to this, especially at first setting out. And it often arises from difference. They are jealous of their performances, and the success they may have in speaking, which gives them a pain till it is over; and this puts them into a hurry of mind, which incapacitates them from governing their voice, and keeping it under that due\nPronunciation regulation which perhaps they proposed to themselves before they began to speak. And the greater degree such persons have of a native and ingenious modesty, accompanied with a laudable ambition to excel, they are commonly more exposed to this. For while, on the one hand, they are fired with an ardent desire to recommend themselves, and on the other are fearful of the event, this dubious state of mind is very apt to throw them off their guard, and run them into this excess. From which we may see the great advantage of having the voice well formed becomes; for when once it is become habitual to speak with justness and propriety, persons readily practice it without much attention or concern.\n\nAnd as a precipitant and hasty pronunciation is culpable, so likewise, on the other hand, it is a fault to break too slow. This seems to argue a heaviness in the speaker. And as he appears cool himself, he can never expect to warm his hearers, and excite their affections. When not only every word, but every syllable is drawn out to too great a length, the ideas do not come fast enough to keep up the attention without much uneasiness. For till the sense is completed, the mind is in suspense; and, if it be held long in that situation, it will of course flag and grow tired. Indeed, in some cases, it is requisite the pronunciation should be slower than in others; as in representing things great and difficult; or in expressing some particular passions, as admiration or grief. But the extreme we are now speaking of, is a slowness equally continuing through a whole discourse, which must necessarily render it flat and lifeless.\n\nNow, to avoid either of the two extremes last mentioned, the voice ought to be sedate and distinct. And in order to render it distinct, it is necessary, not only that each word and syllable should have its full and full sound, both as to time and accent; but likewise that every sentence, and part of a sentence, should be separated by its proper pause and interval. This is more easy to be done in reading, from the assistance of the points; but it is no less to be attended to in speaking, if we would pronounce in a distinct and graceful manner. For every one should speak in the same manner as he ought to read, if he could arrive at that exactness. Now the common rule given in pausing is, that we stop our voice at a comma till we can tell one, at a semicolon two, at a colon three, and at a full period four. And these points are either accommodated to the several parts of the same sentence, as the first three; or different sentences, as the last; this occasions the different length of the pause, by which either the dependence of what precedes upon that which follows, or its disjunction from it, is represented. And, therefore, in the first three stops, the voice is rather to be suspended in different degrees or measures of time than entirely dropt, to show that the sense is not yet completed. But between sentence and sentence we respire, and begin anew. So that in long periods, the voice should be favoured by beginning low and sedately, that it may hold to the end without respiration; or if it will not, the breath ought to be recovered without sinking the voice. For if once the voice drop for want of breath before the period be finished, not only the beauty, but likewise the sense of it, will be lost. Quintilian lays a great stress upon due attention to these pauses; and says, \"Though it may appear not so considerable in itself, yet all the other virtues of a good pronunciation are deficient without it.\"\n\nHitherto we have considered such properties of the voice as respect quantity; we come now to speak of its qualities. And the chief of these are fireness or weakness, clearness or obscuration, falseness or truthfulness, smoothness or roughness. Now, one half of these is what every one would willingly choose, as he would wish to be free from the others. But it is not in our power to give ourselves what qualities of the voice we please; but only to make the best use we can of what nature has bestowed upon us. However, several defects of the voice are capable of being helped by care and proper means; as, on the other hand the best voice may be greatly hurt by ill management and indiscipline. Temperance is a great preservative of the voice, and all excess is highly prejudicial to it. The voice must necessarily suffer, if the organs of speech have not their proper tone. And in order to their having this, they must be kept in a due temperature; that is, they must neither be too moist nor too dry. If they abound with fluids, these will obstruct the clearness of the voice, and render it obscure and confused; and if they are parched with drought, the voice will be harsh and rough. Now all excesses, as well as some bodily indispositions, are apt to affect the organs one or other of these ways.\n\nA strong voice is very serviceable to an orator, because if it want some other advantages, he is, however, capable to make himself heard. And if at any time he is forced to strain it, he is in less danger of its failing him before he has finished his discourse. But he who has a weak voice, should be very careful not to strain it, especially at first. He ought to begin low, and rise gradually to such a pitch as the key of his voice will well carry him, without being obliged to sink again afterwards. Frequent inflections of the voice will likewise be of some assistance to him. But especially he should take care to speak deliberately, and raise his voice, by allowing due time for respiration at all the proper pauses. It is an extreme much less inconvenient for such a person rather to speak too slow, than too fast. But this defect of a weak voice is sometimes capable of being helped by the use of proper methods; as is evident from the instance of Demosthenes, before-mentioned.\n\nA voice is said to be clear, when the organs of speech are fitted to give every single letter, and all the combinations of them in syllables and words, their proper and distinct sound. Such a voice is very pleasing and agreeable to the hearers; and no less an happiness to the speaker, as it saves him a great expense of spirits. For a moderate voice, if clear, will be as distinctly heard, as one much louder, if thick and obscure. Which is a great advantage to the speaker, because he can better keep his voice under command, and modulate it at pleasure, as the several parts and circumstances of his discourse may require. On the contrary, an obscure and confused voice is not always occasioned from a deficiency in the organ; but many times is the effect of custom and a bad habit. Some persons, either from want of due care in their education at first, or from inadvertency and negligence afterwards, run into a very irregular and confused manner of expressing their words; either by misplacing the accent, confounding the sound of the letters,\nPronunciation letters, or huddling the syllables one upon another, so as to render what they say often unintelligible. Indeed, sometimes this arises from a natural defect, as in the case of Demosthenes; who found a method to rectify that, as well as the weakness of his voice. But in faults of this kind, which proceed from habit, doubtless the most likely way to mend them is to speak deliberately.\n\nA dull voice is not the same as a strong or a loud voice. It fills the ear, but it is often not pleasant. And therefore to render it so, as well as audible, it should be frequently varied. However, this seems better suited to the character of an orator, than a small and shrill voice; because it has something in it more grave and manly. And those who have the misfortune of a very small voice, should be cautious of raising it too high a pitch, especially at once; because the sudden compression of the organ is apt to occasion a squeaking and very disagreeable sound.\n\nA soft and smooth voice is of all the most musical, especially if it be flexible. And, on the contrary, nothing is less harmonious than a voice that is harsh and rough. For the one grates as disagreeably upon the ear, as the other gives it pleasure and delight.\n\nFrom the consideration of these several properties of the voice, we may conclude that to be the best, and fittest for an orator, which is moderate, distinct, firm, clear, and smooth, and without easily flexible to the several degrees and variations of sound which every part of the discourse may require.\n\nCHAP. III. Of Gesture.\n\nBy this is meant, a suitable conformity of the motions of the countenance, and several parts of the body, in speaking, to the subject-matter of the discourse. The word *gesture* is here used in a larger sense than is ordinarily done in common language. For we rarely make use of that word to denote the motions of the countenance, or any parts of it; but as these make a considerable part of our present subject, they must here be comprehended under this term.\n\nIt is not agreed among the learned, whether voice or gesture has the greater influence upon us. But as the latter affects us by the eye, as the former does by the ear, gesture in the nature of it seems to have this advantage, that it conveys the impression more speedily to the mind; for the sight is the quickest of all our senses. Nor is its influence less upon our passions; nay, in some instances it appears to act more powerfully. A cast of the eye shall express desire in moving a manner as the softest language; and a different motion of it, resentment. Tearing the hands, tear the hair, or strike the breast, are all strong indications of sorrow. And he who claps his hand to his sword, throws us into a greater panic than one who only threatens to kill us. Nor is it in some respects less various and extensive than language. Cicero tells us, he often diverted himself by trying this with Roscius the comedian; who could express a sentence as many ways by his gestures, as he himself by words. And some dramas, called *pantomimes*, have been carried on wholly by mutes, who have performed every part by gestures only, without words, in a way very intelligent, as well as entertaining to the spectators. Well, therefore, might Cicero call *action* (or gesture) the language of the body, since it is capable in so lively a manner to convey both our ideas and passions. But with respect to oratory, gesture may very properly be called the second part of pronunciation; in which, as the voice should be suited to the impressions it receives from the mind, so the several motions of the body ought to be accommodated to the various tones and inflections of the voice. When the voice is even and moderate, little gesture is required; and nothing is more unnatural than violent motion, in discoursing upon ordinary and familiar subjects. The motions of the body should rise therefore in proportion to the vehemence and energy of the expression, as the natural and genuine effect of it.\n\nBut as gesture is very different and various as to the manner of it, which depends upon the decent conduct of several parts of the body; it will not be amiss to consider more particularly the proper management of each of those parts. Now all gesture is either natural, or from imitation. By natural gesture we mean such actions and motions of the body, as naturally accompany our words, as these do the impressions of our minds. And these either respect the whole body, or some particular part of it. But before we enter upon this, give us leave just to observe, that it has been customary in all ages and countries, in making a fit discourse before an assembly, to do it standing. Thus we read, that Abraham stood up, and spoke unto the children of Heth. And it seems as if he sat down when he had ended his speech; because, immediately after the account of their answer, it is said again, that Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, the children of Heth. In like manner Homer represents the Grecian princes, as standing up, when they made a speech, either to the army, or in their councils. So when Achilles has assembled the army, to inquire into the reason of the great plague which at that time raged among them, he rises up before he begins to speak, and sits down again when he has done. After him the prophet Calchas rises, and charges it upon Agamemnon; who rising up in a passion, does not refuse to comply with what Calchas proposed, but expresses his resentment at him for saying it. And upon another occasion both Agamemnon and Nestor do the same in council. And Cicero acquaints us, that when Lentulus had been charged in the senate as an associate with Catiline, he stood up to make his defence. Nor does the advantage of being better heard, seem to have been the only reason for so general an agreement in this posture; but it appears likewise to have been chosen, as the most decent and respectful. Sitting carries in it an air of authority, and is therefore a posture scarce used upon such occasions, unless perhaps where that is designed to be expressed by it. Wherefore it was a thing very much resented, that when Caesar after he had got the power into his hands, once addressed the senate, either refused to rise, as some say, or as others, one of his friends held him down by his gown.\n\nBut though standing appears to be the most proper posture for speaking in public, yet it is very unbecoming for the body to be entirely without any motion like a statue. It should not long continue in the same position, but be constantly changing, though the motion be very moderate. There ought to be no appearance of stiffness, but a certain ease and pliability, naturally fitting itself to every expression; by which\nwhich means, when a greater degree of motion is necessary, it will appear less sudden and vehement: For as the raising, sinking, and various inflections of the voice must be gradual; so likewise should the motions of the body. It is only on some particular occasions that an hasty vehemence and impetuosity is proper in either case.\n\nAs to the several parts of the body, the head is the most considerable. To lift it up too high has the air of arrogance and pride; to stretch it out too far, or throw it back, looks clownish and unmannerly; to hang it downwards on the breast, shows an unmanly bashfulness and want of spirit; and to suffer it to lean on either shoulder, argues both sloth and indolence. Wherefore in calm and sedate discourse it ought to keep its natural state, an upright posture. However, it should not be long without motion, nor yet always moving; but gently turn sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other, as occasion requires, that the voice may be heard by all who are present; and then return again to its natural position. It should always accompany the other actions of the body, and turn on the same side with them; except when aversion to anything is expressed, which is done by stretching out the right hand, and turning the head to the left. The ancients erected a statue of Venus in this posture, who was called by the Greeks \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, and by the Latins Veritcordia, and in English may be termed the forbidding Venus. But nothing is more indecent than violent motions and agitations of the head. And therefore when a witty writer, who is well known among us, would convey the most ridiculous idea of a pretender to knowledge, he expresses it thus:\n\nFor having three times shook his head\nTo stir his wit up, thus he said. Hudibras.\n\nBut it is the countenance that chiefly represents both the passions and disposition of the mind. By this we express love, hatred, joy, sorrow, modesty, and confidence: by this we supplicate, threaten, soothe, invite, forbid, consent, or refuse; and all this without speaking. Nay, from hence we form a judgment not only of a person's present temper, but of his capacity and natural disposition. And therefore it is common to say, such an one has a promising countenance, or that he promises little by his countenance. It is true, this is no certain rule of judging; nor is it in the power of any one to alter the natural make of his countenance: however, it may put us upon endeavouring to gain the most pleasing aspect we can; since it is so natural for mankind to draw such conclusions from it: and some persons are so unhappy, as to render their countenance more disagreeable, than otherwise it would be, by ill habits.\n\nBut the several parts of the face bear their part, and contribute to the proper and decent motion of the whole. In a calm and sedate discourse, all the features retain their natural state and situation. In sorrow, the forehead and eyebrows lower, and the cheeks hang down. But in expressions of joy and cheerfulness, the forehead and eyebrows are expanded, the cheeks contracted, and the corners of the mouth drawn upwards. Anger and resentment contract the forehead, draw the brows together, and thrust out the lips. And terror elevates both the brows and forehead. As these are the natural signs of such passions, the orator should endeavor to conform to them.\n\nBut as the eyes are most active and significant, it is the advice of Cicero that the greatest care should be taken in their management. And he gives this reason for it, \"Because other parts of the countenance have but few motions; whereas all the passions of the soul are expressed in the eyes, by so many different actions, which cannot possibly be represented by any gestures of the body, if the eyes are kept in a fixed posture.\" Common experience does in a great measure confirm the truth of this observation. We readily guess at a person's intention, or how he is affected to us, by his eyes. And any sudden change or emotion of the mind is presently followed by an alteration in the look. In speaking therefore upon pleasant and delightful subjects, the eyes are brisk and cheerful; as on the contrary, they flinch and are languid in delivering anything melancholy and sorrowful. This is so agreeable to nature, that before a person speaks, we are prepared with the expectation of one or the other from his different aspect. So likewise in anger, a certain vehemence and intensity appears in the eyes, which, for want of proper words to express it by, we endeavour to represent by metaphors taken from fire, the most violent and rapid element, and say, in such cases, the eyes sparkle, burn, or are inflamed. In expressions of hatred or detestation, it is natural to alter the look, either by turning the eyes aside, or downwards. Virgil has very justly observed this: for when he describes Aeneas meeting with Dido in the Elysian shades, and addressing her, he represents her disregard of him, by saying,\n\nDissatisfactorily she looked; then turning round,\nStill fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground.\n\nShe showed her resentment for his former treatment of her, by not vouchsafing to look on him. Indeed, the eyes are sometimes turned downwards upon other occasions, as to express modesty. And if at any time a particular object be addressed to, whatever it be, the eyes should be turned that way. And therefore Philostratus very deservedly ridicules a certain rhetorician as guilty of a solecism in gesture, who, upon saying, O Jupiter! turned his eyes downward; and when he said, O earth! looked upward. A staring look has the appearance of giddiness and want of thought; and to contrast the eyes, gives suspicion of craft and design. A fixed look may be occasioned from intenseness of thought, but at the same time shows a disregard to the audience; and a too quick and wandering motion of the eyes denotes levity and wantonness. A gentle and moderate motion of the eyes is therefore in common most suitable, always directed to some of the audience, and gradually turning from side to side with an air of respect and modesty, and looking them decently in the face, as in common discourse: Such a behaviour will of course draw an attention. As in conversation, when a person addresses us in an handsome and becoming manner, we presently put ourselves in a posture to give what he says a proper reception. But as all the passions are in the most lively manner expressed in the eyes, their motions ought to vary according to the different nature of those passions; they are suited both to discover in the speaker, and convey to his hearers; since, as the quickest access to the mind is by the sight, a proper well-timed look will sometimes\nPart IV.","sp":439,"ep":443},{"h":"ORATORY","t":"Pronunciation sometimes sooner effect this than it can be done by words; as in discharging a cannon we are struck with the light before we hear the sound.\n\nAs to the other parts of the body distinct from the head, the shoulders ought not to be elevated; for this is not only in itself indecent, but it likewise contracts the neck, and hinders the proper motion of the head. Nor, on the other hand, should they be drawn down, and depressed; because this occasions a stiffness both to the neck and the whole body. Their natural posture therefore is best, as being most easy and graceful. To shrug the shoulders has an abject and servile air; and frequently to heave them upwards and downwards is a very disagreeable sight.\n\nA continued motion of the arms any way, is by all means to be avoided. Their action should generally be very moderate, and follow that of the hands, unless in very pathetic expressions, where it may be proper to give them a more lively spring.\n\nThe hands need never be idle. Quintilian seems to think them as necessary and powerful in action, as Cicero does the eyes. \"The hands (says he), without which all gesture is lame and weak, have a greater variety of motions than can well be expressed; for they are almost equal to our words. Do not we desire with them, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, beseech, detest, fear, inquire, deny? Do not they express joy, sorrow, doubt, confession, penitence, measure, plenty, number, and time? Do not they excite, restrain, prove, admire, and shame? that in so great a variety of speech among all nations and countries, this seems to me the common language of all mankind.\" Thus far Quintilian. Now, all bodily motion is either upward or downward, to the right or left, forward or backward, or else circular. The hands are employed by the orator in all these, except the last. And as they ought to correspond with our expressions, so they ought to begin and end with them. In admiration, and addresses to heaven, they must be elevated, but never raised above the eyes; and in speaking of things below us, they are directed downwards. Side motion should generally begin from the left, and terminate gently on the right. In demonstrations, addressing, and on several other occasions, they are moved forward; and in threatening, sometimes thrown back. But when the orator speaks of himself, his right-hand should be gently laid on his breast. When no other motion is necessary, the hands should be kept about as high as the breast, so as to make near a right angle with the arm. This is not only graceful, but likewise the most easy posture, and gives the least strain to the muscles. They should never be suffered to hang down, nor to loll upon the cushion or bar. The left hand should never move alone, but accommodate itself to the motions of the right. In motions to the left side, the right hand should not be carried beyond the left shoulder. In promises and expressions of compliment; the motion of the hands should be gentle and slow; but in exhortations and applause more swift. The hands should generally be open; but in expressions of compunction and anger they may be closed. All fidgety and trifling actions of the fingers ought to be avoided; nor should they be stretched out and expanded in a stiff and rigid posture, but kept easy and pliable.\n\nNeither the breast nor the belly should be thrust out; which in itself looks ungainly, and hinders the free motion of the trunk; which ought not to be kept too stiff and upright, but easy and flexible, always suiting itself to the motions of the head and hands. The feet should continue steady, and not give the body a wavering and giddy motion by frequently shifting; though some persons fall into that habit without moving their feet. Curius, a Roman orator, as Cicero tells us, was addicted to this; which occasioned a friend of his once to pass a joke upon him, by asking, \"Who that was talking out of a boat?\" The jest is too plain to need explication; for every one knows the waving of a boat will give the body such a motion.\n\nThe gestures we have hitherto discussed, are such as naturally accompany our expressions. And we believe those we have mentioned, if duly attended to, will be found sufficient to answer all the purposes of our modern pronunciation. The ancients, indeed, used several more vehement actions and gestures than we are accustomed to; as we have formerly shown. Philip the Roman orator, as Cicero informs us, did not use to prepare his discourses; but spoke, as we say, off-hand. And he was wont to tell his friends, \"he was never fit to talk till he had warmed his arm.\" He doubted, therefore, used a more violent motion with his arms and hands than is common with us. And Cicero calls the arm projected the orator's weapon. Indeed, to extend or brandish the arm, carries in it an air of command and authority, which was not unbecoming the character of Philip, who was a person of the highest rank and quality. And therefore young orators, both among the Greeks and Romans, for a time used no motion of the arm, but kept it confined in their garment, as an argument of modesty, till age and experience allowed them to use greater freedom. Nor was it uncommon for the ancient orators to express the excess of their passions by tears. They thought nothing unbecoming that was natural; and judged it agreeable to the characters even of the bravest men, to be touched with a sense of humanity in great calamities: And therefore we find both Homer and Virgil make their greatest heroes shed tears on some occasions.\n\nThe other sort of gestures above-mentioned are such as arise from imitation; as where the orator describes some action, or personates another speaking. But here great care is to be taken not to overact his part, by running into any ludicrous or theatrical mimicry. It is sufficient for him so to represent things of this nature, as may best convey the image of them in a lively manner to the minds of the hearers; without any such change either of his actions or voice as are not suitable to his own character.\n\nCHAP. IV. Some particular Rules for the Voice and Gesture.\n\nThe subject of pronunciation is of so great importance to an orator, that it can neither be too clearly laid down, nor too strongly inculcated. If we inquire into the causes of that surprising power it has over us, and by what means it so strongly affects us, this may in some measure appear by reflecting on the frame and constitution of human nature. For our infinitely wise and great Maker has so formed us, that not only the actions of the body are subject to the direction of the mind, but we are likewise endowed with various passions\npassions and affections, that excite us to pursue those things which make for our happiness, and avoid others which are hurtful to us. And as we are made for society, we are also furnished with speech, which enables us to converse with one another. And such is the contrivance of our make, and influence of our minds upon the mechanism of our bodies, that we can not only communicate our thoughts to each other, but likewise our passions. For, as Cicero well observes, \"Every motion of the mind has naturally its peculiar countenance, voice, and gesture; and the whole body, every position of the face, and sound of the voice, like the strings of an instrument, act agreeably to the impression they receive from the mind.\" Nor is this all: but as every one is differently affected himself, he is capable to make the like impressions upon others, and excite them to the same motions which he feels in himself. As when two instruments are set to the same pitch, the strings of the one being touched, produce in the other the like sound. This common sympathy in the human frame shows how necessary it is that an orator should not only in general be well acquainted with the rules of pronunciation, but likewise know how to use them as occasion requires; for a general knowledge of the rules of art is not of itself sufficient to perfect an artist, without a further acquaintance with the particular application of them to their several cases and circumstances. Thus, for instance, it is not enough for an orator to understand all the beauties and ornaments of language, and which of them are suited to form the several kinds of style, unless he can likewise accommodate each of those characters to their proper subject. And so likewise in pronunciation, he ought not only to know the several qualities of the voice, and proper gestures of the body, but also when and where to make use of them. For not only different subjects, but also different parts of the same discourse, and even particular expressions, often require a difference in the manner of pronunciation, both as to the voice and gesture. Having therefore treated on both these parts of pronunciation in general, it may not be amiss now to consider how they are to be applied in each of the two respects last mentioned.\n\nWe shall begin with the parts of a discourse, and treat of them in their natural order. And here the view and design of the speaker in each of them will easily help us to see the proper manner of pronunciation.\n\nLet us suppose then a person presenting himself before an assembly, in order to make a discourse to them. It cannot be decent immediately to begin to speak too soon as ever he makes his appearance. He will first settle himself, compose his countenance, and take a respectful view of his audience. This prepares them for silence and attention. To begin presently, and hurry on, without first allowing either himself or his hearers time to compose themselves, looks as if he was rather performing a task than had any design to please them; which will be very apt to make them uneasy till he has done, as he seems to be himself. Persons commonly form some opinion of a speaker from their first view of him, which prejudices them either in his favour, or otherwise, as to what he says afterwards. A grave and sedate aspect inclines them to think him serious; that he has considered his subject, and may have something to offer worth their attention. A haughty and forbidding air occasions dislike, as it looks like disrespect. A wandering giddy countenance argues levity. A dejected drooping appearance is apt to raise contempt, unless where the subject is melancholy. And a cheerful aspect is a proper prelude to a pleasant and agreeable argument.\n\nTo speak low at first has the appearance of modesty, and is best for the voice; which, by rising gradually, will with more ease be carried to any pitch that may be afterwards necessary, without straining it. However, some variation of the voice is always proper to give it an harmony. Nay, and sometimes it is not improper for an orator to set out with a considerable degree of warmth, expressed by such an elevation of the voice, and gestures of the body, as are suited to represent the emotions of his mind. But this is not ordinarily the case. We have some few instances of this in Cicero; as in his oration for Roelius Merinus, where the heat of the charge could not but excite his indignation against the accusers. And so likewise in that against Piso, and the two first against Catiline, which begin in the same manner, from the resentment he had conceived against their persons and conduct.\n\nIn the narration, the voice ought to be raised to somewhat an higher pitch. Matters of fact should be related in a very plain and distinct manner, with a proper stress and emphasis laid upon each circumstance, accompanied with a suitable address and motions of the body, to engage the attention of the hearers. For there is a certain grace in telling a story, by which those who are masters of it seldom fail to recommend themselves in conversation. The beauty of it consists in an easy and familiar manner of expression, attended with such actions and gestures as are suited to the nature of the things related, and help to enliven each particular circumstance and part of the discourse.\n\nThe proposition, or subject of the discourse, should be delivered with a very clear and audible voice. For if this be not plainly heard, all that follows in proof of it cannot well be understood. And for the same reason, if it be divided into several parts or branches, they should each be expressed very deliberately and distinctly. But as the design here is only information, there can be little room for gesture.\n\nThe confirmation admits of great variety both of the voice and gestures. In reasoning, the voice is quick and pungent, and should be enforced with suitable actions. And as descriptions likewise have often a place here, in painting out the images of things, the orator should endeavour to adapt both his voice, and the motions of his body, particularly the turn of his eyes, and action of his hands, as may best help the imagination of his hearers. Where he introduces another person speaking, or addresses to an absent person, it should be with some degree of imitation. And in dialogue the voice should alter with the parts. When he diverts from his subject by any digression, his voice should be lively and cheerful; since that is rather designed for entertainment than instruction.\n\nIn confutation, the arguments of the adverse party ought first to be repeated in a plain and distinct manner, that the speaker may not seem to concede, or avoid the force of them, unless they appear trifling and\nPronunciation and unworthy of a serious answer; and then a facetious manner, both of expression and gesture, may be the properest way to convey them. For to attempt to answer in a grave and serious manner, what is in itself empty and ludicrous, is apt to create a suspicion of its having more in it than it really has. So when Tubero, in his accusation of Ligarius before Caesar, had made it part of his charge, that Ligarius was in Africa during some part of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey; Cicero, in his answer, not thinking it deserved a serious reply, contents himself with barely mentioning it ironically. For thus he begins his defence of Ligarius: \"Caesar, my kinman Tubero has laid before you a new crime, and till this day unheard-of, that Q. Ligarius was in Africa.\" Everyone must easily perceive, by the manner in which these words were pronounced, that the design of them was to make the charge appear ridiculous. But caution should be used not to represent any argument of weight in a ludicrous way, lest by so doing the speaker should more expose himself than his adversary.\n\nIn the conclusion, both the voice and gesture should be brisk and sprightly, which may seem to arise from a tenor of the speaker's opinion of the goodness of his cause, and that he has offered nothing but what is agreeable to reason and truth; as likewise from his assurance that the audience agree with him in the same sentiments. In every undertaking that requires care and thought, persons are apt at first to be sedate and moderate; but when it is drawing to an end, and is near finished, it is very natural to appear more gay. If an enumeration of the principal arguments of the discourse be convenient, as it sometimes is, where they are pretty numerous, or the discourse is long, they ought to be expressed in the most clear and forcible manner. And if there be an address to the passions, both the voice and gesture must be suited to the nature of them, of which more will be said presently.\n\nWe proceed now to the consideration of particular expressions. And what we shall offer here, will be first in relation to single words, then sentences, and lastly the passions.\n\nI. Even in those sentences which are expressed in the most even and sedate manner, there is often one or more words which require an emphasis and distinction of the voice. Pronouns are often of this kind; as, This is the man. And such are many words that denote the circumstances and qualities of things. Such as heighten or magnify the idea of the thing to which they are joined, elevate the voice; as noble, admirable, majestic, greatly, and the like. On the contrary, those which lessen the idea, or deflate it, depress the voice, or at least protract the tone; of which sort are the words little, mean, poorly, contemptible, with many others. Some tropes likewise, as metaphors and verbal figures, which consist in the repetition of a single word, should have a particular emphasis. As when Virgil says of the river Araxes, It abstained a bridge. And Nicias of himself in the same poet, I, I am the man; where the repeated word is loudest. This distinction of words, and giving them their proper emphasis, does not only render the expression more clear and intelligible, but very much contributes to the variation of the voice, and the preventing a monotony. And the different pronunciations of these words will also require a peculiar pronunciation.\n\nII. In sentences, regard should be had to their length, and the number of their parts, in order to distinguish them by proper pauses. The frame and structure of the period ought likewise to be considered, that the voice may be so managed as to give it the most musical accent. Unless there be some special reason to the contrary, it should end louder than it begins. And this difference of tone between the end of the former sentence and the beginning of the next, not only helps to distinguish the sentence, but aids to the harmony of the voice. And that the last syllables of a sentence might become more audible and distinct, was doubtless one reason why the ancient rhetoricians dislike short feet at the end of a period. In an antithesis, or a sentence consisting of opposite parts, one contrary must be louder than the other. As, \"He is gone, but by a painful removal, from painful labour to quiet rest; from unquiet desires to happy contentment; from sorrow to joy; and from transitory time to immortality.\" In a climax or gradation, the voice should rise with it. So, \"There is no enjoyment of property without government; no government without a magistrate; no magistrate without obedience; no obedience where every one acts as he pleases.\" And so in other gradations of a different form. As, \"Since concord was lost, friendship was lost, fidelity was lost, liberty was lost, all was lost.\" And again, \"You would pardon him whom the senate hath condemned, whom the people of Rome have condemned, whom all mankind have condemned.\" We might mention several other figurative expressions, which require a particular conformation and management of the voice; but these, we presume, with some others we shall have occasion to name presently when we come to the passions, may be sufficient to guide us in the rest. But that it may appear more evidently how necessary a different inflection and variation of the voice is in most sentences, give us leave to show how Quintilian illustrates it, by a passage which he takes from Cicero. The place is the beginning of Cicero's defence for Milo, and the words are these: \"Although I am apprehensive it may seem base to discover fear when I enter upon the defence of a most courageous man, and it may appear very indecent, when Milo discovers more concern for the public safety than for his own, not to show a greatness of mind equal to his cause, yet this new form of the court terrifies my eyes, which cannot discern the ancient manner of the forum, and former custom of trials, whatever way they look: your bench is not surrounded with its usual attendants.\" This sentence consists of four members. And Quintilian supposes, that though these words are the beginning of a speech, and were accordingly expressed in a calm and submissive manner, yet that the orator used a great deal of variety in the pronunciation of their several parts. In the first member (as he imagines) his voice was more elevated in expressing the words, a most courageous man, than in those other parts of it I am apprehensive it may seem base, and, to discover fear. In the second member he rose higher, in saying, when Milo discovers more concern for the public safety than for his own; and then again, as it were, checked himself in what follows, not to show a greatness of mind equal...\nThe beginning of the third member, carrying a reflection in it, was spoke with a different tone of the voice, this new form of the court terrifies my eyes; and the other part of it more loud and distinctly, which cannot discern the ancient manner of the forum, and former custom of trials. And the last member was still more raised and audible, your bench is not surrounded with its usual attendants. And it must be supposed, that while he was saying this, he cast his eyes round the assembly, and viewed the folders whom Pompey had placed there, which renders the expression still more grave and solemn. If this was the manner of the ancient orators, and they were so exact and accurate in expressing their periods, and the several parts of them, as we have reason to believe they were, it must have given a very great force, as well as beauty, to their pronunciation.\n\nIII. That the passions have each of them both a different voice and action, is evident from hence; that we know in what manner a person is affected, by the tone of his voice, though we do not understand the sense of what he says, or many times so much as see him: and we can often make the same judgment from his countenance and gestures. Love and esteem are expressed in a smooth and cheerful tone: but anger and resentment, with a rough, harsh, and interrupted voice; for when the spirits are disturbed and ruffled, the organs are moved unequally. Joy raises and dilates the voice, as sorrow sinks and contracts it. Cicero takes notice of a passage in an oration of Gracchus, wherein he bewails the death of his brother, who was killed by Scipio, which in his time was thought very moving: \"Unhappy man (says he), whither shall I betake myself? where shall I go? Into the capitol? that flows with my brother's blood. Shall I go home? and behold my unhappy mother all in tears and despair?\" Though Gracchus had a very ill design in that speech, and his view was to excite the populace against their governors, yet (as Cicero tells us) when he came to this passage, he expressed himself in such moving accents and gestures, that he extorted tears even from his enemies. Fear occasions a tremor and hesitation of the voice, and affluence gives it strength and firmness. Admiration elevates the voice, and should be expressed with pomp and magnificence: O surprising clemency, worthy of the highest praise and greatest encomiums, and fit to be perpetuated in lasting monuments! This is Cicero's compliment to Caesar when he thought it for his purpose. And oftentimes this passion is accompanied with an elevation both of the eyes and hands. On the contrary, contempt sinks and protracts the voice. In the dispute between Cicero and Cecilius, which of them should accuse Verres, Cicero puts this contemptuous question to him: \"How are you qualified, Cecilius, for such an undertaking? I will not ask, when you ever gave a proof of it; but when you so much as attempted it? Do you consider the difficulty of managing a public cause?\" with much more to the same purpose. Though such kind of expressions require little gesture, yet sometimes a motion of the hand may not be improper, to signify disdain or aversion. We may suppose Cicero to have acted thus in his defence of Rabirius. For to show his assurance of his client's cause, having used this expression in a very audible manner, \"I wish I had it to say, that Rabirius had with his own hand killed Saturninus, who was an enemy to the Roman state,\" some persons in the crowd began to raise a clamour, just as of later times hissing has been practised on the like occasions. Upon which Cicero immediately replies, \"This noise does not disturb me, but please me, since it shows, though there are some weak persons, yet they are but few.\" Then presently after follows the expression we refer to: \"Why do not you cease your clamour, since it only discovers your folly, and the smallness of your number?\" All exclamations should be violent. When we address to inanimate things, the voice should be higher than when to animated beings; and appeals to heaven must be made in a loftier tone than those to men.\n\nThese few hints for expressing the principal passions may, if duly attended to, suffice to direct our practice in others. Though, after all, it is impossible to gain a just and decent pronunciation of voice and gesture merely from rules without practice and an imitation of the best examples. Which shows the wisdom of the ancients, in training up their youth to it, by the affluence of masters, to form both their speech and actions.\n\nBut there is one thing which ought always to be attended to; namely, that persons should well consider their own make and genius, especially with respect to the passions. We seldom find, that any actor can excel in all characters; but if he performs one well, he is deficient in another: And therefore they are commonly too prudent as to confine themselves to such as best suit them. The case is the same in an orator; who should therefore keep within those bounds which nature seems to have prescribed for him. Some are better fitted for action than others, and most for some particular actions rather than others; and what fits well upon one would appear very awkward in another. Every one, therefore, should first endeavour to know himself, and manage accordingly. Though in most cases, nature may be much assisted and improved by art and exercise. See Professor Ward's System of Oratory.\n\nOratory, among the Romans, a closet or like apartment near a bed-chamber, furnished with an altar, crucifix, &c., for private devotions.\n\nOrb, in Astronomy, denotes a hollow globe or sphere.\n\nOrb, in tactics, is the disposing of a number of soldiers in circular form of defence. The orb has been thought of consequence enough to employ the attention of the famous Marshal de Puysegur in his Art of War, who prefers this position to throw a body of infantry in an open country, to resist cavalry, or even a superior force of infantry; because it is regular, and equally strong,","sp":443,"ep":446},{"h":"PARTICULAR ELOCUTION","t":"Or that part of Elocution which considers the several Properties and Ornaments of Language, as they are made use of to form different sorts of Style.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of Style, and its different Characters.\n\nThe word style properly signifies the instrument which the ancients used in writing. For as they commonly wrote upon thin boards covered over with wax, and sometimes upon the barks of trees, they made use of a long instrument like a bedkin, pointed at one end, with which they cut their letters; and broad at the other, to erase anything they chose to alter. And this the Latins called stylus. But though this be the first sense of the word, yet afterwards it came to denote the manner of expression. In which sense we likewise use it, by the same kind of trope that we call any one's writing his hand. Style, then, in the common acceptation of the word at present, is the peculiar manner in which a man expresses his conceptions by means of language. It is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind, and of the order in which they are there produced. As to the Elocution, reasons which occasion a variety of style, they are principally these.\n\nSince both speech and writing are only sensible expressions of our thoughts, by which we communicate them to others; as all men think more or less differently, so consequently they in some measure differ in their style. No two persons who were to write upon one subject, would make use of all the same words. And were this possible, yet they would as certainly differ in their order and connection, as two painters, who used the same colours in painting the same picture, would necessarily vary their mixtures and disposition of them, in the several gradations of lights and shades. As every painter therefore has something peculiar in his manner, so has every writer in his style. It is from these internal characters, in a good measure, that critics undertake to discover the true authors of anonymous writings; and to show that others are spurious, and not the genuine productions of those whose names they bear; as they judge of the age of such writings from the words and manner of expression which have been in use at different times. And we may often observe in persons a fondness for some particular words or phrases; and a peculiarity in the turn or connection of their sentences, or in their transitions from one thing to another; by which their style may be known, even when they design to conceal it. For these things, through custom and habit, will sometimes drop from them, notwithstanding the greatest caution to prevent it.\n\nThere is likewise very often a considerable difference in the style of the same person, in several parts of his life. Young persons, whose invention is quick and lively, commonly run into a pompous and luxuriant style. Their fancy represents the images of things to their mind in a gay and sprightly manner, clothed with a variety of circumstances; and while they endeavour to set off each of these in the brightest and most glittering colours, this renders their style verbose and florid, but weakens the force and strength of it. And therefore, as their imagination gradually cools, and comes under the conduct of a more mature judgement, they find it proper to cut off many superfluities; so that by omitting unnecessary words and circumstances, and by a closer connection of things placed in a stronger light, if their style becomes less swelling and pompous, it is, however, more correct and nervous. But as old age sinks the powers of the mind, chills the imagination, and weakens the judgement; the style, too, in proportion usually grows dry and languid. Critics have observed something of this difference in the writings even of Cicero himself. To be master of a good style, therefore, it seems necessary that a person should be endowed with a vigorous mind and lively fancy, a strong memory, and a good judgement. It is by the imagination that the mind conceives the images of things. If the impressions of those images be clear and distinct, the style will be so too; since language is nothing but a copy of those images first conceived by the mind. But if the images are faint and imperfect, the style will accordingly be flat and languid. This is evident from the difference between such objects as are represented to our sight, and things of which we have only read or heard. For as the former generally make a deeper impression upon our minds, so we can describe them in a more strong and lively\nElocution. lively manner. And we commonly find, that according as persons are affected themselves when they speak, they are able to affect others with what they say. Now persons are more or less affected with things in proportion to the impressions which the images of those things make upon the mind. For the same reason also, if the imagination be dull, and indisposed to receive the ideas of things, the style will be stiff and heavy; or if the images are irregular and disordered, the style will likewise be perplexed and confused. When things lie straight (as we say) in the mind, we express them with ease, and in their just connection and dependence; but when they are warped or crooked, we deliver them with pain and difficulty, as well as disorder. A good fancy should likewise be accompanied with a happy memory. This helps us to retain the names of those things the ideas whereof are presented to the mind by the imagination, together with proper and suitable phrases to express them in their several connections and relations to each other. When the images of things offer themselves to the mind, unless the names of them present themselves at the same time, we are at a loss to express them, or at least are in danger of doing it by wrong and improper terms. Besides, variety is necessary in discourse to render it agreeable; and, therefore, without a large furniture of words and phrases, the style will necessarily become infipid and jejune, by the frequent return of the same terms and manner of expression. But to both these solid judgements is highly requisite to form a just and accurate style. A fruitful imagination will furnish the mind with plenty of ideas, and a good memory will help to clothe them in proper language; but unless they are both under the conduct of reason, they are apt to hurry persons into many inconveniences. Such are generally great talkers, but far from good orators. Fresh images continually crowd in upon them, faster than the tongue can well express them. This runs them into long and tedious discourses, abounding with words, but void of sense. Many impertinences, if not improprieties, necessarily mix themselves with what they say; and they are frequently carried off from their point, by not having their fancies under a proper regulation. So that such discourses, though composed perhaps of pretty expressions, rhetorical flowers, and sprightly failles of wit, yet fall very much short of a strong and manly eloquence. But where reason presides and holds the reins, every thing is weighed before it is spoken. The properest words are made choice of, which best suit the ideas they are designed to convey; rather than the most gay and pompous. All things are not said which offer themselves to the mind, and fancy dictates; but such only as are fit and proper, and the rest are dropped. Some things are but slightly mentioned, and others discoursed on more largely and fully, according to their different importance. And every thing is placed in that order, and clothed in such a dress, as may represent it to the greatest advantage. So that, in a word, the foundation of a good style is chiefly good sense. Where these qualities all meet in a considerable degree, such persons have the happiness to excel, either in speaking or writing. But this is not generally the case. Many persons of a vigorous and sprightly imagination, have but a weak judgment; and others much more judicious can think but slowly. And it is this, in a great measure, which makes the difference between speaking and writing well, as one or the other of these qualities is predominant. A person of a lively fancy, ready wit, and voluble tongue, will deliver himself off-hand much better and more acceptably, than one who is capable, upon due premeditation, to discern farther into the subject, but cannot command his thoughts with the same ease and freedom. And this latter would have the same advantage of the other, were they both coolly to offer their sentiments in writing. Many things appear well in speaking, which will not bear a strict scrutiny. While the hearer's attention is obliged to keep pace with the speaker, he is not at leisure to observe every impropriety or incoherence, but many slips easily escape him, which in reading are plentifully discovered. Hence it is often found, that discourses, which were thought very fine when heard, appear to have much less beauty, as well as strength, when they come to be read. And therefore it is not without reason, that Cicero recommends to all those who are candidates for eloquence, and desirous to become masters of a good style, to write much. This affords them an opportunity to digest their thoughts, weigh their words and expressions, and give every thing its proper force and evidence; as likewise, by reviewing a discourse when composed, to correct its errors, or supply its defects; till by practice they gain a readiness both to think justly, and to speak with propriety and eloquence. But it is time to proceed to some other causes of the diversity of style.\n\nDifferent countries have not only a different language, but likewise a peculiarity of style suited to their temper and genius. The eastern nations had a lofty and majestic way of speaking. Their words are full and sonorous, their expressions strong and forcible, and warmed with the most lively and moving figures. This is very evident from the Jewish writings in the Old Testament, in which we find a most agreeable mixture of simplicity and dignity. On the contrary, the style of the more northern languages generally partakes of the chillness of their climate. \"There is (says Mr Addison*) a certain * Spec. coldness and indifference in the phras\u00e9s of our European No. 495 languages, when they are compared with the oriental forms of speech. And it happens very luckily, that the Hebrew idioms run into the English tongue with a peculiar grace and beauty. Our language has received innumerable elegancies and improvements from that infusion of Hebraisms, which are derived to it out of the poetical palliages in holy writ. They give a force and energy to our expressions, warm and animate our language, and convey our thoughts in more ardent and intense phrases than any that are to be met with in our own tongue. There is something so pathetic in this kind of diction, that it often sets the mind in a flame, and makes our hearts burn within us.\"\n\nAgain, people of different nations vary in their customs and manners, which occasions a diversity in their style. This was very remarkable in the Attics, Asiatics, and Rhodians, and is often taken notice of by ancient writers. The Athenians, while they continued a free state, were an active, industrious, and frugal people: very polite indeed, and cultivated arts and sciences beyond any other nation: but as they had powerful enemies, and were exceedingly jealous of their liberties, this preserved them from wantonness and luxury. And their way of speaking was agreeable to their conduct; accurate and close, but very full and expressive.\nThe Asiatics, on the other hand, were more gay, and loose in their manners, devoted to luxury and pleasure; and accordingly they affected a florid and swelling style, filled with redundancies and superfluities of expression. Indeed some of the ancients have attributed this looseness of style to their way of pursuing eloquence at first. For as they were put upon it by conversing with the Greek colonies who settled among them, they suppose, that, inimitating them, before they were masters of the language, they were often obliged to make use of circumlocutions, which afterwards became habitual, and very much weakened the force of their expressions, as it naturally would do. But one would think, if they were put to this necessity at first, when they found its ill effect, they might easily have amended it afterwards, as they grew better acquainted with the Greek language, had they been inclined so to do. The Rhodian style was a medium between the other two; not so concise and expressive as the Attic, nor yet so loose and redundant as the Asiatic. Quintilian says, it had a mixture of its author, and the humour of the people; and like plants set in a foreign soil, degenerated from the Attic purity, but not to wholly as to lose it. The first received it from \u00c6chines, who being worsted in his famous contest with Demosthenes, retired thither, and taught rhetoric, which put them upon the study of eloquence.\n\nThe style of the same country likewise very much alters in different ages. Cicero tells us, that the first Latin historians aimed at nothing more than barely to make themselves intelligible, and that with as much brevity as they could. Those who succeeded them advanced a step farther; and gave somewhat a better turn and cadency to their sentences, though still without any drefs or ornament. But afterwards, when the Greek language became fashionable at Rome, by copying after their writers, such as Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and others, they endeavoured to introduce all their beauties into their own tongue, which in Cicero's time was brought to its highest perfection. But it did not long continue in that state. A degeneracy of manners soon altered their taste, and corrupted their language, which Quintilian very much complains of in his time. The case was the same with respect to the Greek tongue; though that had the good fortune to continue its purity much longer than the Latin. Nor can any language be exempt from the common fate of all human productions; which have their beginning, perfection, and decay. Besides, there is a sort of fashion in language, as well as other things; and the generality of people are always fond of running into the mode. Perhaps some one, or a few persons, fall into a manner, which happens to please. This gives them a reputation; and others immediately copy after them, till it generally prevail. Cicero tells us, that the most ancient Greek orators whose writings were extant in his time, such as Pericles, Alcibiades, and others, were subtle, acute, concise, and abounded in sense rather than words. But another set that followed them, of which were Critias, Theramenes, and Lyrias, retained the good sense of the former, and at the same time took more care of their style; not leaving it so bare as the former had done, but furnishing it with a better drefs. After these came Hocrates, who added all the flowers and beauties of eloquence. And as he had abundance of followers, they applied these ornaments and decorations according to their different genius; some for pomp and splendour; and others to invigorate their style, and give it the greater force and energy. And in this latter way Demosthenes principally excelled. Now as each of these manners had its peculiar beauties, and generally prevailed in different ages, Cicero thinks this could not have happened otherwise than from imitation. And he attributes it to the same cause, that afterwards they sunk into a softer and smoother manner, not less exact and florid, but more cold and lifeless. If we take a view of our own tongue, Chaucer seems to have been the first who made any considerable attempts to cultivate it. And whoever looks into his writings, will perceive the difference to be so great from what it is at present, that it scarce appears to be the same language. The gradual improvements it has since received, are very evident in the writers almost of every succeeding age since that time; and how much farther it may still be carried, time only can discover. See Language paffion; For the English language in particular, see n\u00b0 35; for the other European languages, as well as the Greek and Latin, see n\u00b0 27, &c.\n\nAnother cause of the variety of style arises from the different nature and properties of language. A difference in the letters, the make of the words, and the order of them, do all affect the style. So Quintilian observes, that the Latin tongue cannot equal the Greek in pronunciation, because it is harsher. The Latins want two of the softest Greek letters, \u03c5 and \u03be; and use others of a very hard sound, which the Greeks have not, as f and q. Again, many Latin words end in m; a letter of a broad and hollow sound, which never terminates any Greek word; but v does frequently, whose sound is much softer and sweeter. Besides, in the combination of syllables the letters b and d are often so situated, as to require too strong and unequal a force to be laid upon them, as in the words obviefus and adyungo. Another advantage of the Greek tongue arises from the variety and different feet of the accents; for the Greeks often accent the last syllable, which both enlivens the pronunciation, and renders it more musical; whereas the Latins never do this. But the greatest advantage of the Greeks lies in their plenty and variety of words; for which reason they have less occasion for tropes or circumlocutions, which, when used from necessity, have generally less force, and weaken the style. But under these disadvantages, Quintilian seems to give his countrymen the best advice the case will admit of: That what they cannot do in words, they should make up in sense. If their expressions are not so soft and tender, they should exceed in strength; if they are less subtile, they should be more sublime; and if they have fewer proper words, they should excel in the beauty as well as number of their figures. If this account of Quintilian be just, that the Greek tongue does surpass the Latin in all these instances, it is certain that both of them have much greater advantages over some modern languages. The varying all their declinable words, both nouns and verbs, by terminations, and not by signs, contributes very much to the smoothness and harmony of their periods. Whereas in the modern languages, those small particles and pronouns which distinguish the cases of nouns and the tenues and persons of verbs, hinder the run of a period,\nElocution and render the sound much more rough and uneven. Besides, the ancient languages seem to have a better and more equal mixture of vowels and consonants, which makes their pronunciation more easy and musical.\n\nBut the chief distinction of style arises from the different subjects or matter of discourse. The same way of speaking no more suits all subjects, than the same garment would all persons. A prince and a peasant ought not to have the same dress; and another different from both becomes those of a middle station in life. The style therefore should always be adapted to the nature of the subject, which rhetoricians have reduced to three ranks or degrees; the low or plain style, the middle or temperate, and the lofty or sublime: Which are likewise called characters; because they denote the quality of the subject upon which they treat. This division of style into three characters, was taken notice of very early by ancient writers. Some have observed it even in Homer, who seems to assign the sublime or magnificent to Ulysses, when he represents him as so copious and vehement an orator, that his words came from him like winter snow. On the contrary, he describes Menelaus as a polite speaker, but concise and moderate. And when he mentions Nestor, he represents his manner as between these two, not so high and lofty as the one, nor yet so low and depressed as the other; but smooth, even, and pleasant, or, as he expresses it, more sweet than honey. Quintilian observes, that although accuracy and politeness were general characters of the Attic writers; yet among their orators, Lytias excelled in the low and familiar way; Ifocrates for his elegance, smoothness, and the fine turn of his periods; and Demosthenes for his flame and rapidity, by which he carried all before him. And Gellius tells us, that the like difference was found in the three philosophers who were sent from the Athenians to Rome (before the Romans had any relish for the polite arts) to solicit the remittance of a fine laid upon them for an injury done to a neighbouring state. Carneades, one of those ambassadors, was vehement and rapid in his harangues; Critolaus, neat and smooth; and Diogenes, modest and sober. The eloquence of these orators, and the agreeable variety of their different manner, so captivated the Roman youth, and inflamed them with a love of the Grecian arts, that old Cato, who did all he could to check it by hurrying away the ambassadors, could not prevent their vigorous pursuit of them, till the study became in a manner universal. And the old gentleman afterwards learned the Greek language himself, when it became more fashionable. Which a noble writer of ours* represents as a punishment upon him for his former crime. It seldom happens that the same person excels in each of these characters. They seem to require a different genius, and most people are naturally led to one of them more than another: though all of them are requisite for an orator upon different occasions, as we shall show hereafter.\n\n**Lord Bacon.**\n\nThe low style considered both as to thoughts and language.\n\n**Chap. V. Of the Low Style.**\n\nThis we shall consider under two heads, thoughts and language; in each of which the several characters are distinguished from one another.\n\nI. And with respect to the former, as the subjects proper for this style are either common things, or such as should be treated in a plain and familiar way; so Elocution, plain thoughts are most suitable to it, and distinguish it from the other characters.\n\nNow, by plain thoughts, are meant such as are simple and obvious, and seem to rise naturally from the subject, when duly considered; so that any one, upon first hearing them, would be apt to imagine they must have occurred to himself. Not that this is really the case, but because the more natural a thing is, the more easy it seems to be; though in reality it is often otherwise; and the perfection of art lies in its nearest resemblance to nature. And therefore, in order to speak plainly and clearly upon any subject, it must first be duly considered, well understood, and thoroughly digested in the mind; which, though it require labour and study, yet the more a person is master of what he says, the less that labour will appear in his discourse. This natural plainness and simplicity, without any disguise or affectation, very much contributes to give credit to what is said. Nor is anything more apt to impose on us, than the appearance of this, when artfully assumed. Cicero's account of the fight between Milo and Clodius, in which Clodius was killed, is a remarkable instance of this. \"When Clodius knew (says he) that Milo was obliged to go to Lanuvium upon a solemn and necessary occasion, he immediately hastened from Rome, the day before, to affright him before Clodius's own house, as appeared afterwards by the event. And this he did at a time, when his turbulent mob in the city wanted his assistance; whom he would not have left but for the advantage of that place and season to execute his wicked design. But the next day Milo was in the senate, where he continued till they broke up; then went home; changed his dress; laid there some time till his wife was ready; and afterwards set forward so late, that if Clodius had designed to return to Rome that day, he might have been here by that time. Clodius, prepared for his design, met him on horseback, having no chariot, no equipage, no Greek attendants as usual; and without his wife, which was scarcely ever known: whereas Milo was in a chariot with his wife, wrapped up in a cloak, and attended by a large retinue of maid servants, pages, and other persons unfit for an engagement. He met with Clodius before his house, about five o'clock in the evening; and was presently assaulted from a higher ground by many armed men, who killed the coachman. Upon which, Milo, throwing off his cloak, leaped out of the chariot, and bravely defended himself; and those who were with Clodius, having their swords drawn, some made up to the chariot to attack Milo; and others, who now thought he had been killed, began to fall upon his servants who were behind. And of these, such as had courage, and were faithful to their master, some were killed; and others when they saw the skirmish at the chariot, and could do their master no service (for they heard Clodius himself say that Milo was killed, and really thought it was so), did that, not by their master's order, nor with his knowledge, nor when he was present, which every one would have his own servants to do in the like circumstances. I do not say this to fix any crime upon them, but only to relate what happened.\" His meaning is, they killed Clodius; which he avoids mentioning, to render what he says less offensive. Can anything be told in a more plain and simple manner than this? Here is nothing said, but\nElocution what in itself seems highly probable, and what one would imagine the fact might easily suggest to any ordinary spectator. But in this, both the art and skill of it consist. For in the whole account, as, on the one hand, Milo is so described as to render it highly improbable he could have any design at that time against Clodius; so on the other, no one circumstance is omitted which might seem proper to persuade the hearers that Clodius was the aggressor in that engagement. And yet, if we may believe Aelius, the quarrel was begun by some of Milo's retinue, and Clodius was afterwards killed by his express order. But as things are sometimes best illustrated by their opposites, we shall here produce a contrary instance of a very affected and unnatural way of relating a fact. Val. Maximus tells us of a learned man at Athens, who, by a blow which he received by a stone upon his head, entirely forgot all his learning, though he continued to remember everything else. And therefore, as he says, since this misfortune deprived him of the greatest enjoyment of his life, it had been happier for him never to have been learned, than afterwards to lose that pleasure. This is the plain sense of the story. But now let us hear him relate it, \"A man (says he) of great learning at Athens, having received a blow upon his head by a stone, retained the memory of all other things very perfectly, and only forgot his learning, to which he had chiefly devoted himself. The direful and malignant wound invading his mind, and as it were designedly surveying the knowledge repose there, cruelly seized on that part of it in particular from which he received the greatest pleasure, and buried the singular learning of the man with an invidious funeral. Who since he was not permitted to enjoy his studies, had better never have obtained access to them, than afterwards to have been deprived of the delight they afforded him.\" What an unnatural way is this of relating such an accident, to talk of a wound invading the mind, and surveying the knowledge repose there, and cruelly seizing a particular part of it, and burying it with an invidious funeral? There is nothing in the story could lead him to this, but an over-fondness to refine upon it in a very affected manner. But there are two proprieties of plain thoughts, one of which ought constantly to attend them in common with all thoughts, and the other is often necessary to animate and enliven this character.\n\nThe former of these is justness and propriety, which is what reason dictates in all cases. What Cicero says of the death of Craffus the orator, seems very just, as well as natural. \"It was (says he) an affliction to his friends, a loss to his country, and a concern to all good men; but such public calamities followed upon it, that heaven seemed rather to have favoured him with death, than to have deprived him of life.\" This thought seems very just, and agreeable to the sentiments of a good man, as Craffus was; to choose death rather than to outlive the happiness of his country, to which he himself had so much contributed. Quintilian has a reflection upon a like occasion, which is not to just and becoming. It is upon the death of his only son, a youth of very uncommon parts, as he represents him; and for whose sake he had dignified his Institutions of oratory; but he died before they were finished. The passage is this: \"I have lost him of whom I had formed the greatest hopes, and in whom I had repose the greatest comfort of my old age. What can I do now? or of what further use can I think myself to be, thus disappointed by heaven? What good parent will pardon me, if I can any longer study, and not condemn such resolution, if, thus surviving all my family, I can make any other use of my voice, than to accuse the gods, and declare that providence does not govern the world?\" Allowance may be made for the follies of persons, even in wise men, upon some shocking occasions; but when it proceeds to such a degree as to become impious, it is very indecent, as well as unjust. And all indecency is unnatural, as it is disagreeable to reason, which always directs to a decorum. That seems to be a very natural as well as just thought of Pliny the Younger, when he says, \"The death of those persons always appears to me too heavy and unseasonable, who are preparing some lasting work. For persons wholly devoted to pleasures, live, as it were, from day to day, and daily finish the end for which they live; but those who have a view to posterity, and preserve their memory by their labours, always die unluckily, because they leave something unfinished.\"\n\nWe shall mention but one more instance; and that in a comparative view, to make it the more evident. The two sons of Junius Brutus, the first Roman consul, having been convicted of treason, in associating with Tarquinius' party, were ordered, among others, to be put to death; and their father not only pronounced the sentence, but prefixed at the execution. This fact is mentioned by several of the Roman historians; and, as it carries in it not only the appearance of rigorous justice, but likewise of cruelty in Brutus, to have been present at the execution of his sons, they endeavour to vindicate him different ways. What Florus says seems rather an affectation of wit, than a just defence of the fact. \"He beheaded them (says he), that being a public parent, he might appear to have adopted the whole body of the people.\" Nor does Val. Maximus come up to the case, who says, \"He put off the father to act the consul; and chose rather to lose the sons, than be wanting to public justice.\" This might be a reason for condemning them; and would have been equally true, had he not been present at their execution. But Livy, whose thoughts are generally very just and natural, affirms the best reason which perhaps can be given for his vindication, when he says, \"Fortune made him the executioner of the sentence, who ought not to have been a spectator.\" By saying fortune made him so, he represents it not as a matter of choice, like the other historians, but of necessity, from the nature of his office, which then obliged him to see the execution of that sentence he had himself before pronounced; as is the custom at present, in some popular governments.\n\nThe other property, which should often accompany plain and simple thoughts, is, that they be gay and sprightly. This, as has been said, is necessary to animate and enliven such discourses as require the low style. The fewer ornaments it admits of, the greater spirit and vivacity is requisite to prevent its being dry and jejune. A thought may be very brisk and lively, and at the same time appear very natural, as the effect of a ready and flowing wit. Such thoughts, attended with agreeable turns, are very suitable to this style; but care should be taken, lest, while fancy is too much indulged, the justness of them be overlooked. We shall give one instance, in which this seems to have been the case,\nElocution, case, from a celebrated English work, where the ingenious writer endeavours to show the disadvantages of persons not attending to their natural genius, but affecting to imitate others in those things for which they were not formed. \"The great misfortune (says he) of this affectation is, that men not only lose a good quality, but also contract a bad one; they not only are unfit for what they are designed, but they affix themselves to what they are unfit for; and instead of making a very good figure one way, make a very ridiculous one another. Could the world be reformed to the obedience of that famed dictate, Follow nature, which the oracle of Delphos pronounced to Cicero when he consulted what course of studies he should pursue, we should see almost every man as eminent in his proper sphere as Tully was in his. For my part, I could never consider this preposterous repugnancy to nature any other-wise, than not only as the greatest folly, but also one of the most heinous crimes; since it is a direct opposition to the disposition of providence, and (as Tully expresses it) like the sin of the giants, an actual rebellion against heaven.\" The advantages that arise from persons attending to their own genius, and pursuing its dictates, are here represented in a very lively and agreeable manner. But there is one thing affected, which we fear will not hold; which is, that, Could the world be re-formed to that dictate, \"Follow Nature,\" we should see almost every man as eminent in his proper sphere as Tully was in his. For though doubtless persons would generally succeed best if they kept to this rule; yet different degrees of ability are often found, where the bias and inclination is the same, and that accompanied with equal labour and diligence. If this was not so, how happened it that no one came up to Tully in the art of oratory; especially in his own age, when there were the greatest opportunities for that study, and the highest encouragements were given to it, as it paved the way to riches, honours, and all the grand offices of the state? It cannot well be questioned but that there were other gentlemen, who had all the same advantages, accompanied with as strong a passion for this art, as Tully had, who yet fell much short of him in point of success. And experience shows, that the case has been the same in all other pursuits.\n\nIII. But it is time to proceed to the other head, the language proper for this style. And here it may be observed in general, that the dyes ought to be agreeable to the thoughts, plain, simple, and unaffected.\n\nBut the first thing that comes under consideration is elegance, or a proper choice of words and expressions; which ought always to suit the idea they are designed to convey. And therefore when an ancient writer, speaking of cruelty, calls it navus crudelitatis, the blemish of cruelty; and another, applying the same word to ingratitude, says navus ingratiitudinis, the blemish of ingratitude; that term does not sufficiently convey to us the odious nature of either of those vices, as indeed it was not their design it should. But otherwise, where the speaker has not some particular view in doing it, to flatter too low is as much a fault as to rise too high. So to call ancient Rome the mistress of Italy, would as much lessen the just notion of the extent of her power, as the Roman writers aggrandise it when they style her mistress of the world. But purity, both in the choice of words and expressions, is never more necessary than Elocution is here. This may be called neatness in language. And to be plain and neat at the same time, is not only very consistent, but the former can no other way recommend itself, than as joined with the latter. Besides, the fewer advantages anything has to set it off, the more carefully they ought to be observed. Periphrasis is always to be regarded; and serves very much to keep up the attention, where other ornaments are wanting. Epithets should be sparingly used, since they enlarge the images of things, and contribute very much to heighten the style. Indeed they are sometimes necessary to set a thing in its just light; and then they should not be dropped. Thus, in speaking of Xerxes, it would be too low and flat to say, He descended with his army into Greece. Here is no intimation given of their vast and unparalleled numbers, which ought to be done. Herodotus says, his whole army, of sea and land forces, amounted to 2,317,000 and upwards. Therefore, unless the number be mentioned, the least that can be said is, that he descended with a vast army.\n\nThe next thing to be regarded is composition, which here does not require the greatest accuracy and exactness. A seeming negligence is sometimes a beauty in this style, as it appears more natural. Short sentences, or those of a moderate length, are likewise upon the whole best suited to this character. Long and accurate periods, finely wrought up with a gradual rise, harmonious numbers, a due proportion of the several parts, and a just cadency, are therefore improper, as they are plainly the effect of art. But yet some proportion should be observed in the members, that neither the ears be too much deceived, nor the sense obscured. Of this kind is that expression of a Greek orator, blamed by Demetrius: Ceres came readily to our assistance, but Ariadne did not. The latter member of this sentence is too short; and by dropping so suddenly, both disappoints the ears, and is somewhat obscure. It would have been plainer and more agreeable thus, but Ariadne did not come. As to order, the plainest and clearest disposition, both of the words and members of sentences, and what is most agreeable to the natural construction, best suits with this character. For one of its principal beauties is perspicuity. And a proper connection likewise of sentences, with a regular order in the dependence of things one upon another, very much contributes to this end. With regard to the collision of syllables in different words, for preventing either a hollowness or asperity of sound, greater liberty may be taken in this style than in the other characters. Here it may be allowed to say, Virtue is amiable to all, though all do not pursue it. But in a higher character, perhaps, in order to prevent the hollow sound of the words though all, a person would choose to vary the expression a little, and say, though few pursue it. So, Xerxes' expedition, may be tolerable here; but in the florid style, the expedition of Xerxes would found much better.\n\nThe last thing to be considered, with respect to the language, is dignity, or the use of tropes and figures. And as to tropes, they ought to be used cautiously; unless such as are very common, and by time have either come into the place of proper words, or at least are equally plain and clear. So in the instance mentioned above, Diodorus Siculus, speaking of the forces of Xerxes, calls them an innumerable company. Where,\nby a syneddoche, he has chosen to make use of an uncertain number for a certain, as less liable perhaps to exception. Other examples might be given if necessary.\n\nAnd with regard to figures, as most of those which consist in words, and are therefore called verbal figures, serve chiefly to enliven an expression, and give an agreeable turn, they are often not improper for this character. Nor are figures of sentences wholly to be excluded, especially such as are chiefly used in reasoning or demonstration. But those which are more peculiarly adapted to touch the passions, or paint things in the strongest colours, are the more proper ornaments of the higher styles, as will be thrown hereafter.\n\nUpon the whole, therefore, pure nature, without any colouring, or appearance of art, is the distinguishing mark of the low style. The design of it is to make things plain and intelligible, and to set them in an easy light. And therefore the proper subjects of it are epistles, dialogues, philosophical dissertations, or any other discourses, that ought to be treated in a plain and familiar manner, without much ornament, or address to the passions. A freedom and ease both of thought and expression, attended with an agreeable humour and pleasantry, are its peculiar beauties that engage us. As we see persons of fashion and good breeding, though in the plainest habit, have yet something in their air and manner of behaviour that is very taking and amiable. Somewhat of the like nature attends this style. It has its difficulties, which are not so easily discerned but from experience. For it requires no small skill to treat a common subject in such a manner as to make it entertaining. The fewer ornaments it admits of, the greater art is necessary to attain this end. Lofty subjects often engage and captivate the mind by the sublimity of the ideas. And the florid style calls in all the affluence of language and eloquence. But the plain style is in a great measure stripped of those advantages; and has little more to recommend it, than its own native beauty and simplicity.\n\n**CHAP. VI. Of the Middle Style.**\n\nThis we shall treat in the same manner as we did the former, by considering first the matter, and then the language proper for it.\n\nI. And as the subjects proper for this style are things of weight and importance, which require both a gravity and accuracy of expression; so fine thoughts are its distinguishing mark, as plain thoughts are of the low character, and lofty thoughts of the sublime. Now a fine thought may deserve that character from some or other of the following properties.\n\nAnd the first property we shall mention is gravity and dignity. Thus Cicero in a speech to Caesar, says, \"It has been often told me, that you have frequently said, you have lived long enough for yourself. I believe it, if you either lived, or was born for yourself only.\" Nothing could either be more fit and proper, than this was, when it was spoken; or at the same time a finer compliment upon Caesar. For the civil war was now over, and the whole power of the Roman government in the hands of Caesar; so that he might venture to say he had lived long enough for himself, there being no higher pitch of glory to which his ambition could aspire. But then there were many things in the state that wanted redressing, after those times of disorder and confusion, which he had not yet been able to effect, and of which Cicero here takes an opportunity to remind him. We shall produce another example from Curtius. Philotas, one of Alexander's captains, having formed a conspiracy against him, was convicted of it, and put to death. Amintas, who was suspected of the same crime, by reason of his great intimacy with Philotas, when he comes to make his defence, among other things speaks thus: \"I am so far from denying my intimacy with Philotas, that I own I courted his friendship. Do you wonder that we showed a regard to the son of Parmenio, whom you would have to be next to yourself, giving him the preference to all your other friends? You, Sir, if I may be allowed to speak the truth, have brought me into this danger. For to whom else is it owing, that those who endeavoured to please you, addressed themselves to Philotas? By his recommendation we have been raised to this share of your friendship. Such was his interest with you, that you courted his favour, and feared his displeasure. Did we not all in a manner engage ourselves by oath, to have the same friends, and the same enemies, which you had? Should we have refused to take this, which you as it were proposed to us? Therefore, if this be a crime, you have few innocent persons about you; nay, indeed none. For all desired to be the friends of Philotas; though all could not be so who desired it. Therefore, if you make no difference between his friends and accomplices, neither ought you to make any between those who desired to be his friends, and those who really were so.\" Could anything be finer spoken, more proper, and becoming the character of a soldier, than this defence; especially to a prince of so great and generous a spirit as Alexander? There is something which appears like this in Tacitus with relation to the emperor Tiberius, but falls vastly short of it in the justness and dignity of the sentiment. Sejanus, his great favourite, and partner in his crimes, falling under his displeasure, was, like Philotas, put to death for a conspiracy. Now a Roman knight, who apprehended himself in danger on account of his friendship with Sejanus, thus apologizes for himself to the emperor, in the manner of Amintas: \"It is not for us to examine the merit of a person whom you raise above others, nor your reasons for doing it. The gods have given you the sovereign power of all things, to us the glory of obeying. Let conspiracies formed against the state, or the life of the emperor, be punished; but as to friendships and private regards, the same reason that justifies you, Caesar, renders us innocent.\" The turn of the expressions is not much different from that in the case of Amintas; but the beauty of the thought is spoiled by the flattery of complimenting Tiberius upon an excess of power, which he employed to the destruction of many excellent men. There is not that impropriety in the defence of Amintas, which is equally brave and just.\n\nAnother property of a fine thought is beauty\u2014and elegance. It is a fine compliment which Pliny pays to the emperor Trajan, when he says, \"It has happened to you alone, that you was father of your country, before you was made so.\" Some of the Roman emperors had been complimented with the title of father of their country, who little deserved it. But Trajan had a long time refused it, though he was really so, both by his good\ngood government, and in the esteem of his subjects, before he thought fit to accept of it. And Pliny, among other instances of the generosity of that prince, which he mentions in the same discourse, speaking of the liberty that he gave the Romans to purchase estates which had belonged to the emperors, and the peaceable possession they had of them, does it by a turn of thought no less beautiful than the former. \"Such (says he) is the prince's bounty, such the security of the times, that he thinks us worthy to enjoy what has been possessed by emperors; and we are not afraid to be thought so.\" There is a frightfulness in this image, which gives it a beauty; as there is likewise in the following passage of the same discourse, where he says to Trajan, \"Your life is displeasing to you, if it be not joined with the public safety; and you suffer us to wish you nothing but what is for the good of those who with it.\" And of the same kind is that of Cicero to Caesar, when he says, \"You, Caesar, are wont to forget nothing but injuries.\" It is a very handsome, as well as just reflection, made by Tacitus upon Galba's government, that \"He seemed too great for a private man, while he was but a private man; and all would have thought him worthy of the empire, had he never been emperor.\" The beauty of a thought may give us delight, though the subject be sorrowful; and the images of things in themselves unpleasant may be so represented as to become agreeable. Sisygambis, the mother of Darius, after the death of her son, had been treated by Alexander with the greatest regard and tenderness, in whole power she then was. So soon as she heard therefore that he was dead, she grew weary of life, and could not bear to outlive him. Upon which Q. Curtius makes this fine reflection: \"Though she had courage to survive Darius, yet she was ashamed to outlive Alexander.\"\n\nThe next property of a fine thought, which we shall mention, is delicacy. As, in the objects of our senses, those things are said to be delicate which affect us gradually in a soft and agreeable manner; so a delicate thought is that which is not wholly discovered at once, but by degrees opening and unfolding itself to the mind, discloses more than was at first perceived. Quintilian seems to refer to this, when he says, \"Those things are grateful to the hearers, which, when they apprehend, they are delighted with their own sagacity; and please themselves, as though they had not heard, but discovered them.\" Such thoughts are not unlike the sketches of some pictures, which let us into the design of the artist, and help us to discern more than the lines themselves express. Of this kind is that of Sallust: \"In the greatest fortunes, there is the least liberty.\" This is not often so in fact, but ought to be; both to guard against an abuse of power, and to prevent the effects of a bad example to inferiors. Pliny, speaking of the emperor Trajan's entry into Rome, says, \"Some declared, upon seeing you, they had lived long enough; others, that now they were more desirous to live.\" The compliment is fine either way, since both must esteem the sight of him the greatest happiness in life; and in that comeliness lies the delicacy of the thought. It was a fine character given of Grotius, when very young, on the account of his surprizing genius and uncommon proficiency in learning, that he was born a man: As if nature, at his coming into the world, had at once furnished him with those endowments which others gradually acquire by study and application.\n\nThe last property of a fine thought, which we shall take notice of, is novelty. Mankind is naturally pleased with new things; and when at the same time they are set in an agreeable light, this very much heightens the pleasure. Indeed there are few subjects, but what have been so often considered, that it is not to be expected they should afford many thoughts entirely new; but the same thought set in a different light, or applied to a different occasion, has in some degree a claim of novelty. And even where a thing hath been so well said already, that it cannot easily be mended, the revival of a fine thought often affords a pleasure and entertainment to the mind, though it can have no longer the claim of novelty. Cicero, in his treatise of an orator, among several other encomiums which he there gives to Craufus, says of him, \"Craufus always excelled every other person, but that day he excelled himself.\" He means as an orator. But elsewhere he applies the same thought to Caesar, upon another account; and with some addition to it. \"You had (says he) before conquered all other conquerors by your equity and clemency, but to-day you have conquered yourself; you seem to have vanquished even victory herself, therefore you alone are truly invincible. This thought, with a little variation of the phrase, has since appeared in several later writers; and it is now grown common to say of a person, who excels in any way, upon his doing better than he did before, that he has outdone himself. The like has happened to another thought, which, with a little alteration, has been variously applied. It was said by Varro, That if the Muses were to talk Latin, they would talk like Plautus. The younger Pliny, applying this compliment to a friend of his, says, His letters are so finely written, that you would think the Muses themselves talked Latin. And Cicero tells us, It was said by Xenophon, that the Muses themselves seemed to speak Greek with his voice. And elsewhere, that Philosophers say, if Jupiter speaks Greek, he must speak like Plato. The thought is much the same in all these instances, and has been since revived by some modern writers.\n\nII. We shall now consider the language proper for the middle style. And in general it may be observed, that the language of the middle style, though not of that exalted nature as wholly to captivate the mind, and divert it from attending to the diction, so all the ornaments of speech, and beauties of eloquence, have place here.\n\nAnd first with regard to elegance, it is plain that a different choice of words makes a very great difference in the style, where the sense is the same. Sometimes one single word adds a grace and weight to an expression, which, if removed, the sense becomes flat and lifeless. Now such words as are most full and expressive suit best with his character. Epithets also, which are proper and well chosen, serve very much to beautify and enliven it, as they enlarge the ideas of things, and set them in a fuller light.\n\nThe most accurate composition, in all the parts of it, has place here. Periods, the most beautiful and harmonious, of a due length, and wrought up with the most exact order, just cadency, easy and smooth connection.\ntion of the words, and flowing numbers, are the genuine\nornaments, which greatly contribute to form this char-\nacter.\n\nBut the principal distinction of style arises from\ntropes and figures. By these it is chiefly animated and\nraised to its different degrees or characters, as it receives\na lesser or greater number of them; and those either\nmore mild, or strong and powerful.\n\nAs to tropes, those which afford the most lively and\npleasing ideas, especially metaphors, suit the middle char-\nacter. It is a pretty remark, which has been made by\nsome critics upon two verses of Virgil; one in his\nEclogues, and the other in his Georgics. The former\nof these works is for the most part written in the low\nstyle, as the language of shepherds ought to be; but the\nlatter in the middle style, suitable to the nature of the\nsubject, and the persons for whom it was designed, the\ngreatest men in Rome not thinking it below them to\nentertain themselves with rural affairs. Now in the\nEclogue, as some copies read the verse, the shepherd,\ncomplaining of the barrenness of his land, says,\n\n*Infelix lolum et steriles nafcuntur avenae.*\n\nIn English thus:\n\nWild oats and darnel grow instead of corn.\n\nBut in the Georgic, where the same sense is intended,\ninstead of the proper word *nafcuntur*, grow, the au-\nthor substitutes a metaphor, *dominantur*, command, and\nsays,\n\n*Infelix lolum et steriles dominantur avenae.*\n\nThat is in English;\n\nWhere corn is sown, darnel and oats command.\n\nIt was fit and natural for the shepherd to express his\nsense in the plainest terms; and it would have been\nwrong to represent him going so far out of his way, as\nto fetch a metaphor from government, in talking upon\nhis own affairs. But in the Georgic, where the poet\nspeaks in his own person, the metaphor is much more\nbeautiful, and agreeable to the dignity of the work.\nThis instance may show in some measure how the style\nis heightened by tropes, and the same thought may be\naccommodated to the several characters of style by the\ndifferent manner of expression.\n\nThe like may also be said of figures either of words\nor sentences, in reference to this character; which ad-\nmits of the finest descriptions, most lively images, and\nbrightest figures, that serve either for delight, or to in-\nfluence the passions without transport or ecstasy, which\nis the property of the sublime. This is indeed the pro-\nper seat of such embellishments, which support and\nmake up a principal part of the middle or florid style.\nHaving treated largely upon these in several preceding\nchapters, we shall here only briefly mention some of the\nmost considerable.\n\nDescriptions are not only a great ornament to a dif-\nferent course, but represent things in a very lively and agree-\nable manner. In what a beautiful light has Cicero pla-\nced the polite arts and sciences, when, describing them\nfrom their effects, he thus represents to us the great ad-\nvantages, as well as pleasure, which they afford to the\nmind? \"Other studies neither suit with all times, nor\nall ages, nor all places: but these improve youth, de-\n\nlight old age, adorn properly, afford a refuge and so-\nlace in adversity; please at home, are no hinderance\nabroad; sleep, travel, and retire, with us.\" And they\noften affect us very powerfully, when they are addressed\nto the senses. Quintilian has painted the calamities of\na city taken by storm in the brightest and strongest col-\nours, which he represents by \"Flames spreading them-\nselves over the houses and temples, the cracking of fall-\ning buildings, and a confused noise from a variety of\ncries and shouts; some running they know not where,\nothers in the last embraces of their friends, the shrieks\nof children, women, and old men unhappily referred to\nsuch distress; the plundering of all places civil and fa-\ncred, the hurry and confusion in carrying off the booty,\ncaptives driven before their victors, mothers endeavour-\ning to guard their infants, and quarrels among the con-\nquerors where the plunder is largest.\" This seems to\nbe a very natural, as well as moving, image of so dread-\nful a calamity.\n\nPropositions are another very strong and beautiful fig-\nure, very proper for this character. Seneca has a fine piece well\ninflamed of it in his \"Consolatory Letter to Marcia,\" fitted for\nthis character.\n\nUpon the death of her son. After many arguments he\nhad made use of to alleviate her grief, he at last intro-\nduces her father, Cremutius Cordus, as thus addressing\nto her: \"Imagine your father (says he) from the ce-\nlestial regions, speaking to you in this manner: Daugh-\nter, why do you so long indulge your grief? why are\nyou so ignorant, as to think it unhappy for your son,\nthat, weary of life, he has withdrawn himself to his an-\ncestors? Are you not sensible what disorders fortune oc-\ncasion everywhere? and that the is kindled to those\nwho have least concern with her? Need I mention to\nyou princes who had been extremely happy, had a more\ntimely death secured them from impending evils? or\nRoman generals, who wanted nothing to consummate\ntheir glory but that they lived too long? Why then is\nhe bewailed longest in our family who died most happily?\nThere is nothing, as you imagine, desirable among\nyou, nothing great, nothing noble; but, on the con-\ntrary, all things are mean, full of trouble and anxiety,\nand partake very little of the light which we enjoy.\"\n\nThis advice was very suitable for a philosopher; and he\nseems to have chosen this way of introducing it, to en-\nforce the argument drawn from the happiness of good\nmen in a future state, from the testimony of a person\nwho was actually in the possession of it.\n\nSimilitudes and comparisons are another great orna-\nment of this style, and oftenest found here. Nothing both\ncan be finer than the comparison between those two\ngreat orators, Demosthenes and Cicero, made by Quin-\ntilian, when he says, \"Demosthenes and Cicero differ\nin their elocution; one is more close, and the other\nmore copious; the former concludes more concisely,\nand the latter takes a larger compass; the one always\nwith pungency, and the other generally with weight;\none can have nothing taken from him, and the other no-\nthing added to him; the latter has more of art, and the\nformer more of nature. But this must be allowed to\nDemosthenes, that he made Cicero in a great measure\nwhat he was. For as Tully gave himself wholly to an\nimitation of the Greeks, he seems to me to have expres-\nsed the force of Demosthenes, the fluency of Plato, and\nthe pleasantry of Florentius.\" Similitudes, taken from\nnatural things, serve very much to enliven the style,\nPart III.","sp":420,"ep":429},{"h":"PITT","t":"The ancient druids had a most profound veneration for oak trees. Pliny says, that \"the druids (as the Gauls call their magicians or wise men) held nothing so sacred as the mistletoe, and the tree on which it grows, provided it be an oak. They make choice of oak groves in preference to all others, and perform no rites without oak leaves; so that they seem to have the name of druids from thence, if we derive their name from the Greek,\" &c. (See Druids\u2014Definition, and No. 11.) Maximus Tyrius says the Celts or Gauls worshipped Jupiter under the figure of a lofty oak (A).\n\nThis useful tree grows to such a surprising magnitude, that were there not many well authenticated instances of them in our own country, they would certainly appear difficult of belief. In the 18th volume of the Gentleman's Magazine we have the dimensions of a leaf twelve inches in length and seven in breadth, and all the leaves of the same tree were equally large. On the estate of Woodhall, purchased in 1775 by Sir Thomas Rumbold, Bart., late governor of Madras, an oak was felled which fell for \u00a342l. and measured 24 feet round. We are also told of one in Millwood roost, near Chaddelley, which was in full verdure in winter, getting its leaves again after the autumn ones fell off. In Hunter's Evelyn's Sylva, we have an account of a very remarkable oak at Greendale; which Gough, in his edition of Camden, thus minutely describes: \"The Greendale oak, with a road cut through it, still bears one green branch. Such branches as have been cut or broken off are guarded from wet by lead. The diameter of this tree at the top, whence the branches issue, is 14 feet 2 inches; at the surface of the ground 11\u00bd feet; circumference there 35 feet; height of the trunk 53; height of the arch 10, width 6. Mr. Evelyn mentions several more oaks of extraordinary size in Workop park.\"\n\nIn the Gentleman's Magazine for 1773 we have an account of one differing very essentially from the common one; it is frequent about St Thomas in Devonshire, and is in that county called Lucombe oak, from one William Lucombe who successfully cultivated it near Exeter. It grows as straight and handsome as a fir; its leaves are evergreen, and its wood as hard as that of the common oak. Its growth is so quick, as to exceed in 20 or 30 years the altitude and girth of the common one at 100. It is cultivated in various places; Cornwall, Somersetshire, &c.\n\nM. du Hamel du Monceau, of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris (who wrote a treatise on husbandry), gave an account in the year 1749 of an oak which he had kept in water eight years, and which yielded fine leaves every spring. The tree had, he says, four or five branches; the largest 19 or 20 lines round, and more than 18 inches long. It throve more in the two first years than it would have done in the best earth; it afterwards lost its vigour, and rather decayed; which he attributed to a defect in the roots rather than to a want of aliment.\n\n(A) Camden informs us of a tradition (which, like most other traditions of this nature, seems to be founded in ignorance and fostered by credulity) respecting an oak near Malwood castle, where Rufus was killed, viz. that it budded on Christmas day, and withered before night. This tree, the same tradition reports to have been that against which Tyrrel's arrow glanced.\nM. de Buffon made some experiments on oak trees; the result of which is recorded in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1754. He had compared barked with unbarked trees, and proves, we think with success, from a variety of trials, that timber barked and dried standing, is always heavier and considerably stronger than timber kept in its bark.\n\nThe bark of oak trees was formerly thought to be extremely useful in vegetation. One load (Mr Mills in his Treatise on Husbandry informs us) of oak bark, laid in a heap and rotted, after the tanners have used it for dressing of leather, will do more service to stiff cold land, and its effects will last longer, than two loads of the richest dung; but this has been strenuously controverted. (See OAK LEAVES.)\n\nThe bark, in medicine, is also a strong astringent; and hence stands recommended in hemorrhages, alvine fluxes, and other preternatural or immoderate secretions; and in these it is sometimes attended with good effects. Some have alleged, that by the use of this bark every purpose can be answered which may be obtained from Peruvian bark. But after several very fair trials, we have by no means found this to be the case. Besides the bark, the buds, the acorns and their cups are used; as also the galls, which are excrescences caused by insects on the oaks of the eastern countries, of which there are divers sorts; some perfectly round and smooth, some rougher with small protuberances, but all generally having a round hole in them. All the parts of the oak are styptic, binding, and useful in all kinds of fluxes and bleedings, either inward or outward. The bark is frequently used in gargarisms, for the relaxation of the uvula, and for sore mouths and throats: it is also used in refringent catarrhs and injections, against the prolapsus uteri or ani. The acorns, beaten to powder, are frequently taken by the vulgar for pains in the side. The only official preparation is the aqua germinum quercus.\n\nOAK LEAVES. The use of oak bark in tanning, and in hot-beds, is generally known. For the latter of these purposes, however, oak leaves are now found to answer equally well, or rather better. In the notes to Dr Hunter's edition of Evelyn's Treatise on Forest Trees, we find the following directions for their use by W. Speechly: The leaves are to be raked up as soon as possible after they fall from the trees. When raked into heaps, they should immediately be carried into some place near the hot-houses, where they may lie to couch. Mr Speechly says, it was his custom to fence them round with charcoal hurdles, or any thing to keep them from being blown about the garden in windy weather. In this place they tread them well, and water them in case they happen to have been brought in dry. The heap is made six or seven feet thick, and covered over with old mats, or anything else, to prevent the upper leaves from being blown away. In a few days the heap will come to a strong heat. For the first year or two in which he used these leaves, our author did not continue them in the heap longer than ten days or a fortnight: but by this method of management they settled so much when brought to the hot-house, that a supply was very soon required; and he afterwards found, that it was proper to let them remain five or six weeks in the heaps before they are brought to the hot-house. In getting them into the pine pots, if they appear dry, they are to be watered, and again trodden down exceedingly well, in layers, till the pits are quite full. The whole is then covered with tan bark, to the thickness of two inches, and well trodden down, till the surface becomes smooth and even. On this the pine pots are to be placed in the manner they are to stand, beginning with the middle row first, and filling up the spaces between the pots with tan. In this manner we are to proceed to the next row, till the whole be finished; and this operation is performed in the same manner as when tan only is used. The leaves require no farther trouble through the whole season; as they will retain a constant and regular heat for 12 months without stirring or turning; and our author informs us, that if he may judge from their appearance when taken out (being always entire and perfect), it is probable they would continue their heat through a second year; but, as an annual supply of leaves is easily obtained, the experiment is hardly worth making. After this, the pines will have no occasion to be moved but at stated times of their management, viz. at the shifting them in their pots, &c. when at each time a little fresh tan should be added to make up the deficiency arising from the settling of the beds; but this will be inconsiderable, as the leaves do not settle much after their long couching. During the first two years of our author's practice he did not use any tan, but plunged the pine pots into the leaves, and just covered the surface of the beds, when finished, with a little saw-dust, to give it a neatness. This method, however, was attended with one inconvenience; for, by the caking of the leaves they shrunk from the sides of the pots, whereby they became exposed to the air, and at the same time the heat of the beds was permitted to escape.\n\n\"Many powerful reasons (says Mr Speechly) may be given why oak leaves are preferable to tanners bark.\n\n\"1. They always heat regularly; for during the whole time that I have used them, which is near seven years, I never once knew of their heating with violence; and this is so frequently the case with tan, that I affirm, and indeed it is well known to every person conversant in the management of the hot-house, that pines suffer more from this one circumstance, than all the other accidents put together, insects excepted.\u2014When this accident happens near the time of their fruiting, the effect is soon seen in the fruit, which is exceedingly small and ill-shaped. Sometimes there will be little or no fruit at all; therefore gardeners who make use of tan only for their pines, should be most particularly careful to avoid an over-heat at that critical juncture\u2014the time of flowering the fruit.\n\n\"2. The heat of oak leaves is constant; whereas tanner's bark generally turns cold in a very short time after its furious heat is gone off. This obliges the gardener to give it frequent turnings in order to promote its heating. These frequent turnings, not to mention the expense, are attended with the worst consequences; for by the continual moving of the pots backwards and forwards, the pines are exposed to the extremes of heat and cold, whereby their growth is considerably retarded; whereas, when leaves are used, the pines will have no occasion to be moved but at the times of potting, &c. The pines have one peculiar advantage in this undisturbed situation; their roots grow through the bottoms of the pots, and mat among the leaves in...\"\na surprising manner. From the vigour of the plants when in this situation, it is highly probable that the leaves, even in this state, afford them an uncommon and agreeable nourishment.\n\n3. There is a saving in point of expense; which is no inconsiderable object in places where tan cannot be had but from a great distance.\n\n4. The last ground of preference is, that decayed leaves make good manure; whereas rotten tan is experimentally found to be of no value. I have often tried it both on land and clay, and on wet and dry land; and never could discover in any of my experiments, that it deserved the name of a manure; whereas decayed leaves are the richest, and of all others the most proper manure for a garden. Leaves mixed with dung make excellent hot-beds; and I find that beds compounded in this manner, preserve their heat much longer than when made entirely with dung; and in both cases, the application of leaves will be a considerable saving of dung, which is a circumstance on many accounts agreeable.\n\nOAK Leaf Galls. These are of several kinds; the remarkable species called the mugwort gall is never found on any other vegetable substance but these leaves: and beside this there are a great number of other kinds.\n\nThe double gall of these leaves is very singular, because the generality of productions of this kind affect only one side of a leaf or branch, and grow all one way; whereas this kind of gall extends itself both ways, and is seen on each side of the leaf, in form of two protuberances, opposite the one to the other. These are of differently irregular shapes, but their natural figure seems that of two cones, with broad bases, and very obtuse points, though sometimes they are round, or very nearly so.\n\nThese make their first appearance on the leaf in April, and remain on it till June or longer. They are at first green, but afterwards yellowish, and are softer to the touch than many other of the productions of this kind: they are usually about the size of a large pea, but sometimes they grow to the bigness of a nut. When opened, they are found to be of that kind which are inhabited each by one insect only, and each contains one cavity. The cavity in this is, however, larger than in any other gall of the size, or even in many others of three times the size; the sides of it being very little thicker than the substance of the leaf.\n\nIt is not easy to ascertain the origin of the several species of flies which are at times seen in this manner to come out of the same species of galls. It seems the common course of nature, that only one species of insect forms one kind of gall; yet it may be, that two or three kinds may give origin to the same kind: and this is the effect of the enemies of the proper inhabitants.\n\nIt might appear that the parent fly, when she had formed a gall for the habitation of her worm offspring, had placed it in an impregnable fortress; but this is not the case; for it frequently happens, that a fly, as small perhaps as that which gave origin to the gall, produces a worm which is of the carnivorous kind, as the other feeds on vegetable juices. This little fly, well knowing that where there is one of these protuberances on a leaf, there is a tender and defenceless insect within, pierces the sides of the gall, and deposits her egg within it. This, when it hatches into a worm, feeds upon the proper inhabitant; and finally, after devouring it, passes into the chrysalis state, and thence appears in the form of its parent fly, and is seen making its way out of the gall, in the place of the proper inhabitant.\n\nOn opening these leaf-galls, which are properly the habitation only of one animal, it is common to find two, the stronger preying upon the body of the other, and sucking its juices as it does those of the leaf; often it is found wholly employed in devouring its offending neighbour at once: this is probably the case when its time of eating is nearly over; and, in fine, when we find the gall inhabited by only one insect, or containing only one chrysalis, as it ought in its natural state to do, we are never certain that this is the proper inhabitant, as it may be one of these destroyers who has eaten up the other, and supplied its place.\n\nSee APHIS, Entomology Index.\n\nOAK Saw-dust is now found to answer the purposes of tanning, as well, at least, as the bark.
